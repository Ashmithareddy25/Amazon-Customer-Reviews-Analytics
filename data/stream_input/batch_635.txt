B00005J6UP|5.0|Adventure, Pirates, Treasure, Heroics...and children?<br /><br />It's easy to see why this film has become a \\"Cult Classic\\" amongst Gen X-ers and Y-ers: it's entertaining on many levels.  While it still feels distinctly like an 80's film, it definitely has withstood the test of time.  A group of children are placed in a situation whereby they encounter a variety of \\"grown-up\\" experiences and have to adapt.  Humorous and awkward situations unfold, and the story stays compelling throughout.  I still enjoy this film as much as I did when I was a kid, and have gone out of my way to see it at midnight showings downtown, etc.  The commentary and other features are nice bonuses, and make the DVD all the more worthy of adding to your collection.<br /><br />The bottom line: This is a great adventure film that will please kids and adults alike!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This is such an amazing concert DVD and it is without a doubt one of the best DVDs I own.  The sound and camera work on this DVD is so spectacular.  Clapton, Bruce, and Baker definitely proved that they still had the magic when playing those songs together on stage.  Clapton's playing here is definitely among his best especially since there is no keyboardist or additional guitarist.  He can only look to Jack and Ginger for inspiration.  Jack and Ginger are in excellent form too on bass and drums respectively.  How is it possible that those two weren't able to have the success that Eric has as a solo artist.  It's fantastic that the three of them were able to reconcile their differences since they were never the best of friends (Jack and Ginger especially).  Every performance here is a winner but I think the standouts are \\"Sunshine Of Your Love,\\" \\"Spoonful,\\" \\"Sleepy Time Time,\\" \\"White Room,\\" \\"Politician,\\" \\"Badge,\\" \\"NSU,\\" \\"Born Under A Bad Sign,\\" \\"We're Going Wrong,\\" and I could keep going on.  All three musicians are on fire throughout the whole concert and the camera appropriately shows plenty close ups of all three of them playing.  I already said this but Clapton's guitar playing here is so incredible and it will blow you away when you see and hear him jam with Bruce and Baker.  The audio is great, the video is great, excellent camera angles, spectacular performances, extraordinary concert DVD.  The specials features are great too with the interviews and some alternate performances.  If you are a Cream fan or a Clapton fan, you definitely need to purchase this DVD.  If you don't like Clapton or Cream at all, this DVD could change your mind.  It's that good.  Once you start watching it, you won't want to ever take it out of the DVD player.
B0007G89G4|5.0|This movie is right up there with \\"The Sandlot.\\"  As a 20somethingyear old young man, I fondly recall my childhood fascination with creative insults, lewd jokes, and just the innocence of being a young boy and yet experiencing very \\"grown-up\\" things.  This film rekindles those memories for me, through the recounting of an experience that seems so similar to the kinds of things I did as a boy.  Also, if you've had siblings and experienced favoritism (haven't we all?), both as the favorite trying to redistribute the love and affection to your siblings, or as the \\"other\\" child, always feeling inadequate and/or jealous, this film will tug at your heartstrings.<br /><br />There isn't much else to say that hasn't already been said, but if you enjoy gilded nostalgia about childhood, especially boyhood, you can probably relate to this film, and will get swept away!<br /><br />Two personal bonuses: John Cusack's cameo as Gordie's deceased football star brother.  Kiefer Sutherland's star performance as a teen hoodlum/villain.
B000JJSM4S|5.0|It's evident this is George and son Giles Martin's Mona Lisa.  The remaining Beatles and family have given the Martins an empty canvas and a paintbrush loaded with the grandest colors the world has ever seen.  All that's needed is to stroke the canvas as they see fit.  And that they did.  George Martin has always been the fifth Beatle in my world...and the one person close enough to all four to know exactly how to put the music together.  I was mezmerized by the structure of the entire CD.  The new-birth of the songs we have heard so many times in their original formats are now connected with other songs to deliver an entirely different view of the Beatles music...in some cases better this time around than the original version.  I can't seem to find anything that seems out of place with the arrangement of this CD.  George Martin and son Giles have painted their masterpiece and it holds true in my head that this is more an art form somewhat like Sgt. Peppers than just another Beatles release.  A must have for all Beatles fans and a future classic in the Beatles never ending catalog.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Some of the reviews written here, including Amazon.com's editorial review hammer home how important this movie is: the poignant emotions it evokes in viewers, but in terms of how powerful using time in a film to create a real sense of experience can be.  This movie is also the movie that really put Morgan Freeman on the map; he lost Best Actor in a Leading Role by a hair to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump, but ever since has been a household name.  Since most great things have been said already, I will say this:<br /><br />The reason to buy this DVD set is because unlike older versions, this contains the remastered 5.1 mixing, documentaries about the film making, and the director's commentary.  These features were lacking in the first release of the DVD, so if you never bought it or own the first release, it's time to upgrade!  If this movie is nostalgic for you, you'll enjoy seeing the stars reminisce about filming the movie, and what it meant to each of them.  I think this really solidifies the intense emotions this movie produces in viewers, and it definitely adds value to the film.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Maybe I just expect original songs.  He has a great voice, but the only reason I bought the album was because my girlfriend absolutely loves this album.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Big budget, cookie-cutter formulaic films with \\"all-star\\" actors and extensive special effects are a dime a dozen these days.  It's no wonder people have become desensitized to films with all the money-whoring spineless sequels that assail them.<br /><br />This movie has none of the above.  Some great B actors and comedians collaborated to make this story of \\"real life\\" so amusingly close to home for many people with different family histories.  In a world obsessed with reality tv, this film appeals to many different audiences beyond those who appreciate the sense of \\"realness\\" that those shows afford.  This film reaches those with visions of success and perfection, to the folks who have a crazy relative, or anyone who's ever been disgusted with the world of beauty and pageants.  There's something to be gained in this film for everyone.<br /><br />That is to say that despite a few \\"contrived\\" moments during the course of the film, the team of directors, actors, producers and staff are able to share a convincing picture of what it means to be a family experiencing all manner of adversity, and how they cope.  The movie itself deserves four stars, I feel, mainly because it's not one of those movies you'll find yourself wanting to watch over and over again, but the alternate endings and commentary add more flavor and insight into the creative process that went on, and definitely bump up that last star to make this a must-buy purchase for anyone who enjoys family \\"dramedies\\".
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Tom Hanks dominates this lively, warm, and sweet animated feature, based on the 1985 Caldecott Medal winning book of the same name by Chris  Van Allsburg.    We travel to a home in a snow-filled suburb of Michigan one Christmas Eve, where a young boy on the verge of adolescence lies in bed, hoping to hear the sound of Santa's sleigh bells. His parents (voiced by Tom Hanks and Leslie Zemeckis) check on him and his sister, Sarah (Leslie Zemeckis/Ashly Holloway). But as logic, reasoning, and concrete proof are becoming more essential to the young lad, he has reason to doubt that he will hear the bells; his World Book Encyclopedias tell him the North Pole is a barren wasteland where life cannot be sustained, therefore, no place for Santa to have a toy facory. He has a newspaper story about striking department store Santas, and a copy of Norman Rockwell's painting, \\"The Discovery\\", featuring a child discovering his father's Santa Claus suit.    Soon enough, there is a mysterious rumbling outside his house. Clad only in his pajamas, robe, and slippers, our Hero Boy wanders out into the snow to investigate. In so doing, he is confronted by an enormous train called The Polar Express, and a conductor urging him to get on.    Reluctantly, he does so, and as a smiling snowman waves in the distance, he is off.    He encounters a group of children in one of the cars, clad only in nightclothes like himself despite the cold. Another little boy(voiced by Peter Scolari) is hesitant to get on, and almost misses the train. Once aboard, he remains by himself in a dark box car.   The Hero Boy becomes better acquainted with his fellow passengers. The most prominent of these are the Know-It-All (voiced by the Eternal Nerd, Eddie Deezen, who is very much in his element), and  the Hero Girl (Nona Gaye), the latter of whom expresses a motherly concern for the Lonely Boy, whose name we learn is Billy.    The children are entertained by the waiters who treat them to an amusing performance while serving hot chocolate.   During the heart of the journey, the children engage in various acts of kindness and civility towards each other, and the Lonely Boy is made to feel more and more included. At one point, a train ticket goes astray and has an interesting journey of its own.   The conductor, Hero Boy and Hero Girl deal with goofy engineers (voiced by the late Michael Jeter, to whom the film is lovingly dedicated), and a dangerous jaunt down an exteremely steep slope.    The Hero Boy has periodic encounters with  a mysterious Hobo(also voiced by Hanks) who confronts him about his lack of faith in Santa, but does help him save a life.   The conductor comes up with an unorthodox way of getting a herd of caribou blocking the train out of the way, and the Hero Boy and Hero Girl view a car filled with damaged toys and are exposed to the concept of recycling.    In the meantime, the Lonely Boy watches the night and begins to sing a wistful carol which becomes more hopeful-sounding when the Hero Girl joins in. Soon, the four main characters are treated to a viewing of the Northern Lights as they approach their destination.   The Christmas City is lively and full of light. The children are surrounded by a multitude of elves, and the three children on whom the story focuses break away from the others after disembarking.   Amid an array of Christmas carols from the 1940s and '50s (in marvelous counterpoint to Alan Silvestri's glorious score), the three observe the inner workings of Santa's toy factory, watching the elves as they monitor the behavior of children all over the world.    Traveling in a tube-like vehicle, as they saw the elves do, they find their way to a conveyer belt where Billy finds a gift with his name and address. But soon the children and  the gift are dumped into the bag on Santa's sleigh. The Know-It-All is found among the packages as well.    To the strains of \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\", sung by a young Frank Sinatra, Santa Claus appears, and the crowd of elves and children go wild with delight.    From his position in the crowd, the Hero Boy cannot see Santa. A bell  falls off of the sleigh's reindeer harness and the Hero Boy picks it up, listening for the jingle and trying to believe with all his might. Of all the children in attendance, Santa selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas before taking off to deliver the gifts.   Watch for a fun cameo by Steve Tyler as an Elf Lieutenant and Elf Singer!   Soon, the children are homeward bound, and the conductor punches a special message of either praise or suggestions for improvement into each of their tickets.    The Hero Boy discovers the harness bell missing, and he is as disappointed about that as Billy was about relinquishing his gift to an elf.     But the magic that both felt had slipped away, is indeed reclaimed on Christmas Day--a theme touched upon the the film's beautiful closing anthem, warmly and soronously sung by Josh Grobin.    While the story focuses on the magic and myths of Christmastime, the Hero Boy and his family are presumably going to attend a church service that day. We learn that as he gets older, the Hero Boy gradually becomes the only one who can hear the sleigh bell.   I wish those on Amazon a fond Christmas 2006, and may we always enjoy the sweetness of the sleigh bells!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great series (Firefly). Great movie.  You can't help but wanting more.  By far my favorite sci fi story, period.
0739307886|5.0|Pompeii, 79 A.D. has always fascinated, but who were the people now silently preserved forever?  What must their lives been like?  Many people fled and lived, there was time.  But some did not, why?  What are their stories?  They held loved ones close in their last heart wrenching moments. The reader cannot help but put one's self in their place and wonder, 'how would I have faced my death?'<br /><br />The massive aquaduct is failing and several towns are going dry. In this believeable fiction we are introduced to a few people whose lives and schemes depend on that aquaduct.  The reader is swept into Pompeii as we follow a young engineer or an aquarius as he is called. His job is to repair the aquaduct, FAST. He soon discovers to his horror that Vesuvius is the cause of the failure, but so much worse than that, the volcano's eruption is imminent.<br /><br />Not just the volcano threatens. Pompeii is nearly owned by a greedy former slave now powerful politician whose scheme of greater wealth depends on the water supply; and this aquarius with his high principles must never be allowed to report to Rome. Firestorms threaten on all sides, and time is running out.<br /><br />Michael Cumpsty's voice easily adapts to the many characters he portrays. The story flows so smoothly that all too soon the last chapter is read. Thoroughly enjoyable, anyone interested in this cataclysm will want to read it again and again.
B00079HZUM|5.0|Comparisons between Stage Beauty and Shakespeare in Love are inevitablle. Though Stage Beauty is set about a generation after Shakespeare, both are love stories that deal with the conceit of a man playing a a woman onstage. However, Shakespeare In Love's high profile overshadowed Stage Beauty and more's the pity because Stage Beauty is the better film.     Ned Kynistan (Billy Crudup) has made his career playing women's roles and is considered by meany to be the most beautiful woman on the London stage. offstage however, Ned is deeply confused about his sexuality having been taught and trained from childhood to surpress anything masculine in him. His dressing girl Maria (Claire Danes) watches him from the wings each night mouthing his lines and stealing off to a pub where she illegally performs female roles to crowds interested in the novelty. When the king (Rupert Everett) proclaims that women's roles are to be played by women Ned is suddenly out of a job and Maria takes his place as the toast of the theater world.     All Ned knows is how to mimic a woman. All Maria knows of acting she learned from Ned. Therefore we see her mimic his exaggerated gestures- but coming from a woman they seem false and artificial. Maria comes to fear that she is not an actress but a novelty. Meanwhile Ned is unable to play men, having worked his whole life at being feminine. It takes a few intervening parties including the king and his mistress Nell Gwynn to show Ned and Maria that they are the ones to help each other. We see Ned and Maria stumble into a romance born on the ground of initial fondness and combined with jealousy and resentment. When they perform the death scene from Othello, all of these come into play with the actors as well as the chatacters they play. When Ned attacks Maria for attempting to do something that he'd spent his whole life training to do, she freely admits that she had no teacher but she had less need of practice- she is able to understand what it is to bea woman based on experience, not soley on observation: something that will be her greatest asset as an actress. She also asserts that Ned's formal training left him trapped in a man's body that he has no idea how to inhabit. Every word is true and Ned must struggle to form an identity regardless of whether it is masculine or feminine. He needs to learn to be a person separate from the roles he plays.     All of the performances are good but Crudup and Danes stand out in their roles. Crudup is given a difficult task: to portray a man, raised as a woman and then rejected as one. He's left as a man, which he doesn't know how to be. His walk is affected with a swing in his hips, his voice approaches a falsetto even when he's not in character. Danes has proven herself to be a highly skilled and innately gifted actors many times. She proved adept at Shakespeare's language in Romeo + Juliet, so it's all the more amusing to watch Maria stumble through Shakespeare's lines and put on artificial airs. At the same time she's legitimately in pain; acting is her passion but she struggles with the knowledge that she's terrible at it.  Both Danes and Crudup have to play actors- in other words they must play Ned and Maria playing Othello and Desemona. It's a rough thing to do but they pull it off on all levels.     Based on a stage play the dialogue is witty, and Richard Eyre's direction is more than able. The costumes and the scenery are lovely, but unlike in many period films they are not the show. That belongs to the actors, the dialogue and the story.
B000GPIPVU|3.0|The problem is, the moments are few and far between.  The best song on this album, by far, is Gone Away From Me and you don't get to it until track 7.  Absolutely worth it once you get there though.  \\"Be Here Now\\" drags on a little too long without changing.  \\"Empty\\" gave me some hope as it had such a promising sound, but it too didn't hold my interest throughout.  I admit, Gone Away From Me doesn't do that much changing throughout it's air time, but the lyrics kept me hooked in... the other songs, not so much.  The last song, \\"Within You\\" is another good song but it fails to rescue the album as a whole.<br /><br />I think it's important to read reviews that disagree with your own opinions, so think about it.
0385338082|1.0|Okay, this is all my fault.  The \\"Shopaholic\\" book (only read the first) was appallingly bad, so what on earth made me think this would be any better? <br /> <br />First of all, the main character is an idiot.  Please.  Gets on a plane, gets nervous and tells some total stranger her ENTIRE life story?  And he just sits there and listens?  AND remembers every single detail? <br /> <br />Secondly, how old is this guy? <br /> <br />Third. They have two aborted \\"dates\\" and she jumps right into bed with him?  And he expects her to?  I mean, they had, up to that point ONLY KISSED ONCE! <br /> <br />And HIS secret?  Laughable.  Completely laughable. <br /> <br />The only use I can find for this book is as a coaster. <br /> <br />I honestly don't understand how these awful books keep getting published!
078322933X|1.0|in this movie, she acted so dumb, and her father was really getting on my nerves. Alyssa Milano really took the cake, playing the friend who sleeps with her friends man. The ending was the worst part of this movie, I found myself being able to predict what was going to happen (she only gave him the alarm code when he snuck in to sleep with her)....the only person who had any sense in this movie was the little brother....
B000075BFK|5.0|Even though I felt like Until The End Of Time was his best posthumous album Im still feeling this one though. Standout tracks on disc1: STILL BALLIN, WHEN WE RIDE ON OUR ENEMIES, CHANGED MAN, NEVER B PEACE, MAMA'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL, STREET FAME, LATE NIGHT, GHETTO STAR, THUGZ MANSION(Nas version) etc. Filler on disc 1: none. Standout tracks on disc 2:THUGZ MANSION, BETTER DAYZ, U CAN CALL, MILITARY MINDS, FAME, CATCHING FEELINGS, THERE U GO(humorous), THIS LIFE I LEAD, WHO DO YOU BELIEVE IN and THEY DONT GIVE A F*** ABOUT US. Filler on disc2: Fair Exchange remix. Bottom Line: this is the last good album that they put out of Tupac's before his memory and his music got destroyed by the likes of Suge Knight and Eminem. There are some solid gems on here like Mama's Just A Little Girl, They Dont Give A F*** About Us, Never B Peace, Thugz Mansion etc that you are not going to hear from the assortment of clones, floozies, and morons we have in the game right now. Its a highlight album that was Way better than a lot of those other albums that came out that year.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Granted this movie is not the most exciting movie ever made, however it will hold your interest for the full 95 minutes. This is a documentary about a slide show on Global Warming that Al Gore has given all over the world. The movie itself consists of different sections of the slide show with Gore presenting to an audience, intercut with different shots narrated by Gore.<br /><br />The information displayed here is very clear. Gore doesn't try to rush through anything or generalize as he's presenting. This movie is simply a wake up call to everyone in America, and even the world, letting us know what we've been doing to the planet over the last 50 years, and what we're continuing to do. Some of the information is shocking.<br /><br />The most shocking to me was when Gore showed two statistics. One was the number of stories in science magazines that disagree with the idea of global warming. Out of around 1000: ZERO disagreed. Then, out of around 600 mainstream media stories on the same topic: 53% expressed doubt that global warming was real. That should give anyone watching a wake up call to what our media is really used for.<br /><br />Everything Gore presents in this movie is precise and thought out. If there's any counter-argument to any of this information I would love to hear it.<br /><br />And at the end Gore actually offers solutions for us. He doesn't just complain and point out what we're doing wrong. He shows how we have the technology to fix this, and explains that we have to do it one person, one family, one town at a time. I didn't know much about Al Gore before this movie, but I respect him a great deal now for what he's doing with this movie.
B000K3HTRY|4.0|Great acting.  Don't the let the simple title fool you.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|You know, it's awkward. Rarely have I discovered work from an artist that makes me go back to their predecessors and then it seems like the previous work either seemed inferior or like they weren't trying enough. It's awkward, but that's how it's working for me with B.R.M.C. The first two albums I like but don't love now, even though they both came out in my indie-happy days. This album has a certain depth to it that makes it so amazing and legitimate. The songs are catchy like the last time, but they feel less empty this time around. This sound actually works for them better than the previous sound. All 13 songs are wonderful. I heard \\"Ain't No Easy Way\\" on the radio and loved it. I did not know that I was going to hear an album where 12 songs were even better. There is a certain variety, some of it bluesy, some of it rockin', all of it just plain ol' good. \\"Howl\\" and \\"Devil's Waiting\\" are probably the tracks that I like the most, but gosh, I didn't even realize before the last time I listened to this how much I enjoy it. Highly recommended. Production and songs are both great. Hmmm, I see the site lists it as an Enhanced CD album, but that's not the format mine's in. Although as far as I know, it is one of those copy protection things. Oh well, blame that on RCA and leave it to the band for these songs.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Contrary to previous reviews (and the latest ridiculous error-filled Rolling Stone Album Guide), this disc does NOT contain the full version of the song \\"Echoes\\", though they made a respectable edit.  This disc also doesn't include \\"Brain Damage/Eclipse\\" which still gets a lot of airplay (and is on Dark Side Of The Moon).  It does include for the first time on CD, a version of \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\", though it's not the same version as in the film (which used two parts and are combined here), nor is it the superior version released as a single in the '80s.  (Apparently this same version as on \\"Echoes\\" has now been added to remastered CD of The Final Cut, though I don't have the remaster.)   <br /> <br />Of course, since Pink Floyd are a progressive rock band (as most people will agree, despite another previous reviewer who is using a very limited definition), you should really get the full albums rather than a compilation.  But this is about the best they could do in trimming down Floyd's career to two discs.
B000AGTPUU|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of this movie - let's get that out of the way up front. I think the book was original and charming and the movie was simply over the top, a techno orgasm. Furthermore, I don't care for this type of animation. Why would animation want to try to look deceivingly real? I don't get it. I enjoy animation that revels in its absurdity rather than trying to fool the audience or make them gasp with amazement at how realistic it looks. Lastly, call me old fashioned, but I'm a fan of the tv specials of the 60s that celebrated Christmas, and they are the measurement of joyful holiday viewing I hold all other movies, specials, etc. up against.<br />Imagine how surprised I was when I showed this in my kindergarten class today and the children were mesmerized! You must understand (those of you who work with youngsters can attest), having two dozen kids sit quietly for over ninety minutes is nothing short of miraculous. No matter how popular or entertaining the choice is, there are always a handful who get squirrely and start chatting or bothering their classmates, and soon the viewing devolves into a battle to keep the room quiet for those who want to continue watching. And yet, today the room was quiet and engaged!<br />It struck me that perhaps this was a new tradition that had been born. This movie, despite my misgivings, has managed to perform the kind of seasonal magic that so many films strive for and so many never achieve. The children were getting the message, thrilled with the wild ride, and, sorry for the heavy handed cliche, but BELIEVING! Amazing. They may never know the Rankin-Bass delight of cheesy stop-action puppetry, the hilarious dance scenes of the Peanuts gang, or the sinister glory of Chuck Jones' Grinch, but damn if they haven't found their own Christmas classic to revel in for those years they chose to believe. One day they may try to foist this on their children and come away with the same sadness and disillusion that I had when my kids (mine and the school children) yawn during Rudolph, but hopefully they'll learn the same lesson I did. Merry Christmas!nd the school children) yawn during Rudolph, but hopefully they'll learn the same lesson I did. Merry Christmas!
B000J10EQU|4.0|Well, Brandon Routh may not be Christopher Reeve (he kinda looks like Reeve though) but this movie is still pretty darn good. I've seen it twice so far, it's very intense and visually stunning. The plot is pretty standard and predictable, but who cares? The score, especially the Superman Theme, are excellent and blend well into the action. My big complaint with this movie is Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He got the odd humor down ok, but just didn't do it for me in regards to being evil enough. Also, they did away with \\"truth, justice, and the American way\\". Gotta be politically correct. The special effects were pretty good too, especially Metropolis itself. I really liked the combination of modern New York City with a 1950's kind of motif. Superman fans will do well to watch this movie, just don't expect something of Reevian proportions. The next one will be even better, wait and see. Just as long as they recast Lex's role!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This is a good movie, but not the funniest of the year by far, nor of all time. This movie really starts off slow, and after a while things wind up falling into place, then the real laughter starts.  By the end, it ends up being a really funny movie.  This is a good movie to rent, but I would not spend the extra to buy this.  This has good dark humor, greg kinnear's and steve correll are both funny, and this is a great showing of a dysfunctional family, and a worst case scenario of whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.  worth a watch.
0743289412|3.0|Stephen King, Lisey's Story (Scribner, 2006)<br /><br />For a man who was supposedly retiring after completing the Dark Tower series, Stephen King has been remarkably prolific in his golden years. Lisey's Story is, after all, his second novel in the space of six months; the last time that happened was in 1992.<br /><br />Lisey Landon's husband Scott, a popular and much-lauded novelist, died two years before the novel opens. The problem is that, as with all such deaths, it doesn't seem to have really happened for some of the more, shall we say, rabid fans. One in particular, who's been after Scott's papers, put a few words in the ears of the wrong guy, someone who's willing to break some rules to get those papers.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Lisey's sister Amanda, who has always had a history of mental problems, goes into a catatonic state and has to be committed. The convergence of these two things leads Lisey to some surprising revelations about Scott's powers of foresight, and leads her to some memories she has repressed for decades, memories she'll need in order to solve both her problems.<br /><br />First, the good news: this is a Stephen King novel. It is written in such a way that its half-a-thousand-plus pages roll by like miles of steel under the wheels of a train. King has lost none of his readability during his short-lived retirement.<br /><br />The bad news: this is a Stephen King novel. King has had a long and memorable history with the coining of neologisms, and oftentimes they help a book stand out, keep it in memory long after you've closed the back cover. That is the case here, but for all the wrong reasons; if I ever see the words \\"smuck,\\" \\"smucking,\\" or \\"smucked\\" again, I'm going to belt the person who says them. With an anvil. Worse, King seems to have dropped any sort of restraint with said neologism, overusing it horribly in the first half of the book. He throttles back in the latter half, but that only has the added ill effect of every use of it standing out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />It's certainly not a bad little book, and if you're an established King fan who wasn't completely turned off by his efforts at less horrific material (the whole time I was reading it I wanted to make comparisons to Dolores Claiborne and Gerald's Game, but ended up not finding any way to do so), you're going to at least find it readable. I found it a touch fantastic. Not because of the actual fantasy content, but the whole \\"dead main character is a National Book Award/Pulitzer winner\\" thing-- what's the male equivalent of a Mary Sue? ** ½ffect of every use of it standing out like a sore thumb. <br /> <br />It's certainly not a bad little book, and if you're an established King fan who wasn't completely turned off by his efforts at less horrific material (the whole time I was reading it I wanted to make comparisons to Dolores Claiborne and Gerald's Game, but ended up not finding any way to do so), you're going to at least find it readable.

078681859X|5.0|What a delightful read this was. Having recently turned to \\"children's\\" fantasy out of sheer frustration (adult fantasy has gotten SO fomulaic for the most part. There are still a few good authors but they take a lot of hard work to find), I was first introduced to the Harry Potter series. Although I find that author be a rather good storyteller, it took her until the 5th book (The Half-Blood Prince) to really win me over as a writer. \\"Bartimaeus\\" was a recommendation, along with a few other children's fantasy-based literature, and I couldn't be more pleased. Of course it doesn't deal with some of the heavier sexual references and overtones found in such adult series as George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series (a strong series), or Steven Erikson's \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" (an amazing and highly complex series), I was surprised at how enthralled I quickly became over the course of the first 200 pages. After that, the author had me at every twist and turn. I can safely say that this is due in no small part to the character of Bartimaeus himself. Wonderfully wicked, observant, intelligent, and often commenting on either the current situation, defining a magical beast or artifact, or just interjecting a side-note of humor through the liberal use of footnotes, this character is wholly unique in my experience as a reader of fantasy.  <br /> <br />I do have one quibble but this has absolutely nothing to do with the book. I've seen mentioned a few places that this book was optioned to be made into a film. This is a huge mistake. Without the narrative voice of Bartimaeus and all of his musings on life the film will be a shallow attempt to cash in on the Harry Potter film craze. If they are brave enough to include this element, no matter what they do, the character will come off as some copy of \\"Jack\\" in \\"Fight Club\\", and although narration is at the heart of that visual story, Bartimaeus will suffer for it. A word to the film studio; let this book remain what it is and in its current and best form... as a wonderfully written and captivating book.
B00005JPCD|1.0|Happy Feet (George Miller, 2006)<br /><br />George Miller gave us Mad Max. Then he grew up and turned his talent to serious filmmaking, and he gave us Lorenzo's Oil. You'd not be stretching much by tagging either with the word \\"classic.\\" Then he disappeared for a while. He resurfaced and wrote two of the best kids' films of the past decade in Babe and its sequel, Pig in the City. Then, once again, he disappeared from sight. Is it wrong to have assumed, given George Miller's track record, that he would once again emerge with something sterling?<br /><br />Instead, we got Happy Feet, a confused mess of a movie that joins the junk heap of worthless 2006 kids' movies, the largest pile of them in recent memory. Even Pixar couldn't come up with something that rose above mediocre in 2006. George Miller should have been a savior. Instead, we got Happy Feet.<br /><br />For its first fifteen minutes, this movie wants to be a subject-less musical with well-rendered, but age-inappropriate and badly-covered, pop tunes. This is not necessarily a horrible thing; any parent who spends an hour listening to Satan's mouthpiece on Earth, Radio Disney, will be greatly surprised at the number of songs s/he recognizes (and despairs at how awfully they've been rendered by the current generation of child TV stars). I was prepared for bad child-star renderings of previously popular songs. As a result, the first fifteen minutes of the movie were its most enjoyable. Had it stayed on that track, it would have worked.<br /><br />Then, however, it became a coming-of-age tale with assorted bad musical numbers. Mumble (Elijah Wood) is a penguin who can't sing. (Whether any of the others can is open to debate, but you have to accept it for the premise. Note that, ironically, the only professional singer in the cast who plays an Emperor penguin plays Mumble as a baby.) He expresses his musical gift in another way-- he can dance. Noah (Hugo Weaving), the tribe elder, is convinced that Mumble, being different, is evil, and should be cast out of the tribe. But he doesn't need to be cast out; the other penguins do a fine job of marginalizing him. (Don't worry, this is the subtle message in the movie.) Mumble wanders off on his own and finds another tribe of penguins. Ramon, his first contact with the tribe, and Lovelace, their spiritual leader, are both voiced by Robin Williams. (That nothing has yet been said about Robin Williams' awful hispanic accent and the stereotyping of the \\"lazy Mexican\\" in this penguin tribe is somewhat confounding.) After some clashes with Noah and the setup of a love-story subplot with Mumble's childhood friend Gloria (Brittany Murphy), we get into the third direction this movie wants to pull us, which anyone who's seen any kids' movie since FernGully should be all too familiar with: the idea that every time a human being sets foot outside his environmentally-destructive door, he will cause further irreparable harm to the environment, leading to the imminent destruction of the entire planet unless we DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.<br /><br />Frankly, it's not just getting old, it was already old when FernGully came out. Worse, it's the most obvious, braindead form of inculcation possible, and we allow our children to wallow in it without us ever questioning it. It's gotten to the point where \\"oh, boy, another kids' movie!\\" equates with \\"oh, boy, another vicious attack on humanity's inability to live in harmony with the environment!\\" It's pathetic and disgusting. Even if Happy Feet had been an otherwise brilliant movie, the braindead pandering in the final third of its length would have knocked a couple of stars off its rating. But it's not an otherwise brilliant movie. It's a confused, needlessly complex mess that could have been a pretty decent-- at best-- musical. Instead, it's one of the worst films I have personally experienced in 2006, and I attribute this only to the fact that I was successfully able to avoid seeing both Madea's Family Reunion and the Larry the Cable Guy movie. *Family Reunion and the Larry the Cable Guy movie. *

1896597890|4.0|Guy Delisle, Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea (Drawn and Quarterly, 2003)<br /><br />Cartoonist Guy Delisle is on a work visa to North Korea to supervise production of a children's show. While there, he takes a lot of notes and makes a lot of drawings about what life is like in this notoriously reclusive country, and then shares them with us. It's fascinating.<br /><br />Like Steve Mumford's Baghdad Journal, Pyongyang is important because it gives us an entirely different take on a culture that American society is currently somewhat obsessed with, but knows almost nothing about. As far as most Americans know, North Korea is a massive nuclear launch pad with Kim Jong-Il at its center, surrounded by red buttons. Unlike Baghdad Journal, however, the portrait Delisle paints of Pyongyang is almost completely devoid of warmth; it seems popular opinion is closer to the mark on Pyongyang than it is on Tikrit.<br /><br />Delisle keeps it amusing, but the sense the reader is most likely to get is of an almost obsessive claustrophobia, both from the outsiders who are working for the animation company and whisked around to various tourist sites by their handlers, and occasionally from the natives themselves. It's a scary feeling, and it is quite adequately conveyed by Delisle's pop-art style of depicting mass production.<br /><br />Quite a good little book, this, and worth checking out. *** ½
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I certainly understand everyone's anger over the \\"double dipping\\" going on throughout the DVD industry.  I also understand that George Lucas is one of the biggest culprits in this area (dating back to the video tape releases of his properties.)  I predicted this release because, if nothing else, Lucas is a shrewd businessman.  After guaranteeing sales of the Special Editions (by declaring that they would be the only versions of the saga ever released), he then released the original version so that the purists would wind up owning both incarnations.  The move may have been artistic: the Special Editions do flow better with the prequels.  It may have been about the money- there was a lot to be made there.  It may be that he really never wanted to release the originals but felt pressure from the fan base.  I'm not here to attack him or defend him regarding this issue.  The point, metaphorically, is:  if I want to play, I have to face the fact that George Lucas owns the playground.      I was eight-years-old when Star Wars was released in 1977.  I couldn't wait to see that film.  Unfortunately, I had to...my parents refused to take me because they were not interested.  I finally wore them down by the summer of 1978 when they begrudgingly took me to a Drive-In to see it.  By then it had the \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\" tacked on and, even though I loved it, I felt I missed out.  In viewing the film for the first time in it's pure form, I realized how good it really was.  I'm not going to go in to all the fan boy rhetoric that permeates most reviews.  I'm simply going to state that the original Star Wars, like it or hate it, is a piece of cinema history.  It changed the way Science Fiction movies and, for that matter, movies in general, were perceived.  It's raw and rough around the edges and that is part of its charm. I am constantly amazed by CGI and what can be portrayed on film.  I am amazed but not engrossed or moved.  I prefer the film in this raw form with none of theupgrades that are available to DVD releases- after all I wanted to see the movie that I missed in the theater! This film and its two sequels (in their original form) are what escapism and imagination are all about.  It's hard to believe but there was a time (not too long ago) when heroes weren't \\"anti-heroes\\" and hope wasn't considered naïve.   Good films have something to say about the human condition and this film is no exception.  Unfortunately, since its original release people have forgotten that it is a film about life and not a way of life.   If you understand what I'm trying to say, you've probably already purchased this DVD.  If not, I suggest you give it a try- but do so with the mind-set of a wide-eyed eight-year-old.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|Nuevo Cinema Paradiso (Giuseppe Tornatore, 1988)<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Giuseppe Tornatore's movies and have been for years. I have wondered for a while now what it is that's kept me from seeing Tornatore's (arguably) most famous film on this side of the pond, Cinema Paradiso. And, not coming up with a good excuse, I finally rented it, blocked out three hours, and sat down to watch it. Self-imposed or not, it was worth every second of the wait.<br /><br />Tornatore gives us a fairy tale centering on Salvatore (played as an adult by Jacques Perrin, most recently in L'Enfer), whose love of movies at an early age led him to become the projectionist at Cinema Paradiso, his small town's movie house, as an adolescent, under the tutelage of cantankerous but lovable Alfredo (the late Philippe Noiret, whose last role was in the upcoming 3 Amis). Meanwhile, as the theater is in slow decline, Salvatore (played as an adolescent by Maradona's Marco Leonardi) meets Elena (played as an adolescent by Agnese Nano, recently of Killers on Holiday), and love blossoms. The nostalgia of the bulk of the film is framed by a story in the present: we open with Salvatore's mother calling to tell him Alfredo is dead. Salvatore goes back for the funeral, which coincides with the week when the Cinema Paradiso is being torn down. While in town, he sees someone he mistakes for Elena, whom he hasn't seen in many years, but soon finds that she's still in town, and all the old feelings come rushing back.<br /><br />As with all of Tornatore's films, Cinema Paradiso is a feast for the senses, with the story taking a backseat to the subjective elements of its telling-- Tornatore wants you to feel nostalgia here, and thus nostalgia you will feel. He is an expert at weaving emotion with a combination of setting, dialogue, and character, and he is at full power here. This is a stunning, and thoroughly wonderful, film. You owe it to yourself to see it, if you haven't already, at your earliest opportunity if you love movies. For Giuseppe Tornatore does, too. **** ½pportunity if you love movies. For Giuseppe Tornatore does, too. **** ½
B000021XR5|5.0|I would advise everybody to just buy this album so they can hear Scott do one of the greatest Jim Morrison impersonations ever (\\"Atlanta\\"). I think with this last great album by this incredible group you see that the band was just becoming too content. Each song seems so effortless and easy. They can go in this direction or that direction and everything sounds great. Perhaps the challenges were no longer there? I would have loved to have seen them stay together for more than five albums, but the five they gave us were pretty damn sweet.
0618477942|3.0|Alison Bechdel, Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic (Houghton Mifflin, 2006)<br /><br />I'm somewhat impressed that I somehow managed to read one of the New York Times' Notable Books of 2006 while it's still 2006, and before they named it as a notable book. Completely unlike me. But there it is. My closet trendiness is finally leaking out.<br /><br />And as tempting as it is to use that paragraph as a segue into a review of Fun Home, I can't figure out a way to do it that isn't monstrously cheesy, so I'll leave it where it stands.<br /><br />As sick of the whole memoir thing as I am, there are still a few that generate enough buzz from the trustworthy to merit picking up while they're still somewhat fresh. Fun Home has been one of them since months before it came out, and for the most part, the buzz seems warranted. (The part that's not \\"most\\" is because, well, it's a memoir, and in today's climate, where everyone from the Bush's pet dog to the janitor of the local brothel is publishing a memoir, publishing a memoir in and of itself is cause for skepticism.) Bechdel takes her childhood journal and reworks it with an adult sensibility, but doesn't throw out the awkward, painful bits. Or, if she did, she left enough of them in to make it scan.<br /><br />At its heart, Fun Home is the story of the conflict between Bechdel and her father, both of whom were struggling with sexuality issues during Bechdel's adolescence; she eventually came out, while her father stayed closeted until his death (whether accident or suicide, a question unanswered to this day). Bechdel picks at the relationship, worries it like a dog at a neighbor's welcome mat, piecing her father together from a tapestry of memories and journal entries, telling the story of the rest of her somewhat dysfunctional family (yes, only somewhat; no Augusten Burroughs or David Sedaris here, thankfully) in the process. And while she was doing so, I kind of wondered where it was all going, as I usually do with memoirs-- whether it would resolve, or whether it would just end. Because life is not well known for its resolutions.<br /><br />Bechdel, however, should be. The final, page-sized frame of Fun Home is both a surprise and the only correct ending to the book, and it moves the book from \\"okay, decent memoir\\" to \\"wow, that works.\\" She does what she does, and she does it well. Well enough that sometimes it sneaks up on you. ***irs-- whether it would resolve, or whether it would just end.

B00005O3VD|5.0|\\"Funny Girl\\" is not perfect.  The film starts out like a beautiful fairy tale (a.k.a. Cinderella) which comes dangerously close to becoming sickeningly sweet before it finally takes a dark turn.  Even as it is, the more serious conflict is subdued compared to the romance.  The conclusion to this video is a bit too abrupt.<br /><br />\\"Funny Girl\\" is not perfect, but it deserves its status as a 5 star classic.  The stellar performances of Barbra Streisand and Omar Sharif are haunting and will stay with the viewer long after the movie is done.  The good outweighs the bad.  This is one film that everyone who loves movie classics should see.
0345457684|3.0|Richard K. Morgan, Altered Carbon (Ballantine, 2002)<br /><br />Morgan's first novel featuring futuristic crimefighter Takeshi Kovacs is a bit slow getting started, but once it ramps up, it hums along quite nicely. In the 25th century, human consciousness has been quantified and captured, and can be implanted in \\"sleeves\\"-- organic bodies either harvested from incarcerated humans or grown artificially. Thus, death is almost a thing of the past. Kovacs is hired to investigate an attempt to bring death back to the present-- the attempted assassination of magnate Laurens Bancroft. (People in this world can be killed by destroying the chip which holds the consciousness.) The first couple of chapters, as with many sci-fi novels, are more interested in getting us up to speed with not only the principal characters, but also the jargon, the physics, and all the other stuff we need to know about Morgan's future alternate Earth, and that sort of thing leaves a footprint-- sometimes invisible, sometimes large and ungainly. Here, it's the latter, and that's the books main flaw. Things pick up roundabout the end of chapter two, though, and the book becomes a viable sci-fi/mystery.<br /><br />An interesting beginning to a promising series; I'll pick up the second to see where he's going. ***
1573223085|5.0|I'd heard quite a bit of buzz surrounding the book A Whole New Mind: Moving from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age by Daniel H. Pink, so I decided to check it out at the library.  He makes a strong case for the emergence of \\"right-brained\\" individuals in what could be called the post-information age, a.k.a, the \\"conceptual age\\".<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - The Conceptual Age: Right Brain Rising; Abundance, Asia, and Automation; High Concept, High Touch<br /><br />Part 2 - The Six Senses: Design; Story; Symphony; Empathy; Play; Meaning<br /><br />Afterword; Notes; Acknowledgements; Index<br /><br />According to Pink, there are three trends that have reshaped the information age.  Abundance means that we have a wide array of goods at affordable prices.  Asia denotes the rise of information workers in developing countries who can do process labor (information worker tasks) at wages far less than we make.  And automation is the term that stands for the power of the computer, and its ability to take on more and more tasks that can be distilled to a set routine.  The information age has provided the fertile ground for all of these, but the side effect is that these very benefits have made the \\"left-brained\\" information worker less of a resource and more of a commodity.  Pink contends that the skills needed to prosper now involve the blending of left- *and* right-brained thinking, the ability to see the whole and make connections in new and innovative ways.  The person who does the coding can be outsourced.  The person who comes up with the ideas and sees the trends is the one that an organization needs in order to innovate and differentiate themselves.  People don't want the raw facts any more....  There's too much of that.  They're looking for \\"stories\\", for a blending of facts into a relevant application.  The people who can provide those stories are the ones that will be in demand.<br /><br />I found this book fascinating.  While I don't necessarily agree that the information age is over, I do agree that the ability to bridge the technical and emotional aspect of life is becoming increasingly important.  At the end of each one of the senses chapter, there's a portfolio section that outlines a number of steps you can take to explore that area in more depth.  I now have a list of (what else?) books that look very interesting and that should take me a bit further down this road.<br /><br />A recommended read for anyone looking to make sense of what life skills you need to stand out in today's world...that the information age is over, I do agree that the ability to bridge the technical and emotional aspect of life is becoming increasingly important.

0446310786|5.0|The dusty roads and the barren land was home for Scout Finch, a young white girl narrating this timeless classic, To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. Growing up in the scorching heat of Maycomb County, Alabama, may be hard for Scout, her headstrong brother Jem, and their wise friend from Meridian, Mississippi, Dill, but throughout the story the kids have many good times. <br />  <br />In the small town, everybody knows a little about each family except for the Radleys. Even though the Radleys live close to the Finches, all the kids ever hear about them was deranged rumors of their child, Boo. Dill was especially interested in trying to find out who Boo Radley really was. The kids invent a lot of stories about Boo, but will they ever get to see him? <br /> <br />Scout and Jem's father, Atticus Finch, was my favorite character in this story. The voice of knowledge and reason came from Atticus, who was a role model not only to me, but also to his son Jem. Atticus was a lawyer for the town who believed that no matter what race, there should be an equality within a courthouse, which will be proven when Tom Robinson, a black man who was accused of raping a white girl. Atticus has to muster all his strength to win this case because the jury and the whole town against him. Will Atticus ring true or will racial injustice win this case, read To Kill a Mockingbird to find out.  <br /> <br />Racial injustice was huge in this book, being in 1935 slavery is abolished but not all of the white people respect black people yet and sometimes took advantage of the black people's nice intentions. The black people were the scapegoat of many of the white people's misfortune when they didn't know whom to blame. Even in the court, where the color of your skin shouldn't matter, there is a big bias with black people. Hopefully Atticus's loyalty to Tom Robinson will bring a wind of change to the community of Maycomb County. <br /> <br />In a town where everything is changing, even Jem and Scout as they get older and hit puberty, a line is crossed in Tom Robinson's court case, but by whom? To Kill a Mockingbird sends every reader back in time so they can witness how far we have come from the 1930's and how racist our country was then. Harper Lee does an excellent job at describing even the minute details in an eight year olds life. If you want to know what happens to Scout, Jem and Dill in this thrilling novel pick up a copy today. <br />

B000HCO83Q|3.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie but, there were parts and actors in it that you just couldn't stomach.  I've never liked rogue and her character as an actor, she just come's off way too subdued and normal,  (imagine that!) compared to the wild, fun and carefree 'southern girl' of the X-men cartoons callin peolpe 'suga' that we all got used to growing up. <br /> <br />Storm took way too much of a role in this movie, the screen time wolverine got wasn't bad at all.  If anything wolverine has become a better actor over the movies.  Storm seemed way out of character in this movie compared to the prior 2, she acted alright, but she felt of character, and almost nauseatingly so.  Magneto, Xavier, and Jean did a pretty bang up job with their characters, although jean had some weak acting moments.   <br /> <br />The problem with this movie is that it tries to pack way too much plot into too short a timeframe, its like the plot and scripts they had were sheared into oblivion.  The movie runs 1 hour 40 minutes, it's simply not enough to develop the story much at all, especially in relation to jeans alter ego, we never learn or get a glimpse into her past with Dr. Xavier.  This movie should have been more fleshed out with many aspects of it left for another movie, but I guess the suits wanted to finish it at three.  It's a shame really because X-Men was turning into a great over-all movie series. <br /> <br />I really hope they continue it if they start doing a better job on it, if it's anything like X-Men 3... it may be entertaining but after you've watched it you'll have all these questions and you'll feel unsatisfied.

Key elements in the history and growth of the characters were entirely omitted and the lack of character development left me feeling very little for these characters.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|I really didn't want to see this movie a whole lot. I am a fan of Miyazaki and have loved every movie of his I've seen, but a story about a flying pig in Italy? Get real. But I had nothing else I wanted to watch and it was either this movie or [[ASIN:B0006J28BO The Cat Returns]] and I hate cats, so I got this movie.<br /><br />All I have to say is I was shocked. I actually liked this movie. Not just a \\"its okay\\" kind of liked, but a \\"wow that was amazing\\" like. The animation was amazing and the voice acting was better than any other Miyazaki English dub with the exception of Spirited Away. But what really made this movie great was the fact that it's really, REALLY funny. Even parts that I would normally consider corny, like when Fio is talking to the air pirates about how great they supposedly are, are saved by the fact that they aren't taken seriously, they are made fun of. Instead of all the pirates going sober and calming down, they burst out cheering and going nuts. Its one of the funniest things you'll ever see.<br /><br />As for flaws, there aren't very many. Sure you don't really know why Porco is a pig in the first place and the American pilot acts very stupid, but these are minor problems that don't really bring this movie down a whole lot.<br /><br />This movie may not be for everyone. I loved it, but for someone expecting a movie of the same caliber of [[ASIN:B0001XAPZ6 Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind]] or [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]], you may be disappointed.

Does that make up for the rest of the movie being bad? Hardly. There were a couple of high tension moments but overall this movie is completely forgettable. And this is supposed to the best of Dario Argento's work?!?! Good lord, I'd hate to see what's considered his \\"lesser\\" work.
1400082773|5.0|Every thinking person needs to read this book.  It makes us examine what it is within our evolved consciousness that makes us seek our own kind, and whether we can ever grow past it.
B000J6I0PM|5.0|I just got this from Amazon, and I cant stop playing it. Its a reworking of the Foo's material. Including new arrangements and new instrumentation. Terrific DVD. Its great!
0307237699|1.0|I just finished reading this book today. It seems to me that the book lacks any real subject matter that you can lean on to say \\"hey, this Obama stands for ____\\". The book basically hits the standard fix-the-world topics, but delves into very few of them. This is a great strategy to get Obama'a face out in the view of the masses, but I do not recommend this book.
B000GTLQXU|1.0|sadly, there is nothing worth saving from this flick...having seen the original one in the theatres years ago, i still remember how breath-taking it was to traverse thru the bowels of the ship with gene hackman and ernest borgnine...but, then again, they were awake thru the whole picture... <br /> <br />i must stress that i love kurt russell and richard dreyfuss...they are two of my all-time favorites, and yet, they seem to be sleep-walking through this whole thing...but i can't blame them...if they actually had a script to involve them, maybe it would have involved us more as well... <br /> <br />i understand that today's generation has a 'limited attention span', and, unless you blow up something every 30 seconds, they get bored and go home...but, a film like this depends on character development, and without that, you get something like this...
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I really enjoyed this remake. I love the original, and I think a good job was done staying true to the original, while managing to update it for a new generation. I've seen a lot of remakes, and very often you get a sense like the director is trying to avoid ties to the original movie, but not here.<br />I thought this movie was fast paced and fun. It kept me interested all the way through. It was quite violent at times, and gory, but when your subject matter is about an all consuming space blob on a huge boat, named the Titanic, you sort of expect that kind of thing.<br /><br />The interaction between the characters was pretty well done.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jack, our hero who is also an outcast due to his rebellious nature. Kate Winslett plays the female lead, the all American cheerleader homecoming queen type. The two are thrown together to fight the blob.<br /><br />This version starts off essentially the same as the original, the blob arriving from space and attacking an old man in the boat. The old man is found by the poorer people on the boat, and is taken to the infirmary, where the blob proceeds to consume some characters. Jack is initially suspected by the police, as he's no stranger to them, but they have no physical evidence to hold him, so they have to let him go. Soon, people in the boat start disappearing, and the police have their hands full. Jack and Rose are the only two who have some idea what's going on, but when Rose tries to relate her story, what she saw, no one really believes her, and Jack isn't very credible, due to the reputation he has with the boat in general.<br /><br />Soon, the blob starts making itself known, consuming many people. Some kind of rich lady shows up, and seals the boat with the purpose of capturing the voracious organism. Facts about the origin of the blob come to light, and it seems the boat captain has a larger agenda than they originally stated. I thought it was quite funny how a number of people would fire at the blob with pistols and automatic weapons, only to find it had no effect on the creature. There were some pretty horrific scenes with people getting consumed by the blob, showing them basically dissolving as if bathed in acid. One scene in particular was when a ten or twelve year old boy gets taken. I was surprised to see this happen, as it seems pretty rare to me that kids get hurt or killed in these monster movies. I did see this when it came out, which was like 9 years ago, but I didn't remember that part. I didn't mind so much, as the kid was pretty annoying. There's a climatic battle at the end, and the teenagers save the day, but in the last scene we are left wondering if the horror is truly over.<br /><br />The main differences between this movie and the old version are the effects and the level of violence. In the old version, the violence was more implied, where this version expands on that, showing us many people being consumed. Also, the poor people in this movie can really pass themselves off as poor people, while in the old version, the actors seemed a little older than was suggested. Also, some interesting plot elements are added which suggest the creature may not have originated from space, but here on Earth. Also, the special effects are well done, and show us more of what we didn't see in the old version.<br /><br />I think the old version, which I also own, is and always will be a classic, and this makes a nice companion and is a good movie in it's own right.omatic weapons, only to find it had no effect on the creature.

0393324818|3.0|I thought this book was worth reading, but that Michael Lewis was not the best person to write it. He does a good job of introducting James, an everyday person who introduces an intriguing new set of statistics that convincingly illustrate which player skills lead to baseball victories. Interestingly, these are not the skills that most ML baseball teams attend to when recruiting. <br /> <br />Lewis alternates between idolizing Billy Beane (the Oakland A's GM who acts on James statistics), and portraying him as a raving maniac. In a postscript, Lewis admits that he skewed the manic portrayal (and that Beane wasn't too happy about it). Can't say I blame him. As a reader, I found the inaccurate portrayal baffling, and found it lessened the book and my view of Lewis as an author. Substantially. <br /> <br />Lewis reveals his scientific naïveté again and again by providing narratives of a few baseball games when Oakland A's players, chosen for their embodiment of James' theory, experience success. After reading these, a mental image of a 7-year-old running to his mother saying, \\"Look Mom, it's true\\" came to mind. If a scientist were to test whether James was right, she would also consider for each of these anecdotes whether there was another explanation. She also would look at cases when James' theory fails, and explain them. I found these narratives sometimes dragged on pointlessly and detracted from the book's readability. I believe James' theory, but think a more balanced look at when it works and doesn't would have been much more interesting. <br /> <br />Lewis ends by contending that despite his book, nobody in ML baseball has changed their practices (other than the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox, who as he explains during the book, start to emulate the Oakland A's). It appears he reached this conclusion by anecdotal evidence, so I think it's preliminary (and contentious) to make such an assertion. <br /> <br />I'm glad to see that many have become interested in sabermetrics, and hope that a better author writes more on this topic. I don't anticipate reading any more Lewis books, but would read others on this topic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000F48CD8|5.0|The people who are giving this album bad reviews must have bought it thinking it was going to be 'Elephant' pt 2 (I say 'Elephant' because they are probably equally upset that 'Get Behind Me Satan' doesn't sound like every other White Stripes album).  Don't buy this album expecting Jack White to dominate every track with his distinctive style.  Buy it, forget Jack White is a member, and listen to it 5 times in a row (that's not hard to do...it's not very long).  You might not be blown away the first couple of times around, but this album will grow on you until you can't get it out of your head.  Jack definitely shines through on a couple of tracks but this album is a team effort.  The White Stripes is basically his solo act so, it's very cool to hear him in a true ensemble.  He harmonizes with and supports his band-mates in a way that I've never heard before, but it's still a real treat to hear him break out once in a while.  As a die-hard White Stripes fan, I loved this album, but my wife, who doesn't really care for The White Stripes at all, still plays the Raconteurs album on a weekly basis. <br /> <br />Jack White is an evolving artist.  If you want to follow a musician that sounds the same on album after album, project after project, you picked the wrong guy.
B00070QXL8|4.0|Colin Firth still tops the list as one of the hottest leading men, and he only improves with age.  Hugh Grant is comparably handsome, but we find that his character Daniel is up to his old tricks (so despite the fact that he looks absolutely gorgeous, we know he's NOT the one for Bridget). (I must be getting older, as men in their 40s are beginning to look more and more attractive...)<br /><br />In my opinion, this sequel was well done. The plot may have been a little thin, but I thought the dialogue hilarious.  I was in stitches for much of the movie. In fact, I thought the sequel even funnier than (or at least as funny as) the original, though I admit the plot wasn't as good. (Likewise, I thought Analyze That funnier than Analyze This and loved Meet the Fockers as much as Meet the Parents--as an aside, when my brother got married a little over a year ago, both wedding parties claimed to be the Fockers...)<br /><br />A few things that I really liked about this movie: it's SO sweet, and I can't imagine a better catch for any woman than Mark Darcy.  When he claims that he was just \\"a messanger\\" for his law firm who happened to be in Thailand (where Bridget is wrongfully arrested for cocaine smuggling), Bridget looses heart.  She later learns that Mark travelled throughout the world, tracking down the real criminal with as much aplomb as James Bond or the Avengers. I like that despite Bridget's numerous social gaffes and self-professed \\"love handles,\\" Mark really loves her and recognizes her worth. In other words, unconditional love conquers misunderstandings, jealousies, physical imperfections, and words said in the heat of anger. Bridget Jones is a realistic woman the rest of us can relate to: she battles with insecurities, tries (unsuccessfully) to get rid of bad habits (in Bridget's case, smoking and unhealthy eating), and makes many of the mistakes featured in the movie, \\"How to Loose a Guy in 10 Days.\\"  Yet she's charming and a refreshing break from the Superwoman syndrome.<br /><br />If you want an escapist movie with some good laughs, this is a great movie to watch.<br /><br />One part that wasn't so funny--we see women who share their horror stories with Bridget while she's in prison in Thailand--so there's room for social advocacy on the behalf of the viewer and human rights activists.If you want an escapist movie with some good laughs, this is a great movie to watch.

B000GPI2EK|5.0|If \\"metal\\" gives you visions of pale fat kids with tribal tattoos and dreadlocks, doing the same \\"shred\\" solo over double bass drum rolls as the last guy... you have missed some real good music. <br /> <br />While not quite as fast as Leviathan, Blood Mountain does indeed rock and carry on more of the same. <br /> <br />Mastodon might be the only band that could sing about finding a \\"Crystal Skull\\" and evolving to the next level of humanity... without sounding like someone who spends too much time in Mom's basement, filling in D&D character sheets. <br /> <br />Part of that is the genesis of the band... mixing sludgy guitars with metalcore/punk intensity is the result of scene vets.  But they do it, and do it incredibly well.  \\"Capillarian Crest\\" mixes metalcore and guitar noodling into a Converge-style punk-metal thrash and comes back out at the end.  Several songs are slower and more moody... others grind along with throaty, snarly guitars and the brilliant drum work that we come to expect from Brann Dailor. <br /> <br />The album is peppered with guest vocals, including Cedric (from ATDI and The Mars Volta) and rumor has it that Omar (from the same bands) loaned them his dizzying array of pedals. <br /> <br />Merely blending genres into a more progressive, honest form of music isn't the sole property that makes Mastodon good.  There aren't many metal bands that punks, metalcore kids, and indie nerds all agree on... and that's with good reason.  Mastodon may be metal, but doesn't fit too well into the current \\"vogue\\"... and that's good.  Even when their guitars slow down and the tom fills are slowly building, the band shines with the same odd innocence and honesty of the best punk/metalcore acts of the last twenty years.  You won't find songs about how \\"bad\\" they are or goofy posturing, it's just a band, telling you a story in the best way they know how.  It's the same quality that made early Metallica, Black Flag, Sonic Youth, and Fugazi good.  And for that, we should all be thankful.
B00005ATQF|5.0|I was drafted out of college in 1968 when graduate school deferments ended.  Yes, I know I could have avoided the whole thing just by swearing that I was homosexual or handicapped or by convincing my father to win a Senate seat.  Alas, Dad was a World War II vet who worked for Ford and who thought it was about time I started acting like a man.  And, I was young then and idealistic and it seemed important to me that year that I should share the same risks that other young men were being compelled to take.   <br /> <br />    At least, unlike so many of my peers, I have not since been forced to wonder what I missed.  Because, I didn't really miss any of it.   <br /> <br />    Most of the war movies that have been produced since Vietnam have been made by men who have never heard a shot fired in anger and have been haunted by what they missed all their lives.  For example, 'Saving Private Ryan' looks and sounds and feels nothing like war.  I have always felt insulted by 'Apocalypse Now.'  And, 'Platoon' sometimes looks like Vietnam but not usually and I don't really think Oliver Stone has anything more to say on the subject of that war that what Jane Fonda has already said a thousand times.  And, I realize it is idiosyncaratic of me, but I also had a good friend named Jack Rambo who met a tragic and painful end in late November 1969 and so I have always been annoyed that Sylvester Stallone, who spent the war hiding in Switzerland, should not only give himself permission to appropriate my friend's name but go on to more or less slander all Vietnam Vets at the same time and then get rich by doing it.   <br /> <br />     But 'Full Metal Jacket' is very different from all these other Vietnam films.  Most of the kids with whom I served were bright, funny, anti-authoritarian, ironic, tough and very dangerous.  So are the characters in this movie.  I have probably been asked a hundred times:  \\"Well, did you ever actually kill somebody?\\" and then the inevitable, \\"Well whatwas it like?\\"  Well, if you actually want to know, watch the smartass protagonist of this movie try to rise above the Marine Corps with his intellect and cleverness.  Watch him go out with a patrol that gets lost--because really, you aren't actually in combat unless you're lost.  Watch kids get picked off.  Watch another kid do something really angry, stupid and brave.  Watch them line up, pop smoke and go waste a slope.  Then watch them skip home in the dark singing the Mickey Mouse song.  That is pretty much what my war looked like.    <br /> <br />     The other day I heard our President say that he and Donald Rumsfeld had \\"been through a war together\\" these last few years.  I think it haunts the President that he \\"missed\\" Vietnam.  I once heard James Jones say, \\"I would never want my son to go to war but I would have to tell him that if he didn't go that not going would haunt him for the rest of his life.\\"  Now I live in a nation governed by men who are haunted by \\"not going.\\"  And, I think they could have saved us all a world of heart break if they had just watched this movie instead of having to prove what tough guys they are by invading Iraq. <br />Donald Charles Davis
0783225849|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock featured many blonde leading ladies in his films. In Psycho, we're fortunate enough to be treated to no less than TWO attractive blondes: Vera Miles and Janet Leigh. The former played Lila Crane, the sister of Janet Leigh's character Marion Crane. Both of these blondes would sooner or later wind-up in the company of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). One of the ladies would die tragically, making her the \\"fatal blonde,\\" the other would barely escape her own death attempting to unravel the mystery surrounding her sister's disappearance.    Marion Crane was inwardly bitter of the fact that she could not marry her boyfriend Sam Loomis due to his financial woes. At her job with the real estate office, Marion's resentment was pushed further when an overbearing client boasted to her of the $40,000 home he was purchasing as a present for HIS daughter's wedding. After blatantly waving the $40,000 bankroll in Marion's face, he dropped it on her desk and beckoned her to \\"count 'em!\\" It was a demonstration he would later regret. Acting on a romantic notion, and perhaps also a spiteful impulse to punish the obnoxious client, Marion absconded with his money in an attempt to create a new life for herself and Sam.    The scene of a lifeless, colorless desert hung on the wall behind Marion's desk. When she left her office for the last time (with the client's money), the scene of a lush, colorful paradise behind a VACANT desk was shown right before the disolve. Those were symbolic of Marion's virtual escape or transition from her drab existence as an unhappy single secretary to her much prefered lifestyle with Sam as a happily married wife and mother; safe and financially secure on their own \\"private island.\\"      On the run, Marion became lost in a rainstorm. A lighted sign in the distance announced the Bates motel. She decided to stay there for the night and wait-out the storm. Marion was brutally murdered at this motel and her body cleverly disposed of in a seemingly routine fashion.       Interesting Psycho Fact #1: Mr. Cassidy, whose money Marion stole, uttered the rather uncharacteristic phrase \\"Hot Creepers\\" in reaction to the news of the theft. That sounded more like the vernacular someone such as Beaver Cleaver would have used to express astonishment than that of the shrewed, free-wheeling, man-of-the-world Cassidy.     Interesting Psycho Fact #2: At home, as Marion packed suitcases for her fateful journey, her shower, complete with flowered curtain, was visibly looming in the background like an ironic premonition.    Marion was a somewhat sexy and sophisticated blonde number whom Norman Bates took an immediate liking to. She was quite fascinating to him - fatally fascinating, and as things turned-out she became \\"Norman's fatal blonde.\\" She was a good-looking number all right, but an UNLUCKY number just the same.    When the police finally pulled Marion's Ford from the swamp, even before they could pry open the trunk, one of the first things they probably did was to scrape the mud off of the license plates in order to positively identify the vehicle. Marion's plates were NFB 418. If they had read the letters and added-up the numbers correctly, the contents of the trunk would have been foretold: NFB = Norman's Fatal Blonde - Marion. 4 + 1 + 8 = 13, an unlucky number - Marion.      Interesting Psycho Fact #3: For a guy that had as much to conceal in his home as Norman Bates did, he never seemed to be too concerned about keeping the front door locked.    Enter Lila Crane, Marion's sister. She arrived at the Bates motel with the intention of searching for any and all possible clues to Marion's disappearance. Lila eyeballed Norman suspiciously while registering in his office, when he smiled at her she could barely bring herself to reciprocate. Lila was a gutsy woman who didn't like to take \\"no\\" for an answer; \\"no,\\" however, seemed to be a favorite reply of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates. It would have made for an interesting confrontation had Lila been able to question Mrs. Bates as Lila had planned.    Interesting Psycho Fact #4: While in Norman's bedroom, Lila was drawn to a book that had no title on its cover or spine. She opened the book and saw something inside that interested her, we were not shown the page, only Lila's expressionless face. What was the book? What did she see in it?    Lila was almost murdered after finding Mrs. Bates, and the last we saw of Norman, he was sitting in a room at the county courthouse. Look closely at the cop standing by the door of the room, it was future TV star Ted Knight.    Theater-goers in 1960 had never experienced anything like Psycho before, it was the first of its kind, and like a recurring nightmare, its images and sounds would continue to haunt them LONG after the curtains closed and the house lights went up.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Fans of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer who've been feeling bereft since the show's 2003 cancellation should look no further than the first two seasons of the newly revived British series, Doctor Who.  A BBC flagship series from 1963-1989, the updated show bears little resemblance to the quaint, campy, and often hokey old show that Americans might remember from PBS in the 1970s and 1980s.  Dr. Who has been brought forward into the 21st century, modernized, and given a gleaming makeover.  Yes, the special effects still looks cheap by American standards, but the update is still streets more sophisticated than the original series; the quality of the writing and acting more than make up for its visual shortcomings. <br /> <br />The smartest decision the Beeb made was to hand the reins of the revived series to maverick writer/ producer Russell T Davies.  The smartest decisions Davies made were 1) to cast Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper as the leads, and 2) to base the structure of the show (a la Kim Possible) almost entirely around Joss Whedon's Buffy.  Davies recognizes that Whedon had hit on a winning formula, which he replicates in loving detail. <br /> <br />Rose Tyler (Piper) essentially IS Buffy Summers, minus the Slayer powers.  Green-eyed peroxide blonde?  Check.  Former gymnast?  Check.  Raised by single mother?  Check.  Brave, intelligent, and curious?  Check.  Sarcastic tongue and pop culture vocabulary?  Check.  Doofy but well-meaning best friend who grows into a hero in his own right?  Check.  In love with a centuries-old otherworldy being?  Funny you should ask.  Replace high school with space/ time travel and vampires/ demons with aliens, and you have, in essence, described the new Who. <br /> <br />With so much focus on Rose, the Doctor himself seems almost of secondary importance, but that's not really so: Davies and his writers use the profoundly ordinary Rose as the viewer's avenue into the Doctor's bizarre world.  Yes, he's still a space-time traveling alien who rackets about the cosmos in a giant ship that looks like a blue phone booth on the outside, but gone are the loud costumes and outlandish behavior viewers may remember from Doctors past.  Eccleston's Doctor is modern and stripped-down, with buzzcut hair, a black leather coat, and a pronounced northern accent.  He's 80% Rupert Giles and 20% Angel: dry, ironic, sexy, hundreds of years old, and staggering under a burden of unimaginable guilt.  He quickly comes to fill the role of both father figure and mentor to Rose, and in a break with old Who tradition, he becomes her love interest as well. <br /> <br />Rounding out the cast are Noel Clarke as Rose's on-again, off-again (ex) boyfriend Mickey Smith (95% Xander Harris and 5% Willow Rosenberg), who starts out useless but by the end of the season has proved his guts and integrity several times over.  Jackie Tyler (Camille Codori) is a trashier version of Joyce Summers: loudmouthed, cuttingly funny, always on the lookout for a shag, but fiercely loyal to and protective of her daughter--even though Rose's new lifestyle bewilders her, and she's deeply suspicious of the Doctor.  Later in the season, Rose and the Doctor are joined by Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a 51st century omnisexual conman with a heart of gold. <br /> <br />An array of aliens and monsters provide the Doctor's adversaries each week, but the real evils he fights are universal: greed (individual and collective), conformity, apathy, and the mother of all monsters, religious fanaticism.  The stories deftly mix humor, horror, romance, and drama, much as Buffy did at its best.  Viewers get a smorgasbord of \\"Who's greatest hits:\\" travel to the past, travel to the future, new foes, classic foes, human evil, alien evil, and a spectacular regeneration sequence in the season climax.  If the series had not been renewed beyond its first season, Davies would have at least treated his audience to all the classic elements that made the original series so wonderfully inventive.   <br /> <br />Of all the stories, the two part \\"Empty Child/ Doctor Dances\\" stands out as not only the best of the season but the best of the series to date (rivaled only by season two's \\"Christmas Invasion\\").  A creepy, suspenseful thriller set in WWII London, the story unfolds at just the right pace; the guest cast is outstanding; the atmosphere of war-torn London is marvelously evoked; the resolution is joyous without ever descending into schmaltz.  Other highlights include the pilot episode \\"Rose,\\" the gripping \\"Dalek,\\" the powerfully emotional \\"Father's Day,\\" and the hold-no-punches finale, \\"Bad Wolf/ Parting of the Ways.\\"  Of all thirteen episodes, only \\"The Unquiet Dead\\" feels a little flat. <br /> <br />The series would not have succeeded without the formidable talents of Eccleston and Piper, whose chemistry together is tremendous, coming across as completely new and fresh while still evoking the best classic companion-Doctor partnerships.  Purists might quibble at the romantic attachment, but it's mostly very understated and nicely worked into the narrative structure as a whole, never distracting from the stories themselves. <br /> <br />Above all, the new series is infused with a powerful sense of love and hope that serve as a welcome antidote to the sometimes crass cynicism of popular culture.  The emphasis on courage and self-sacrifice is especially good to see.  Parents who are looking for thought-provoking entertainment that has real warmth and decency at its core should definitely add the new Who to the family's DVD collection. <br /> <br />In short, Who is a terrific television accomplishment.  A new series of this quality would likely be hailed an immediate success, but Who is even more impressive for having shed the clunky embarrassments of its past.  The marvelous essence of the original has been preserved, nurtured into life by the able talents of its cast and crew.  Skip the TV broadcasts (which are badly mangled forcommercial time) and splash out some money on the DVDs.  The extras alone make the purchase well worth the investment.  Come discover what so many viewers around the world have already learned: that Who is one of the best things on television. <br /> <br />And fans of Buffy may at last discover the program that fills the void in their hearts. <br />
B00006L7XQ|5.0|By now you've read these reviews and already you may have seen a pattern. Fans of harder edged rock listening to music that literally brings them to tears. The reason why is simply one word: Cash. Unfortunately, I too was late in appreciating The Man in Black while he was still with us. In my youth I was always a fan of rock of all kinds. Hard, metal, progressive. I swore against anything that wasn't based in rock. Namely Country. And because the Marketing execs didn't know how to categorize Mr. Cash, they lumped him into Country. So I avoided him out of my stubbornness. Now, I have more appreciation of all types of music, including some Country.  <br />Then I saw the movie \\"Walk The Line\\". I started to realize that Cash's music is nowhere near what I thought. I heard his version of \\"Hurt\\" and then \\"Personal Jesus\\". These are cover songs, but these are rare covers that actually transform the songs into something greater than the originals. And it's done with a simple voice full of life and pain. I just got this album today in the mail. I just put it in for the first time just an hour ago. It is now on my all time favorites. By the time I heard \\"Give My Love To Rose\\", I had a tear. And another on \\"Danny Boy\\". And yet another on (ironically) \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\". No album I own (and there are hundreds) has moved me this much. And the tears aren't just from hearing the pain in his voice and music. I weep because I kick myself thinking, \\"Why couldn't have I listened to this beautiful man years ago when he was with the living?\\" <br />Then I tell myself one thing.  <br />His physical being is no more. <br />He is now with his one true love, June. <br />His music, his soul, will always be with us. <br />Thank you, Johnny. \\"We'll Meet Again.\\"

0743243315|5.0|This is not a prescriptive book.  I tend to look for the underlying morality of books I read, and you'd be hard-pressed to find it here.  It simply describes life Nazneen as she emerges from the cocoon of defined femininity in Bangladesh.  There are letters and dreams interspersed throughout, but the entire novel feels dream-like, as Nazneen is trapped in a life that is only as substantial as a dream.  She begins to awake through pain and suffering, rather than simply enduring fate as masha'allah, the will of God.<br /><br />I didn't find myself identifying strongly with any particular character, despite how real they are drawn.  Rather I felt pulled into an alternate reality, one that I do not and could never share, but had become real under the pen of Monica Ali.  She vividly paints how men and women have been trapped in respective spheres of influence, and how difficult it is for any to break out of what has become Truth.  This is the [[ASIN:0385264704 Sugar Street]] of Britain, showing the culture through the political events of the 80's, 90's, and Noughties- and more than culture, individuals struggling for identity within myriad cultures.<br /><br />The reader should be aware that at times the book slowed down, or was difficult to read.  This was particularly true of the small-print italicized mailed letters, and in respect to British terminology, which I wasn't always familiar with.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I don't know about you, but I love watching tv shows on dvd. What I love even more is watching tv shows on dvd that I had never seen on television before. It makes it that much more exciting not knowing what is going to happen. Let me tell you this is one great show to watch on dvd. You'll have a hard time taking your eyes off the screen for so many reasons.  <br /> <br />First, my number one reason, is Kristen Bell. She plays her character, Veronica Mars, absolutely fantastic. Interesting, witty, smart, sexy, creative etc. you name it she's got it. Possibly one of my favorite new tv characters.  <br /> <br />Second is the excellent writing. I never once questioned any of Veronica's dialogue, actions, expressions, anything. She plays the heck out of that character and they write her a perfect script. The interaction between the cast is fantastic and so may plot twists but all very believeable.  <br /> <br />The season progresses nicely and leads to a great season finale as well as a season ending cliffhanger that makes me anxious for season 2.  <br /> <br />If you appreciate great acting, great writing, and a great cast I highly reccomend this show. Kristen Bell alone would make this show excellent, but with every aspect top notch, this is a must see.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|I admit, I haven't watched the movie.  The first thought that comes to mind is, let's say Americans DO make minor adjustments for the better welfare of the environment.  So what?  What about the rest of the world?  America only contributes a small percentage of the problem.  We can't stop North Korea from producing nukes, much less convince them to switch to electric cars.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Please, forget this director's cut, the theater version is so better. Mann has changed the introduction sequence, all the perception of the movie in not the same as before. Take the cut, forget the director's cut, or buy the french collector edition, you have the two version of the movie in the same set.
B00005JPE7|5.0|If Stallone keeps making Rocky movies, I would pay money to see every last one of them: I am a huge fan of the series, and I am a huge fan of the idea of having the courage to pursue your dreams and to pursue what God created you to do.    When an ESPN computer fight shows Rocky Balboa knocking out current heavyweight title holder Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon, something stirs Rocky deep inside, a need to do what he was created to do, a need to fight again. Everyone thinks he's nuts, except for faithful friend Little Marie, who tells him that \\"fighters fight.\\"    An astute Amazon reviewer noted that there are a lot of shadows in this movie: Rocky is living in the shadow of his glory days, the son is living in the shadow of his father, Mason Dixon is living in Rocky's shadow, even Spider Rico is living in Rocky's shadow, and Little Marie is living in Adrian's shadow (there are also a lot of shadowy scenes in the film   (alleys and streetlight scenes).     In a sense, Rocky himself is living in Adrian's shadow, as he struggles to move on with his life without her.     Let me also say that the fight scenes were very realistic, it   definitely has the look and feel of an HBO PPV telecast. My favorite   line is when Lampley asks Larry Merchant why they are calling this   fight an exhibition and Merchant says \\"so they won't have to call it an   execution.\\"     Yes, the movie pulls at your tear ducts: The movie begins with Rocky at the tomb of Adrian and ends with Rocky at the tomb of Adrian. On the anniversary of Adrian's passing, Rocky goes to all of their special places and visits with her. He even tells his grown son, \\"Don't forget to visit your mom.\\"    And yes, there are plenty of nods to nostalgia and maybe even a bit of self-parody, but this movie definitely climbs off the canvas and achieves a cinematic victory. Rocky Balboa is a knockout!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Don't kid yourself, when you've got a kid frolicking in the Skittle hills with the \\"primal scream\\" puppet people and feudal Oompaloompas dancing around hidden by snowflakes, you realize once and for all that Godot is never in fact going to show up and all this waiting around you've been doing was just an excuse to overpopulate the planet with your diseased lies and ever-bloated reflection. And the dogs of war barking from a tunnel and scenes from nuclear winter looking suspiciously like a Macy's Thanksgiving Parade gone awry might cause a lesser man to doubt his sensibilities, but not Kurosawa, by god. For he knows that dying leaf is watching you as it falls and that anguish is measurable only in sines and cosines by this alien race now spying via foliage.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|I bought Stargate:Atlantis sight unseen.  I had watched maybe 15 minutes of SG-1 several times and just couldn't get into it. But because I love sci fi shows like Battlestar Gallactica and Doctor Who, I took my sister's advice and bought Stargate:Atlantis. <br /> <br />I wasn't disappointed - the show has kept my husband and I interested through all of the episodes we have watched.  We both agree that it's Dr. McKay who makes this show great. There is always witty, comical banter even while the show manages to keep that dark sense of foreboding about the wraith alive. I'm definitely glad I bought it!
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I think KISS is America's best band.  I think I have good arguments on that as well.  These DVD's show the power that they had (and still have).    It is so cool to see the reviews that say something like:  Paul is the best!  Gene is eternally cool!  Ace is the best guitarist ever! or Long live Peter Criss-- The Catman!  Everyone seemed to have their favorite, just like the Beatles.  I look at these shows and think they really knew where they wanted to be, which was atop the Rock and Roll Mountain.  Like them or not, that is where they went.  No one could touch 'em.  Not Grand Funk, not Bob Seger, not even Aerosmith (they stumbled off stage too many times for me back then).    But, if you're reading this you are probably a fan already.  If so, queue this one up and get ready to enjoy!
1594200823|5.0|I read Mr. Pollan's Botany of Desire and enjoyed it. I have just finished Omnivore's Dilemma and very much enjoyed it. My graduate and undergraduate work was in seed science and sustainable production systems. I am currently in graduate school for Plant Breeding and Genetics. I have worked in production agriculture for the last 15 years. I am also an avowed foodie. I hunt game, I pick and grow mushrooms and I grow heirloom vegetables. I think Mr. Pollan has pulled together a lot of things that many of us in the industry know intuitively. I think the writing style is spot on. It is informative, but not overly technical. Some of the reviews by others in the field have picked apart the research or some of the technical facts and I could do so as well, but stepping back and looking at the whole is what is appropriate here. The writing style is not only informative, but also engaging and amusing.<br /><br />I think that anyone who reads this book will have to take a moment and ask themselves how they can change a production system that is fundamentally flawed. I remind all of those people they have that power and they make that choice every day in how they shop. Vote with your dollars, that will bring about change the quickest. And, change some of your expectations. No more peaches and asparagus in December. Accept the fact that grass fed beef will vary in flavor based on where it is raised and when it is brought to market. With wine we often speak of terroir; the flavor of the vineyard and how the grapes are grown being expressed in the wine. But, the same can be true for many other agricultural products where the flavor of the site and the variety and how it is grown can also be very distinctive.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|outlaw turned bounty hunter... some old tag line...  but this movie stands out because of it's dark atmosphere, great acting, and realistic action sequences. <br /> <br />When I want to sit and watch a serious, adult western...  this is it. <br /> <br />It makes you think about all the aspects of life, and all the different times of your own life, like how cocky you were when you were young, how many bad things you might have gotten away with, how powerful you can still be if you had to, and what lies ahead in the future and how you can control your own destiny.
B00005Q45W|1.0|Some of the worst songs ever.Its not even worth a one. <br /> <br />I listened to it twice ..this is dull, boring and depressing. <br />I have been a fan since 1968. <br /> <br />I would  not recommend this for new fans . Start with \\"I'm Your Man\\"  then go buy the Suzanne album. <br />He is dialing for dollars on this one and \\"Dear Heather\\" is more of the same. {Number #10 is what the Vietnamese called the GI's in Vietnam <br />and it means worst.} <br />This guy should be composing anti war songs again instead of number #10. <br />At least something better than this in \\"The Future\\"
B000002J0B|5.0|No one can touch Led Zeppelin's studio recordings.  These are the best.  Believe it or not, this was the last one for me to purchase back in the day.  I don't think I got this one until early '78.   <br /> <br />My first thought was not good though.  I didn't like the studio version of 'Song Remains the Same'.  That was the first song, and I didn't like it.  The reason:  I had the 'Song Remains the Same Soundtrack' with the live version.  I still think the live version is a much better version.  The rest of these are classics in pure Zeppelin fashion.   <br /> <br />Imagine that, the band that I think made the best studio albums of all time and my only complaint is that I like a live version of one song better.  Hmmm... pretty minor complaint and this still deserves every bit of the 5 stars.   <br /> <br />If I were to meet Jimmy Page, I'd only say things I'm sure he's already heard a million times, but he is the master of the studio.  The songs were well crafted too, but I think this CD is another example of 'studio brilliance' that only a few artists ever have been able to do.  When you can create EXACTLY the sound you want and the atmosphere you want... well that's brilliance.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I've happily watched my VHS version for years and was surprised to see in the reviews that it was changed in the initial DVD version. What a shame. Why on earth remove \\"The Love is Gone\\"? Anyone who's read the complete Dickens Christmas Carol will remember that Scrooge lost Belle because of his greed. That in fact the last place the Ghost of Christmas Past takes him is to Belle's home with her husband & children, showing Scrooge what he lost to his greed. Understanding Dickens Christmas Carol as I do the song makes perfect sense to me and it's ridiculous to remove it. When I need to replace my VHS version I'll only buy the version that has the song included.

B000ION79Y|1.0|When I reviewed \\"Mercenary for Justice\\", I said that was the worst Seagal movie since \\"The Foreigner\\". \\"Attack Force\\" is no better. The movie tries to be part action movie and part horror movie, and ends up being neither. Apparently, it's not only Avi Lerner and the other producers at Millennium/Nu Image that can make greenlight scripts with completely incoherent plots.  <br /> <br />The movie is not likely to appeal to action movie fans, nor to horror movie fans. That leaves only one potential target audience: Steven Seagal fans. The problem is that Steven Seagal does not have all that much screen time, and when he does, he's just sitting around looking tired. As if that's not bad enough, about half of his dialogue is dubbed over by another actor. So Steven Seagal fans are likely to feel cheated after wasting their money on this movie.  <br /> <br />The only people who should even consider wasting their time on this movie are die hard Steven Seagal fans, and even they would be wise to rent the movie instead of buying it.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|For nine long years I, like every other Loreena McKennitt fan, have mourned her extended absence from the music world. Like all of her music everytime I listen to \\"An Ancient Muse\\" I hear new nuances of voice and instrument. The range of her singing voice is truly stunning in this album. Though \\"An Ancient Muse\\" is a musical journey through the middle east, you can hear the echoes of the footsteps of the ancient Celts, who were the world travelers of their time. My favorite track on this album is \\"Never-ending Road (Amhr&agrave;n Duit)\\" It is a song of ending...the Muse's journey is done...and yet there is the promise of more to come. A deeper meaning can be found in the ancient Celtic belief in an after life. To them, death was but a single event on the never-ending road of life. I also liked \\"Beneath a Phrygian Sky\\", \\"Incantation\\", and \\"The English Ladye And the Knight.\\" My favorite album is \\"The book of Secrets\\" but I give \\"An Acnient Muse\\" a five star rating because it is simply too good not to. :)WELCOME BACK LOREENA!!! :)
B00005JOLI|2.0|I know that they state in the movie that Eragon is based on the book, I ask WHAT Part? It is like they pulled all of the pages out of the book threw them in the air, stacked it back together and slapped it on screen. So frustrating. OK the names are the same, the dragon is blue but really that is about it.<br /><br />1. Why did they say anything about Arya being a Princess? That is revealed in the second book and it is a big part of her story.<br />2. Were the Hell are the Dwarfs and who was that guy in with the Staff and the long beard, I have read the book and I could look him up but I should not have too.<br />3. Murtagh was put in a secure room with food and a bed and treated well for saving Eragons life and not a cell.<br />4. Who the hell cast Joss Stone as Angela, read the book before you cast, horrible acting, too young and her werecat, were was he?<br />5. Robert Carlyle was good but not great, he looked fantastic but just not menacing enough<br />6. Jeremy Irons was a good Brom, Brom was supposed to be older, but at least Jeremy's presence to the part made it believable.<br />7. Rachel Weisz's voice as Saphira sounded lovely, but it was ran through a computer for special effects echoing.<br />8. They never mentioned that Brom's dragon's name was Saphira and that Eragon named her without that knowledge. She did not name herself, nor did she morph into a large dragon in the period of 10 seconds.<br />9. The Vartan did not test Eragon at the entry and they did not just take Arya into the healers, they used her as a way to break Eragons stubbornness.<br />10. The relationship between Eragon and Saphira was more like a pet and owner than respectful partners. There was no character building, he spends a lot of time with her in the book whilst she grows and she becomes his one true friend when his cousin leaves.<br />11. I know Edward Speleers is cute but I was expecting someone a little older, his travels take a long time and at the end of it is a muscler fighter not a wimpy boy, in fact when he is standing watching the battle from the ledge, I thought from the body outline that it was a girl.<br />12. Eragon also goes to the Elves with Ayra at the end of the books to learn more magic.<br />13. The plot reveals to much and assumes the audience is too stupid to figure anything out. How does everyone know in 5 seconds that Eragon is the one with the egg, from my memory Ayra did not reveal anything.<br /><br />This movie was just a prime example of what could have happened to Lord of the Rings (and lets face it Eargon, sounds like Aragorn maybe?) if it was given to the wrong director.

0743424425|3.0|I've had the chance to read several books by SKing (Carrie, IT, The Stand, Different Seasons, 'Salems Lot, Thinner among others) and this has been the only one I ever had trouble reading. I wasn't too keen on reading it since I had already seen the movie but I ultimately decided to take a chance since \\"the book is always better!\\". Anyway, I bought it back in 2003 and I put it down around page 104. Two months later I picked it up again and re-read it from the start to no avail. I read some other books after that and finally decided to give it one last chance one month ago. I got to say that I felt mostly urged by the fact that I 'had' to read it rather than being motivated by the thrill of reading a good book. The other SKing books I finished in 3 to 4 days but this one just wouldn't stick!  <br /> <br />The plot just wasn't that interesting and the characters weren't as developed as I would've liked. The Jack-Danny relationship is dealed with ad nausea to try to make us care about them 'cause in the end Jack tries to kill Danny; to me it didn't do it! I think the ghosts/hotel could've been developed even more to try to bring the message home but it never happened. Jack never finds out that 'missing' piece of Overlook history and the big punchline is that he ends up becoming part of it... big deal! Wendy's character is weak and almost disposable, even Hallorann seems more interesting than her! <br /> <br />Anyway, I had a hard time reading through this and I least can say that that I read it after almost 3 years since I bought it! I wouldn't recommend it since I think other books by King are way better, like IT, Carrie or The Stand. I think SKing is a great writer and I look forward to reading more of his books. Ciao!
B000ICL3KG|3.0|However Al Gore (the savior of the human race) is the emperor of cheese balls. I cant believe he injected a bit of his weaselly political powting about his loss to the presidency. There was no need for that unless he had other motives other than to warn about this supposed impending catastrophe--mmm... say maybe a political agenda? FEAR! IS THE GOVERNMENT'S ULTIMATE WEAPON!--Ah ha, there is one for all the conspiracy theorist in the land. This is very important information and every one should take it seriously--even if it were true by a margin of .00000000001%, action should be taken by every person on the planet.

B0000AQVCL|4.0|After hearing Are You Gonna Be My Girl on the radio I bought the CD cold-knowing nothing at all about the group. The music has a 60's 70's classic rock feel with a modern edge that gets me going at anytime. I think I would even go see them in concert although I have not been to a live rock and roll concert since the late 70's when I saw Led Zeppelin as a teen.(Why didn't I save that black t shirt)? <br />This CD rocks for all age's.
B00062J00S|5.0|I just received this movie, and it's one of my favorites but I got it as a gift for my Dad and he's been looking for it in widescreen without any luck.  It says this one is full screen, so is any edition in wide screen?  Is the movie too old to be formatted for wide screen?
B00005JOLK|2.0|OK, as many reviewers on the net have already pointed out, the plot of `Eragon' resembles some of the more famous epic stories in such films as `Star Wars' (I'm talking about Episode IV). But I suspect that is not really the real problem of `Eragon.' You should remember that George Lucas actually borrowed from Kurosawa's masterpiece `Hidden Fortress' when he wrote the story of the Princess, the Warriors, and two comic relief. The difference is that Lucas created the characters that almost instantly became cultural icons every one can relate to - Who can forget the `conversations' of R2-D2 and C-3PO?  <br /> <br />`Eragon' has promising start when we are introduced to the dragon named Saphira. Rachel Weisz effectively provides the voice of this newly-born dragon, who quickly grows to be much wiser than its `rider' Eragon (Edward Speleers), young farm boy who happened to discover the dragon's egg. The egg was in fact stolen from King Galbatorix (scenery-chewing John Malkovich) who orders Durza (Robert Carlyle) to take it back no matter what it takes. <br /> <br />Well, I think this is a pretty good story. I don't see originality here. but not that bad. However, director Stefen Fangmeier (formerly visual effects supervisor for `Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' and others) misses every opportunity to let us know the film's characters on the screen. If the film's story says the egg was stolen from the evil king, presenting a bit more actions (and information) about Arya (Sienna Guillory) would not hurt. It would give us more vivid pictures of the fantasy world by showing more of this beautiful fighter, but the film just forgets it. Or how about Eragon's mentor named Brom (Jeremy Irons) who says he knows much about dragons and dragon riders? I do not doubt his mumbling words, but he could have used and showed better tricks than just words and sword-fighting with wood sticks to prove his knowledge.  <br /> <br />The only thing we are sure of is that the young hero is a good boy but still immature, even arrogant sometimes. That's OK as long as his motives are reasonable and consistent. Apparently the director didn't think that way. While watching, we are often at a loss as to the mission or the purpose of his journey, having few clues as to what he realy wants to (or has to) do. Magic spells are cast all too sudden, rather haphazardly. Geography of the world is not clear, and worst of all it seems as if Eragon himself is causing some of the troubles (and their serious consequences). But we are required to take side of him while he doesn't know what he is doing. <br /> <br />CGI of the film is nothing great, if not bad. The images of the flying dragon(s) are good, but its facial expressions need improvement. The lack of more convincing dragon's face may be forgiven in other films, but not in this where the relation between the dragon and the dragon rider plays a significant role in the plot. <br /> <br />I expected more from `Eragon' because I like films about fantasy world. Yes, while watching Jeremy Irons in ragged coat, I was reminded of Obi-Wan and Jedi Master, but that didn't bother me a lot. Rather, it was the lack of the force and originality that really disappointed me.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|ABOUT A BOY, based on Nick Hornby's 1998 hit novel, showcases a Hugh Grant veering away from his more normal role of hapless, stuttering romantic lead and, instead, this time, playing a shallow, emotionally stunted cad. Hugh Grant is so good in this role that it doesn't take long before you find yourself being charmed by this ingratiating, witty, and rudderless no-goodnik. Equally solid is the youngster Nicholas Hoult, who makes his film debut here. The not-quite-father-and-son (more like older-and-younger-brothers) rapport between Grant and Hoult, as well as a storyline which doesn't pander to the audience, makes this movie really work.<br /><br />SPOILERS here: This movie is about a boy...and a man who acts like a boy. Will Lightman (Hugh Grant) is a 38 year old bachelor whose songwriting father once wrote a famous Christmas jingle, of which royalties Will is still cheerfully living on. Will has never worked in his life and uses his credo \\"all men are islands\\" to explain the lonely emptiness and aimlessness in his life. He spends all his time ensuring that his life is so compartmentalized that he has activities broken down into units of time (taking a bath: 1 unit, exercising: 3 units, having his hair carefully dis-shelved: 4 units, etc.). He's so irresponsible that when a friend invites him to become her baby girl's godfather, the aghast Will rejects the offer. His friend retorts in disbelief, \\"I thought you had hidden depths,\\" to which Will responds with a clarifying \\"No, no, no, no...no. You always had that wrong. I really am this shallow.\\" The other lead character is Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), an odd 12-year-old boy who's a misfit in school and who's constantly worried about his unstable mother (Toni Collette). Marcus is so off-the-wall that even his nerdy chums cast him off as being too weird.<br /><br />When Will turns his lasvicious eyes on single mothers, he discovers the SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) support group. He joins a session and actually bags a picnic date with single mom Susie. However, on the day which will forever be known as the Dead Duck Day (oh, that poor duck!), Will is horrified to find out that the picnic will have added company in the form of  Marcus, whom Susie takes care of on occasion. The rest of the film depicts the relationship between Marcus and Will as, in due course, Marcus teaches Will to become more responsible and caring, and Will, in return, gives Marcus self-confidence and helps him to fit in better with his peers as Will becomes the go-to adult anchor in the boy's life. In the end, Will discovers that, instead of being a mere island, a chain of islands is infinitely more satisfying.<br /><br />The story is great, obviously. Chris and Paul Weitz, who had earlier helmed AMERICAN PIE, would, at first, seem to be poor choices to be directing this higher brow effort, but, apparently, they were big fans of the book and managed to convince the right people. They do a massively good job here, conducting a delicate juggling act of comedy, pathos, and cynicism. The secret of this movie, of course, is that it contains a core of misery. The socially awkward Marcus is sadly unable to be a regular kid and is thus ridiculed by his peers. His mom is definitely \\"off colored\\" and is prone to fits of depression. And Will. The saddest thing may be that, for a great length of film time, he continues to endorse his solitary and meaningless way of life. When he does come around, finally, there's a feeling that he does it somewhat reluctantly. The bits of humor thrown into the mix perfectly balances out the picture and even works to bolster the pathos and make the cynicism seem less cruel.<br /><br />The cast is excellent. And a very well done to Hugh Grant, who has matured to the point where I feel he's become a real thespian, instead of this clever bloke with a cute blinking gimmick and nice hair. And, of course, I continue to savor his urbane, uniquely British wit. His predominant on-screen partner, newcomer Nicholas Hoult, plays off him really well and they have nice moments that are quirky without being too syrupy. The best thing about Nicholas is that he didn't play his Marcus as confused but sweet. There were actually moments where I thought the kid was being too pushy or obtuse. I could see why other kids would bully him - Marcus is more than a bit off-kiltered. Still, you do end up rooting for him to do well. Toni Collette, as usual, convincingly makes her presence felt as Marcus's troubled mom as there were points in the film where I thought, \\"Uh-oh, she really is gonna off herself.\\" More screen time for the ravishing Rachel Weisz would've been preferred, but I do understand that this film is about Will and Marcus and not Will and Rachel, so it's all good.<br /><br />Special Features include: \\"Spotlight on Location\\": the 11-minute Making of ABOUT A BOY; feature commentary by Directors Chris and Paul Weitz; deleted scenes (with optional directors' commentary); music videos by Badly Drawn Boy (including the awesome \\"Something to Talk About\\"; lyrics to \\"Santa's Super Sleigh\\"; English to English dictionary; production notes; cast & crew bios; and the movie trailer.<br /><br />As someone in the special features mentioned, this film is an intelligent blend of cynicism and hope. Nick Hornby's depiction of bachelorhood in England is well represented here as the directors strived mightily to be faithful in their adaptation, though, apparently, they did come up with new stuff for the end bits. So, yes, do try this one out. ABOUT A BOY is thoughtful, a bit prickly, funny, and not at all mawkish,and, because the film doesn't insult the audience's intelligence, it'll stay in your brain and in your heart just that much longer.

0446528056|4.0|This novel is Nicholas Sparks' best one yet, as by the book's conclusion, he pegged it right on what true love is really about. All I can say is wow! His last few books have been disappointing, to say the least, and unbelievable. With his new one, he takes an idea everyone in the military knows about...the notorious \\"Dear John\\" letter that women decide to write to the love of their lives when they are either in basic training, on an overseas assignment, or fighting in some war. Why women decide to write such a letter at stressful and lonely times as those is beyond the comprehension of any man, but it happens, and Sparks took that idea and ran with it. Though he doesn't have any military background himself, he represented the military lingo pretty accurately and has a grasp of soldier life in Germany. I'm impressed. <br /> <br />What I find most fascinating with this novel is how well everything comes together in the end. What once seemed like a young man's strange isolation from his aloof father, his summertime fling with a type of woman he'd never consider dating before, and how such relationship changes him and his own relationship with his father. We see the good, the bad (though John isn't a bad guy, he has his human moments of imperfection, as well as the love his life, Savannah), and the beautiful, as Sparks hits the mark on what true love really means. That's what makes this novel a must read in his literary canon. <br /> <br />The reason I deduct one star, however, is based automatically on Sparks' tendency in several novels to perpetuate the 1950s cliche of \\"the white picket fence\\" that he seems to think women want. Yet, in all the neighborhood houses I've seen in my travels, it is rare to come across the stereotypical 50's ideal of a house with the white picket fence, so why does he mention that detail in novel after novel? A best-selling writer shouldn't rely on cliches and an editor should automatically zap it out. My only other complaint is that some of the dialogue in the beginning seemed a bit unrealistic to me. It didn't ring true with me, but other than those bits, it truly is his best novel to date. Let's face it, Nicholas Sparks is a man who knows what true love is and it's great to see a story that shows it by the resolution. The ending made all the difference between a great novel and another cliched romantic novel.
B000IU3Y1O|3.0|No \\"Policy of Truth\\"?????  No Best of Depeche Mode.
B00005JPAD|5.0|Warner Home Video has announced \\"The Departed\\" which stars Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson. The Martin Scorsese directed film will be available to own in single & double-disc editions from the 2/13/2007.<br /><br /> Each will include a 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, and English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track. The only extra on the single-disc will be the theatrical trailer. The two-disc special edition will include that, along with nine additional scenes with introductions by Martin Scorsese, a Story of the Boston Mob featurette, and a Creating Criminal Cultures featurette.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This has to be one of the most unique cd's I've purchased in a long time.  I enjoy a wide variety of music, however I don't know how one would classify Sigur Ros, but this cd is very beautiful.  I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers of this cd that it sounds as if they came from another galaxy and presented us Earthlings with something that was recorded in the Milky Way.  I enjoy trip hop/ambient/chill-out and although Sigur Ros seems to pull elements from these genres, I wouldn't classify it as such since there are other sounds incoporated as well.  Whatever the case may be, it's a wonderful cd laced with ethereal swirls of sound that make for not only for excellent ear candy, but its emotionally stirring as well.
080701429X|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone who has ever had the audacity to feel sorry for themselves (which is most of us). The biggest lesson I took from this wonderful book is that choice is everything. I highly recommend it.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I am now approaching a half century of life. I have watched hundreds, perhaps thousands of films and this is repeatedly among our most favorite. It seems ironic that its initial release wasn't as successful as we would assume from our vantage point in history. <br /> <br />This is a film rich with meaning and love. It is one of the few that I heartily recommend year after year. <br /> <br />My wife and I have accumulated 27 years of public school teaching between us and we feel this is one movie we would wish that all of our students as well as loved ones experience at least once a year. <br /> <br />When I think of the incredible gift this movie has been to so many over the years and how highly it rates among the movies of all time and how many lives it has impacted for good with its richness and love and humor I am filled with gratitude and thankfulness and I am very happy for those who had a part in spreading such good across the generations and time. <br /> <br />May you too be blessed with the message of love and purpose and the lessons of this profound masterpeice of films.
B000F0V0LI|5.0|This review is on the Ultimate Collector's Edition which came out this year.<br /><br />I guess it would be no surprise to anyone if I stated that The Searchers remains John Wayne's greatest film. Virtually everything about the movie remains timeless and its quality proves to be near perfect in almost every way. This movie should dispelled for all times, the fiction that John Wayne cannot act but himself. This movie was Wayne's greatest acting job. This was clearly shown early in the film when Wayne's character realized that his brother's ranch may be doom, the stricken look on that face remains priceless as it conveyed the horror of his mistake and despair behind the stoic behavior. Anyway, with so many previous reviews, I won't go further repeating what been written already.<br /><br />This DVD edition is definitely the ultimate edition as movie of this type could go. The movie image from this edition proves to be a superior improvement from the earlier edition that came out several years ago. The image proves to be clean, color vivid and it almost pristine. The soundtrack is clear, the audio is your basic mono but its also clear.<br /><br />The second disc contained all the extra documentaries. Both documentaries, \\"The Searcher: A Appreciation\\" and \\"Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers\\" proves to be insightful, interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />This edition also contains a copy of a 1956 Dell comic book on the movie. It been reduced in size but still readable. I supposed it useful to introduced the story without watching the movie. There is also a b/w booklet that contains many versions of the movie posters, and contemporary media hype on the movie. The other package contains collection of b/w back scene photos which is quite nice.<br /><br />There's also a coupon for a free The Searchers' movie reproduced poster. Unfortunately, the offer expired back several months ago.<br /><br />For people who don't want the extra material, there is the regular two disc edition which is bit cheaper.<br /><br />Overall, the ultimate edition sound bit overpriced but depending on how die-hard John Wayne fan you may be, the cost may be subjective.aterial, there is the regular two disc edition which is bit cheaper.  <br /> <br />Overall, the ultimate edition sound bit overpriced but depending on how die-hard John Wayne fan you may be, the cost may be subjective.
B000ION79Y|3.0|Right up there with other former box office superstars such as Van Damme, Norris, Lungren and Snipes. It would seem that one can make more money producing STV movies with good production instead of waiting for a theater release that might never come again.  <br /> <br />Other than the obvious dubbing of Seagals voice, this wasn't any better or worse then most Seagal movies. <br /> <br />I wouldn't mind seeing more gratuitous nudity or even meaningless sex in his movies, but I'll take what I can from Seagal. <br /> <br />One more thing, the singing thing isn't working...........stick to movies.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|The set was not scratched, not even a tiny bit. With care and no unnecessary jostling the set should last forever. If it starts to get scratched I'll simply store the discs in a envelope. I am not sure but i am guessing that the carriers who shipped these sets to individuals probably threw the boxes around. It is a flaw but it says more about the shipping habits of the carriers than anything else. My wife bought me mine at Borders and it is flawless. As for the series, I have never seen a single episode so I'll add more to this when I get through some of it. I have only heard great things and from many people who's opinions I trust.
B000008LOV|5.0|It was with a sense of relief,and pleasure that The Wilburys were welcomed in the late 1980s. Ostensibly, Orbison had gone missing, and the careers of Jeff,Bob and George were, to put it plainly, not garnering much attention. So, a renaissance of sorts, a democratic sprinkling of skills and showmanship, perfectly crafted songs and musicianship, with T Bone in the driver's seat. Dylan and Orbison sound comfortable and to be enjoying the sessions. After a few undistinguished years of religious proseletyzing, this heralded a more initimate channel for me to travel. The Traveling Wilburys Medicine Show is a great sampling of American rock and its sound has stood the test of time without succumbing to a trace of nostalgia.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|No doubt about it, this is a fantastic dance album. On the dance floor, you're hard-pressed to find more intoxicating and fueled music -- despite the fact that the melodies are dangerously hot, most of the album just produces a mysterious aura that is undeniable. It's sexy; lustful; infectious. For what it is, it's one of the best out there (not that I'm an expert in the genre -- I'm basically full of it).     I was one of the few people that thought 'American Life' was a solid album, but 'Confessions' tops it. Definitely lacks the overt-emotional edge of the previous, but it also succeeds far more in its own arena -- sexually geared, intellectually devoid dance music. I can't express that enough -- much of this, to me, is a type of ecstatic sex channeled through music, perhaps the best example of this heard in the seductive \\"Get Together\\". You don't think your lower bodily regions have ears? Listen to this album. :)    It loses some points for being repetitious on too many occasions, though again, the spur-of-the-moment nature of it makes this a lot less of a problem than it would be otherwise. Take \\"Sorry\\" -- flabbergastingly enticing in its melody and orchestration, just limited in ideas that forces it to reuse the material too much within its five minute runtime. Oh well. The only dud on the disc is \\"I Love New York\\", which I find truly abhorrent, but skipping one track is not a difficult task. The last half of the album reverts a bit to the sound of 'American Life', at least in its slower tempo and reliance on a more naked instrumentation -- not to mention Madonna's melodic styling -- and while it isn't as titillating as the former half, it's good stuff. \\"Push\\", specifically (which also happens to be one of my favorite tracks), recalls the sort of psychological musings of 'American Life', with awesomely unique soundscapes and rhythm backing such. Love it.    True, nothing on the album peaks like, oh, \\"Like a Prayer\\", but one must remember with that, Madonna created one of the finest songs in modern music -- I stubbornly stand by that belief, and I'm not a Madonna fanatic. That comparison is irrelevant, really; just thought I'd throw it out there. It boils down to this -- anyone who digs hypnotic, sensual pop, and feels like getting their more primitive juices flowing, shouldn't be -- at all -- disappointed in 'Confessions'.     One last note, which may be surprising after reading all of that -- this is coming from a guy who won't dare step on a dance floor.
B000J10ERO|2.0|I'll try to make this brief. For some reason, I never made it to the movie theater to see SR. Having seen the video, I now know why. <br /> <br />Two large problems immediately leap out. First is Kate Bosworth, a terrible choice for Lois Lane. Too bland. Too one-dimensional an actress. It is especially sad, because their ideal actress was right under their noses -- Parker Posey. She would have been the perfect Lois Lane. <br /> <br />Second, too much emphasis on Lex Luthor in the beginning. This is a Superman movie that starts with Lex Luthor!  They make the same mistake here that they did in those early Batman movies by putting equal emphasis on the Hero and the Villain. We want more Superman! <br /> <br />But I will admit that the jet rescue scene is fantastic and almost worth the price of the rental. Almost.
B0002OERI0|3.0|This isn't the greatest album in the world, but it's entertaining. The lyrics are insipid and their execution excruciatingly preachy, but musically it overcomes this, to an extent, because it's pretty rockin'... pop-rock. From the people I know personally (not a great number in this case), their biggest complaint was that the album was far too poppy. I've never been a huge Green Day fan, but my response to this -- when in the world were they not pop (or pop-punk; it still always possessed a substantial degree of pop)? Now, granted, 'American Idiot' does take the pop mentality to a higher plane, but you know what? It's far from bad pop. Pretty fetching hooks; some cheerily pompous choruses; an enthusiastic energy throughout most of it. It's simple, fun pop-rock. <br /> <br />But then again, it's no more than that. It all feels a bit too mainstream, ready to be downed for mass consumption -- pretty obvious after the fact, given it was possibly the most broadcasted album in the country for any number of months. While the hooks are good, they're exceedingly simple -- almost gimmicky -- and seem to lack true creativity, never arising beyond merely enjoyable. I mean, there's a reason \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" (and the completely disposable \\"American Idiot\\") were the two most played-out songs on the radio following the album's release -- I heard them countless times, and I don't even listen to the radio (I'm often surrounded by it at work). To Green Day's credit, the songs really do  maintain themselves strongly in front of such repetition; despite hearing them endlessly, they're still enjoyable when I listen to them even now, never sinking into irritating territory -- for such simple ballads, that's certainly worth mentioning.  Even then, those singles are probably two of the best tracks on here. Easily, 'American Idiot''s peak number comes in the lengthy epic \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", which erratically jumps in all directions and is enthralling for a massiveprogressive[?]-pop-rock song, not to mention the only real memorable bit on the disc. It's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't follow suit.  <br /> <br />Temporarily saccharine.  Likably vacuous.  That is all.
7119005901|4.0|The story itself is amazing, the translation lively and I like that it had little pictures once in a while to give me a picture in my head of what these characters looked like.   <br />HOWEVER...There are quite a few spelling mistakes, out-of-place words, and mixed up letters (b,d and p,q).  I bought a set directly from China so I'm not sure if the edition for sale in North America has these flaws.  They don't cause any major comprehension problems, but they're frequent enough for me to knock off 1 star. <br />Still, this is the translation you should get, even if their proof-reader should have been fired.
B000002P5R|5.0|This is the geniune article, folks: The tapes that Jimi was working on before his untimely death. Seventeen songs, and all but two (Beginnings and Stepping Stone) are must-haves for any serious Hendrix fan. Of course, it's got the lovely, oft-covered ballad Angel, which has quickly become a Hendrix standard and is one of his best songs, perfect lyrics, perfect melody, perfect instrumentation... it's all there. A masterpiece. And it's not even the best song on the disc - I'd go with either the title track or Drifting, a low-key ballad that is one of Hendrix's more underrated. Rockers In From the Storm; Freedom; Izabella and Roomfull of Mirrors are perfectly complimented by the ballads (Night Bird Flying; the aforementioned Angel; Drifting) and the funk songs (Ezy Rider, another favorite; Dolly Dagger). And then there's the hilarious, wah-wah'ed Belly Button Window. Hendrix's last recordings have been repackaged several times, but this is the one to go to - it's probably what Hendrix would've approved of, unlike the Allen Douglass releases. Hendrix's music was taking an interesting turn before his premature death. If you're curious as to how a fourth studio album would've turned out (and really, who isn't?), this should satisfy you.
B00003W8NM|3.0|David Fincher made a great movie. Seven is it. Fight Club is not. Fight Club was good.<br /><br />The most important ingredient for me in awarding stars to a movie is that it was a realistic film. A believable film. You know, \\"Could this happen in real life?\\" That's the key for me.<br /><br />I'm not saying that the Fantasy Genre doesn't interest me. It does! Just look at my other reviews here. Look at some of the movies that I've given high marks to. The Descent (2005). Night of the Living Dead (1968 & 1990). Even 1997's Starship Troopers earns high marks. Why? Because the director pulls you in with adult situations where the players all act like adults; they do what you'd expect them to do when faced with their given situations. Or at they do something, while not expected, is not out of the realms of possibility.<br /><br />In Fight Club the acting is good...it even boarders on great. The story is fun. The twists and turns are unexpected and brilliantly executed. The development of the actual Fight Club?...Well...would you expect employees of every establishment and institution to become members? Next level: would every single member that joined to fight in underground Ultimate Fighting matches also seemingly become as interested in becoming terrorists? Of course not. So taketh away from my experience and ability to walk away with an above average experience.<br /><br />Fred Durst may have \\"seen the Fight Club about 28 times,\\" but I have and will see it just once. I was entertained. It was a good movie with fast moving action. But the reality factor took it back a notch.<br /><br />Fincher's resume is full of \\"good\\" movies. Let's hope next year Fincher falls back in the arms of greatness with Zodiac...my expectations are, clearly, high.
B000AYEL1A|2.0|On November 20, 2006, I was lucky enough to see Barbra Streisand perform for the 9th time, 6th in a full concert.  She proved once more why she is who she is with a stripped down show that proved that true talent doesn't need a show to rival a modern day DeMille spectacal.  For me, the highlight was \\"My Man\\" that stayed in my thoughts constantly for days...that is until I watched this DVD and listened to Barbra's comments.   <br /> <br />As you may have guessed, I am a huge fan, but alas, the movie, which I saw 6 times in the theatre including the world premiere (this was before the days of home video) does not hold up for me.  I find Barbra's performance most erratic and at times quite mawkish.  It's too bad because the structure of the movie, opening up with three scenes focused on him and ending with three scenes focusing on her is a good idea, it's just that her last three scenes are two monologues and a 7 minute musical number.  Granted 7 minutes of Streisand singing is as close to heaven as we can get, but cinematically, I've thought that she should have at least started cutting when she started to rock out.   <br /> <br />The deleted scene of the cut version shows why they didn't go with it.  It had nothing to do with her ego or any artistic decision.  The truth is that our Barbra looks absolutely silly.  (See the difference just three years earlier when she sang \\"Sweet Inspiration\\" with Ray Charles and the Rayettes on \\"Barbra Streisand and Other Musical Instruments.\\"  As herself, you can just see her having a ball and the feeling is infectious.)   <br /> <br />Worse is the commentary in which during the aforementioned opening scenes, she talks about the two songs that she wrote for the movie rather than during those scenes!   <br /> <br />A big plus for this picture is Kristofferson's performance.  The caterwauling, the who gives a f--k 'tude, all work.  Supposedly his life at the time mirrored his role and it works.  There's not a false note in his acting.(Kristofferson apparently thinks enough of Barbra to have appeared in an 80's music video with her as well as when she recieved her AFI Life Acheivement Award.)   <br /> <br />Despite what Barbra thinks, her clothes (from her closet for \\"budgetary\\" reasons) do not hold up.  I'm not exactly a fashion maven, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone wear such schmattas in at least 25 years!  <br /> <br />Hopefully I've given an objective review as opposed to the fans who have an unconditional love for our idol and the haters who have no idea of what true talent is.
B000H305U0|5.0|This CD grows on you.  And it's a great CD to drive to or get ready for a party to.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|Well? Where do I start?<br /><br />Michael Mann has been making some great crime movies over his years: Thief, Manhunter, Heat (one of my favorites) and Collateral. With Miami Vice he went with the same realistic theme we saw in those movies and with it, we lost the flash and color of Miami. We lost the charm and spectacle that made the television series, in which this movie is based upon, such a quality show, STILL.<br /><br />I didn't necessarily go into Miami Vice (the movie) looking for Miami Vice (the series), but you sort of half expect it to be a little bit similar, otherwise, why call them Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Tubbs (Jamie Foxx)? After watching Miami Vice (the movie) I wish they WOULD have just made it an original story and not a based it on a television show, because if they had... I would have given it 2 stars.<br /><br />Heck, after seeing this, I would have given 4 stars to see Owen Wilson & Eddie Murphy as Crockett & Tubbs.<br /><br />That being said, lets say that it is an original storyline and not based on a television series. MIAMI VICE is quite simply... boring and drab and a god awful waste of time. The two actors, most specifically Colin Farrell, are drawn down and deliver their lines like they are wasted out of their minds themselves. Maybe that explains why Farrell checked into rehab immediately after shooting?<br /><br />The first thing I look for in a film is a character that you can get into and actually WANT to spend the next 2 hours with... in this case, 2 hours and 20 minutes. This movie is completely void of this and I realized it within 20 minutes. I didn't register with the characters or the dilemmas. Not once in the entire film did Colin Farrell say a single line with any flair.<br /><br />This was a really bad miscalculation on the filmmakers behalves. Michael Mann has a great touch when it comes to giving us real drama and real crime, but in this case, it was too real and too boring.
B000GY729M|5.0|Every song on this album is amazing.  It is the best CD of 2006.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|As an avid West Wing fan I have been waiting for this product to come out for some time.  You can always get the individual season pack but having all in one place is an outstanding opportunity.  The series is nicely packed in   a sturdy portfolio with each season having its own \\"file\\".  The DVD's are safe and secure within the file.  A book with a synopsis of each episode is included along with the script for the pilot episode.  It would have been nice if each \\"file\\" has the episode names on them to make it easier to find that special eposide.  I uess all of them are special and that's why you should buy this complete series pack.

0060763280|1.0|The majority of the book is just an ad to come to the author's seminar, the rest can be summed up as follows: \\"Think positive.\\"  That is it!  Just don't think you are poor, think you are rich, and... yeah keep a notebook...yeah right.  Thinking positive is good advice for everyone, so just do it, and don't make yourself poorer by buying this book.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|I'm getting so sick of this Led Zeppelin fan two reviews below me slamming Dire Straits and Foreigner albums and rating them 1-star. I wish he can leave these wonderful bands alone and let him go listen to his lousy overrated Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones.  <br /> <br />Back to this now I think the song Skateaway is really,really wonderful and I think it is one of the finest songs ever written. <br />I also love Expresso Love too. Get this along with great albums from Metallica, Bon Jovi, Foreigner and ignore the previous reviewer and avoid the lousy bands that he recommends. Highly Recommended.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|It is a great movie, but not sure if it is because of the actual movie, or because this movie went mainstream.  One big comment is that it is sad we have to resort to straight actors to make it mainstream, and then remove any intimacy from the film which futhers certain stereotypes.  I don't mean porn style intimacy, but parts of the movie where a real gay couple snuggles, kisses, and behaves like any other couple.  Instead, we get a one spit in the hand quasi-rape sceen that makes everyone (gay/straight/bi/trans/other) cringe.  I wanted to take my mom to this movie, but the beating in the end just re-inforced what lots of mom's think that being gay results in being gay bashed.
B000002LR6|5.0|This album is the type that is so direct and truthful that it scares you. It certainly scared me as a teenager. It felt subversive it was subversive. I felt naughty in a good way while listening to it but didnt fully appreciate the album at the time despite knowing it was good. After all this album existed and competed in a world of U2 and REM and the beginning of whine rock. How could this be a representation of the truth certainly I would much rather live in the fuzzy world of REM or U2?   Yet today without question here we are in Ministry world. They saw what was in us and spat it back at us in all the glory that is Psalm 69. Some of their songs feel almost prophetic in todays world yes 'Hero' I'm talking to you. Far from being the drugged out losers many people believed them to be these guys were practicing their craft until their songs were as precise as a Swiss watch in marathon practice sessions. You can hear that precision on this album if you have ears for such things. Rammstein certainly would not have existed without Ministry and for that we can all say 'Danke' to Ministry.    The seminal album of the 1990's that blazed the trail for everyone of any note after them just like Sabbath did in the 70's. Forgive Ministry their sins, all hail Ministry godfathers of the modern age!
0618680004|3.0|Review of The God Delusion by Dr. Richard Dawkins <br /> <br />Richard Dawkins is brilliant, educated, credentialed, articulate and persuasive, and consequently so is his book \\"The God Delusion\\".  If you are an atheist looking for some scientific criticisms of the concept of God, this book is for you.  If you are a Christian, wondering what `they' have come up with lately, this book will also interest you.  On the other hand, if you are a seeker of truth - the \\"Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything\\" - there is little here of value. <br /> <br />Dawkins presents this book as a scientific work, written as a scientist.  Yet the domain of science is the natural world, not a supernatural one.  Science has nothing meaningful to say, now and for the foreseeable future, in the domain of theology.  A scientist would know this.  Still, to be fair, Dawkins was trained as a Zoologist who earned a D.Sc. (a curious scientific degree that seems to be left over from the Enlightenment), and his field is not constrained by the rigors of mathematics, as is physics, chemistry, cosmology, etc.  That's why some say it's not properly called a science at all; rather a craft.   I loved \\"The Selfish Gene\\", but now I find myself embarrassed for him.  <br /> <br />What little science there is in this book comes from the study of animals.  To Dawkins, man is merely an extremely sophisticated animal endowed only with more; more intelligence, more language, more tools, etc.  To those who believe in God, man is not merely an animal for he is endowed with a soul.  Dawkins may be right that we have no souls and are only animals, but this is not a scientific fact; it can't even become a valid scientific question.  In any event, knowledge of the animal kingdom can only take one so far when it's applied to humans. <br /> <br />Looking underneath Dawkins' pseudoscience, I found a pervasive sentiment; rebellion.  To be a Christian, I must acknowledge that I fall short of what's requiredof me by God; I am a sinner.  If I can't tolerate the idea of being a sinner, I have only 2 choices.  One, do no sin, which is difficult if not impossible.  Or, reject God and thereby reject the rules which label me a sinner.  Once there is no such thing as sin, there can be no sinner.  This is an atheist's freedom.  And their power?  Once there is no God, there can be no revelation, leaving it to the individual atheist to be the ultimate arbiter of right and wrong in the universe.  This is, of course, a violation of the 1st commandment:  `I am the Lord God.  Not you.'  Now that's a lot of freedom, and a lot of power; it's no wonder folks like Dawkins find atheism so seductive. <br />  <br />Intellectually, atheism is one answer to a perennial question; if not God, what?  There is no demonstrably correct answer to this question so it ends up as a matter of opinion, or perhaps choice.   <br /> <br />Historically, you won't find many atheistic cultures; they don't seem to last.  The few that have tried it barley made it a century or 2.  In Dawkins' terms, atheism seems to be selected against, and the route they take is pretty clear:  Since there is no God, there can be no `personal' afterlife, so the greatest possible evil to befall a person is death.  Once a society no longer holds values worth dying for, it's hard for its members to see why they should sacrifice anything at all.  And why should they?  In those utterly human moments when we ask, \\"Is this all there is?\\", the atheist's answer is \\"There is nothing more than you.  So yes, this is all there is.\\"  Not a very satisfying answer, is it? <br /> <br />Anyway, this book is a lucid presentation of Dawkins' beliefs, and as such is an excellent read.  Just don't expect too much enlightenment from it, and don't expect any science. <br />
B00001QEE8|3.0|I bought a better version of this on VHS.  I couldn't even play it on my computer DVD player.  I believe it was an import.<br /><br />But on a better note, this is one of my top two favorite Disney movies, next to Aladdin.  And the main reason this disappointed was the missing special feature.  It was a documentary about the creative process and this being Walts last movie.  He died during the making of.<br /><br />If you can buy one with better features, I HIGHLY recommend this film.<br /><br />Five stars for the film.  One star for this copy.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|Released several years before the original \\"Halloween\\", \\"When a Stranger Calls\\" and \\"Friday the 13th\\", this overlooked and under-rated horror film isn't as famous as its imitators but is superior in almost all aspects with the sole exception of Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\". Like \\"Halloween\\", this film has a low body count and is low on gore but offers loads of thrills, some spills and suspense.<br /><br />The story involves sorority sisters Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin, who are terrorized on Christmas Eve by a homicidal maniac. The killer has made his way inside the Sorority house (not a spoiler since this is shown in the first couple of minutes in the film) and takes refuge in the attic. By using their telephone, he manages to call the helpless victims and torture them mentally with some really nasty phone calls. The unsuspecting girls are unaware that the calls are coming from within the house and several of them fall victim to the caller's homicidal tendencies. Although we never get to see the lurking killer, we do get to hear him and his phone calls are grisly and excruciatingly chilling.<br /><br />\\"Black Christmas\\", in my opinion, is one of the best films of the genre. It's definitely one of the best \\"slasher\\" films and on the same level as the classic \\"Halloween\\". It offers good performances (Margot Kidder is especially delightful), a great cast (along with the 3 leading female stars, John Saxon and Keir Dullea also turn in good performances), loads of suspense and it moves along at a pretty good pace. Unlike the later less ingenious but gorier films of its kind, \\"Black Christmas\\" is executed so brilliantly that there is no need to throw in buckets of blood in order to shock and to make its point. You will be squirming with tension and fear as you see Hussey try to stay calm and collected as she listens to the vulgarly offensive ramblings of the insane caller. This is definitely one of those films that will have you saying \\"don't go in there!\\" or \\"hurry up and get out of there!\\". It is a shame that this clever little shocker went unnoticed for so many years considering that its light years ahead of the more famous films it inspired. \\"Black Christmas\\" is shocking, skillfully constructed and innovative (for it's time). It needs to be in every horror film fans DVD collection. Let's just hope the remake (which will be released shortly) doesn't manage to screw it up; highly recommended.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5.re!\\" or \\"hurry up and get out of there!\\".

B00005JLEX|4.0|Who would have believed that a show about nothing would someday become a classic to be ranked up there with shows such as \\"I Love Lucy,\\" \\"Leave It To Beaver,\\" or the \\"Brady Bunch.\\"  But that is exactly what Seinfeld has done.  After nine wonderful seasons, Seinfeld became a contemporary classic whose reruns are still high in the rankings.<br /><br />In this DVD featuring Seasons 1 & 2, we are introduced to the three of the four single New Yorks that we come to know and love:  Jerry, Kramer & George.  Later in the Season, after producers decided they needed a female character, we are introduced to the fourth Seinfeld friend, Elaine.<br /><br />In these first two seasons, Jerry's apartment looks bare compared to later seasons.  Kramer is bit more rough around the edges and George just hasn't quite got his \\"game\\" (funny) on at this time; but it's still well worth the watching so that you can see these characters grow.<br /><br />Just bare with this new show during these two seasons, and I can promise you'll become a Seinfeld fan for life!
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Unquestionably, a very good effort. I have not heard a more ferocious opening for an album (The Monster is Loose) since Welcome to the Jungle (in GNR's Appetite for Destruction). The mix is good, although a number of songs we have heard before. The only weak point of the album is the third version of \\"Its all coming back....\\", which pales in comparison to the original Pandora's Box version. The power ballad \\"Blind as a Bat\\" deserves special mention. There are a number of Jim Steinman songs which never sound old. Overall, the album has a cohesiveness, which I felt would not be retained with so many producers and songwriters.
B000GFRDN6|5.0|There's no way you could be a white 20 year old in 1976 (which I was) and not be somehow impacted by this album.  It was like aural wall paper.  In those days, there were those LPs that were just everywhere.  This certainly was one of them.  In fact, it took me quite some time to actually purchase the album because almost all the songs were being played on the radio (this was back in the days of AOR), and it seemed that ALL my friends had it.  It was actually TOO familiar.  After a couple of years, I finally added it to my personal collection. <br /> <br />It certainly is an artifact of its time, but there is also a timelessness about the album.  It's so well constructed, even synth parts that SHOULD sound dated hold up well.  The simplicity of the songs and beauty of the arrangements add to the classic appeal.  Also, there are no real duffers.  Every song impresses in some way, and the album actually covers a lot of stylistic ground, and covers it well.  At the time, I considered it perhaps too overtly \\"commercial\\" but hey, what did I know?  I know I'll never purchase the 30th anniversary edition of Foreigner 4, no offense intended. <br /> <br />It's very nice to have the 3 bonus tracks on the CD, and the DVD has a 5.1 mix of the original 12 track album as well as a nice 30 minute documentary.  As if that's not enough, it also includes a 2 hour concert filmed in 2005.  The band is very good, and the renditions are spot on.   <br />Some of the performances seem a bit flat, but it's probably hard to really get up for the 2000th performance of Rock'n'Me.  The bright spots are indeed that: guest spots for Carlos Reyes, who really shines, Buffalo Norton (OK, Norton is a full-fledged band member, but he really shines on his harp solos),etc.  Speaking of harp, the other kind, Reyes really opened my ears and eyes as to what can be done with the classical harp in a rock context.  The other guest spots (Thorogood, Satriani) don't impress as much, but still give a boost to the proceedings.  Anyway, it's nice to have a live Steve Miller concert in my library.  I must add, however, that it is NOT in 5.1 surround, although your player may say that it is.  My hunch is that it was recorded direct to 2-track digital, because it's absolutely stereo, even all the crowd noise is in the front speakers (and there's too much of it, IMO).  Also, the 5.1 mix of the album is only in Dolby, not DTS, and is not spectacular. <br /> <br />That about covers it.  I'm not dwelling on the negative, just mentioning it.  I'm very happy to have a very good remaster of the orginal LP and happy to have the bonus tracks.  The 5.1 mix may not be as great as it could be, but it's nice to have all the same, and it's really great to have ANY concert footage of Stevie, much less 2 hours of it. <br /> <br />Buy it and love it for what it is and what it has.
B00005JOLI|1.0|In order to trim the film to two and a half hours, much is left out. My guess is that they trimmed what would have added an hour to the running time because what they trimmed was so much worse than what they kept.    It's no surprise that Eragon feels like \\"The Lord of the Rings Lite\\", or \\"Star Wars Impaired\\", because that's what the book was. The screenwriters made no attempts, and neither did the director, to put a stamp of originality on this. That may be because they couldn't without drastically changing the events of the story. Like leaving Eragon's uncle out of the story, or Brom, or...well, perhaps even Eragon himself. (By the way, did anyone else expect to see a light saber every time Eragon flashed his sword around? I did.)    There's a certain amount of guilt that I feel for being so critical of a story written by such a young writer. But when he is asked, \\"What race from your books would you choose to be?\\", and he answers, \\"A dwarf, because their language and culture is so fascinating\\", it soothes that guilt. He honestly believes that the dwarves have a complete language and culture. Perhaps in his mind they do, and perhaps in the minds of so many teenagers who have never read *good* fantasy they do, but for anyone who has read *good* fantasy (LOTR, for example) this rings hollow. No writer (artist) who steals so openly from others and who had half a brain or a teaspoon of common sense would say things like that. And yes, there have been many other comments made by him, similarly narcissistic.    The acting wasn't half bad, but the dialogue (something that Paolini says is essential to make realistic) is horrid. It's also pulled nearly word by word from the text. I think that people seeing this film will have a better grasp of the weaknesses of the book, as visuals are often more striking than the written word.    How did so many good actors get caught up into this?? My only guess is that they never read the book, never read the criticism, and thought theywere going to \\"Ian McKellan-ize\\" themselves. Well...that didn't work.    I almost gave this movie two stars because of the special effects, but the special effects nearly mirrored those of The Lord of the Rings movies. The one aspect where they could have been original (this also includes the physical appearance of the various races), and they chose not to. I cannot imagine why. The director had to know that he was dealing with a thief (even if Paolini won't acknowledge this), and he could have done so much to make this original. Again, I can't imagine why he didn't. Even with the thievery of the book's plot and characters, an original film could have been made. Sadly, it was not.
B000AJJNPY|1.0|i should mention that agaetis byrjun wasnt my cup of tea either. i first was introduced into sigur ros with () which i enjoyed, but was completly blown away by the heavily atmospheric(& at times very abstract) von, which i can easily say is my favorite album from the band.<br /><br />the only ones i ever enjoyed were von,(),& the babatikidido ep because i absolutely loved what seemed like a great direction that they were heading in but after agaetis byrjun, i started to have my doubts.<br /><br />i'm sure alot of people will disagree simply because sigur ros became more recognized around agaetis byrjun (which is what i consider their first attemp at pop) than followed by takk, which just sounds like another radiohead rip-off. these two albums, i felt, were very different from the band's other albums, which were based on being very unconvential as opposed to their two late & so convential its mediocre albums. the lead singer's vocals progressed downward as well. in the earlier albums he used it more as another instrument instead of \\"singing\\" away from the band. his voice was alright on agaetis byrjun, perfect with (), but in takk it was hard to listen to combined altogether with the band, just not an enjoyable attempt on my part.<br /><br />if you are into agaetis byrjun than definately give this a listen, but if you prefer their less mediocre, more \\"out there\\" atmospheric music than definately check out von, sad to say, probably their least listen to album.
B00005JOLI|2.0|Should have been better, but the editing disrupted the flow of the story line. I have seen Lord of the Ring and this is no LOTR. Then again, it is better than the pitiful Dungeons and Dragons.
1400079179|5.0|I'm not a big reader but if you're into a little fiction (don't misconstrue, this is fiction) and an easy read, pick up this book. Very, very entertaining even for a non-reader like myself. The movie was awful though, don't waste your time watching it.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Criterion does DVDs right, plain and simple.  Never have I seen such respect and effort gone into the packaging and remastering of such worthy film titles.  Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is no exception.  The packinging is wonderful in itself, featuring simply wonderful designs, not to mention an entire booklet that contains seven essays (contributors include director Sidney Lumet) and an interview.  The movie itself?  Well, I don't think I have to prove this is one of the most influential and generally important movies ever made.  And because Criterion knows this, it has given this movie the respect it has been waiting for.  The movie looks the best it ever has looked, the sound remastered and crisp, and the movie in general has finally been shed of all of the dust a 50 year old movie can collect.  An important buy for any sophisticated film lover.  It's worth all forty-something dollars to have this movie.  Criterion applies a lot of effort into thier releases, and it's truly worth it.  Especially in cases such as these.
B0006399FS|5.0|This is a great rock album of which I do not tire listening to. Should be in everyone's collection.
0671799320|5.0|Simply, this is a book one simply must read in order to get up to speed on the history of oil in world history.  It affects the way we live, our prosperity, our technology, what we wear, what we eat, how we build our homes and work spaces, and even how and why we wage war.  The book covers the history from the time that oil was sopped up from surface pits, to the discovery of \\"rock oil\\" and its uses to make kerosene and cheaper lighting through the 1991 first Gulf War.<br /><br />It has always been a wild industry with big winners and big losers.  Huge risks have paid big off handsomely and even more often have handed out ruin.  Those building and running the industry have gone to the ends of the earth and down to its depths to acquire the crude that is made into so much of who we are today.<br /><br />Yergin handles this big canvas well.  He writes even handedly about the development of the industry and its geo-political implications.  For example, the decision to move ships from coal to oil in World War I had huge implications and added much to British Naval Power.  We all know how the issues of oil and the Middle-East and Israel are all mixed together in a dangerous balancing act that has been used by a few for their own ends rather than trying to find a path to peace.<br /><br />This is an excellent book and one that I think essential to one's understanding of the world we inhabit.  Please get a copy and enjoy all it has to offer.  The book is about 775 pages with another couple of hundred pages of notes, index, and a three page chronology of major events in the history of oil from 1853 to 1991.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|I was pleasantly suprised with this movie.  I was thinking that this movie was going to be like all of the other King Kong remakes. I was wrong. I liked this movie out of all of them. It told about Kong more in the jungle and relating also protecting his \\"captor\\" rather than the killing of Kong in the city. With that being said, it is a much longer movie and it does drag in some places, but is well worth a watch. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a good remake of an orginal movie.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had not seen Firefly before watching this movie, so I was unprepared for the crazy setting - an outlaw western version of space.  I say crazy because before seeing the movie I would not have believed it possible to pull of such a scenario, but it worked very well.  The plot itself was very good, and overall the movie was very entertaining but the most impressive aspect to me was simply the new and different take on space.  Not having seen the TV shows, the characters did not mean much to me and I did not follow all of the  subtleties of their interactions.  I did later watch the Firefly series and then rewatch Serenity, that time around it was far more dramatic.  Though still well worth watching without seeing Firefly.
B00005JPDS|2.0|\\"You're a good poppa\\", Christopher (Jaden Smith, son of Will & Jada Smith) says to his father, Chris Gardner (Will Smith). Yeeeoooowwwccchhhh! Excuse me for a moment; I need to inject some insulin before the diabetic shock from the treacle dialogue takes hold.<br /><br />Okay, thanks for holding on. I'm all better.<br /><br />Well, I'm sure to get some negative hits at Amazon, after I post this review, but here it goes...<br /><br />Chris Gardner (Smith), the struggling father of a small boy, Christopher (Smith), struggles to sell pieces of medical equipment no doctor seems to want, struggles to get his kid to a third rate, but cheap daycare, and struggles to maintain a home with his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), who works double shifts in a hotel laundry. He just struggles. Chris eventually loses one of the medical devices and this is the last straw for Linda, who walks out. Unable to pay the rent, Chris and his son are evicted and they move into a seedy motel in the Mission district of San Francisco. Chris watches a man park his expensive car at the curb and learns the man is a stockbroker at Dean Witter. Hounding the head of personnel, Jay Twistle (Brian Howe), Chris eventually wins an interview and soon lands an internship with the prestigious brokerage. An unpaid internship. While he works through the competitive internship, Chris sets out to sell the remaining medical devices, to support him and his son, providing their only source of income. Only one in the class of twenty will be hired so it's a struggle. As Chris tries to keep his son safe and fed, he studies his manual, tries to sell the machines, and tries to impress his bosses. Will Chris Gardner be able to overcome the struggle?<br /><br />\\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" (yes, I know Microsoft, it is misspelled), directed by Gabriele Muccino, starring Will Smith and his real son, Jaden, is \\"inspired by\\" the real story of Chris Gardner.<br /><br />\\"Happyness\\" is the perfect film for this time of year. Designed to provide a brief respite for all of the mall shoppers, give them a bit of fluff, between checkout lines at the Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch, and give them a little inspiration before they trudge out to deal with the next store employee who has had one too many customers like you today. I'm sure some people will be moved and some people will be inspired, it is difficult to not be moved when Gardner finally gets the job at Dean Witter. Oh, I'm not spoiling anything. Even if you didn't already know this, they would never make a film about someone who didn't get the job. That is what the film is about, persevering beyond the struggles. Maybe you'll come out of the film with that extra little oomph in your step, ready to face your own struggles with holiday woes.<br /><br />But \\"Happyness\\" is so much more than a little piece of fluff. It is a very calculated move by Smith to get an Oscar nomination. If he tells you otherwise, he is lying. Smith is a movie star and commands a top salary for every film. He can open any film, good or bad, because he has legions of fans willing to pay to see any film he is in. Heck, he can open \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\", making it the number one film for the weekend. But he, like every actor, isn't content with simply appearing in box office fluff. Right before this film, there was a trailer for Adam Sandler's next film \\"Reign Over Me\\", in which he plays a depressed widower who meets up with an old college chum (Don Cheadle). Sandler and Smith are remarkably similar. If Sandler appears in a silly comedy, the film is box office gold. If Smith appears in a sci fi comedy or an action film, box office gold. But both want respectability and the way to achieve that is to make films like \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" and \\"Reign Over Me\\". These films show they can act, become something other than their popular on screen persona. Sandler has been dipping his toes in this pool for a while, making films like \\"Punch Drunk Love\\" and \\"Spanglish\\" along with his more sophomoric comedies.<br /><br />So, going in, we already know the outcome of \\"Happyness\\", which means there is no suspense. The only point in watching the film is to watch the struggle. And Gardner struggles. No doubt about that. As the voice over narration states, he signs over his life savings to buy these machines, the medical devices no doctor seems to want. He loses his car, because he has a problem with parking tickets, so he has to carry them all over the Bay Area. He has to make sure he can pick up his son on time. He has to count every penny, to make sure he can feed his son. And more. When the money starts to run out, they are kicked out of their apartment. Then the slide downward continues.<br /><br />But Chris can't let this affect him, as it would most. He has a son to look after. So he signs up for the internship. As he deals with all of these other problems, he also has to study and learn all about his new job. \\"Pursuit\\" piles on the challenges and the few moments Chris is able to spend with his young son are filled with moments of \\"divine insight\\". Chris imparts one helpful comment after another, determined his son will not suffer the same mistakes he has made. \\"Don't let anyone tell you you can't do something.\\"<br /><br />The problem with \\"Pursuit\\" is two-fold. Because there is not suspense about whether he will get the job, we must be content with the depiction of the struggle. And how he struggles. One obstacle after another is thrown at him. This presents the second problem. Chris Gardner is so saintly, his character has no evolution or change at all. He starts out a good father and ends the film as a good father. He is a saint and the film knows it. At one point, when Chris and Christopher are sleeping in a homeless shelter run by a church, `poppa' moves to a darkened corner to work on his last medical device; the device is broken and he needs to fix it before he can sell it. When he manages to fix it, a brilliant white light emanates from the machine and the film moves away to a long shot, to show the light emanating from Chris' center, the center of his very being. If you look at the poster for this film, you may notice that a light obscures where Smith is holding his son's hand. Chris is a martyr who will do anything for the betterment of his son's life.<br /><br />Every year, a number of fine actors and actresses are nominated for an Academy Award. If you do a survey, you will find that an inordinate amount of these nominations went to actors who portray handicapped people of one type or another. And a large number of winners have played these roles. It also helps if a pretty or handsome actor takes on the role, to `show their range'. In \\"Pursuit\\", Chris Gardner has a handicap of sorts; a phenomenal lack of good decision making skills. From marrying Linda and having a son with her, to spending his life savings on the medical devices, from asking a hippie to safeguard one of the machines while he has an interview, to chasing a homeless man through BART to retrieve one of those heavy medical devices, Chris never makes the right decision. Yet, he perseveres. And the moment when Chris gets the job with Dean Witter is an emotional one. Maybe Smith does deserve a nomination for making this performance work.<br /><br />\\"Pursuit\\" doesn't seem to believe anyone has more than one facet to their character. Chris is good. Linda is bad. Thandie Newton's Linda does nothing but complain, act sullen, put out and annoyed, grudgingly kissing her son and husband. Believe me, she has every right to be this way, but because Chris is so saintly, we look at Linda as a shrew. She has to work two shifts? Look at how this man has struggled to sell these machines all over the Bay Area, lugging the heavy machines on multiple buses and through crowded BART trains. How dare she complain, even though Chris created the problem by not paying his parking tickets. When she walks out, the film wants us to have no sympathy forher, Chris is the saint in this picture and he must have the sympathy.<br /><br />All of the people who Chris comes into contact with are either good or meant to provide comic relief. He has an encounter with a hippy and another with a crazy homeless man, but all of the partners at Dean Witter are supportive and encouraging. Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer and many other characters on \\"The Simpsons\\") plays Alan Frakesh, the office manager who runs the intern training program. Chris becomes his errand boy and Alan unknowingly threatens some of the deals Chris is working on. But this character goes nowhere. Because he `unknowingly' threatens these deals, he is still `good'. And he doesn't provide enough comic relief to make the role interesting.<br /><br />Jaden Smith is okay as Christopher. He's no Tatum O'Neal, but he's not as precocious as some child actors. Most of his scenes require him to do little more than display one emotion, and he does this well. In some, he is mopey, in others, happy. Hopefully, his adult life won't mirror the daughter of Ryan O'Neal's either.<br /><br />\\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is meant to be an inspiring holiday tale, designed to move people to tears as they watch Chris Gardner's struggle. But it is such a calculated piece of filmmaking that it was difficult for me to watch. It doesn't help that many of the moments between Chris and Christopher are punctuated by dialogue that seems ingested from every single self help book ever written. Hopefully, Dr. Phil is getting a royalty.<br /><br />I cry when I watch \\"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\\" and \\"Pursuit\\" didn't move me that much.hite light emanates from the machine and the film moves away to a long shot, to show the light emanating from Chris' center, the center of his very being.

Hopefully, his adult life won't mirror the daughter of Ryan O'Neal's either. <br /> <br />\\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is meant to be an inspiring holiday tale, designed to move people to tears as they watch Chris Gardner's struggle. But it is such a calculated piece of filmmaking that it was difficult for me to watch. It doesn't help that many of the moments between Chris and Christopher are punctuated by dialogue that seems ingested from every single self help book ever written. Hopefully, Dr. Phil is getting a royalty. <br /> <br />I cry when I watch \\"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\\" and \\"Pursuit\\" didn't move me that much. <br />

B00005JPE7|5.0|Just got back from seeing this movie with my wife.  It was the first movie I'd gone to the theater to see in years.  I've watched all of the previous Rocky movies and enjoyed them all.  This one was no different.  I think they did a good job of not trying to be so serious about everything.  After the movie was over my wife said \\"Eh, it was a Rocky movie.\\"  I guess that's how most people who aren't \\"Rocky fans\\" would rate it.  I really enjoyed the movie and will get the DVD when it comes out and watch it again.  Makes me want to go hop on the treadmill and start lifting some weights.  You know, developing some \\"hurtin' bombs.\\"  I doubt the movie will win any awards but am still glad I went to see it.  Rocky!  Rocky!  Rocky!

B0009WXGGE|5.0|Who'd have thought it? The same three cartoonish clowns that titled an album \\"Dookie\\" and sang about \\"Pinhead Gunpowder\\" may have the best album of 2004 on the table with \\"American Idiot.\\" Green Day suddenly abandons three minute two chord blasters and writes a play in 13 acts. Maybe they decided it was time to show upstart kiddy punkers like Blink, Sum or Avril exactly just how it's done.<br /><br />All right, I'll admit the \\"cartoonish clowns\\" comment might be over the top. After all, I believe the lyric \\"Do you have the time to listen to me whine about nothing and everything all at once\\" is one of the most brilliant opening lines to a 90's song. That was almost 15 years ago, and some maturity had to creep in somewhere. Politics would come into play as well, and the title track suddenly ditches the old backdrops of mental wards and tweaking binges to shout at the \\"subliminal mind-fk America.\\"<br /><br />As soon as that rant ends, we are thrown into the twin tales of \\"St Jimmy\\" aka \\"The Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and his battle with his dual personalities. There are plenty of the usual three chord havoc bangers here, but more sophisticated arrangements appear in \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" and the ballad \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams.\\" The suites of \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are the best \\"Punk Opera\\" concept pieces since the mighty Husker Du roared forth with \\"Zen Arcade.\\" Like that classic album, Green Day are out to prove that there is more to the world of punk than the preconceived notions and spiky haircuts.<br /><br />For those still longing for \\"Kerplunk\\" etc, those albums are almost twenty years old. Get over yourselves, the band is grown both artistically and physically since then. They probably identify with the stuck in the past girlfriend who writes Jimmy (in \\"Letterbomb\\") \\"Where have all the b@s#ards gone, where have all the riots gone\\" just before she walks out on him. For Green Day and Jimmy/Jesus, like the great lot of us, the mohawk cut disappeared when the bald spot became more prominent. But that doesn't mean the Green Day creative brain fell out along with hair. They haven't caved into recording an album of standards, and that is something to be thankful for. Add on that Green Day has managed to crank out an album as diverse and powerful as \\"American Idiot\\" without abandoning much of what made them originally great (and Billie Jo just seems to sing better with every album) is cause for celebration.ed when the bald spot became more prominent.

B00005JPE7|5.0|I just came from the opening showing of the film and a suprisingly packed house for a noon viewing!  I really enjoyed the film and the story...as well as Stallone's brilliant dialog.  This was the Rocky character we all fell in love with 30 years ago....and I really appreciated all the references to the history of the character and particularly the first installment. A very good bookend to the first ROCKY...I don't want to spoil it for others by discussing plotlines...just encourage fans of the first,  in particular, to get off their butts and to the theatre....it would be good for this to succeed and shut up all the big mouths and naysayers who want this character to go away.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|it can get old in a way.<br /><br />The new direction of this is the mix of music and another means of seeing/hearing the mixers view of what THEY like about their best memories of the Beatles:  albeit, it's a very neat experience and I liked playing it many times in the beginning.<br /><br />You will find this album is not a true, go-to-track-# play.  It's to be played entirely from start to finish in that is the experience.  Almost, like the composer is dialing a juke box of memories in their head and settling on a few 'better' memoried tunes.  The mixer [I call this person a mixer] allows some songs to just stand, as they did originally, on their own as you remember...BUT, sometimes, just a little, will s-l-o-w it down a quarter measure and you get a different feeling.  Some songs are truely redone entirely different, like Octopuss' Garden and Johns merging of Blue Bird with other almost pure non-electric/accustic renditions he did for trial...that's worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I don't rate this higher than 3 stars, because after you get it, it really is just like watching a good movie too much in a row....it gets old.  Sorry, but it will have to sit on the shelf for awhile before I plug it in again...HOWEVER, one or two songs [now I violate the track 1-finish rule] are worth hunting out....

0156029065|4.0|I admit that the first time I read Umberto Eco's fourth novel, I felt a little disappointed. The novel starts with the sacking of Constantinople by the crusaders in 1204 and then goes back a few years in time to tell the story of Baudolino, an italian peasant in Alessandria (Eco's hometown) who has managed, through good luck and his own special charms, to become the adopted son of the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa. In the course of his picaresque tale, the novel manages to touch on nearly every major theme of the Middle Ages: the Crusades; the troubadours; the legend of the Holy Grail; the rise of the cathedral cities; the position of Jews; the market in relics; the life at Europe's first universities, the rivalries between Italian cities that made impossible the existence of a national government for many centuries, and the perennial power struggles between the pope and the emperor. The problem I have in my first reading of the book, is that halfways through the story, after Baudolino and his ragtag band goes to the Crusades, they then decide to instead go and visit the legendary Prester John, the fictional Christian King of the East. From there, things become stranger and stranger. My problem was that I didn't bought the transition between the realistic first part of the book and the wholly fantastic second part. They are two books in one, both fascinating on their own right but the melding between the two seemed imperfect to me at the time. But the novel grew eventually on my memory, and I now considered it a very worthy book (certainly better than The Island of the Day Before, though some notches below The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum).
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Trufully this is movie deserved 2 1/2 stars, but I felt to give it the benefit of the doubt, becasue it somewhat followed what it intened to be. This movie was pretty bad, but I don't think it was worth only one star, like many reviewers have given. The thing with this movie was that the acting was bad by Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell, as if there was no effort at all. Also the screenplay was bad. About an hour into the movie, I was under the impression that they just wanted to make a movie just because it was a televison series at first and attract people's interst, or as if the screen writers never watched the series at all. I seriously hope it was the first reason I stated. The beginning of the movie is real slow, almost no action at all. But it does give us some towards the last 45 minutes or so. I recommend that you rent this movie before you decide to buy it, or if you have a common bootleg man, you might want to hit him up for this one. Peace!

B0006399FS|3.0|This album is above average at best. As an album, it lacks the raw creative energy of Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and Pop. The previous album ATYCLB was a load of mediocrity(the only U2 album I did'nt keep), and it was disappointing to see the band release such material. On the bright side, HTDAAB certainly puts U2 back in the business of making solid music. Having said that, the album as a whole does not really offer anything new for the most part. While there are a few solid songs like 'Miracle Drug', 'Original of the Species', 'Sometimes You can't Make it on Your Own' and 'A Man and a Woman', the last one mentioned is probably the only song on the album that offers something fresh. Importantly, even some of these better songs have a 'neatly crafted' flavor, and lack the raw energy and creative genius of U2. I hope the band will devote more time to the next album, and not be afraid to push the envelope as they did with Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and Pop.

B000H7JD4A|5.0|For me, this was not supposed to be Iron Maiden's year. In a busy year shaped by my interest in the lighter musical contributions of Elvis Presley, Gordon Lightfoot and Al Green among others, there was not much room for the Heavy Metal stylings of one of my favorite bands. Could I fit them onto the dance card after 2003's lukewarm Dance of Death?<br /><br />I bought the album on its release day out of loyalty and obligation, not genuine enthusiasm. But these guys were *the* seminal Heavy Metal group, whose stretch of classic albums during the 80s was all but unequalled. They deserved a listen.<br /><br />Oh Me of Little Faith.<br /><br />The first thing that grabbed me was the excellent production. The mix was crystal clear, as it always seems to be from producer Kevin Shirley. The snare drum and cymbals were crisp. The bass guitar is mixed nicely and \\"visible\\" on every track. The guitars have the perfect tone I look for in heavy metal, melodic without a ton of distortion. And vocals are clear and mixed in the forefront of every track as they should be.<br /><br />All of this means nothing if the songs are sub-par. And for me, this might the strongest set of songs Maiden has put together in years. It's hard to believe how good this material sounds, how relevant and inspiring. The album starts with the punchy rocker \\"Different World\\" and builds from there. Maiden builds songs on an epic scale, and long-time fans should be familiar with their successful formula. What was tedium on Dance of Death becomes everything that was ever great about Iron Maiden on this release. \\"Out of the Shadows\\" takes me back to Piece of Mind era writing. \\"Lord of Light\\" has a tremendous, classic Maiden gallop. \\"Benjamin Breeg\\" is a high point. And the highlight of the whole enterprise for me is \\"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\\". Bruce Dickinson and the band out-do themselves on this piece.<br /><br />Grand songwriting. Catchy choruses. Compelling lyrics. This is music for Adventurers. I find the \\"progressive\\" label for this CD an odd one as it is solidly based in the sturm and drang of classic Heavy Metal.<br /><br />I took this CD on a flight to the Philippines in October. I'll always remember landing in Japan, watching the dreamlike clouds and the landscape below while Bruce sang the lines \\"Far away from the land of our birth...\\" while I rode in the dark twilight between dawn and morning.

0446310786|5.0|Jack Lewandowski <br /> <br />To Kill a Mockingbird Review <br /> <br /> Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a story that symbolizes life in southern Alabama in the early 1930's during a time of the Great Depression but also time of racism. <br /> The story is told in the perspective of an eight year old girl named Scout Finch. She discusses her views on a very important topic, racism. Scout is a curious girl who along with her brother, Jem, is fixated on her neighbor, Boo Radley. Boo is a strange man who has spent almost all of his life inside his house and never comes outdoors. Scout unsuccessfully tries to meet Boo Radley many times. <br /> Atticus Finch, Scout's father, represents moral values and justice in this story. Atticus is chosen to defend Tom Robinson, a black man, in a trial where Tom was accused of raping a white woman. Atticus does what is right and accepts this challenge and puts his whole heart into this case. He knew it would be very hard for him to persuade an all white jury not to convict this black man of rape, but he does not let this stop him. This appeal was not just a simple rape trial it exemplified racism in the world of the 1930's. Atticus does more than expected, he tries not only to win his case but break a barrier between whites and blacks. <br /> This is a timeless novel that will always be viewed as one of the greatest story ever written. It symbolized hope for many and also symbolized an end to world of racism. <br />
0486650677|5.0|If you ask 10 PhD scientists: \\"Why is Schrodinger's Equation complex?\\" (contains the square-root of minus one), 9 out of 10 won't be able to give you the correct answer.    It has little to do with taking the root of negative numbers. After reading Lanczos you will know it has do with \\"space\\" and what is a proper physical law. (Now you have to read the book to parse this sentence. Good.)    This is one of many wonderful insights Lanczos provides; with humor, wonder and crystal clarity. This is not a 'text book' on mechanics, you will get more out of it if you are familiar with the subject. He gives you understanding, not technique.    It is as if you can hum a few tunes. Reading Lanczos is experiencing the entire opera for the first time. Now you know the full story, how each aria is a part of the fabric; how each fits in the situation, the motivation behind it. The tunes you liked become richer, more profound, they are connected. The next time you sing you fancy you are a Caruso, a Puccini.    It is so rare to encounter a master who is also a gifted writer.      Some reviewers compare Lanczos to Feynman's Lectures, I agree partly.  Lanczos is more literate and much more humble. Feynman is so busy being the genius from Brooklyn that his exposition is choppy and uneven.  Lanczos is a better organizer and writer.

B000J10EQU|2.0|Bryan Singer would have done better completing the \\"X\\" trilogy. Seriously miscast and inconsitent in tone. Williams' score and the slavish main titles, several of which are virtually unreadible, should have been jettisoned. The music certainly doesn't fit with John Ottman's new notes (Ken Thorne did a better job integrating Williams in SII). But, this is symptomatic of the schizophrenia of this attempt. When we learn that Lois has won The Pulitzer (for a single editorial, yet), my jaw dropped. Was this meant to be satirical, reflecting the diminished standards in all aspects of modern life? Lois was always ambitious and agressive, but was she ever meant to be taken seriously as a journalist? J.P. must be rolling. By the way, I agree with the guy who felt Parker Posey would have been the right choice for Lois.
B00005JOLI|3.0|The genre of fantasy has always been a shaky area as far as cinema is concerned.  While there were have been some truly magical (or at least entertaining) efforts such as WILLOW, CONAN THE BARBARIAN, THE DARK CRYSTAL, and THE PRINCESS BRIDE (I apologize if I forgot to mention anything else), audiences have been mostly treated to trashy dreck such as THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER, DEATHSTALKER, and the DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS movie.  It wasn't until recently with the phenomenally successful theatrical releases of HARRY POTTER, the LORD OF THE RINGS, and THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA that fantasy in cinema really seemed to find its peak.  Now it seems as though other studios are trying to get on the fantasy wave.<br /><br />This is certainly true of the newly released ERAGON, which, as with HP, LOTR, and CoN, is based on a popular (although not necessarily legendary) book trilogy called \\"Inheritence\\".  Interestingly, the story was penned by a seventeen-year-old named Christopher Paolini, and this movie is based on the first book of his series.  Unfortunately, audiences expecting the movie of ERAGON to be in the same caliber as HARRY POTTER, LOTR, or NARNIA, are bound to be disappointed, for, while the movie shows potential in many areas, it does not come anywhere near close to excellence.<br /><br />Not having read the books at all, I cannot remark on what changes have been made from the source material, so I won't make any comments about that.  It has been declared, however, that the story--in which a young farm boy discovers a magical stone which turns out to be a dragon's egg, and, with the aid of an old sage and his talking dragon, aspires to overthrow a medieval tyrant and his court wizard--is a rip-off of STAR WARS and THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  Yet one can make the same argument about fantasy tales in general--as a huge fan of the genre I recognize that no tale is totally, 100-percent original (I could go on with comparisons on how the aforementioned HP, LOTR, and CoN all share similarities, but that's irrelevant); what ultimately matters is whether the end result is good or bad.<br /><br />For the most part, newcomer director Stefan Fangmeier handles the all-too familiar material fairly well.  The movie is highlighted by beautiful cinematography, and there are many breathtaking panoramic helicopter shots and intricate production design sets that bring a fun, but underdeveloped fantasy world to life.  Patrick Doyle's impressively grand music is also a plus--very epic in style and scope.  As one might expect from a fantasy movie, ERAGON is loaded with special effects, and the majority of them are spectacular.  Particularly noteworthy is the hero's dragon companion, an impressive beast named Saphira.  As with DRAGONHEART, this purple-scaled giant--fully realized by computer-generated-imagery and a gentle, edgy voice supplied by Rachel Weisz--is the central attraction of the movie.<br /><br />Not that there aren't any good performances from the human cast in ERAGON.  Jeremy Irons (who unfortunately portrayed an oh-so-over-the-top villain in the ill-fated DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS movie) is excellent as the old sagely figure, Brom, (a sort of Obi-Wan Kenobi type character) bringing both a dramatic presence and credibility to a role that would otherwise come across as cardboard cut-out.  (And for those of you who dreaded him in DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, he doesn't overact here.)  Just as good is Robert Carlyle as the evil wizard, Durza, a dead-on impersonation of Brad Dourif's Wormtongue in LORD OF THE RINGS.<br /><br />The film moves along at a breezy pace and is never boring--except this also proves to be one of ERAGON'S major faults.  Through the movie's 98 minutes, the tangled plot comes across as very rushed; characters like a princess and a Han Solo-like rogue figure jump out of nowhere, and, as such, come across as superfluous and uninteresting.  An extra thirty minutes worth of character building wouldn't have hurt.  I also felt that Saphira's growth from a cuddlesome baby to a magnificent beast happened too quickly, even for a fantasy story.<br /><br />My other quibbles:  newcomer Edward Speleers as young hero Eragon sticks out like a sore thumb.  When he's thrust into action sequences, Speleers is decent, but for the majority of the movie he comes across as flat and emotionless (although not as much as, say, Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker in STAR WARS EPISODE II).  Furthermore, John Malkovich as the real bad guy only shows up for scanty scenes, and consequently, his character never develops into anything.  Because of this, I was unable to evaluate his acting to get enough of an opinion about his overall performance.<br /><br />As mentioned, it is probably unrealistic to expect every fantasy story to be totally original, and the occasional nods to STAR WARS (the hero's uncle is killed by an enemy attack, and later Brom meets a similar fate) and LORD OF THE RINGS (Durza looking down at an army of stripped-down orc imitations) don't really pose much problem.  But the script doesn't do much to make the entire adventure fully satisfying for a more demanding audience. These flaws bring ERAGON down from its potential as a worthy new franchise and turn it into a fun but uninspired and too rapidly paced action flick.<br /><br />In short, ERAGON is passable although not stellar--certainly more watchable than most sword-swinging dreck, but weaker than its more superior counterparts.  The movie promotes itself as the beginning of a trilogy, and it ends with the promise of a sequel to come.  I look forward to the next movie, but I also hope it will be something better.  If ERAGON or its future installments hope to achieve its promise, it needs to improve on its failings.  That would make this tale more than just \\"watchable.\\"at Saphira's growth from a cuddlesome baby to a magnificent beast happened too quickly, even for a fantasy story. <br /> <br />My other quibbles:  newcomer Edward Speleers as young hero Eragon sticks out like a sore thumb.

B00003XAVA|5.0|Originally released in September of 1975, \\"Wind on the Water\\" is the second proper album from the duo pairing of David Crosby and Graham Nash, and quite simply, it's a must-have.    You haven't truly lived if you haven't experienced the soaring beauty of Crosby's looping, aptly-titled \\"Bittersweet\\", and the dreamy contemplation of his \\"Homeward Through The Haze\\".  Likewise, Nash's waltzing \\"Mama Lion\\" has striking lyrical imagery and an incredibly powerful buildup, with searingly emotional slide guitar from the extraordinary David Lindley.  The album's ultimate 'forgotten gem', in that it doesn't appear on the \\"CSN\\" box set, and seems to have never been performed live by these guys (if it has, then just barely), is Nash's spellbindingly powerful and defiant anthem \\"Love Work Out\\"--Jackson Browne is credited for \\"other vocals\\" on it, and it features some of the richest vocal harmonies you could imagine, and the guitar interplay between Lindley and Danny Kortchmar is again extraordinary; CSN&Y should have seriously considered resurrecting this timeless inspirational gem for their 2006 Freedom of Speech tour, and hey, it'd have given Stills and Young a perfect vehicle for one of their guitar duels.  Fittingly, Lindley brings out the fiddle, to excellent effect, for \\"Cowboy of Dreams\\", an excellent 3/4 country-western song that Nash claims to have written about Neil Young--heard today, the chorus sounds like a sly jab at those who are willing to go along with Young no matter what musical detour he chooses.  \\"Naked In The Rain\\" is the first time Crosby and Nash shared a writing credit on a single song--it has a blissful, sun-kissed feel to it, with its blend of acoustic guitars, Craig Doerge's modulated electric piano, and Kortchmar's 'raining' electric guitar flourishes.  Nash's protest number \\"Fieldworker\\" suffers from a somewhat lackluster execution, but it's still strong.  Other great songs include Nash's angry \\"Take The Money And Run\\" and Crosby's dynamic, incredibly crafty \\"Low Down Payment\\".  James Taylor is featured on at least two songs--Crosby's uplifting \\"Carry Me\\" (where he sings about a visit to his dying mother) and Nash's title song (a cautionary tale about the killing off of whales); it also sounds like Taylor playing acoustic guitar on \\"Bittersweet\\", although he is not credited (furthermore, no one at all is credited for playing acoustic guitar on it, although it's clearly audible, which just makes me all the more certain it's Taylor).  Crosby's \\"Critical Mass\\", which serves as an intro to the title song, is magnificently arranged, bafflingly sophisticated, and beautiful--it's an a capella piece sung entirely by Crosby & Nash until the orchestra kicks in at the end; seemingly an outtake from Crosby's first solo album, it's kind of mind-blowing that Crosby's vocal parts had been recorded over 4 years before Nash got around to adding his.    As the liner notes for this 2000 reissue indicate, Crosby and Nash themselves hold this album in very high regard, and had incredibly good feelings about it as they were recording it.  Indeed, with so much sumptuous, emotionally-wrenching material, \\"Wind on the Water\\" should be an indispensible part of any serious music lover's collection.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I have great respect for Bob Dylan's body of work but I admit I've never been a fan of his nasally voice.  However, my 28 year old son recommended this CD so highly I had to pick up a copy. <br /> <br />IMHO, the first 5 songs are some of the best work Dylan has ever done.  Dylan's voice is getting better with age and, as others have pointed out, there is an unmistakable spiritual essence to many of his songs. <br /> <br />This album is a classic!  From beginning to end it's the best album I've heard in a long time.
0743289412|4.0|Ok, I have to admit that I've been kind of disappointed in Stephen King lately. So I was a little hesitant when Lisey's Story came out. But, of course, I HAD to buy it and read it!  <br />I liked it! It is definitely different. I like the character of Lisey, strong and passionate, in love with her husband and going through the grieving process. It took me at least the first hundred pages to get an understanding on what was going on. The story runs smoothly, it is not contorted but you don't immediately understand where King is going.  <br />And I like that! <br />The downside: for me it was the use of made up words, but they didn't make the book hard to read.

1594200696|5.0|This guide is an absolute must for the PhD student getting ready to write a dissertation.  The whole process of writing will go much easier knowing the \\"elementary rules of usage\\".  What more can I say, this is a critical guide that have.
B0002ZMITY|1.0|Im a big fan of the HBO series and this movie is nothing like it.I didnt laugh once.If your expecting this movie to be the least bit funny you will be wrong.I dont know why or how someone so funny could make a movie so bad.Stick to the series.
B00005JPE7|4.0|To put things in perspective, when the original \\"Rocky\\" came out, my wife was still three years away from being born.  That's 30 years Stallone has been playing this Rocky Balboa.  I grew up with the first two films on endless TV reruns and saw the later ones in the theater.  My nostalgia-fueled anticipation for tonight's premiere was akin to the thrill I felt for the final \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie, or for \\"Superman Returns\\", or even for the misbegotten Chronicles of Narnia movie last year.  Literally I've been waiting decades to see this movie.  \\"Rocky V\\" bombed when I was still in high school and I was hoping Rocky would get one last chance to knock out evil boxers with ridiculous ring nicknames. <br /> <br />My advice is that you'll need to see this movie in a packed theater, as I did.  I can't imagine it would have the same effect on the small screen when you're alone with a much smaller crowd.  In many ways, the best part of this film was the spontaneous call-and-response from the audience I was with, two storeys beneath 3rd Avenue.  People shouted famous \\"Rocky\\" catchphrases at the screen seconds before the famous fanfare started playing.  \\"I pity the fool!\\", \\"I will break you!\\", \\"If he dies, he dies!\\", and, of course, \\"Mickey!!\\" <br /> <br />Once all the pre-movie nostalgia was out of the way... it was time for more nostalgia.  Wisely or not, Stallone (who wrote and directed) soaked the first half of the script in nostalgia so deep for the first, small-scale \\"Rocky\\", that significant screen time was devoted to characters who hadn't appeared since the original's second reel.  I had to explain to my wife who Spider Rico was, and why Rocky needed him in his inner circle by the end of the movie.  Also great to see the return Duke, Apollo Creed's old trainer, although most of Tony Burton's lines appear to have been looped in post-production. <br /> <br />The main problem with \\"Rocky Balboa\\" early on is Stallone's concept of dialogue.  Just about every character in this movie delivers a loud speech about motivation and glory and drive and passion.  Rocky's defense of his application for a boxing permit to the State athletic commission (after 20 years of retirement) is particularly ludicrous, although Stallone must think it's going to cap off the montage for his Lifetime Achievement Oscar. <br /> <br />Once the nostalgia and flashbacks clears out and the plot settles in, the film picks up steam.  Antonio Tarver does a decent job as Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon, the brazen young champ at odds with the boxing establishment.  Dixon never really becomes a villain in this movie -- he even has a Rocky/Mickey relationship with his own trainer. <br /> <br />Also welcome are the numerous cable TV personality cameos.  Everyone from ESPN's Brian Kenny to ESPN Classic's Bert Randolph Sugar to the entire HBO fight team (Merchant and Lampley and I, Max) chips in; too bad Jim Rome got left on the cutting room floor.  The only thing missing from the celebrity bandwagon was Randy and Jason Sklar doing \\"Cheap Seats\\" commentary over the Rocky vs. Thunderlips celebrity boxing/wrestling match.  Maybe in a deleted scene on DVD? <br /> <br />In the end, \\"Rocky Balboa\\"'s a fun nostalgia trip that echoes the original in tone and sentiment, and even has a similar bittersweet finale.  This is never going to become a TNT rerun classic like \\"Rocky III\\" and probably has no catchphrases of its own, but if Rocky's been one of your movie heroes since the 1970s, check him out one last time.
B000GRUS22|2.0|I've been an Enigma fan since about '94.  I was an instant fan of the first four and would typically listen to each CD from start to finish without skipping any songs.  After about 5 listens (yes, with headphones) I've found three songs that I enjoy listening to - Eppur Si Muove, Andromeda and 20,000 Miles Over The Sea.  Note though that I enjoy trance and ambient.  That's what this cd is.  It's ambient.  I get the same level of enjoyment and connection with the music as I get from Conjure One or Groove Armada.  This cd, as with Voyager lacks a depth that's hard to explain.  It's like the old Enigma cds had hidden meanings withing meanings.. and they did I suppose.      The last two cds really lack that feeling of depth for me, and I don't mean the mixing itself.  As others have said, with headphones you hear nuances that you miss otherwise.  But that's not the depth I mean.  This CD presents itself to you quite plainly.  We all know that enigma can't keep putting out MCMXC A.D. II's and III's, but at this point Enigma has morphed into basic ambient electronica and sits comfortably beside the other artists of the genre.   While that's fine if Cretu was aiming for more of a mainstream audience/sound, though Enigma ceased to be origional in sound after #4.     The space theme people seem excited over, listen to E3 again..  Space, satellites, mission control voices.  Final verdict - I've never needed time,headphones and repeated listens to fall in love with a new enigma cd   .  I refuse to accept that it should require such effort to remain a fan of the music.  Pick this up if you like ambient, if you're an old school E-fan... listen to a friends copy first.
B00005JOLI|3.0|But I didn't love the book. I LIKED it. Very big difference. Though this movie has perhaps two good actors in its cast (Brom and Murtagh, the others are gag-worthy. Especially Galbatorix -- his soon-to-be infamous line \\"I suffer without my stone!\\" still makes me laugh as I write this. Except it wasn't a comedic line) and Saphira has the cheesiest and most stilted lines on the planet, and though they cut immensely from the book (the book wasn't exactly the Masterpiece of the Year, but still, even if I hated a book I like the movie to stick to it. Odd preference, I know) it was still mildly enjoyable (maybe because of the aforementioned hilariously awful \\"stone\\" remark, and others.)<br /><br />SOON-TO-BE INFAMOUS AWFUL LINES:<br /><br />\\"I suffer without my stone!\\" (I've already gone into this.)<br /><br />\\"I have skills!\\" (Is this Eragon or Napoleon Dynamite I hear?)<br /><br />\\"Into the sky, to fight or die!\\" (The scriptwriter was probably quite proud of this little corny stupid rhyme that made an otherwise decent scene another laugh-fest for Haley.)<br /><br />\\"ARE WE ONE NOW?\\" (I think that's how it went. I won't explain this one. It's not made any less hilarious by Saphira's cry of \\"We are one!\\")<br /><br />So see it, rent it, buy it if it's in the bargain pile (it will be, this movie is not destined for greatness). I'll probably buy it, to watch when I'm having a bad day so I'll laugh reeeeeaaaally hard, and to enjoy the performances of two actors, who happened to be my favorite characters in the books. But two good actors out of such a huge cast...<br /><br />It is kind of sad.<br /><br />Rating: Average, but worthwhile because it's funny. Oh-so-funny.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Although I have almost always only reviewed books on Amazon, I had to write my feelings on \\"Rocky Balboa\\". As someone who counts the original Rocky as one of my favorite films of all time, I had to see this movie, which I did last night to a Sold Out audience. Most of the people in the theatre were guys around my age. As soon as the previews ended and the movie started, the crowd erupted into cheers and applause. Who would have thought that a fictional underdog from South Philly from the late 70s would carry such a following for all of these years.<br /><br />I thought that Rocky Balboa was excellent - not because the boxing scenes were great, or because every scene was a treat, or because the acting was the best I've ever seen, although Stallone did a great job I thought. But the film was very inspirational and reminds us that no matter who we are, we can achieve our dreams. Rocky reminds us that it does not matter how hard life hits, so long as we get up and keep going forward. Rocky did so in life and inspired me to keep on going forward in my life with this excellent film. Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky . . . . . . .
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Without going into great detail about this album or individual Beatle songs, so many words have been written about the Beatles' music, I'll just say this; I really don't understand why anyone would give this CD/DVD less than 5 stars. We could argue endlessly about other tracks that could have been included, or other changes in production, but I have every Beatles album and this is more than a welcome addition to their body of work. You'll hear something new with every listen. This is some of the best music ever created by anyone, the sound quality is phenomenal, and I consider it a gift to us from the surviving Beatles, George Martin & son. It is truly a musical journey you'll want to experience again and again. It brings John, Paul, George, and Ringo back together in a unique way, as if you were listening to the Beatles perform a concert in your living room! Delivered with a fresh slant, this is almost like hearing the Beatles for the first time for those of us who've been around since Beatlemania in the '60s.  As for young newcomers, I'd recommend listening to the individual releases first, but for ANYONE who appreciates great music, BUY IT, YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY!
0790729369|4.0|Meryl Streep received her first Academy Award nomination for the stunning war drama \\"The Deer Hunter\\" (1978). The following year, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Dustin Hoffman's wife, Joanna, in \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\". She earned the Best Actress Award for \\"Sophie's Choice\\" (1982), and was nominated for another Oscar for her outstanding performance as real-life Karen Silkwood... In all, she has received 13 Academy Award nominations, the most recent for her supporting role opposite Nicolas Cage and Chris Cooper in the fascinating film 'Adaptation.'<br /><br />In 'The Bridges of Madison County,' Streep stars as Francesca, a conventional wife of an Iowa farmer... Francesca cares for her family with all her heart, as she has done for years... She describes herself as \\"happily married,\\" but nevertheless falls easily into a chaste but tender affair with a charismatic wandering photographer on assignment for National Geographic magazine in the fall of 1965...<br /><br />Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) stops at Francesca's farm to ask for directions... While close-ups provide Streep's intimate thoughts, some women lost patience with her indecision and reticence...<br /><br />Francesca, although nervous by the attention of the courteous visitor, but guilty about being unfaithful to her passionless Iowa husband, finds out a mystical attraction for the top photographer who has come to Madison County to take pictures of the local covered bridges... Francesca was at home, alone, her husband and two children having gone for four days to the Illinois state fair...<br /><br />Francesca and Robert talk about their lives and their old dreams, and as their relationship grows, they both find themselves drawn to each other, falling deeply and immediately in love... Their true love strikes at the heart of everyone... 'In a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes only once.'<br /><br />The suffocating rain sequence has to go down as one of the most poignant in cinematic history, beautifully complemented by a soundtrack resonating with a melancholic piece of blues and piano...<br /><br />Every performance in the movie is backed up by a truthful, believable script full of real, everyday people... The poignancy of each moment is underscored by an unforgettable choice of romantic melodies...<br /><br />The motion picture, nominated for the C&eacute;sar Awards in France, is another example of Eastwood's exceptional style as both a filmmaker and as an actor...<br /><br />As a filmmaker, Eastwood proves his comprehension of the secret of romance novels, showing sensuously, and sensitively the way people feel and think when they are really in love... As an actor, he is very convincing as the loner with much to share... Although his travels have taken him far across the 'other side of the world,' he still looks cleverly back on his life...<br /><br />His film gives us the passion between two lovers, but also life's compromises and regrets... It is a realistic portrait of a man and a woman who love the memories they share... It is a sensitive exploration of feelings which grows into something neither one can get free... It is an invitation to consider what might have been missed or lost in our life...<br /><br />Meryl Streep is heartbreaking as a lonely woman surrounded by family... We truly feel her pain and desperation... She fights with all the love, hope, frustration and responsibility... She is someone whose dreams of coming to America have not been fulfilled by the tedious reality of her life in Winterset, Iowa... Her busy life is filled with details but has nothing that truly excites her anymore... She is forever altered by a chance encounter.. Her emotional range is enormous and her laughter is as charged with energy as her tears... But you never doubt the truth of what she's feeling...<br /><br />As the pair reveal their own lives through each other, a connection is made, and in just four fatefuldays, they find one another and commit themselves to each other for a lifetime even though they remain apart...<br /><br />We all dream of the chance meeting, that particular time when we really feel we are enjoying life... But love never obey our expectations... Robert and Francesca, couldn't stay together physically, but their love was so strong that lasted forever as Francesca grew old on the farm and Robert traveled the world... Women love romanticism and never seem to get enough... And true love is possible, even in the scope of a life of compromise, and in the middle of nowhere, on the far side of any age...in just four fateful days, they find one another and commit themselves to each other for a lifetime even though they remain apart... <br /> <br />We all dream of the chance meeting, that particular time when we really feel we are enjoying life... But love never obey our expectations... Robert and Francesca, couldn't stay together physically, but their love was so strong that lasted forever as Francesca grew old on the farm and Robert traveled the world...

B00012QM8G|5.0|This film is very difficult to watch, and stays with you long after its finish.  The public executions by Amon Goeth were exceptionally brutal and barbarous, as was the killing spree of his sadistic comrades at the concentration camps and the ghettos.  Oskar Schindler, first blind to the inhumanity taking place around him, subsidizes the freedom of his Jews (Schindlerjuden) and removes them to a factory with a diminishing Nazi influence.<br /><br />There is only was negative comment I have to make of this movie:  Spielberg focuses the holocaust murders on just the Jews.  But not only were the Nazis impassioned anti-Semites, the massacre extended to Sinti, Roma, prisoners of war, mentally and physically disabled, homosexuals, Africans, Catholic and Protestant clergy, Jehovah's Witnesses, trade unionist, Freemasons, and Eastern Christians.  The estimates of murdered \\"undesirables\\" at the hands of the Nazis is between 9 to 11 million if the omitted groups mentioned above are included.  I am aware that this film is about the waking of Oskar Schindler and the rescue of his immediate workers, but briefly mentioning a few of those omitted would have been appropriate.
0792839730|4.0|Richard Attenborough's monumental war drama is about one of the most stirring battles of World War II, based on the best-seller by Cornelius Ryan... The film presents the most impressive all-star cast ever assembled for a single production...<br /><br />World War II's \\"Operation Market Garden\\" would have put the Allies in control of the major road leading into the industrial Ruhr, the heart of the German war machine... The war would have ended in a matter of weeks... Instead, what Market Garden left in its wake, through a combination of costly miscalculations, bad weather, battlefield politics and tactical errors, were more than 17,000 British, American, Dutch and Polish casualties, nearly twice as many dead as in Normandy...<br /><br />On Sunday, September 17th, 1944, the largest assemblage of gliders, bombers, transports and fighters ever involved in a single mission flew over eastern Holland, and dropped 35,000 assault troops along the 64 mile road corridor between Belgium and Arnhem, the Dutch city on the Rhine River...<br /><br />This airborne army - the Market phase of the operation - was assigned the task of taking and holding the six major bridges along the corridor...<br /><br />Smashing through the crumbling German resistance along the way, the British Corps tanks and infantry - the Garden phase - were to link up with the paratroops and, with their help, drive the retreating armies of the Third Reich back into their own homeland...<br /><br />The Germans, however, correctly guessed the British plan and formed a ring of armor around the approaches to the bridge at Arnhem... The result was near slaughter for all the allied forces and an enormous number of German dead...<br /><br />Col. John Frost (Anthony Hopkins) and the survivors of his 2nd Battalion battered their way through heavy German fire to the northern end of Arnhem bridge, where they took up a strong position in houses over-looking the entire bridge...<br /><br />For four long days and nights, Frost and his 'valiant few' held this tenuous position against superior German tanks and infantry... The Dutch civilian helped by piling the bodies of the dead - friend and enemy alike - in forbidding barricades across each major street to prevent Germans from reaching Frost and his men at the bridge...<br /><br />Major General Roy Urquhart (Sean Connery), Brigadier James Gavin (Ryan O'Neal), Lieut.Col Joe Vandeleur (Michael Caine) and the rest of the Allied commanders met with much the same resistance and disaster...<br /><br />At the Nijmegen highway bridge it became obvious that the British tanks would be stopped until the bridge's northern end could be taken by an assault crossing of the Waal River... This brave action, executed in a full clear day under murderous German fire by Major Julian Cook (Robert Redford) and his battalion, has been described by witnesses as one of the most heroic deeds of arms in World War II...<br /><br />Delayed by ground fog in England, both replacements and badly-needed supplies were late in arriving... Communication was so bad; most of the food and ammunition fell into the hands of the Germans...<br /><br />The Polish Parachute Brigade, under Major General Sosabowski (Gene Hackman) command, held up three days by the fog, finally made their drop into a deadly thick shower of German rifle and machine gun fire... Many died before they touched ground, and the rest met with further disaster...<br /><br />Casualties were enormous and the hundreds of British wounded were placed in the Beautiful home - of Dutch heroine Kate Ter Horst (Liv Ullman) - offered as a surgery and the small hotels provided some bed space for the worst casualties...<br /><br />Laurence Olivier (Dr. Spaander) wins a cease-fire from the German Lieut. General Wilhelm Bittrich (Maximilian Schell), in order to bury the dead and surrender the wounded...<br /><br />Meanwhile, Col. Frost and the last few at Arthem bridge were taken prisoners by the Germans... Only a few escaped... Vandeleur's advance was stopped cold... Urquhart hopelessly surrounded planned a retreat down the river... The Germans, lighting the river with rockets, began firing on the fleet and only some made it to the other side...<br /><br />The following morning, Padre Pere, a British Chaplain who stayed behind with his wounded men, noticed the mysteriously frightening silence that prevailed throughout the whole Oosterbeck area...

B000002N2Z|5.0|Coming out in 1995, &#34;Adrenaline&#34; is the Deftones's debut album, and it's their most rawest and most heaviest release to date. Every song on here (minus the bonus track &#34;Fist&#34; I think that's the name of that track) is full of pure raw aggression. This album is also my 2nd favorite Deftones album with &#34;Around the Fur&#34; being my all time favorite Deftones album. Chino Moreno's vocals skills are just awesome. He can sing, he can scream and shout, he can rap, he can do it all. Stephen Carpenter's guitar riffs are great. They not only pack a serious punch, but they're also downright catchy as well. Chi Cheng's plays great bass lines that are very ominous, and Abe Cunningham's drumming while not fast, but it's still great, and it really hits the tone on this album. The first track &#34;Bored&#34; is an instant classic, and one of the best songs on this album. But my favorite song on here definitely has to be &#34;7 Words&#34;. This song is very heavy and very mosh worthy, and that heavy shout along chorus in which Chino madly shouts out is just addicting. My other favorite songs on here include &#34;Minus Blindfold&#34;, &#34;Birthmark&#34;, &#34;Engine No. 9&#34;, &#34;Nosebleed&#34;, &#34;Lifter&#34; &#34;One Weak&#34;, and &#34;Root&#34;. Anyways, if you're a Deftones fan, metal, rock, or just good music in general, than by all means, you must own this album. Later Dudes!!!<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. Bored - 5/5<br />2. Minus Blindfold - 5/5<br />3. One Weak - 5/5<br />4. Nosebleed - 5/5<br />5. Lifter - 5/5<br />6. Root - 5/5<br />7. 7 Words - My favorite song. 10/5<br />8. Birthmark - 5/5<br />9. Engine No. 9 - 5/5<br />10. Fireal - 5/5<br />11. Fist (Bonus Track) - 4/5t (Bonus Track) - 4/5
B00005QXDD|5.0|I was surprised at how good the music is on this cd.  knowing jack black and his antics i figured it would be a comedic spoof and nothing more but the musical talent is definetely there.  dont get me wrong, this album is meant to be funny, which it is, but it has alot more to offer in the musical field than you would think upon first glimpse.
0743270754|5.0|A wonderful book, huge, but very well written.  I've read a couple of these massive history books recently, and this one moves very well.  It is full of not only facts and keen observation, but also drama.  I highly recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I sadly didn't watch this show when it came out. A friend of mine actually put me on to it. I was hooked from episode 1. This is one of my all time top show ever, among Angel, Simpsons, Highlander, Flash, Buffy and more. I cannot speak more highly of it. And I am so mad that it didn't even get a complete first season. The worst episode of Firefly is still better the best show currently out there. Also check out the awesome movie Serenity! Buy it now.
6305308659|3.0|Competent acting.  Decent Storyline.  It actually streches your mind a little to consider \\"What If?\\"  Three stars...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie! Smart, funny, action packed, and with a great story too. You don't have seen the tv show to like the movie. But to love it you have to have seen and loved the series. What a great story, I will see anything written or directed by Joss Whedon.
B000089RVX|5.0|It's already been said by everyone else.  An outstanding release for the band known as...Evanescence.  Five stars...
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|All I can say is this is a great movie, with a great story. The acting is solid, the climax is rememberable, and it moves you as a member of mankind. Truly a must see.
B00005MNP8|5.0|It's already been said by others.  A great band, a great sound, a great album - The price is right, get your copy and relive the sound of Blondie!
6305014140|3.0|I'm  not familiar with the series, so I review this as a stand alone anime movie. It was a bit short, but full of action, maybe if you get to know the main caracter you could get attached to him and buy the series. Didn't worked for me, once I saw it the first time, I didn't watch it a second time. Only for the hardcore fan, I think...
B000001FS3|5.0|Even years (and years) later - this Disc is a classic.  But then again, it IS U2.  Five stars...
B0000004V2|5.0|This is a fantastic album, but you can read the other reviews to find out why.  <br />My problem is the album needs to be remasterd. If you listen to \\"Very Best of the Stone Roses\\" (which is remastered and recommended as an introduction to the Stone Roses) the difference is night and day and difficult to listen to the original albums songs that overlap (which is quite a number). I would also suggest adding some bonus tracks such as the Peter Hook (of New Order) produced version of \\"Elephant Stone\\" which makes an already great song even better (available on Very Best) and some era B-Sides especially \\"Mersey Paradise\\" the best Stone Roses song not on this album (and good enough alone to warrant a purchase of Turns Into Stone).
B000002LK1|5.0|It's already been said by others on \\"Violator.\\"  If you (like me) had forgotten about \\"Enjoy the silence\\" by Depeche Mode, it's time to re-familiarze yourself with this band.  Five stars!!
B000HA4WT8|3.0|Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift was created because................... <br />This movie must beer for car lovers. I think I purchased this because my daughter wanted to see Bow Wow. <br />

I AM QUITE SURE AL PACINO HAS LEARNED KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER. <br /> <br />
B000002KMV|5.0|Awesome CD!!!! <br />I purchased this CD because I wanted a digital copy of the album that I own.  This is one of the best albums Prince has written.  The name does say it all.  Go ahead and buy this CD, you won't be sorry that you did.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS A STAND ALONE. THERE IS NO NEED TO SEE THE FIRST ONE TO FOLLOW THE STORYLINE. TYRESE GIBSON IS IN THIS MOVIE WHAT MORE DO I NEED TO SAY.
B000067DNC|5.0|Awesome boxed set!!! <br /> <br />This boxed set centers around the original SG1.  If you are a fan of the show or Richard Dean Anderson like I am then you will love this box set.
0790729725|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON WISEGUY BY NICHOLAS PILEGGI. THIS IS THE BEST COMPARED TO GODFATHER ONE AND TWO. MARTIN SCORSES DEVELOPED A POWERFUL MOVIE WITH SOME POWERFUL CHARACTERS. RAY LIOTTA HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO HAVE AN ELETRIGYING PERFOMCES  IN ANY OTHER MOVIE. <br /> <br />
0743289412|3.0|Stephen King's latest offering is one of his most personal stories that I have ever read.  I don't know if it's one of his most powerful, as the jacket claims, but I thought it was evident that King set out to write a story about a character, not about a situation.  With most of King's novels, including his previous, Cell, I feel like the characters are always second in importance to the situation they are placed in, and I have never had a problem with that.  With Lisey's Story, however, the author has definitely churned out a thick novel full mostly of a drifting narrative that focuses on Lisey and her relationship with her deceased husband, Scott.<br /><br />Lisey and Scott were married for 25 years before Scott died mysteriously of \\"pneumonia.\\"  The novel begins with Lisey finally starting to clean out Scott's study two years after his death.  The novel's drifting narrative ultimately serves the purpose of making us care about Lisey, as you really aren't sure what the plot is until Lisey gets a disturbing phone call dealing with her release of her late husband's papers, and possibly some unreleased works.  Lisey is threatened by the mysterious Zack McCool, and this extraneous pressure forces Lisey to go through the study and all of its things, and while doing so she must relive some of her best and worst moments with Scott through the years.  Ultimately, Lisey is forced to take a trip to Booy'a Moon, the place that Scott \\"went\\" throughout the years for a number of different reasons.  It is in this world that Lisey will not only find answers to her difficult present situation, but also to lingering questions left over from her marriage to Scott and his unfortunate death.<br /><br />As with all King novels, the characters in Lisey's Story are well-written and easy to love or hate.  Lisey and Scott's relationship is spelled out in some eerie, disturbing, yet meaningful flashbacks.  And the book is full of their own little private language that they developed with each other through the years.  All this is important because Lisey's devotion to Scott is central to all the decisions she makes throughout the novel.  In order to truly believe what is happening, you must believe that she and Scott were truly in love, and King does everything he needs to do to elicit that from the reader.  Lisey's sisters, however, are pointless, and do nothing more than to annoy the reader and random points throughout the novel.  I could have done without them completely.<br /><br />No matter how many good moments, though, I could never get past the writing style King employed for this novel.  I guess you could call it \\"stream of consciousness\\" but it still has some semblance of order.  However, there are many sentences and paragraphs in the novel that were so  convoluted that I didn't know how it began by the time I got to the end of the sentence.  Also, when there are literally flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks, the reader can tend to get lost just a little bit when asking exactly what time period they are currently in.  These factors added up to a slow-moving middle frame in the book that I literally had to push myself to get through so I could finish the entire thing.<br /><br />Characters, good.<br /><br />Storytelling, bad.h each other through the years.

B00008MZ0N|5.0|Everything in this movie is looking good. The men and the cars. This action packed movie will keep you entertained. If you haven't seen this movie by now you don't know what you are missing. <br />
B00005GL0Q|5.0|I was a mere toddler at the time of this album's release, and I recall hearing the singles released from it on radio.  In my teen years, I grew intensely attracted to the Beatles.  I purchased 7 or 8 of their albums and thought I'd heard it all (or all that I needed to hear).  Fast forward twenty years:  after the births of my two children, I decided to buy the entire Beatles collection of albums on CD, including some (such as Revolver) that I hadn't previously owned.  Oh my gosh, was I in for a real treat!  As I was attempting to expose my children to the Beatles, I realized I was still discovering them myself!!  I was absolutely carried away by this album in particular.  In 1966, the Beatles were way ahead of their time; this album clearly influenced so much music that came in its wake.  Also, like so many other Beatles albums, there is something in it for everyone.  I think the extent of their reach to so many generations and walks of life was such a great part of their magic.  I recommend Revolver highly.
B00005JOLI|4.0|If not perfect, it's certainly beautiful. The acting, special effects, scenery, and plot are no doubt this movie's strongest point. The casting is wonderful: Edward Speelers makes a wonderfully endearing and memorable Eragon, the young boy who comes across a beautiful stone that turns out to be a dragon's egg and, upon hatching, reveals a destiny for Eragon that is far more perilous and fantastical than he ever imagined. He is destined to be a dragon rider, part of an almost extinct race of people who forge powerful alliances with dragons and are connected with one dragon for the rest of their lives.     Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, are called to an army to help overthrow the evil king Galbotorix (played by brilliant John Malkovitch), a former dragon rider who went terribly wrong and holds a tyranical reign over the land. Among the cast here, Jeremy Irons as Eragon's wise mentor Brom (two parts wise, three parts sarcasm) and the actor who played the demented and evil Durza were also excellent standouts.     My one real complaint of the film was the trimming of certain parts that had to take place, namely the relationship between Eragon and his uncle and cousin and some of the time he spent with Brom (also, why weren't Arya's ears pointed? I had to explain to my mom that she was an elf). Still, the majority of the film was true to the book and spectacular to behold.     Some of the comments, both of the story and the film, have been waaaay too harsh, IMO. The main complaint is that the film is a copy of LOTR. This rather exasperates me, to tell you the truth. I'm a huge fan of Tolkien, both books and movies, and I have no qualm with this film in that regard. The plot and writing of Paolini's tale are wonderfully entertaining and did not ring false to me at all. Tolkien's writing and Paolini's writing are both different and original. Yes, Paolini did borrow from Tolkien as far as the elves and dwarves went, but considering how much I love Tolkien's elves and dwarves and wanted to see more of them, I can hardly blame him for this. In fact, I was thrilled when I first read Eragon and found the elves to be the same sort as Tolkien's. Plus, I hate to break it to the complainers, but Paolini was hardly the FIRST to do this; artists and writers have been portraying elves and dwarves the Tolkien way for a good long time. The brilliant D&D games were one of the first to do this, I believe. Heck, this is even assuming that Tolkien was the first to portray elves and dwarves this way; if you look into the fay lore (of which elves are a part of) there's a great deal of variety and elves are not always shown as little skipping figures.     People have also been imitating Star Wars for years; if you want to rag on Eragon, put it in line! The biggest accusations seem to be that Paolini borrows word-types from Tolkien, and I'll freely admit that he does do this. I noticed certain similarities within the prologue. However, it is the story and the characters which are important and THEY are original. Eragon, Saphira, and Brom, to start with, are wonderful and complex characters.     There is plenty of originality in this movie and its characters to, in my opinion, make most complaints invalid; the plot of dragons and riders is definetly separate from Tolkien and Star Wars and, considering how often evil dragons have been portrayed, this was another change I welcomed. Brilliant cast, magical effects, epic story; 4 and half stars. Paolini's jewel has finally come to the big screen! I highly recommend this!
B00005JPE7|4.0|Rocky is back in his 6th and final film. The first half of the film moves a bit slow as the audience is updated on Rocky's life since we last saw him 16 years ago. The most obvious change is the absense of Adrian (Rocky's wife), who has passed away. An emotionally damaged Rocky revisits the past, hoping to fill the void (of Adrian) in his heart. This eventually leads him back to his passion of boxing, which serves as the ultimate symbol of his determination.<br /><br />So how does Rocky get back into the ring (for a title shot) at 59 years old? Well, it's the same old Rocky premise: Current champ is seen as a fake by the public and fights Rocky in hopes of gaining the respect he thinks he deserves. However, it's a premise that works and true Rocky fans embrace time and again. Sure, I wasn't completely happy with the ending, and at times Rocky gets carried away with his moronic one liners. But, Stallone delivered what he promised: a sweet goodbye from an old friend
B000003TA4|1.0|this **** isnt even worthy of a review.. they inspired some of the worst bands in rock and roll history...kurt cobain was just no talent heroin user, . NO stars but i have to give it one for inpiring someone, thats all nirvana did. There are so may GREAT bands to represent the 1990's check out Oasis-(Whats the story?) Morning Glory and RADIOHEAD- Ok Computer...Nirvana had NO TALENT.. they were just in the right place in the right time
B00004TJTS|5.0|This movie is a really great film.  It is so well told, the story is as sweet as they come.  I have watched this film at least 20 times and I never get tired of it.  I laugh and cry every time.  Best of all it was a true story of a boy and his dog and the love and adventures they shared. This is a must have if you have kids.
B00005JPE7|5.0|I wasn't as down on Rocky V as most people were, but the fact that Rocky didn't go out in the ring kind of left a black eye on the entire Rocky series.  Fighting Tommy Gunn in the street wasn't nearly as good as one more title shot would have been.  Well, in Rocky Balboa, a 50+ year old Balboa gets his one last shot.<br /><br />It was very different seeing the Rocky characters in the 21st century.  Rocky's son worked for a corporation, Rocky owned a restaurant, Paulie STILL worked at the Meat Packing plant.  Instead of having the local news carry the info on Sports like in Rocky movies of the past, ESPN carried the info, and HBO Pay Per View televised the actual fight.  I also like the fact that the championship fight was only scheduled for 10 rounds, instead of the 15 they used to fight back in the 70's and 80's.<br /><br />There was no mention of Rocky's actual age, just that he was \\"in his 50's\\", which I thought was a bit unrealistic.  If a fighter in his 50's today got into the ring, headlines would always say his actual age.<br /><br />I enjoyed the guy who played Rocky's son very much.  I thought he did a very good job.  Stallone and Burt Young played Rocky and Paulie just as well as ever, although Burt Young, at times, seemed a little rusty.<br /><br />All in all, great storyline, a few exceptional speeches by Rocky about life, and I left the theatre pumped up, with a different outlook on life.  I love movies that make you think that you're living your life wrong.  Any movie that can bring about self-reflection is a winner in my book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|$19.99 on Amazon!  A STEAL!!  This alone makes it worth 5 stars! <br /> <br />This has got to be one of the best character-driven television shows created in the last two decades, or in other words, since I've been alive.  It's hard to say anything new here with so many other excellent reviews posted, but I think it's worth mentioning my affinity for the show anyway. <br /> <br />I first heard about Firefly during movie previews.  A trailer came on, talking about the sad fate of the series all the while urging support for the new film, Serenity.  Being the Sci-Fi fan that I am, I couldn't turn down the opportunity to get into a whole new world.  I immediately went out and bought the series and my only regret to this day is how many days of my life I've spent glued to the screen with friends, enjoying this fantastic, short-lived world that Joss Whedon, his cast, and crew have created. <br /> <br />This is a unique Sci-Fi world, particularly in that there's a hybridization of Western elements...Star Trek always referred to space as \\"the final frontier\\", and I think this show really takes it literally, but does so in a credible and enjoyable way.  Also **Spoiler** there are absolutely ZERO Aliens in this show.  This show is much more about human nature and limitations contrasted against the farthest reaches of space exploration, rather than mysterious alien species which is much harder to wrap our minds around. <br /> <br />A few of my favorite episodes include: \\"Ariel\\", \\"Out of Gas\\", and \\"War Stories\\".
B000AY3KN0|5.0|As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on \\"Million Dollar Movie\\". I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br /><br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as \\"Kong\\", and who is, indeed, king of the island.<br /><br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious \\"Kong\\".<br /><br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious \\"Kong\\" is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of \\"Kong\\". Notwithstanding the fact that \\"Kong\\" has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br /><br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls \\"King Kong\\" and takes him back to New York with them on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, King Kong makes his debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br /><br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago. It is a truly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!Bravo! <br />
0393307050|5.0|One of the reviews above indicates rather strongly that the Aubrey-Maturin series is for men; it implies that the treatment of women in the series is problematical.  Nonsense!  I am a woman who has read the series several times, and I find more to appreciate each time.  First of all, it is well-known that O'Brian was heavily influenced by his love for the works of Jane Austen (even to the point of using the first two letters of her first and last name for Jack Aubrey).  In addition to the exquisite literary style and the details of social life in the early 19th century, O'Brian has given us women who are complex and fully a part of all levels of the plot.  Diana Maturin is certainly not always admirable, but she is strong and has a dash that in many other novels set in the period is reserved for male characters.  Clarissa Oakes, who certainly does cause trouble on board, becomes a staunch person, whose practicality, kindness, and intelligence are admired by both Jack and Stephen.  In fact, both men are admirers of strong and independent women throughout the series.  Another draw for me was the matter-of-fact way that women fit into the life of the ship in the later novels, as medical assistants or even as able \\"seamen\\".  Women in these books can be heroic, villainous, or even comic, but they are strong and act according to their own lights.  Even Jack's little twin daughters, raised with rough sailors as nannies, swear with the gusto of a more modern and freer age--the difference being that they are also taught proper social language (which would be a blessing today).  Another little girl, the street waif Dil, \\"mothers\\" Stephen in India and considers herself to be the equal of the glamorous Diana when the two meet.  Women readers may not like all of them, but they will surely be interested to make the acquaintance of Louisa Wogan (spy and murderess), Peg Skeeping (Maturin's assistant in the sickbay), Brigid (Maturin's little daughter, afflicted from birth with something resembling autism and brought fully into the world through love and care), Mrs Johnson (Jack's proper mother-in-law, who turns to the bookie business to make money), and even, in a very short vignette, a high-class, haughty courtesan known only as the Gentlemen's Relish.  Bawdy, touching, gentle, violent, earthy, or sophisticated, the women in the series have a great deal to offer the female reader!

B00005JPE7|4.0|I am only 23 years old, so I grew up watching the classics that were the Rocky movies years after they had already come out. Last year I was so happy to hear about the new rocky movie coming out in 06. Still I had my doubts because of stallone's age, the lackluster rocky 5, and the long break since there had been a rocky movie out. <br />  I'll say right away that it's not the best Rocky movie. No sequel ever is, but this one was pretty good. It definite does a good job at concluding the franchise. <br />  If you liked any of the Rocky movies, go see this. It was way better than I had expected, and as a hardcore rocky fan, I loved it. I felt like a little kid again, bouncing up and down in my seats during the fight at the end. Stallone at 59 was in amazing shape, and the story and film making techniques of stallone made this a great movie. I'm gonna go see it again. I can't wait for the box set!
B0002JJBZY|3.0|I have been a fan of Star Trek since the original showing in the 60's and was eager to finally obtain the dvds.  It is nice to have them, but it is disappointing that not only did Paramount not clean up the video but they used the edited versions for the dvds that were released back in the late 70's to fit in more commercials.  None of the episodes are intact and all have scenes and dialogue missing.  It is a shame that not only does Paramount fail to bother releasing the full versions, but they are hoping that we don't realize it when viewing them.  While some argue they are uncut, the missing parts are indeed gone.  For example, during the episode where the Enterprise is hijacked to Eden in the Neutral Zone, the discussion with McCoy about the leaders deformed and diseased ears is missing.  While the cuts are not significant in length or may seem trivial to some, they do exist.  The 35 mm film that Paramount used for the dvd's where those that were edited and provided for syndication after NBC dropped the program, not the original ones that they used.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|i read the classic novel in high school and i loved reading that book. iam so excited and glad that there is a movie about the book. i have not seen this movie yet so i cannot make a review about the movie. i just hope this film is close to the book like lord of the rings movie is close too jrr tolkien's novels and the lion,the witch and the wardrobe movie also being close to c.s.lewis novel series chronciles of narnia.  <br /> this movie makes me glad to be norwegian.  <br />  iam glad to see actors from norway and other parts of scandinavia in this movie. adds alot of authenticity to a film when actors are of the same background of the characters they play.

B00000AFFI|5.0|Allow me to introduce you to one of my favorite albums EVER: <br /> <br />If you were to poll PJ fans, this will NOT rank as favorite with most of them.  However this is my favorite of hers for so many reasons I will try and explain.  At this point in her carreer, she had 4 albums under her belt and her fans were accustomed to experiencing a very brash rocker chick.  This album is a clear departure of the woman her fans had come to know.   <br /> <br />They had become accustomed to this mad operatic diva shrieking and moaning her pain so when many heard this toned down vision, they thought she had lost her strength.  But no, she FOUND her strength.  In her subtelty she lays claim to power and becomes a whole new artist.  Many were also lost on the electronic nature of this album but that only added to her invention.  This album is a marvelous blend of electronic elements and organic instruments.  Skin to the muscle, blood to the veins.  Intimately connected..... <br /> <br /> <br />\\"My first Name  Angeline <br />Prettiest Mess you ever seen <br />Love for money is my sin <br />Any man calls, I'll let him in.......\\" <br /> <br />And the search begins..... This song to me, sounds like a hymn, but more like a lost spiritual than anything you'd hear in a regular church.  That's how much of this album feels to me, like lost spirituals.  The kind that you'd only hear in a place where there was no pomp and no tradition, just the open wounds of those in search of healing bleeding until they either have no blood left or have been completely healed.  A friend of mine characterizes this album as \\"haunted\\" and I feel that is really perfect description.   <br /> <br />The album is very focused on female characters.....Angeline, Leah, Elise, Catherine, Joy, Dawn.......  And word has it that many of these are literary characters which stories have been written about.  However, I will never read any of the stories these characters are based on for I would ruin the truth I have created in my heart. <br /> <br />\\"I'm walkin in the city tonight <br />I'm walkin in the city at dark <br />Remembering, remember light <br />Thinking of nothing and the shooting stars <br /> <br />And this world tonight is mine <br />a world to be remembered in <br />Think on a faded photograph <br />My hair longer than it's ever been, and then <br /> <br />THE SKY LIT UP! <br />the sky, my friend <br />the sky lit up and i'm lighter than I ever been...\\" <br /> <br />OMG!   Amazing what can happen in less than 2 minutes.....  My mind's sky turns to fire when I hear this song......and I become lighter than I've ever been.  By the time this song is over, your sky will be on fire too..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Catherine liked high places <br />High up on the hills <br />A place for making noises, like whales <br />Noises like the Whales <br /> <br />Here she built a chapel with <br />Her image on the wall <br />A place where she could rest and rest <br />A place where she could wash......shhhhhhhhhhhh <br /> <br />and listen to the wind blowing, and listen to the wind.....blow\\" <br /> <br />This is the church of lost spirituals.  I have longed to be like Catherine at her chapel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Did you see her walking? <br />Did she come around here, Sir? <br />Black hair, brown eyes <br />My beautiful Leah <br />She was always so needing <br />Said, \\"I have no-one\\" <br />Even as I held her <br />She went out looking for someone <br />She only had nightmares, <br />And her sadness never lifted <br />And slowly over the years <br />Her lovely face twisted <br />Did she come around here, Sir? <br />I swear you would remember <br />Black hair, Brown eyes <br />Late September <br />October <br />November <br />December <br />It never leaves my mind <br />The last words she said <br />\\"If I don't find it this time, <br />Then I'm better off dead\\". <br /> <br />Cold desperation....... Sadly, this reminds me of my cousin Lisawho was murdered in March :cry:  She was always searching for something in her life, even searching unto her death.  When Gangsta calls this haunted, I can't think of a more perfect song to really characterize that feeling.  I included this on a mix disc that focuses on social ills, anguish and pain.  This song was just perfect for that mix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"It's a perfect day.....a perfect day Elise.\\" <br /> <br />Perfection is the furthest thing from the truth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Catherine Debara you've murdered my thinkin <br />gave you my heart, you left the thing stinkin <br />I'd shake from my spell if it weren't for my drinkin <br />the wind bites more bitter with each light of mornin.... <br /> <br />'til the light shines on me <br />I damn to hell every second you breath\\" <br /> <br />Here is Catherine's reintroduction.  You get your first glimpse of her at her chapel high up on the windy hill.  And now you know what conclusion she's come to..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"The beauty of her, under electric light\\" <br /> <br />electric........light.  The initial sublelty of this song is belied by the entire universe that lies within.  Listen carefully and you will hear that there is a whole world going on underneath the surface.... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />One of the most famous stories ever told is the act of humanity's genesis.  Imagine the perfection of that day.  God taking dirt and forming a man, taking a rib and fashioning a mate for him.  A New Earth, pure skies, crisp clean air, warm sunshine washing the skin with its golden rays.   Every day after became more perfect than the day before and this was the most perfect of all days.  And then......... <br /> <br />\\"He was walking in the garden <br />and he was walking in the night <br />and he was singing a sad love song <br />and he was praying for his life\\" <br /> <br />Adam sensed something was very wrong for it had neverturned so dark so quickly and so early, neither had it been so cold.  Searching the garden, he noticed Eve standing at the foot of the Tree of Knowledge in discourse between the highest powers.  Adam saw the flaming eye of God's wrath focused on the cool slick veil of smoke that surrounded Eve and there enveloped in the shroud of Satan's lie stood Eve with a half eaten fruit.  Remembering the commandment to never eat of the Tree of Knowledge, in fear he ran...... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"and the stars came out around him <br />he was thinking of his sins <br />and he's looking at his song-bird <br />and he's looking at his wings\\" <br /> <br />Having not come to Eve's defense, Adam's guilt bore down on him like a thousand crimes.  Grieving over the knowledge he would never see his Eve again, he went in search of the one thing he knew would bring him comfort........his song-bird.  Adam's earliest days in the garden had him searching for this creature.  Just one of many of God's creations, this one made the most beautiful music of all.  However, of all the times Adam heard the bird's majestic symphonies, he was never able to spot it.  Having never seen his songbird before Adam stood in shock and awe as he stood looking at his mirror image.  The song-bird was not a bird, but a man..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"there inside the garden <br />came another with his lips <br />said, 'Won't you come and be my lover?' <br />'Let me give you a little kiss' <br />and he came, knelt down before him <br />and fell upon his knees <br />'I will give you gold and mountains <br />if you stay awhile with me'\\" <br /> <br />The first words of his creator upon his waking moments rang clear in his memory.....For I have fashioned a mate for you..... and Adam realized that God had given him a CHOICE. God created Adam 2 mates and now the choice was there before Adam, but which one was right?  Should he stay with his song-bird?  Should he validate Eve's disobedienceto their creator?  Adam's heart surged and swelled and, he got down on his knees and pled for the love of his bird.  Adam promised him everything the Lord had created on his earth, if he stayed with him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"and there was trouble taking place, trouble taking place.......\\" <br /> <br />As Adam pled with his song-bird, Eve was being banished from the garden...... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"there inside the garden <br />They kissed, and the sun rose <br />and he walked a little further <br />and he found he wasn't alone\\" <br /> <br />Having just been lost in the comfort of his lovers arms, Adam's stopped dead in his tracks as he noticed the jealous and rage filled glare of a woman he used to know named Eve. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"and the wind, it gathered round him <br />he was thinking of his sins <br />And he's looking for his song-bird <br />He was looking for his wings <br /> <br />and there was trouble........taking place.  Trouble, taking place\\" <br /> <br />In Scorn, the wind of Eve's rage whirled around them.  In her short time on the earth she had been betrayed by the snake, her creator and her mate.  In shame, Adam could barely meet her gaze.  Remembering how he ran in fear instead of standing in solidarity with his charge, the burden of guilt was too much and Adam cried hot bitter tears, facing an impossible decision. <br /> <br />Which mate should he choose?  Should he choose the path Eve has taken and become banished from his paradise forever?  Does he leave the loving arms of his song-bird never to see him again?  How to make up for the fact that he left Eve alone when she needed him the most?  Eve walked over to Adam as the Song-bird tearfully looked on from afar.  Eve stretched out her arm and opened her hand and in it was the half eaten fruit.  <br /> <br />Perhaps Eve's sin wasn't the only betrayal that day...... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Joy was her name <br />A life un-wed <br />Thirty years old <br />Never danced astep <br /> <br />She would have left these red hills far behind if not for her condition <br />'Would have left these red hills long ago if not for my condition' <br /> <br />Pitiful Joy <br />She looked away <br />Into a hollow sky <br />Came face to face <br /> <br />With her own innocence surrounding her until it never was a question <br />Innocence so suffocating, now she cannot move, no question <br /> <br />No hope for Joy <br />No hope or faith <br />She wanted to go blind <br />Wanted hope to stay <br />'I've been believing in nothing since I was born, it never was a question.' <br /> <br />Trapped, with no way out..... :shudder: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"And they came to the river <br />And they came from the road <br />and he wanted the sun <br />just to call his own <br /> <br />And they walked on the dirt <br />And they walked from the road <br />til they came up close <br /> <br />Throw your pain in the river <br />To be washed away slow <br /> <br />And we walked without words <br />And we walked with our lives <br />Two silent birds <br />Circled by <br /> <br />Like our pain in the river <br />And we followed the river <br />And we followed the road <br />And we walked through this land <br />And we called it a home <br /> <br />But he wanted the sun <br />And I wanted the whole <br />And the white light scatters <br />And the sun sets low <br />Like the pain in the river\\" <br /> <br />PJ is famously known for singing about cutting off her lovers legs so he cannot run away :lol:  And one of the really intriguing things about her as an artist is that she gives voice to the things that many cannot find the courage or the ability to speak.  She is able to sing and play her feelings in the way that many of us wish we could but simply aren't able.  I feel that is the kind of purpose she was made to serve.  I think this is really the first time you get a glimpse of the PJ that strives for cleansing and healing.  I feelthat this is the first peak at the evolved person she is to become...... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"In came the girl with the saddened eyes <br />And asked him over again and again <br />\\"Was I too weak ?

Anyone who feels that they miss the old PJ and therefore neglect this album, can feast on this song because aside from Sky Lit Up, it's singly THE performance that characterizes the PJ that people claim is missing from this album.... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Mary and Joseph went on and on.....

Is......this......Desire? <br /> <br />That question can be asked many many times over during this 40 minute spell.  8 years after it's release, this album continues to remain a mystery to me.  That is one of the things about it that I love so much.
B000008GHW|5.0|This album is worth purchasing just for \\"Angel\\", let alone other stellar tracks like \\"Drifting\\" and \\"My Friend\\". <br /> <br />\\"Angel\\" is simply the most beautiful song I've ever heard...
032147404X|5.0|The book is a definite keeper.     In small book, author succeeds to cover almost all of the aspects of photography while keeping it friendly and fun.   Author doesn't go too much into \\"why\\" question nor he goes into the technicalities, never the less author covers each and every topic in more then sufficient depth without putting the reader to sleep :)    Author shares a lot of his experience in very clear and easy to understand manner. I picked tons of tips and knowledge.  This book is organized in a very topic independent manner - that no matter at which chapter it's been opened, reader can go from there without feel of lucking of details from previous chapters.    I think this book will benefit any level, and everybody will be able to pick a thing or two from it. I've been reading and rereading it multiple time, and even so I own a lot of \\"serious\\" photography book, this book beats them all.    Highly recommended.
B000002P5W|5.0|With classics such as \\"Little Wing\\", \\"If 6 Was 9\\", and \\"Castles Made of Sand\\", how could this album not be epic? <br /> <br />And yet none of the aforementioned tracks holds a candle to \\"Bold as Love\\". Its lyricism is impeccable. Hendrix's voice perfectly matches with the instrumentation, which also happens to awe-inspiring. <br /> <br />Despite being overshadowed by \\"Are You Experience?\\", \\"Electric Ladyland\\", and \\"Band of Gypsys\\", \\"Axis: Bold as Love\\" more than holds its own as a classic rock record...
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I could be mean and say something like \\"Light Grenades = A Crow Left of the Murder Pt. 2\\" but it really isn't true. Incubus has come a long way from their early days, expanding and carving new musical channels with each album. This CD is no exception. <br /> <br />While it does have some tracks that sound somewhat similar to a few on Crow, the CD is overall very interesting. There are a couple of crank-it-out loud and fast songs, but overall the CD is more mellow. It's a bit like Morning View in that regard, but the vibe is somewhat more wise and knowing instead of hopeful and life-loving.  <br /> <br />Speaking of which, love is indeed a big theme with this CD. It's almost as if they waited this long to really talk about it so they could give it the full attention it deserves. <br /> <br />Musically, Brandon's beautiful lifting vocals are still there, and at their best. The guitar sound is recognizable, but not in a tired, played out way. It's there just enough to reassure you that although they are always evolving, Incubus is still the same at heart. On some of the softer tracks, there's even a few acoustic Beatle-esque melodies, which is a refreshing integration of the old with the new that Incubus is constantly creating.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a beautiful album. And hey, it's INCUBUS! They can never do wrong, and they never will. They wouldn't put it out if they weren't behind it 100%. These guys have musical integrity, and they just plain rule.
B0002HTZJI|3.0|\\"Live in Hyde Park\\" is the first live record released by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, although for whatever reason it was never distributed in the United States (import copies, such as this one, however, are readily available).  The show does a pretty good job capturing the live energy and atmosphere of the Chili Peppers live show, but before talking about the good, I'll talk a bit about what's been perceived as the bad about the show. <br /> <br />The first, and most glaringly obvious thing, is the show's reliance solely on new material-- the band performs 20 originals-- no less than 15 of them come from \\"Californication\\" (9) and \\"By the Way\\" (6), with a pair of new-at-the-time songs that are as-yet unreleased as studio recordings and one piece from the \\"Greatest Hits\\" album.  In short, there's only a pair of songs from \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magick\\" and the rest of the band's catalog is completely unrepresented.  I suppose the real final result is that this is what was played by the band at the show, and the choice was to either break up the live energy and integrity of the show by compiling it from a number of performances or just go with it as is. <br /> <br />Other complaints have to do usually with the performance and the sound.  As to the former, it's a decent enough show-- the Chili Peppers are, regardless of how cooled out their music gets, an energy band, even live, but vocalist Anthony Kiedis has shifted himself away from the rap styles of the early records to more singing on the later ones-- when he reverts to his earlier styles, he tends to sound a bit clumsy and forced (\\"Give it Away\\").  This is a pretty small point however, the other criticism of the performance that's easy to make is that the sound tends to be kind of thin-- this is no doubt a result of a lack of overdubs that the band leaned on in the studio for \\"Californication\\" and (particularly) \\"By the Way\\"-- this means a number of pieces have substantially more stripped down arrangements (\\"By the Way\\").  It's not bad, it's definitely different though, but given the choice between somewhat stripped back arrangements or the Peppers touring with an entourage of supporting musicians, I'd go with the former.  As far as the sound of the record goes, it's not quite up to snuff with some of the live albums released in the past few years-- I can't quite put my finger on it, but the record doesn't seem to have quite the crispness that live records tend to have these days.  It's definitely well recorded, but it sounds like someone went out of their way to give it a natural feel-- this means it's not flawless in its sound, but it ends up with a charm all of its own. <br /> <br />The performance itself-- like I mentioned, the Chili Peppers are an energy band live-- they tend to excel best when they push tempos and dig deep, which they do pretty much everywhere.  I found listening to this that a number of pieces I didn't care for on the albums came off quite well (\\"Easily\\") and also noted that cleverness in (re)arrangement was of serious benefit to a number of pieces (tagging Joy Division's \\"Transmission\\" to the front of explosive \\"Right on Time\\", the great coda on \\"By the Way\\" that adds a moody swirl to the piece).  And while it ends up being an enjoyable listen throughout, one thing I will say is that it's not something I come back to very much, and I think in a way this is the sharpest criticism I can offer-- when I think of the Chili Peppers, I don't think \\"Live in Hyde Park\\". <br /> <br />Worth having?  For fans, definitely, for the more casual types, stick to the studio records.
B000J10EQU|3.0|You watch this movie for the action scenes and the plot, not the Superman/Lois interactions.   Well, I should say that if you were looking for a Superman/Lois Lane movie, this isn't it.  Lois Lane has a child (by Superman) and a relationship with another man, but still kinda has a crush on Superman.  Great.  I guess this paves the way for them to have an affair in Superman Returns Again.  Being a Superman fan, this really pretty much ruined the movie for me.  Grade: 'F'    Brandon Routh--Did a good Superman.  I think he upheld the Chris Reeve tradition.  He didn't have a clue about Clark Kent, though, while Chris nailed them both.  Kent wasn't much of player in this movie, however.  Overall, I'd still give Brandon an 'A-'.    Kate Bosworth as Lois.  Okay, who did the casting on this one?  It was awful.  A one-dimensional Lois Lane from Hell.  She was basically a bitter witch from beginning to end.  There were no redeeming qualities in her.  She was miserable and unlikeable and her lines were delivered without much real feeling.  I'll give part of the blame to the scripting on that.  Grade: 'F'    Kevin Spacey as Lex.  This wasn't the clownish Gene Hackman role in the original.  Lex was a competent and evil villain here.  Actually it was quite disturbing and it took a while to get used to it.  Grade: 'A'    The special effects weren't bad.  I don't think they went over the top and what they did was done well.  I'd give them an 'B'.    The plot, aside from Superman/Lois, was decent.  I'd give that a 'C'.    Overall, I think it was okay.  As I said, watch it for the special effects and the action, not the character interactions.  I'd rank this one third after Superman I & II.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Lately, I have been at peace with just how lousy an actor Keanu Reeves is.  Of late, I've been able to watch movies of his with my opinion of his talent secure--he will be awful, but since he's not such a bad guy personally, I'm not offended by the fact that he continues to get work (unlike such dweebs as Van Damme and Seagal, who are abominable at both acting and human being-ness).<br /><br />I first came to this realization in _Matrix Revolutions_, aside from being awed by the innovation that occured with writing and directing for Reeves--Neo spends almost the entire movie being unsure of the meaning behind most everything he says.  Since this is Reeves when acting anyway, I found this to be a wonderful way to make his lack of skills work for a movie.<br /><br />And all this let me sit back and not be bothered by his efforts in this film.  Granted, he has some 'tough guy' moments that are purely laughable, but instead I was able to get into the story despite him, and there are some real intriguing turns to this.  It would be tough to be particular about what impressed me about the storyline, for this would give away almost everything at the end, but I did like how the game between God and Lucifer for souls was played out here--how there are rules, and how neither entity is allowed to interfere directly in the human game of choice and assignment of the soul, but despite that there are some interesting moves and moves within moves to make the last 20 minutes or so of these really worth watching.<br /><br />So, to sum up--Keanu bad (acting wise), story thoughtful, but you do have to sweat it out until the end to get to the really interesting stuff.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I realize that The Beatles have had a huge impact upon modern music. No one denies that. However, even though there are some Beatles' tunes that I really enjoy I think The Beatles are largely overrated--they had a few good years, then got sucked in by fame before having a couple of mini-comebacks before breaking-up for good. I don't dislike The Beatles, but I'm not really a fan. Therefore, I was somewhat reluctant to listen to the &#34;new&#34; Beatles' album, LOVE.<br /><br />The &#34;new&#34; label on the album isn't really true. LOVE is actually a soundtrack to a Cirque Du Soleil show by the same name. There are no new songs on the album. Instead, the songs on this album are classic Beatles' songs that have been re-mixed and superimposed with each other to create a different flavor and style of music. The core the songs really haven't changed all that much in the transition. It's the beginning and endings of these new mixed and combined songs that are different and that make this album unique. To be honest, there are a few songs on this album that I had never listened to before in their original form, for example &#34;Within You Without You&#34;. Hearing songs such as that in their new form is refreshing. I'm beginning to discover things about The Beatles' music that makes me appreciate their impact much more than I did before.<br /><br />As a whole, the album flows together almost flawlessly. However, therein lays the only major drawback I can find with LOVE. The album fits together well, but each of the songs played individually don't stand up as well. That's not to say the songs are bad. It's just that not all of them play very well as individual tunes.<br /><br />I'm not sure how Beatles fans will react to LOVE. There are many who will probably love it while others will be dismayed. The album is sure to attract some new fans to the band's music and it at least fosters a greater appreciation among music fans whom might not be Beatles fans. LOVE is a fitting tribute to an original band.ibute to an original band.
B000002LSH|5.0|This is my favorite record of all time.  It's like a story that takes you from chapter to chapter with such amazing songstyling and vocal harmonies, All I really want to say about it, is that you are really missing out if you do not experience Hollywood Town Hall.  The stuff that they do now is also very good, but here you have them in their heyday with both Olson and Louris bouncing harmonies off eachother - amazingly beautiful.  They Jays also defy being labeled, so in order to explain them to my friends, I say that they are like alt.country + roots rock + power pop + a little bluegrass and a little honkytonk thrown in there too.  While still being dynamically beautiful.  Just listen to it even though I sound like a raving lunatic, we give the best reccomendations anyhow.
B0000AQS6R|3.0|\\"Christmas Vacation\\" is an entertaining film, but like all of the \\"Vacation\\" movies in this series it's TVPG version is better.

B00003CY5J|4.0|Montreal is an inexpensive pace to film and can be made easily to resemble a confined space. It's also beautiful. And French. <br /> <br />In construction The Score owes a good deal to Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge, and although it's in color, the feeling is black and white. The story centers around what is to be DeNiro's last heist, a 17th century French sceptre worth a  bundle. He works the job with the ever chameleon like Edward Norton. Their boss is Marlon Brando, and Angela Bassett plays the highly believable love interest. <br /> <br />The movie avoids cliches; the characters develop; and the action is arresting from the first. I confess I'd never even heard of this movie when I found it on cable one night. Too bad for me; it's terrific. <br />Director Franks Oz, the dark side of Sesame Street, does a fine job of creating a taut gangster flick, making moral judgements on a case by case basis rather than providing an overarching moral atmosphere a la francais. <br /> <br />If you've never seen The Score, you should. If you've wondered what a non-overblown American robbery movie looks like this is it. Oz's great accomplishment here,though, is letting the actors play their parts rather than imitate former screen incarnations. No mean feat in itself and a 'helluva' movie into the bargain.
6305657947|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />This movie is a remake (actually not an exact remake) of the 1968 movie \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" starring the legendary Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway (who has a small role in this remake).<br /><br />In this movie a bored billionaire named Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Crown (Pierce Brosnan who also co-produced) masterminds an art theft of a 100 million dollar Monet painting.  Unlike in the original movie (that was a bank heist), Crown actually participates in the theft.<br /><br />Enter insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) with police detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary).  Banning identifies Crown as the mastermind behind this crime.  She's out to get him but a problem ensues along the way: she falls for Crown and Crown falls for her.  Their scenes together are sizzling and explosive.<br /><br />Unlike the 1968 original, there is tension created as the viewer wonders if Crown will actually get caught.  As well, the sexual tension between Crown and the insurance investigator is heightened in this movie.<br /><br />The acting is terrific by Brosnan, Russo, and Leary.  I have to give special kudos to Russo as the smart and very sexy insurance investigator Catherine Banning.  The background music is interesting and adds to each scene.  There is a clever ending that I found unforgettable and fun to watch.  I felt the entire movie was slick and ingeniously done.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2000) is perfect in visual and audio quality.  It has the movie on both sides of the disc (where the movie is in wide screen on one side and full screen on the other).  Extras consist of the 1968 and 1999 theatrical trailers as well as a director audio commentary.<br /><br />In conclusion, watch this movie for yourself to discover what a billionaire does in his spare time!!<br /><br />(1 hr, 55 min;  1999;  wide screen/full screen;  36 scenes; rated 'R')<br /><br />XXXXX

B0009A1AS2|3.0|Allow me to be blunt - I hate this album. I don't hate it because it's a bad album; I hate it because it's a completely generic and blatantly derivative recording. Maybe I wouldn't hate it so much if it had been released by some other band, but for a band of such caliber (and even more, for a band hailed as the gods of \\"progressive\\" metal), it's disappointing and downright saddening. <br /> <br />Before getting into the depressing details, I'd like to briefly mention a thing or two about Train of Thought, which I feel holds some relevance to this review because it is Dream Theater's other major love/hate album. While Train of Thought was a severe departure from the majority of what DT had done prior, it was still interesting music. It was full of mind-boggling instrumental passages, creative rhythms, tasteful unisons, exceptional drumming, and basically a lot of everything that makes you stop and say, `Wow!\\". <br /> <br />Enter Octavarium - \\"It's DT! No, it's U2! No, it's Muse! No, it's the Flower Kings! No, uh...\\" <br /> <br />First of all, I don't mind a band paying respects to their influences in the music they create, but Octavarium enters the realm of influences-worn-on-your-sleeve in a way never before witnessed on a DT album. The chorus in \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is ripped straight from an unreleased U2 album. The entirety of the title track is like an extended jam between Pink Floyd and the Flower Kings... which is cool, except that if I wanted to listen to either of those bands, I'd go listen to those bands. Then there's \\"Never Enough\\", a song which I believe has had enough said about it already, so I'll just make a small contribution and say that the guys in DT should have just put a memo in the liner notes stating the following - \\"Well guys, we couldn't come up with a sufficiently original eighth song for the album, so we decided to cover Muse's \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" and throw a few guitar solos in there for some added flavor! Enjoy!\\" <br /> <br />Thanks guys.<br /> <br />Moving on to the lyrics - when did Dream Theater turn emo? As if the mindless chatter of \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" wasn't enough, you're then treated to Mike Portnoy bitching about ungrateful fans. What would I say if you walked away? I would probably say a whole lot of nothing and listen to Pain of Salvation instead. Even \\"Sacrificed Sons\\", which is one of the only decent tracks on the entire disc, is filled to the brim with inane and trite lyrics. Apparently John Petrucci wrote most of the lyrics on Octavarium, and while I respect his efforts, I sincerely think he should stick to his guitar. <br /> <br />Speaking of Petrucci, there's a decisive lack of him on this album. His playing is a major part of what has made post-Awake Dream Theater so interesting for me, and here he has resigned himself to writing poppy and generic melodies. Prime example is the central melody in \\"Panic Attack\\", which makes me want to violently smash my face into a wall... how many times and by how many bands has that progression now been used? How about the melodies in \\"These Walls\\"? Cut that song down by a few minutes and you have the quintessential radio single. Then there are the uninspired solos. In fact, there are really only two solos on this entire disc that I consider to be worthwhile - \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" and \\"Octavarium\\".  Petrucci isn't the only one who was having feelings of restraint while writing Octavarium, though. Mike Portnoy has also apparently chosen to abandon everything that makes progressive metal drumming so exciting, opting instead to craft fairly straightforward and completely uninteresting rhythms. That was a huge disappointment to me especially, because one of my favorite things to listen to in progressive metal (and metal in general) is the extraordinary manipulation of rhythm and time by the drummer. <br /> <br />The songwriting took a huge hit, as well. Remember the intricate harmonies on Awake? The tremendous unisons on Scenes From A Memory? The extended instrumental interludes on Train of Thought? Sorry. Gone. Swapped out for a kinder, gentler, more appealing Dream Theater. <br /> <br />The only saving grace for this album, as far as I'm concerned, is the title track. It's quite excellent, and does a great job of showcasing just what the guys are capable of. From the extended intro that reminds me heavily of Pink Floyd's \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", to the tasty melodies and grooves that make up the path to Petrucci's wonderful solo medley, and on to the inevitably powerful climax... it's quality prog without a second wasted. This is the kind of material that, in my opinion, would have been the next logical step for Dream Theater to take. Unfortunately, they chose to fill the remainder of the album with uninspired pop tracks like \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and generic wannabe metal like \\"Panic Attack\\". <br /> <br />\\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is another great track, musically. Unfortunately, it is plagued by horrible lyrics. <br /> <br />As for the concept around Octavarium - I've read all about it, and while it's interesting and sort of impressive, it does not excuse the pathetic music surrounding it. <br /> <br />A few final thoughts - <br /> <br />A lot of my hatred towards Octavarium comes from putting the album next to other recent albums from other bands, and next to DT's own past albums. It's vital that you do not misinterpret what I'm trying to say here. I was NOT expecting an album that sounds just like Awake, or SFAM, or any other album that they have put out in the past. Nor was I expecting an utter progressive masterpiece to rival the likes of Cynic's \\"Focus\\" or Pain of Salvation's \\"The Perfect Element I\\". <br /> <br />So what was I expecting? A recording with a level of quality that's consistent with what the band is capable of. I don't care if it actually sounds like anything that DT has released in the past... so all the people that like to say, \\"You don't like Octavarium because it's different!\\" - no,that is absolutely not why I don't like Octavarium. I was expecting them to do something new (like they always do), but I was also expecting them to do it in classic DT style and with classic DT prowess (like they always have). In other words - as long as the album is done with the creativity, mastery, innovation, and originality that Dream Theater are capable of, I don't give a crap what it sounds like. <br /> <br />What I got was none of those things. <br /> <br />I also don't buy all the garbage about \\"getting\\" an album. Certain past DT albums needed an adjustment period because the content on those albums was different, yet still interesting and innovative. Octavarium, however, is full of recycled music... there's nothing to \\"get\\". Though regardless, I don't believe any amount of time will help me get the lack of originality, mediocre songwriting, pathetic lyrics, recycled melodies, and pop sensibility that is thoroughly prevalent throughout this disc. <br /> <br />Biggest disappointment of the year.
B00005KHJR|5.0|When showing this movie to a friend for the first time...<br /><br />(one who has not been poisoned by the unintentional humor of the remake...

The extended version is the version I show to people watching this movie for the first time. Again, don't watch the recent remake with Nicholas Cage if you haven't seen the original first. It will destroy the first-time experience of one of the greatest horror films of all time. After the first viewing of the extended version, you can compare it to the theatrical version, then go to the recent remake for some laughs.<br /><br />This is Christopher Lee's finest, though he made a fine Saruman in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The extended version contains additional scenes of Lee and Edward Woodward. By the way, Edward Woodward is the man of the hour in the original, a very honored guest. Acting like you wouldn't believe, and again, more Woodward to enjoy in the extended version.
B000005Z0G|4.0|After putting out a great first album that was politically charged, 2pacalypse Now was criticized by the dumbest vice president that we ever had. Tupac made his valient return with this album to settle the score. The album starts off with a great single called Holla If Ya Hear Me(also off of The Above The Rim soundtrack) where Pac drops some gems. He also drops jewels in the form of Point The Finga, Soulja's Revenge and the title track. Keep Your Head Up was one the most beautiful odes to black women that I've ever heard. Papa'z Song is where Tupac and Wycked passionately talk about their deadbeat fathers. If you thought Pac wasnt going to address Dan Frail, guess again! He mentions him in Pac's Theme and in Last Wordz. Ice Cube and Ice T join in on Last Wordz and Threat joins in on Peep Game. I liked I Get Around feat Digital Underground but that song shouldnt be what Tupac is remembered by. There are two songs I dont care for. Guess Who's Back and Deadly Venomz(feat Treach, Apache and Live Squad). Other than that, this album is susperb. Bottom Line: Strictly 4 My N***** is a criminally slept-on album that showed the positive side of Tupac(you know the side that only a few real fans embrace him for). He showed that he was a force to be reckoned with while giving you gems that most rappers these days wouldnt dare do. His death is an unfortunate loss for hip hop but his music lives on. Standout Tracks: HOLLA IF YA HEAR ME, POINT THE FINGA, SOULJAH'S REVENGE, PEEP GAME, KEEP YA HEAD UP, STRICLY 4 MY N.I.G.G.A.Z., THE STREETZ R DEATHROW and PAPA'Z SONG.<br /><br />REST IN PEACE TUPAC AMARU SHAKUR.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|I remember as a kid, this was the one movie that my father and I would agree to watch together. He is a John Wayne super-fan and loves all his movies; I love to laugh. McLintock suited us both. It is funny throughout, portraying the state of matrimony with all its irritations and flaws! And of course, to appease the western-movie fans, there are plenty of scenes involving drunken brawls, cattle driving, cowboys and Indians, and of course, John Wayne!  Enjoy.

B000GIXEIG|2.0|Beowulf, is a heroic epic poem which has been orally transmitted through the ages finally written down by monks and retold again and again for its memorable battles and beloved heroes. Both Christians and Pagans alike have found in its 3,182 lines something to relate to and believe in, and many 9th graders have dreaded the pop quizzes it has generated for years.<br /><br />This movie \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" is just one In a long line of interpretations (there is an animated version in the same style as the Polar Express coming out in 2007) It stars Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera, Tomb Raider, 300) Stellan Skarsgard (Ronin, Amistad, Good Will Hunting) Tony Curran (Underworld 2, The Good German) and Sarah Polley (Dawn of the Dead, The Sweet Hereafter)<br /><br />The movie starts out with King Hrothgar (Skarsgard) killing a troll for reasons unknown and leaving the trolls hairy little boy to live. The little boy chops his fathers head off , Mrs Vorhees style, and basically lives in a cave with it , sorta like Tom Hanks and the Volleyball in Castaway. A grown Grendel then waits till the good King erects a massive beer hall and then proceeds to massacre all the warriors and eat them. In the Poem, Grendel decides to kill them because they are just making too much noise and he was a hideous outcast who basically wasn't invited to the party. This is where the film starts taking on a story of its own, completely deviating from the historical poem entirely. Beowulf (Butler), who lives in Geatland, comes to King Hrothgars aide with a handful of braided warriors.<br /><br />The king feigns cluelessness as to why Grendel is eating a Dane Buffet, so Beowulf turns to the local witch/wench. Selma (Polley) is an affront to the Beowulf legend, first of all Polley decides not to even have an accent, instead using her Canadian one. She can see your future death, she has red nappy hair, and she looks like she doesn't want to be there, Secondly there was no woman like her in the poem what so ever. Did they really need a love interest? She admits to being a prostitute, she can understand Grendels language of grunts, and she obviously thinks Beowulf is hot. Grendel doesn't want to kill Beowulf, because he hasn't been harmed by him and BW wants to know why he wants to hurt the King and his subjects, the king however will offer up no explanation. A Geat warrior (Curran) stomps on Grendels daddys head and then he gets peeved, comes to get him and ends up losing his arm (Just like in the Poem) and dies from the wound. Beowulf and his Peeps are then set upon by Grendels Mother. She is a sea hag; with some serious calve muscles, and Beowulf ends up killing her in her lair. There he finds a child guarding Grendels body, which we find out is Grendels child by Selma, they had a nice romantic grunting minute together years back. Beowulf honors Grendel as a warrior, gets his own time with Selma because who hasn't?, and leaves, which basically confused the crud out of me.<br /><br />There is much more to the movie I realize, but why tell this tale and completely make up 99% of it to suite your needs? It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either. Between Selma's Non accent and Grendel feeling randy it lost its heroic beautiful meaning. Gerard Butler is an amazing actor, but he gets glossed over by badly choreographed fights, and a plotline so wierd it felt like a terrible SciFi channel mess. Don't bother buying or renting this if you have any appreciation for the original.the poem what so ever. Did they really need a love interest?

B000H4JGZY|4.0|I have to admit after hearing Sexyback I didn't think much of Justin's new CD but then I heard \\"My Love\\" then \\"What goes Around\\", hearing them made me want to hear the rest of the songs. The song (Another Song) All over again puts me back in the 70's when they really new how to make songs. And that is saying a lot.  Losing My Way is a great song about drug abuse. <br /> <br />A well rounded CD.  Good job Justin transformed from Boy to Man. <br /> <br />L
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I'm a guy of 54, and yet I could cry all the way through this album. <br />Awe-inspiring, heart-felt, poetic, light, dark, transcendent, majestic, beautiful. Along with \\"Fallen\\", probably the best thing to happen musically in decades.  <br /> <br /> <br />
020161622X|5.0|This book is a must read for all developers. It is filled with so many good points. Most of them you probably already know, but don't know you know until they point them out. Others you may already know but just never thought about them a certain way. This book just makes sense.
B000GG4KTU|2.0|What should have been a no-brainer return to form after her tepid foray into singer/songwriter territory on The Girl In The Other Room, Diana Krall's new album of tried-and-true jazz standards backed by a big band never really gets off the ground. While her previous collaboration with the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, Christmas Songs, was a charmer, From This Moment On has too much polish and not enough sparkle and swing, and the tunes just kind of sit there. If you try to please everyone...
0060899190|5.0|I found this book to be a window on human nature - the good, bad and ugly.  The artwork was excellent.  This is an excellent conversation starter.
B000I5X81A|3.0|As a fellow Okie and Tulsan who's seen both JJ and Clapton a number of times I was greatly looking forward to this collaboration, a natural one for obvious reasons.  Unfortunately no matter who \\"dominates\\" on this album, it's  ultimately a bland, safe, and boring endeavor--the songs just don't have any edge to them, either lyrically or musically, and it's a wasted opportunity for two of the greats to really shine.  I'm not saying it doesn't have its pleasures, but with song after song, the arrangements are sleepy and lifeless - as if these two got out of their rocking chairs and jammed after breakfast in between naps. I can't name a song that I want to hear again. You keep thinking something interesting is going to happen on each cut but they all just lay there, lazy and laid-back and ultimately unsatisfying.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|Spoiler alert: First, let me say....I LOVE DONNER! He rocks. I have no doubt this movie would have been hit if Donner had finished what he started. The sad truth is...the movie plays better in Lester's Cut.<br /><br />The Donner Cut did have it's moments. I did liked how Zod and Co. seemed more evil and how Donner's cut removed most of the dubbed-in jokes and one-liners. However, I missed Lester's strong opening with the terrorists/elevator and preferred Lester's answer to how Superman got his powers back. Donner's turning back time was disappointing and left many unanswered questions. Did everyone just forget what happened? Zod's still alive?<br /><br />In short, Donner's verison is interesting, but not as good as the original verison. Rent, don't buy unless your a big Superman/Donner fan!

B000E6FSPW|5.0|This is hands down my favorite motion picture soundtrack of all time!!!  If you like a crisp, intense 80s sound, this is the cd for you.  This cd is loaded with high-energy tracks that will inspire you to accomplish tasks that require great will.  If there were six stars, that's what I would give this track!!!
B00003CXCS|5.0|The best example of Hollywood getting it right. Broadway could never begin to recreate the Austrian Alps like this! The magic of great cinematography. Director Robert Wise wowed film goers with great opening shots of New York skyscrapers in \\"West Side Story,\\" but went one step further in \\"The Sound of Music\\" with its lush mountain beauty. Julie Andrews spinning on top of a mountain peak singing the title song makes for great moments in filmdom.    One of the most family friendly movies of all-time, each viewing takes us back to a time of innocence in our lives. Who doesn't fight back the tears of seeing a harsh Christopher Plummer, playing the widowed father of the Von Trapp clan, allowing his affections to once again break through towards his 7 children, as he joins them in song. Or one of my favorite moments, the \\"So Long, Farewell\\" sung by the children at the  gathering of adult guests. I find myself wanting to wave goodnight to them as well. Sweet and tender, this film melts the heart of even the most \\"manly of men.\\" So pop it into the DVD player, and gather the family around for some old fashioned bonding.    1965 Academy Award winner for Best Picture.
032147404X|5.0|I'd like to be tack sharp even if this is just plain text... this book is literally awesome.<br /><br />It blew my mind, the ease of some hints contained in this book made my photos fly... it is a MUST_HAVE book for any passionate photographer who wants to make the step ahead!
B000002A46|5.0|Do you want Mariah at her very best? Do you want a Christmas CD that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside? This is the one. Not only a top R&B and Pop singer, but with the strong vocals Mariah so powerfully let's loose on this one, she easily could be the top Gospel artist as well, had she chosen that route. I believe she gives her strongest recorded performance here, especially track #3 \\"O Holy Night\\". She's that good.
B000005L86|5.0|You have to wonder why this is one of the few albums that virtually without fault every reviewer has given 5 stars to. <br /> <br />When you start listening you will soon know why.   Its organic, shimmering grooves are simply beyond compare.  It's like nothing you have ever heard, truly awe inspiring, ethereal and deeply spiritual.  It's also an album you can keep coming back to and continue to be amazed by.    <br /> <br />The trademark Perry echoes and ambience sit perfectly with the Congos dual vocalists, augmented by what at times seems to be a celestial choir sent by the most high.   A track like \\"Solid Foundation\\" is a classic example of this.  It's bass throb and percussion would create a masterpiece by itself, but add to that Cedric Mynton's beautiful falsetto brimming with biblical narratives and a choir driving towards religious ecstasy and then tripping out in a dubby coda and you have something utterly unique and wonderous. <br /> <br />I couldn't tell you what my favourite tracks are as there is always something new to visit and wonder at. <br /> <br />Buy this album.  It is a total classic, it sits uniquely within and amongst genres.  You will be amazed and inspired.
0143036742|4.0|You'll likely recognize the pattern from TV comedy shows: how what starts as a fluffy, unconventionally-set caper played for laughs swiftly shifts to murkier, bumpier territory as soon as the characters hit their stride. Thus it is with Lewycka's tale of two sisters who struggle with each other and with Nikolai, their widowed old papa, to save him from a hopeless bust-fixated lust for his voluptuous, voluptuary new bride Valentina, almost fifty years his junior. Valentina has newly arrived in Britain from the old country, Ukraine, from which Nikolai's family fled Hitler and Stalin at the end of World War II, and she is likewise determined to make a new life for herself and her teenage son in what she hopes will prove to be East Anglia's El Dorado.    In younger sibling Nadya's narrative voice, Lewycka's economical prose quickly strips bare the not-so-trivial daily trivialities and ambivalent relationships of the main characters. What at first seems black and white soon resolves itself in shades of grey as we grow less inclined to take Nadya's perspectives at face value. The underpinning themes might easily have tripped a less footsure storyteller: the loss of homeland, innocence and dreams versus Nikolai's naively mechanistic idealism, the challenges of growing old, and the hope for something better in the future regardless of one's shortcomings. Marina Lewycka's novelistic debut is a skilful feat of juggling that portrays her unruly characters with poignancy, comedy and plenty of painful insights.    If your preference is for writers that wield the feather and the dagger with equal skill and gusto, I think you'll like this book.
B0000249ZZ|5.0|This is a masterpiece from many angles. It is a bona fide, kick &%$, rock album, it is tremedous example of smoking blues guitar, and, of course, it is lesson number one for Brittish blues.<br /><br />Eric Clapton established himself as the slinger on this album. He was unsettled with the pop yearnings of the Yardbirds and desired to pursue his blues calling. He also was one of the first guitarists to pick up a Gibson Les Paul and use it for blues music. He loved the fat tone and lasting sustain.<br /><br />There are no highlights on this because every song is a winner. \\"All your love\\" starts out slow, established Mayall's soulful singing, and then picks up the pace with Clapton lighting it all up with a scorching solo.<br /><br />\\"Hideaway\\" is an instrumental standard that is used commercially for an array of projects.<br /><br />Ray Charle's  \\"What'd I say\\" is amped up and much more muscular than what you may be used to hearing.<br /><br />\\"Parchman Farm\\" is a showcase for John Mayall's harp playing and boy... does he ever get soulful. I think that is the high point of the cd.<br /><br />All the songs here have received tons of radio airplay so they are all familiar sounding.<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with this essential work. Blues fans, rock fans Clapton fans and guitar fans...this should be in your collection!

B000J103PC|4.0|I read the book and watched the movie, have to say I like the movie much more than the book.  There have been a lot of movies originated from books(fictions, novels, fables,etc.) in recent years.  I have to say, out of the ones I watched, this movie has made the most interesting choices so far.  It feels lighter without the tough choices and the tragic accident which Andy has to face. Story plots were switched; personalities of charactors were adjusted.  These changes made this movie fun and more suitable for a popcorn night.   <br /> <br />Meryl Streep gave a glowing performance as the \\"devil\\".  The charactor in the book is truly a much worse person and boss.  I don't like Andy's friends and boyfriend in this movie either.  They could've been made less judgemental and more understanding without making Andy and her whole career too inhuman. <br /> <br />There are so much more to say, but over all, watch this movie.  It's fun.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|This is a true classic.  Not only is the storyline intelligent, the acting is excellent and the special effects are so much better than the average 1956 movie.  This one has it all.  I won't put in any spoilers, but this story has many twists and turns before it's finally played out.  As an extra, the model of Robbie the Robot is cute and very detailed, too.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|The movie is technically well made etc and allows one to see Al Gore more of a person than the wooden figure he seemed to be when running for president.  Although parts of the movie seem to play like \\"Al Gore for President Mk II\\" for the most part the movie is non-political and blaming  people seems to be avoided. <br /> <br />The movie is for the most part a recording of a presentation that Al Gore has given many times about global warming.  It seems smooth (but not slick) with touches of humor etc to underline its points.  It is aimed at the non-technical and I would imagine that just about anyone who reads the newspaper will be able to come away from the movie understanding its message. <br /> <br />It would seem that the filming of a lecture style presentation would be boring (I have been to more lectures than I care to remember) but they manage to keep it moving along and I did not find any parts boring or slow. <br /> <br />Given the nature of the debate about global warming, I would watch this to see a good presentation of the issues.  Then you can go decide.
0061092037|2.0|I'm usually very fond of Archer's novels and particularly liked \\"Kane and Abel\\"...in fact, it is probably one of the best books I've ever read and it immediately moved Archer to my list of \\"favorite authors.\\"  He's very much at home in multiple genres, ranging from multi-generation sagas to spy thrillers to political dramas to short stories.<br /><br />This book opens with nearly the same premise as Kane and Abel...two children born in very different circumstances on opposite sides of the globe who grow to become arch nemises.  With expectations that we'd be treated to another K&A, this book fell short in numerous ways...so short that I lost interest partway through and just skipped to the end.  For me, the main problem was the characters themselves - like two self-absorbed asteroids hurtling towards each other, I just really didn't care if they obliterated themselves in the end.<br /><br />For those who know the industry, it isn't too hard to guess who Archer patterned his two media-mogul main characters after.  They aren't the most lovable guys in the world, just like the characters in the book.  Their business-is-war and take-no-prisoners attitude towards life and career isn't particularly endearing, and as a result, Archer managed to somehow give us two antagonists rather than dual protagonists as in Kane and Abel.<br /><br />There are other Archer novels that far surpass this one, most notably \\"As the Crow Flies\\" and \\"Kane and Abel.\\"  I like much of Archer's work...just not this one.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I heard this disc while Christmas shopping in a little boutique and I asked the clerk what the name of the disc was because it sounded phenomenal.

Every song is incredibly done....this is a Must Have!!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|An annual self-assessment for this reviewer is to time myself on when I,  more-sentimental-every-year fool that I am becoming, start blubbering. It used to be that I could last until the bell rang, but as more and more of those near and dear to me depart this earth, I realize more the value of those who remain. So then I started breaking down when the bushel basket of money came in, and this year, when George/Jimmy finds himself back on the Bridge, alive and himself.  May we all live long enough to regress to the opening credits!<br /><br />I haven't owned an edition since VHS, so this special 60th Anniversary edition is indeed a refreshed \\"I can see clearly now\\" experience of Bedford Falls.  And the added features are edifying.  W.C. Fields was considered for the part of Uncle Billy? Miss Melanie a/k/a Olivia de Havilland as Mary Bailey?  What a charmed confluence of coincidence, then, to create the Cosmic Kapra Karmaic cast! /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer
3832791620|3.0|having just received this book I very quickly came to the conclusion that the \\"design\\" is a serious impediment to using and enjoying the book.  First of all the weight, size and bulk make it impossible to enjoy with any degree of comfort - and at normal 'reading distances' the double page spreads require the head to roam around the page.  Secondly, many of the images across double pages have their effect ruined by the spine.  Many of the double page spreads are grossly over enlarged - some are rather out of focus to start with.  Anybody interested in Erwitt would find much in these pages to enjoy, and indeed many of the images are of great quality. Sad that the \\"designer\\" has strove to acheive the wow factor associated with a slab of book on a bookshelf, rather than actually try to understand the elementary aspects of using and enjoying a book.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|As a fan of this group's previous release, Fallen, I was prepared to be disappointed with The Open Door.  My first listen seemed to confirm it:  a couple of songs clearly with promising hooks, but my overall impression was that the group had come back to earth with a much more mediocre effort.  A month later, it has become obvious to me that my first impression was completely wrong:  the new release is at least the equal of Fallen, and The Open Door may ultimately be judged to be the superior album.  Amy Lee's powerful vocals are front and center on every cut, as they should be.  If Amy Lee is not the gold standard of female pop/rock singers, I can't think of who is.  OK, comparing singers involves making very subjective judgements.  I saw Grace Slick live at a concert at the Atlantic City race track a few weeks before Woodstock.  Saw Janis Joplin from the edge of the stage pretty late in her career.  So, we're talking geezer here.  Anyway, I agree with the others who have complemented the production values of The Open Door:  Amy Lee's voice is right there for you with its full power, the amazing emotional range and its unique expressiveness.  And the songwriting is very solid; there are at least a half a dozen excellent tunes on this new album.  So, plunk down your 12 bucks, take your time and savor this one.
0618680004|5.0|Many have criticized this book for not speaking in a voice that could influence religious fundamentalists away from their delusion. There is no way the topic can be discussed that would have any hope of doing this. It would be akin to writing a book that through gentle persuasion would reason a paranoid out of his delusions. Ain't going to happen. <br /> <br />I believe the intended audience is those who already have grave doubts, and are looking for a well reasoned examination of the issue. I was impressed by the simple and straightforward approach to resolving a basic question: \\"since we can't know for sure if God exists, shouldn't we all be agnositics?\\" <br /> <br />I also enjoyed his definition of a pantheist (I'll leave that for the reader to discover). <br /> <br />The opening sections on Einstein and his \\"religious\\" beliefs, and a general discussion of pantheism and deism are worth the price of the book just by themselves. <br /> <br />As an aside -- those reviewers who cite Einstein's religious conversion away from atheism have clearly not read even this much of the book. <br /> <br />Written with great humor and wonderful quotations -- I am sure there is something here to offend just about everyone -- but also with great courage and forthrightfullness.
B000001EUR|5.0|George Orwell was wrong. 1984 was the year of the Scorpion. The German quintet exploded into superstardom with the release of \\"Love At First Sting\\". The album featured three songs that made the Billboard Top 100, and the album itself peaked at number 6 on the Billboard album chart. The phenomenal success of the album sparked an 18-month world tour, which then fueled their second live recording, `World Wide Live'. A small aside: in the summer of 1984, as a 23 year-old music industry professional I had the good fortune to gain access to the Scorpions' sound check in Winnipeg, Canada, where I stood next to the mixing console, shoulder to shoulder with then little-known rock icons John Bongiovi and Richard Sambora, enjoying a fantastic half-hour experience.    There isn't a bad track on this album. From the pure metal of \\"Coming Home\\" to the staccato drumbeat in the anti-war \\"Crossfire\\", this album has all the melody, metal, and meat that Scorpions fans have come to expect. There is a reason that this was their greatest commercial success - it's a great album, not just as a period piece, but as a wonderful piece of work that has ably stood the test of time.     A small piece of trivia: although Francis Buchholtz is credited for playing on the album, and in fact toured with the band following the album's release, and is in the cover photo, it was Dio bassist Jimmy Bain who did the bass parts while recording the album.
1400049628|5.0|I have read this book front to back 5 times.  I want more!!!!!
B00009V7P8|5.0|...and not having to discover that you have been mistaken. That's the best that can happen I think. And so it went with this album. It went straight to my favourite top 10 (or even top 5) and I'm sure it will stay there. <br /> <br />This is music with a soul and true emotion. Something else than faked cry-ballads sung by screaming girls who are in an ongoing contest with other sreaming girls about who can reach the highest note and can scream at the top of their lungs best. Because then it is more heartfelt of course. Not. <br /> <br />Well if you want to caress your ears and feed your soul, listen to Damien Rice and Lisa Hannnigan.  <br /> <br />And if you are looking for more of this kind maybe this is something for you: <br /> <br />- Glen Phillips \\"Abulum\\", \\"Mr. Lemons\\". He's my all-time-favourite ever since the days of Toad The Wet Sprocket and he keeps getting better. Haunting melodies, significant lyrics, amazing voice.   <br /> <br />- David Mead \\"Indiana\\". He was highly recommended by Glen Phillips on his weblog and I thank him for that. A quiet, acoustic, laid-back album to come down and dream away. I especially like the combination between the cello and David's wonderful voice.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I've seen this movie 3 times, and the 3 times I've loved it. Daniel Craig gives and outstanding performance, shows how Bond 'evolutioned' from his first mission to the other James Bond flicks. James Bond in love?! well, I somehow think they added this into the movie to show why Bond is so cold with women in the past movies. Ignore what others say that Craig is not Bond, the movie sucks, etc, because until you see it, you'll see if it's true or not.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I can't believe that Gwen Stefani made this album. Don't waste your money.
B000001EUL|5.0|Scorpions take a giant step forward on this album. Some sources say brilliant, yet eclectic guitarist Uli Jon Roth was already on his way out due to \\"creative differences\\", others say the band released him following \\"Taken By Force\\". Whatever the case, Scorpions hired relative unknown prodigy Mattias Jabs to take over lead guitar duties...that is, until Scorpions also welcomed back Rudolf Schenker's little brother Michael. Jabs was fired in the middle of recording, but was eventually rehired when Michael eventually cratered. Bringing Michael Schenker onboard was simultaneously a stroke of genius and idiocy by the band. He was a musical genius, but his ousting from UK-based melodic metal band UFO due to substance abuse was well- documented. It was thought Rudolf could keep him in check, but unfortunately, Michael is one of those musical geniuses who periodically, inexplicably, self-destruct. Alas, the lineup that all Scorpions fans had waited years to see was short-lived. Still, his contributions to the album are profound. Despite only getting writing and playing credits on three songs, \\"Another Piece Of Meat\\", \\"Lovedrive\\", and the groove-laden \\"Coast To Coast\\", the playing is brilliant and all three songs remain fan favorites. His impact on the album can not be understated, and most fans feel that having Michael Schenker in the band, even for a short while, was the creative influence that put the German quintet on the road to superstardom. Mattias Jabs, finally a permanent part of the group, makes his presence known on several gems, including the reggae-influenced \\"Is There Anybody There?\\" and Scorpions first real power-ballad, \\"Always Somewhere\\". Is this their best overall work? Maybe, but I would certainly argue that a some of their later releases, namely `Crazy World', `Savage Amusement', and `Love At First Sting\\" rank right up there as well.     In this case I have to agree with reviewer William Edwards, who made a point of mentioning the rythym guitar work of Rudolf Schenker. Rudolf brings his axe to the forefront in this, and all future Scorpions releases. It's tough to claim that rythym guitar playing can be called \\"intricate\\", but his multi-layered yet complementary layers add a texture and richness that is uniquely Scorpions. If you don't yet own a Scorpions album, this is a great place to start.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|There are millions memories I would never trade. FRIENDS has always been my favourite show on TV. It's witty, funny and above all, memorable. Each chacters are unnique and in there on ways, can be related by all others. This show is a must for anyone who stills hesitate to see it.  <br /> <br />As for this new boxset, I owned both FRIENDS box; The One With All Ten Seasons and The Complete Series. I can garantee you that it worth every penny I paid. Both came with superb package again with different style; it is highly recommended you buy both if you are a true FRIENDS fans.
B0002SROT0|5.0|this album is like nothing else i've ever heard.  elliott smith takes a feeling, whether he means to or not, and conveys it more intensely to his listener than possibly any other musician i've ever heard.  the writing is of the highest possible level. 'basement on a hill' is full of puns and metaphors, adding a feeling of multiple layers of meaning to each song.  the music is innovative and stretches the realm of anything smith accomplished before.  he maintains his classic layered vocals while adding more electronic 'trippy' type music over the crisp acoustic bits recorded for this album.  i actually disliked this album for about 1.5 years after accidentally buying it.  for some reason, i listened occasionally, set it aside, and for the last two years, i've been addicted to it--finding myself listening to this album several times in a row and craving certain songs only hours after i'd last heard them.  the songs seem to change with every listening.  it's raw.  it's eclectic.  it may not even be what he intended.  but this sometimes eerie, sometimes painfully sensitive album pulls at something in me enough to want to share it with as many people as possible.  if you liked his other albums, don't pass this one by, and don't give up on it early.  also, check out the free b-sides on the web that didn't make the cut for this album.  notably, 'true love.'  can't miss.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Despite its box-office longevity, the James Bond franchise has been creatively bankrupt for years. Taking a page from the \\"Batman Begins\\" playbook, the 007 producers finally return to Ian Fleming's original creation - with an actor capable of redefining Bond while giving Sean Connery a run for his money. Thanks to Daniel Craig's masterful performance, a solid screenplay and Martin Campbell's bravura direction, \\"Casino Royale\\" emerges as the finest 007 effort since \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" (1969). Rarely has a Bond adventure contained so many terrific setpieces - accompanied by a strong emotional depth. When Craig's hard-edged 007 delivers the immortal closing line, we're revved up for the next installment.
B00005QBER|5.0|Scorpions take a giant step forward on this album. Some sources say brilliant, yet eclectic guitarist Uli Jon Roth was already on his way out due to \\"creative differences\\", others say the band released him following \\"Taken By Force\\". Whatever the case, Scorpions hired relative unknown prodigy Mattias Jabs to take over lead guitar duties...that is, until Scorpions also welcomed back Rudolf Schenker's little brother Michael. Jabs was fired in the middle of recording, but was eventually rehired when Michael eventually cratered. Bringing Michael Schenker onboard was simultaneously a stroke of genius and idiocy by the band. He was a musical genius, but his ousting from UK-based melodic metal band UFO due to substance abuse was well- documented. It was thought Rudolf could keep him in check, but unfortunately, Michael is one of those musical geniuses who periodically, inexplicably, self-destruct.  Alas, the lineup that all Scorpions fans had waited years to see was short-lived. Still, his contributions to the album are profound. Despite only getting writing and playing credits on three songs, \\"Another Piece Of Meat\\", \\"Lovedrive\\", and the groove-laden \\"Coast To Coast\\", the playing is brilliant and all three songs remain fan favorites. His impact on the album can not be understated, and most fans feel that having Michael Schenker in the band, even for a short while, was the creative influence that put the German quintet on the road to superstardom. Mattias Jabs, finally a permanent part of the group, makes his presence known on several gems, including the reggae-influenced \\"Is There Anybody There?\\" and Scorpions first real power-ballad, \\"Always Somewhere\\". Is this their best overall work? Maybe, but I would certainly argue that a some of their later releases, namely `Crazy World', `Savage Amusement', and `Love At First Sting\\" rank right up there as well.     A couple of final things. Rudolf brings rythym guitar work to the forefront in this, and all future Scorpions releases. It's tough to claim that rythym guitar playing can be called \\"intricate\\", but his multi-layered yet complementary layers add a texture and richness that is uniquely Scorpions. The fantastic original album cover art featured here was censored for widespread North American release - if you have an original copy in great shape, it's a collector's item.     If you don't yet own a Scorpions album, this is a great place to start.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Cue the music! Rocky Balboa, the most beloved onscreen character and highly anticipated sequel of the the year, is back!    Written and directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone in the role that made him a movie star, Rocky Balboa, like the title character, triumphs. This film could end up being the surprise hit of the year.    16 years have passed since the last Rocky movie, part 5 that is, Rocky is now a widow; Adrian has been dead for nearly 3 years (Talia Shire appears only in flashbacks). It's a walk down memory lane in the first third of the film as Rocky visits the places he and Adrian met and went to in their early days accompanied by Paulie who dreads the annual ritual because it reminds him of how bad he was to his sister. When he's not touring the sites, Rocky is sitting at Adrian's grave pondering what's left of his own life.    Rocky has closed the doors of Mickey's gym, and is now the owner of a local restaurant named after his late wife. Rocky goes around the restarant every now and then, telling customers stories of his glory days. One of his regular patrons is Spider Rico, the guy he fought and defeated in the opening minutes of the original Rocky. Another old face in the neighborhood Rocky bumps into is 'little' Marie, the girl who once told him \\"Screw you, Creepo\\" after walking her home and giving her advice on how to live her life. She ends up being a pivotal character in Rocky's post-Adrian life. She even reminds him of Adrian with her encouragement, and support. However, their relationship does not evolve into romance, which is quite understandable.    Rocky is in pain. He's old and lonely. He regains the passion to fight again to unleash the 'beast' that is still inside of him. His son, played by Milo Ventimiglia, is striving to find his place in the corporate world but can't escape dad's shadow; and as a result despises his father's decision to return to the ring. Things get heated up when ESPN airs a computer generated fight between the new champ Mason The Line Dixon, played by real life boxr Antonio Tarver, who is disregarded by the boxing community as a phony, and Rocky. Computer says that Rocky would win by knockout. This causes a stir with the press and fans, and gives both Dixon and Rocky the chance to prove their worthiness.     Rocky Balboa succeeds in exploring Rocky's inner feelings at his old age. The scene where Rocky expresses that he still has 'stuff in the basement' to Paulie is extremely convincing, especially when the grieving Rocky breaks down in tears. There's also the scene where Rocky angrily refutes the Boxing Commission's refusal to renew his boxing license, a scene so intense, many members in the audience cheered. It's a powerful performance by Sly that will leave audiences wondering why this man has never had the chance to evolve properly as a character actor. Oscar, anyone?    The climactic fight scene at the end is incredible. Even the commentator in the movie says he can't believe he is only moments away from watching Rocky fight again. That's exactly the same feeling I had. When the fight did begin, I was literally on the edge of my seat. Stallone's directing is so precise that Rocky's final round, both in the ring and on the movie screens, goes down in style.    Would I pay to watch it again?    Yo, absolutely!    Recommended    A-
6305546789|5.0|I can ( and HAVE ) watched this movie a MILLION times. I first saw it when I was a LITTLE girl, and it scared the bejesus out of me, and it STILL spooks me when I hear that music and see Micheal Myers casually strolling after Laurie. Great movie!!!!!!
0743298020|5.0|A lot of reviewers have compared this book to JANE EYRE.  However, it reminds me more of WUTHERING HEIGHTS.  It totally draws the reader into the world of Margaret and Vida.  I'm sure reviewers will call it a \\"future classic\\".<br /><br />NOTE: It's very disappointing that the Amazon reviewer gives away a key fact in her review/summary.  That is unnecessary, and unethical.
B00006RINF|4.0|I was skeptical at first, especially after ppl said they sound like Evanescence, who I dont like at all, except maybe \\"My immortal\\" because the vocals are pretty good in that, the rest of the band is just not talented in any way and the song writing is overly simplistic. <br /> <br />Lacuna coil tends to be similar in those aspects, but the female vocals in my opinion are less annoying and kinda sweeter and softer. Not only that, I love the EQ on the drums, the drum tech and producers have done an excellent job there. The overall mixing is done really well, the strings (synth) arent overbearing, at the same time not too soft, pretty good balance.  <br /> <br />There are only two reasons I gave this a 4, infact I would give a 3.5 if I could. First off, I dont think the male vocals are that good. Some one has written in one of the reviews that he sounds like \\"Metallica front man\\" (James Hetfield). I had a hard time keeping myself from laughing after reading that. James is one of the most talented vocalists ever, I have no clue how they could even compare the voices, they arent similar in any way. I find that Andrea tries a bit too hard sometimes, trying to stress stuff, in the end that just sounds lame. <br /> <br />My other gripe is the simplistic song writing. Although it lends itself well to the smooth female vocals, it is overly simple sometimes, which is annoying since the instruments really dont have much to do. I dont want everyone to go the Prog direction, but a little improvisation would go a long way in making the songs more dynamic and enjoyable for longer periods of time. <br />But nevertheless, do check this album out, its a good one, there are some really good songs in there. Dont want to sit and rate them one by one, just listen to it a few times, you should be able to figure out the rest.
B00005U122|5.0|Granted, this is not Pink Floyd, but Roger Waters assembled a great group of supporting musicians for this tour. Doyle Bramhall II looks a little out of his element, but he handles some faithful renditions of legendary David Gilmour solos.  A definite must for any Floyd fan.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|Watch the movie, it will be a great investment of your time. The Author of the book is also the screenwriter, so the movie is a good rendition and hold true to the book. <br />Many elements of the story will resonate with you on some and/or many level(s).  <br />This is a compelling story about a man who ventures on a great journey and learns some basic spiritual principals that were written long ago about our current human situation in life. These writings speak to elements of life that all of us have experienced on some level.  <br />The main character discovers this understanding along with the viewer, but he is thrust into a dire need to put them to work immediately.  <br /> Watch the movie, read the book, do both or either, they will expand your horizon and perspective and open your eyes to things in your life that were there all along, but you just weren't looking at it and could not see it clearly.
B00005JPDJ|4.0|Kate Winslet is Iris, a prim young Englishwoman whose unrequitted love for a seemingly clueless ex-boyfriend is eating her alive.  Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a rather spastic American businesswoman for whom love has once again proven an unfaithful affair.  When the two swap houses for a two-week holiday at Chritmas time, will it be the new beginning both women need, or just another pitfall in the jungle of life? <br /> <br />It's a good plot, and one the leads carry off remarkably well.  Winslet and Diaz each do a good job of bringing their well-written roles to life, and Jude Law, Rufus Sewell and Jack Black are equally strong as the men in their lives.  Eli Wallach is great in a surprising and important role as a retired Hollywood screenwriter, and the friendship between he and Iris is stirring to watch develop.  The aforementioned script is rich and well-conceived, rarely descending to the low level common to most romantic comedies, and the opening monologue from Iris in which she bares her soul and describes the pangs of unrequitted love is the essence of truth.   <br /> <br />Though not what I would call a cinema classic, THE HOLIDAY is an enjoyable, frequently inspiring date movie that I am glad to have taken my wife to.  Recommended to all couples who love watching movies together.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Like many fans have described it's not LAMB--however, there are still some new wave tracks on the sweat escape.  The strongest new wave track being wonderful life.  <br /> <br />When I heard wonderful life, I recognized a Depeche Mode sound within the first two bars. I looked in the CD insert and confirmed Martin L. Gore of Depeche Mode played guitar and keyboard on wonderful life. Lyrically it gets a bit too repetitive and the track would have been stronger with simpler percussion. There was enough texture in the song with the guitar and keyboard running though the synth.  <br /> <br />U started it was another strong track, its kind of new wave meets r&b. It's a good song, however, it's appeal for me is limited--as a strong Depeche Mode fan, I prefer something a bit more depressing LOL.   <br /> <br />Gwen's like of new wave music is self evident in her music and I personally feel her best work is the new wave stuff. Perhapes if she continued with a new wave approach, maybe one day, she could sell out the Rose Bowl as Depeche Mode did in 88. <br /> <br />If you're interested in New Wave check out the following bands: Depeche Mode, The Human League, OMD, Howard Jones, New Order, A Flock of Seagulls, INXS, U2, Duran Duran, David Bowie, and many others.  <br />
B000E8NRR6|5.0|Maybe you're like me.  Pretty loyal Steely Dan fan, but not really a big fan of Donald Fagen's solo work.  The Nightfly and Kamakiriad have some good songs, and they sound great, but the lyrics and their stories... they're just not as strong as the songs written with Walter Becker.  (Yes, I do own WB's solo disc 11 Tracks of Whack, and I like it a lot.)   <br /> <br />But I like Morph the Cat a lot, too.  The music sounds great and is played well, and if you want to focus on the lyrics, there's enough there to keep your interest as well. <br /> <br />You just *know* that this CD could have been shorter, that some of the songs -- maybe all of them -- have more material on them than they need... but they don't sound padded to me.   <br /> <br />The only exception is Brite Nitegown, which goes about 8 choruses too long.  But hey, that's what audio editing programs like GoldWave and Soundforge are for -- 2 snips, and the version on the CD burned for my car has only 3 choruses at the end.   <br /> <br />At the same time, the music that follows the final words in The Great Pagoda of Funn and Mary Shut the Garden Door could just go on and on and I wouldn't complain or snip a note.
B000GOSVEW|1.0|I have tried to download this for 11 days. The process stopped and re-started 4 times. do not use UNBOX VIDEO it is customer un-friendly and the support people can't even understand or speak English!

B00000J2PH|5.0|I am a child of the 70's and I remember my parents playing this record on the stereophonic many times. Not only is every song an original Carole King composition, it is a masterpiece. This is a brilliant album that is deemed truly timeless. It is a treasure for older fans and the best album to listen to if you're curious about King's work over the years. <br /> <br />The album was successful commercially as well, selling over 11 million copies and earning King 4 Grammy awards. The singles released off the album were all hits - \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\", \\"So Far Away\\", \\"It's Too Late\\" and more. There are also recordings on this album that will be familiar to you as they were previously recorded by other artists (i.e. \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" - The Shirelles, \\"You've Got A Friend\\" - James Taylor and \\"You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman\\" - Aretha Franklin) but what stands out most is knowing that King composed these songs and it's a privilege to hear her sing them the way they were meant to be performed - of course, without disrespecting the performances of the above mentioned artists who gave us solid renditions of these classics. <br /> <br />Tapestry will continue to be recognized as a timeless album that touches all of us - regardless of the mood we're feeling. Carole King continues to be an influential and inspiring artist and if you end up loving Tapestry, be sure to pick up a copy of her live CD - \\"Carole King - The Carnegie Hall Concert 1971\\" where she performs many of these hits and other originals in a live acoustic piano setting to a packed house. Magical!!
B00005JPGM|5.0|I am very proud of Mr. DiCaprio. He is amassing quite and impressive body of work both artistically and politically. He appears to be picking his movies and parts carefully. There have been a whole genre of political movies made within the last 4-5 yrs or so that have been doing a very good job of getting out global information to the public -- which is what the American media should be doing but somehow cannot or will not. \\"Blood Diamond\\" is one of those movies that hopefully will make you think and reconsider your purchasing habits and how something so simple can affect other people (especially children) half way around the world.<br /><br />This movie is serious and worth seeing. It put me in a really bad mood, but also made me determined to monitor my purchasing habits so that I do not contribute to that vicious cycle which is war, greed and poverty.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Stallone deserves praise for taking the time and effort to see that the ROCKY series ends on a proper note and comes \\"full circle\\" instead of having an American Icon fade away in disgrace as would have been the case if we had been left with Rocky 5.<br /><br />In many ways this film is a \\"mirror\\" or an \\"opposite book-end\\" to Rocky I as we basically see a man who has come full circle in life with the similiar challenges only made different by the passage of time.<br /><br />Unrelated to the movie itself, Stallone also deserves credit for showing that \\"60 is the new 40\\" in today's society for people who are dedicated enough to diet and exercise.<br /><br />Not only does he look great for 60 in this film, he looks better than 50% of the population in their 30s.<br /><br />I also see a \\"need\\" for this film in todays' American society.<br /><br />In 1976-1977, when the first Rocky came out, America was at a lowpoint in terms of image, self-esteem, respect, etc....<br /><br />Much of this of course is due to one of our worst Presidents ever.... Jimmy Carter.<br /><br />Rocky became a mobilizing icon to remind Americans about dedication, hard work, sacrifice, and \\"never giving up\\".<br /><br />Thru the 80s, America refound itself, Reagan ended the Cold War, the Berlin Wall was torn down, etc...<br /><br />In other words, instead of being negative, America made things happen in the world !<br /><br />Now in late 2006, we have a similiar situation.<br /><br />Much of America has grown soft, fat, lazy, happy and stupid as a result<br /><br />of having it too good for too long.<br /><br />People criticize those trying to take action to protect this Country from an impending crisis.<br /><br />(apparently 50% of our society has no knowledge of history or they would clearly see the importance of action TODAY in the Middle East before we get to the point England, France and Germany are facing already today).<br /><br />Getting to the point.... too many Americans today are apathetic, soft and are trying to rationalize \\"no action\\" as a way to live their lives in \\"cushy\\" ignorance of reality.<br /><br />Perhaps if we are fortunate, the film ROCKY BALBOA can do for us today  what it did for America in 1977................. namely, get people to remember what hard work, sacrfice, duty, standing for principles and \\"never giving up\\" really means.<br /><br />Hopefully this current generation can recapture at lease a glimmer of what made the WW2 generation so strong.<br /><br />Only then can we get back on track and remake America great again as opposed to the disentrgrating cesspool of decadence it is becoming now (like a repeat of the Roman Empire 400AD).<br /><br />\\"Yo, Aint so bad... hit me again\\"oft and are trying to rationalize \\"no action\\" as a way to live their lives in \\"cushy\\" ignorance of reality. <br /> <br />Perhaps if we are fortunate, the film ROCKY BALBOA can do for us today  what it did for America in 1977................. namely, get people to remember what hard work, sacrfice, duty, standing for principles and \\"never giving up\\" really means. <br /> <br />Hopefully this current generation can recapture at lease a glimmer of what made the WW2 generation so strong. <br />Only then can we get back on track and remake America great again as opposed to the disentrgrating cesspool of decadence it is becoming now (like a repeat of the Roman Empire 400AD). <br /> <br />\\"Yo, Aint so bad... hit me again\\"
B000ICL3KG|5.0|'An Inconvenient Truth' is a documentary based on Al Gore's slide show lecture on global warming. Surprisingly, the show is very interesting, but quite disturbing. Gore drives home point after point with fact after concrete fact on why Global Warming is such a serious issue. He does it in a way that keeps you interested, even entertained.<br /><br />The show concludes with possibly the most important message anyone could give. In essence, 'An Inconvenient Truth' is a call to action to fight against global warming.<br /><br />I first saw this movie at the cinema with some friends. The show's message was driven so deeply into me, I was paranoid when we drove home, that the fumes from our vehicle was contributing to global warming.<br /><br />This is one of those documentaries you should watch with the whole family. The message is powerful, moving and above all, very, very important. A must-see.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this album - particularly while I'm driving. Real soulful feel and heartwarming, truthful lyrics. The album starts off on the right note with \\"Waiting for the World to Change\\" and other faves include \\"Belief\\", \\"Stop This Train\\" and his cover of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Bold as Love\\". A brilliant album for John Mayer fans everywhere and a great way to be introduced to his musical catalogue. If you're a fan of Bonnie Raitt, particularly her latest album \\"Souls Alike\\", you'll notice many similarities between the two CDs. Enjoy.
B000002J5K|5.0|Is it possible for anyone to dislike the soundtrack to one of the greatest musical films of all time???  From the opening track of \\"She Caught the Katy\\" to the closing track of \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", the Blues Brothers deliver a solid performance on each and every song on the album.  While the movie and soundtrack are obviously comical (i.e \\"Theme from Rawhide\\", and if you disagree, you've got some obvious developmental issues with your funny bone), the music is nothing less than great.  Yes, I realize that Dan and John might not be the greatest singers/musicians of all time, but what they did for R&B has been more prolific not only for R&B, but for music as a whole in our great United States.  I'd love to see anyone pull off (now) what Jake and Elwood did in their time.  I think G. Love & Special Sauce are great, as I do John Spencer, but what Jake and Elwood did for American music in the late 70's and early 80's has been unparalleled.  Don't get me wrong, I love Jake and Elwood, but the Blues Brothers band is definitely more talented than the \\"Brothers\\".  Knowing the history of the band, it's hard to ignore the talent of the band, and not give \\"props\\" to Cropper, Dunn, etc.  I don't care what a anyone else \\"thinks\\", this is a great album!!!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Just like 'The Squid and the Whale' and 'The Royal Tenenbaums' before it, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a quirky, comedy masterpiece about a dysfunctional family and their quests for love and greatness.  The father (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker who echoes Ricky Bobby's dad in 'Talledega Nights'.  (\\"If you're not a winner, then you're a loser.\\")  He is an angry and frustrated patriarch who has difficulty living up to his own advice.  He's overbearing even with his understanding, loving wife (Toni Collette of 'Sixth Sense' fame), and his family shows that not only success, but love is missing in the family equation.      The grandfather (Adam Arkin) is a foul-mouthed heroin addict who, unlike his son, shoots straight from the hip.  His teenage son, Duane, is a goth silent type who only communicates with a notepad.  His brother, and their uncle, is gay and has just attempted suicide before living with the family, interestingly enough sharing Duane's bedroom where they can have heart-to-heart talks.  The daughter (Abigail Breslin) is sweet, perceptive, and charming.  She's an arm for the family ego, so she is a candidate for \\"Little Miss Sunshine,\\"   a nauseatingly glamorous child beauty contest taking place in California.    Many mishaps come along the way as the whole family goes from Arizona to the Redondo Beach contest in an aging Volkswagon van.  The grandfather has a lot to say on the journey, including a shaking piece of wisdom for his granddaughter the night before the contest.  Having the pre-contest jitters, she hears her grandfather say, \\"A real loser is someone who is so afraid of losing, they're afraid to try.\\"  The uncle also has much wisdom, including some advice to Duane about suffering that he seems to need and hear for himself in the same meeting.  With the admonition that our society has a low tolerance for failure, and the wit and laughter to set us all straight, 'Little Miss Sunshine' remains a sage and funny family satire.  (It is rated 'R,'so the laughs may be only for those family members at your discretion--mainly for a lot of profanity.)
B00008DDRX|5.0|What an amazing automobile. A beast that will tear up the road for 24 hours straight. If you have seen this car run in the flesh you know what I mean. If you haven't - get to you vintage race and you might get lucky. Either way get this movie. It's hard to get tired of. An excellent portait of the car.
B000HIVO64|5.0|While Beck's earlier work (who can look at Odelay and not say \\"masterpiece?\\") was brilliant in a raw way, I think he's gotten more refined and yet has developed more depth over the years.  I totally fell in love with Guero and wondered if he could keep the pace going.  To my surprise, I like parts of The Information even better.  It's more techno, which I like, and yes, darker.  What I get out of this CD is a love/hate affair with technology & the alienation it brings to our lives.  We can cross the world in seconds thanks to the net, and yet we are more distant, isolating within ourselves.  This is a CD for the current day...it's wired, and so are we.  And there's no going back.
032147404X|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted Short sweet and to the point I give it 5 stars & kudos to Scott Kelby.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I'll be brief. This album is almost too good. There are parts, especially during \\"Delicate\\" and \\"Cannonball,\\" when I actually have a physical reaction to the tremor of the vocals. Maybe I'm a bit behind on the times, but I have had this album practically on loop for the last three days. I can't get over it. We need more toe curling music like this.
B000J103PC|4.0|This was a cute movie that really had me guessing throughout to see how it would end up.  The ending was sort of a surprise since it doesn't really go in either of the two directions you would think based on so many other movies of this type.  The situations were funny and I didn't find the movie to drag at any point.

B00005JPDS|5.0|There has been much criticism by other reviewers with regards to this movie and I want to start of my review by saying that I found this movie to be truly inspiring.  Take away the true \\"cuteness\\" between Will Smith - the main  character - and his son, who is also his real life son.  Take away Smith's great acting skills (Note: he has come a far way from \\"The Prince of Bel-Air\\").  Take also away the good camera movement and the editing.  What you are left with is a story of a man who despite his social standing, his nonsupporting wife, his skin color, his education, his age and his lack of \\"luck\\" goes after what he wants.  And Smith's character does not just go after it, he pursues it.   He puts all his effort, all his time and all his strength into building a better life for himself and his son.   <br /> <br />The story is obvious from the beginning, but nonetheless, the viewer is drawn in and is rooting for the underdog.  We applaud his persistence when he goes after the head of HR at a large company, demanding an in-person interview to be accepted into a apprenticeship position.  We are cheering at his ingenuity when instead of listening to his trainer to move from the bottom of a calling sheet, he immediately goes to the top.  We are amazed about his sincerity when he goes to someone's house to apologize for being late. <br /> <br />What is important to note is that Smith's character is rarely seen to use government services for help.  We never see him using food stamps and he only at the very end stays at a local shelter.  Smith's character is a man who uses his wits, his determination and his drive to move himself into a position that in the end will allow him to build the life that he envisions for himself and his son. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie for families with teenagers, who will benefit greatly from such an uplifting story.  The lesson here is that the American dream does not just have to be a dream, but that hard work and persistence willmake it a reality.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I remember when this film was first released, the immediate buzz and praise it received, and the expression on my face after the credits began to roll.  I was in utter awe, and rightfully so.  Until `Batman Begins' there hadn't been a single superhero movie that could compare.  `Spider-Man' marks the beginning of the `serious' superhero film, the film that's more about plot and relationships then about high adrenaline action sequences (although they are here in large heaping amounts).  Sam Raimi and David Koepp brought to life one of the most revered and beloved comic book heroes and did so brilliantly. <br /> <br />First smart move was the casting choices.  Tobey Maguire was a genius choice for Peter Parker.  Peter Parker was a nerdy loner and looking at Tobey you'd assume the same for him.  He has that awkward appearance, that fearful and cautious step and that guilt written all over his face.  He plays this role perfectly.  Kirsten Dunst was also a wonderful pick for Mary Jane Watson, Peters love interest.  Anyone would have to be blind not to fall in love with her.  Willem Dafoe finally impressed me, mostly because the role of Norman Osborn (the Green Goblin) just seems like the role he was born to perform, and James Franco is good as Harry, Norman's son, although he (it this film at least) is more background noise. <br /> <br />The second smart move was making this a much more `bright' superhero film.  What I mean is, instead of following the darker subtext of films like the original `Batman' or `Daredevil', `Spider-Man' is almost a happy film.  It never falls into camp, like the horrid `Batman & Robin', but it keeps things on the up and up, cheery and...happy.  Yes I know it deals with issues like the death of Peter's Uncle Ben and the psychosis of a said crazy Green Goblin, but the action and animation is done in such bright, crisp way that the mood is never heavy and never detracts from the enjoyment of the film. <br /> <br />The third smart move was takingthe time to really develop the main characters and explain the origin of Spider-Man, never rushing into things nor bogging the film down with `too-much' information, but giving us a perfect balance.  By the end of the film you truly care about Peter and his plight.  He's more than just an action-hero...he's a human being with real problems and distractions and concerns and you want him to succeed.  You want him to `get-the-girl'. <br /> <br />`Spider-Man' will probably be remembered as the first of the `great' superhero movies.  Finally a superhero film was taken serious, was worked and brought to cinematic perfection, not taken lightly and thrown together, but molded into a great movie.  It breaks itself away from the mold of generic superhero action film and becomes, in of its own, a brilliant MOVIE...one that everyone can and should enjoy!
B000IMUYJM|5.0|I'm ashamed of myself. I'm a big horror/scary movie fan, but this is the first time I have ever seen the quiet little gem that is Black Christmas. Where have I been and what can I do to make up for the loss?. Watch it dozens of times this holiday season?. Okay!. Director Bob Clark's film is a beautiful movie. But more on that later. Widely reported that the film is similar in ways to Halloween, but Halloween came out 4 years later, is true. A few girls stalked by a maniacal killer in a big house on a holiday. Okay. POV shots of the killer's vision. Check. Nothing will overcome my undying love for Carpenter's film. Black Christmas is a great movie, but not as great as Halloween. But who cares. It's wonderful all on it's own. The movie takes places in Bedford(get it?), during the Christmas holiday. A few sorority girls are staying behind at their sorority house for the holidays. Jess(Olivia Hussey), Barb(Margot Kidder), and Phyl(Andrea Martin), are among those few. Unbeknownst to them, a strange sicko has climbed into the attic and plays his maniacal game with the young ladies. He harasses them with obscene calls, and then starts taking them out one by one. It seems simple, as it is, but is incredibly effective. Just like Halloween was. Bob Clark crafts a film that is obviously, and wonderfully, in the 70's, and that's what gives these older films character and ambiance. The film looks good, and Clark infuses the film with the right feel and tone of the season, while something dastardly is going on. Knowing what's going on(and what is to come)while hearing the haunting echos of \\"Silent Night\\" or any other Christmas tune in the background is haunting and eerie. Like Halloween, the movie is all about tone, fear, suspense, and utter terror. Light on the blood and overly photogrpahed death scenes, the movie builds on it's suspense as the minutes tick by. Just like...well, you know. I was surprised with how funny the film was too. The housemother, Ms. Mack, is a hoot!. Therest of the cast is good too. Olivia Hussey is engaging as Jess, our heroine. Lovely, sweet, but can take care of herself if need be. Margot Kidder played her character Barb wonderfully as well. John Saxon also appears in the film. And then there is our killer. But who is he?. Billy. We never really get to see the killer(part of the film's charm and one of their clever tricks), and we are left at the end not knowing anything more than when the film started. Bad ending?. No. It's great. It leaves you with unanswered questions, and sometimes leaving them unanswered is far more interesting and creepy than having everything explained. The extras here are okay, but nothing special. Some of the interviews(mainly the seperate ones with Hussey and Kidder)seem cheap and amateurish. You can't really hear the questions they are being asked either. In the end, Black Christmas is a tightly packaged scare ride with great atmosphere, mood, suspense, and scares. I may be years late in discovering this little gem, but it's better late than never. Black Christmas is a gem.
B000J103PC|3.0|Okay, I am a little shocked here. Those of you who read the book and then said the movie was better are missing something! I personally thought the producers of this movie completely butchered the story! I love Anne Hathaway but she was completely wrong for this role. Andy really needed to be someone much more smart and savvy and with a slight attitude, as opposed to confused, wide-eyed Anne. As a matter of fact, not one person in the entire cast (aside from Streep of course) was portrayed properly and in line with the book. What is the point of making a movie out of a book if you are going to completely change the story and fail to thoroughly develop any of the characters? I hated the adjustments made to the story and was decidedly angry that the writers chose to have Andy sleep with Christian (who, by the way, going back to the casting problem, should have been someone much younger, cuter and not a complete doofas). For what it was, a pretty good movie and entertaining to watch but speaking from the perspective of someone who read the book first (bad idea), this was a horrible rendition and a supreme disappointment.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|A movie that will truly speak to you in many ways, `Rain Man' hits all the right chords over and over again.  As Raymond Babbitt, Dustin Hoffman truly deserved that Oscar for he evokes so much emotion from the viewer it's almost impossible to keep from tearing up.  Tom Cruise on the other hand is easily overshadowed by the depth in Hoffman's performance.  I'm not a fan of Cruise and feel he's overly praised by many.  His performance here was better than the majority of his others and he in no way detracts from the power of the film, but he could have been substituted and I'd have no issues with that. <br /> <br />Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) is a pompous, self centered, materialistic jerk who's in dire need of some cash.  When he hears that his estranged father has recently died (a man he hasn't personally spoken with since he was sixteen) he travels with his girlfriend (Valeria Golino) to the funeral.  Upon discussing his fathers will he discovers that he wasn't left anything but a classic car and some roses.  His fathers millions on the other hand were left to Raymond (Hoffman), Charlie's autistic brother whom he's never known off.  In a purely selfish attempt at receiving his share of his fathers fortune Charlie, in a way, kidnaps his brother to force the trusties hand to pay up.  Because of Raymond's fear of flying the two brother's end up on a cross country trip towards LA that causes Charlie to slowly change; realizing that this is more than money, this is about having a real relationship with a brother he never knew.   <br /> <br />There are two scenes in particular that really got me, both involving a dance.  The first is when Raymond wants to learn to dance.  Charlie then teaches him, and the reason this scene really touched me was because it was the first act of pure selflessness on Charlie's part, the first scene where Charlie was doing something for Raymond, not because he wanted something from him but because he wanted to do something nice for him.  The next involves Raymond and Susanna (Golino) in an elevator.  After Raymond is `stood-up' for his first date Susanna stops the elevator and has Raymond show her how he would have danced with his date, and then she kisses him.  It's the single sweetest scene in the film for here is a person with no ties to Raymond whatsoever doing something for him; I mean I can't even begin to explain how touching that one scene is for me. <br /> <br />So, in closing, `Rain Man' is a movie that is meant to inspire, to move and compel others to open there hearts, and to that effect it truly works.  To watch Charlie transform over time from loathing his brother to accepting and loving him (although my pet-peeve with this film is that at the end when his brother is on the bus Charlie doesn't TELL him that he loves him) and that transformation is just so emotionally moving.  Thanks in a large way to Dustin Hoffman's brilliant Oscar winning performance, and even to Tom Cruise's development of character (I will admit he was convincing as a jerk who leant a lesson, as much as I despise him) `Rain Man' pays off in the end as a wonderful cinematic experience that EVERYONE should and can enjoy!
B000J103YI|5.0|i saw the movie last night. speechless. made me laugh, cry, reflect. the whole cast is great. i love everything about it.  <br /> <br />My favorite songs on the soundtrack are:  <br /> <br />Cadillac Car (you gotta love a car song right) <br />Move (catchy beats gets you out of the seat)  <br />Steppin to the bad side (oooh yeah) <br />Family (beautiful ensemble song) <br />Listen ( when you see the movie, you'll understand this more)  <br />My favorite Jennifer Hudson songs - I am Changing & And I Am Telling You...she did Jennifer Holiday justice on those tunes to STANDING OVATIONS in the theatre.  <br /> <br />All 20 tracks are great. but these are my favorites.  <br /> <br />Hope you see the movie. It's great. I plan to see again.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|The beautiful thing about computers is the freedom they give all of us, not just George and Giles Martin, to expirement. Using some inexpensive software any of us could create credible Beatles mash-ups, but 1) that's a lot of work and 2) most of our results probably wouldn't be as good as most of these. There are some very cool tracks on this CD, including a couple that make the band sound as if they recorded them last week and others that just bring a fresh way of looking at familiar tunes. Check out \\"I am the Walrus;\\" freed from many of the trappings of the original it sounds very contemporary. The makeovers of \\"Lady Madonna\\" and \\"Within You, Without You\\" are also striking. but you will no doubt find your own favorites...
B000K7VHQE|5.0|and being a winner of a film based on so many potentially disastrous bits of black comedy works exceedingly well!  As opposed to some of the movies of the recent past (Borat, American Pie, Waiting, the National Lampoon endless series, etc) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE  starts with a smart script by Michael Arndt that addresses many of the highly dysfunctional family elements present in today's society and allows us to hold a few mirrors up to our own vaguely warped view of good and bad, right and wrong, ambition and self destructive delusion and makes us laugh - at times embarrassed, at times just having fun!<br /><br />Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris direct this odd little story of a family in Albuquerque, NM, a family comprised of a grandfather (Alan Arkin) whose 'elderly status' allows him to speak inappropriately grossly and frankly to his grandchildren while snorting coke in the bathroom; a father (Greg Kinnear, who just gets better and better) with a motivational program scheme that is melting toward failure; a mother (the extraordinary Toni Collette) who attempts to cope with her role as the matriarch of this weird group; the mother's brother (Steve Carell), a gay Proustian scholar who has just lost his job over an affair with a grad student and has survived an unsuccessful suicide attempt; a space-cadet teenage son (Paul Dano) who is in a vow of silence as he pursues Nietzsche and extracting promises for his future from his intimidated parents; and last, but most important, a chubby little sister Olive (Abigail Breslin) who dotes on Miss America pageant reruns on TV and longs to tryout for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty/talent show for little girls in Southern California.<br /><br />The bulk of the film is a road trip which confines this very strange family in an RUV headed for the only bit of positive hope for change in Olive's ploy to become Little Miss Sunshine.  Along the trip we get to know these oddballs personally and in the end the results of the family effort competition seem almost secondary to the fun of getting there.  Each of the performers is at peak form in acting and the direction and pacing would be difficult to improve. The film accomplishes what comedy sets as a goal: it entertains us while allowing us to take a second look at our own foibles, and that makes for a fun and healthy outing.  Highly recommended.

0375831002|5.0|I just finished this book last night and said to myself, \\"I should really read it again before I try to make comment\\" but, no, I want to share my reactions as spontaneously as possible. <br /> <br />There are hundreds of books in my house, but there is one bookshelf upstairs in a back bedroom which holds those special books: you know, the ones that have made such a profound impact on who you are and how you see the world that they are put aside in a place of honor. This will be one of those books for me. <br /> <br />This book is for adults, but it is also for teenagers. I think it is doing younger people a dis-service to think they could not relate to this book because the narrative style is challenging, the subject matter is doleful and/or because there are too many pages (oh, for heaven's sake!). Young people who like to read and like to think and like to feel will love this book as much as older folks like me. There is no need to dummy things down or sugarcoat them, especially when there is such a compelling story to be told. <br /> <br />One of the most powerful aspects of the book for me was the number of surprises. The book was not what I thought it would be and I was constantly astonished by: <br /> <br />1. the amazing stories that Max told and were re-created with tender illustrations inserted into the body of the book <br /> <br />2. the treatment of the German people as human beings, rather than \\"nasty Nazis\\" a la 1940's Hollywood. Although I like to see a \\"nasty Nazi\\" get his comeuppance as much as the next person, I found the lack of stereotypes in this book quite refreshing.  <br /> <br />3. the imaginative use of language - it's just plain poetical at times. You get stopped short and have to read bits out loud because they are so darned beautiful and/or original. <br /> <br />4. the character Death, who is our guide and narrator. He has seen a lot in all the thousands of years of his existence, but he has never seen anything like the story of the book thief. And neither have I. And neither will you.  <br /> <br />As some other reviewers have recommended, I will be sure to read other titles by this author.  <br />
B000A468XY|5.0|I have viewed this in DVD format only, but I love this charming Christmas tale. It is heartwarming for young and old alike. One review stated that it was for children, I disagree. My children do love the movie, but the \\"magic\\" of Christmas is rooted firmly in believing in something or someone greater than ourselves and seeing this movie through a child's perspective is sure to bring the \\"magic\\" back to the Christmas Season for all ages.

B000000OSG|3.0|Hey, remember my old review of this album? Remember how much it SUCKED? Well, I'm editing it, because I've changed my mind about a couple songs. Now, I still feel Knockin' on Heaven's Door is a mockery of the Dylan classic, that Get in the Ring is stupidly self-centered, that My World is more wanking to end the extended game of pocket-hockey we call Use Your Illusion (at least it's short...), that Locomotive and Breakdown are amazing examples of WHY I feel this was an extended game of pocket hockey (how come nobody but me says that anymore?), and there's too much idiocy like Shotgun Blues, Pretty Tied Up (someone should make a law about anyone but Lou Reed writing a song about S&M) and So Fine. Oh, and why remake Don't Cry? It was a good song, you know, before you threw in the unneeded remake.<br /><br />But we've got five REALLY AWESOME songs here. Ever see that video for Yesterdays? Great stuff, man. (and this from a guy who normally despises music videos!) Say what you will about Axl, but that little slither-dance thing he's got going is pretty cool. Now, I'm not saying you can judge a song by its video, because the song itself is amazing, too. Slash and Izzy riff away and Axl howls \\"ooh... yesterday's... got nothin' for me!\\" Schweet. Estranged is, well... Estranged. I didn't like it at first, but I didn't like ANY Guns n' Roses at first - their work seems to grow on me more than any other group's. Anyway, air-guitaring to that thing should be some sort of Olympic event, it's a great song to blast out the windows while you do said air guitaring (it'll drive the neighbors crazy, especially if they hate GN'R as I'm sure mine do and if you're as bad at air-guitar as me), it's got the best lyrics on any GN'R song anywhere ('cept maybe Patience), it's awesomely epic, AND I like Dizzy Reed's piano. It's true. I think he was an unnecessary addition to the band, but Estranged makes me change my mind. Possibly the best of either Illusion, though November Rain's some pretty stiff competition. Anyway, Izzy Stradin's my second-favorite Gunner (behind Guy with Cool Hat, Cool Stage Name and Even Cooler Guitar Tone), and he gets a chance to sing on his Stonesy Axl bash-a-thon 14 Years, which rocks tremendously. And I haven't gotten to the two big hits: Civil War (which mixes Appetite's hard rock, GN'R Lies' acoustic material, and surprising social relevance) which rules, and You Could Be Mine, a flat-out burning rocker which rules even more.ff competition.

B000J103X4|4.0|I didn't pay attention to G Unit's new signee The Game until I heard him on a remix of Jim Jones' \\"Certified Gangstas\\" that also featured Cam'ron.  It's a known fact that Jim Jones and Cam'ron aren't great lyricists but as a new artist doing a verse on a remix for the said artists in question and leaving them in the dust was impressive in my opinion.   I later heard a mixtape that The Game was on that featured a track with Dr. Dre and Jay-Z, another track with Eazy-E and \\"Westside Story\\" which featured 50 Cent.  When Game's \\"The Documentary\\" dropped in January 2005 I was impressed with Game's lyricism, being that he is from the West Coast and you can never go wrong when the good Dr. produces a decent portion of your CD.  My favorite tracks ended up being \\"Westside Story\\", \\"Where I'm From\\" w/Nate Dogg, \\"No More Fun & Games\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Hate It Or Love It w/50 Cent\\" and \\"Runnin'\\".   The only disappointment that I had about the CD was the numerous times that The Game would name drop rappers names like Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, 50, G-Unit.  Once the CD was over you wish that he would just utilize his lyrical skills and focus on a verse without having to name 8 rappers in every 16 bar verse that he drops. <br /> <br />Eventually, which I personally saw coming, The Game and 50 Cent started to not see eye to eye, which led to confrontations at radio stations, various diss tracks to one and another, etc.   Once The Game and 50 Cent were at their highest point of dissing each other, Dr. Dre told Game to quit dissin' 50 and Game decided to ignore the good Dr.'s wishes.  This eventually ended up with Game not being on Aftermath, no Dr. Dre tracks for his official 2nd CD and The Game releasing his 2nd CD, \\"The Doctor's Advocate\\" on Geffen Records.  Although, this change also could have done to lessen the money that 50 Cent will get from the project.   <br /> <br />The Game's 1st single, \\"One Blood\\" features Junior Reid and is a nice track for The Game to release to show people that he can release a nice single without the assistance of Dr. Dre or 50 Cent.   The 12 minute remix for this track, yes I said 12 minutes, is definitely one of the best remixes that I have ever heard since I have listened to rap music.  If you have any way of getting your hands on this remix, you need to do so.  You get everyone from the likes of Nas, Clipse, TI, Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Daz & Kurupt, Bun B, Slim Thug, Jadakiss & Styles P, Noreaga, etc. and even Ja Rule to drop nice verses on a very, long remix.   Game's 2nd single, \\"Let's Ride (Strip Club)\\" sounds too much like a song that his former G Unit boss, 50 Cent would release.  It also sounds like The Game told Scott Storch to give him the closest beat that he has made to sound like a Dr. Dre track so he could make a single to it.  The song isn't unbearable but I am sure that the Game could have found another track to make a single.   Scott Storch does rebound nicely with the Nate Dogg featured, \\"Too Much\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Doctor's Advocate\\" gets started off with \\"Lookin' At Me\\" which is decent but nothing special.   Once you listen to the CD in its entirety, you will definitely find other songs which you like better.  One of them is the next track, \\"Da S___\\".   You'll be pulling out the original \\"Chronic\\" once you hear the slick vocals of Tracey Nelson matched with The Game's fiery lyrics.   The only problem with this track is that it sounds as if The Game is doing Dr. Dre voiceovers instead of just trying to rap a nice 16 over a tight beat.   However, once you listen to the track and see how tight it is, you'll find a way to forgive The Game.   Will I Am shows up to produce Game's ode to his hometown \\"Compton\\".     The two artists, who seem like a mismatch made in heaven find a way to make things work with a slick beat and hook from Will I Am and Game's lyrics.   Just Blaze, who produced \\"No More Fun & Games\\" and \\"Church For Thugs\\" on \\"The Documentary\\" shows up again on \\"The Remedy\\".  The song is one of the better songs on the CD.  I am just surprised that Chuck D approved the usage of PE's \\"Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos\\" sample for the Game to use.   Kanye West, who produced \\"Dreams\\" from \\"The Documentary\\" shows up to produce and drop a verse on \\"Wouldn't Get Far\\".  The sample on this track is just plain \\"sick\\" as Game takes a playful poke at the popular music video vixens like Vida Guerra, Melyssa Ford, Gloria Velez and my wife in another life Hoopz.  Hopefully, no one takes this song seriously it's nothing but humor.   We all know that Melyssa Ford doesn't drive a Honda Accord.  On \\"One Night\\", Nottz must have been Dr. Dre's under study for six months because this track sounds just like a track that Dre would have produced.  Maybe Dr. Dre ghost produced this track and gave Nottz the credit.  Game creates a track about the so-called friends that were in his life that just wanted the limelight, money and fame and weren't really down with him once he became well known after \\"The Documentary\\".   <br /> <br />\\"The Doctor's Advocate\\", which features Busta Rhymes, is my 2nd favorite track on this CD and the sample that Jonathan Rotem used is once again, just plain \\"sick\\".   Game dedicates one track to write an open letter to Dr. Dre to explain his side of things when it came to the Game/G Unit beef and other revelant issues that were going on at the time.  Busta Rhymes does an excellent job in his verse as he tries to explain how he tried to play peacemaker and how he tried to give Game sound advice on how to handle the sitaution.  Hi-Tek shows up to produce \\"Ol English\\" which features slick vocals from one of Aftermath's new signees in Dion.   Dion is also featured heavily on Hi-Tek's \\"Hi Teknology 2-The Chip\\" CD.  The beat is midtempo and The Game rides a slow flow to the track.  Jonathan Rotem shows up again to produce \\"California Vacation\\" which also features Snoop Dogg & Xzibit.  The Game also returns the favor on Snoop's \\"The Blue Carpet Treatment\\" CD on \\"Gang Bang'n101\\" and on Xzibit's latest release \\"Full Circle\\" on \\"On Bail\\".   The three artists show what happens when a coast can actually try to make peace and get along.   Jellyroll attempts his best Dr. Dre imitation on the Daz & Kurupt featured \\"Bang\\".  It's definitely a nice 2006 West Coast track and is definitely one of the better tracks that Jellyroll has produced.  It's nice to hear Daz & Kurupt rapping together once again.  Jamie Foxx shows up to help Game do a track for the ladies on \\"Around The World\\".  The Game & Snoop did a track entitled \\"With You\\" on Jamie's \\"Unpredictable\\" CD.   Although, the track is something you can listen to more than once, you will find tracks that are alot better than this one on \\"The Doctor's Advocate\\". <br /> <br />The highlight of the entire CD is definitely \\"Why You Hate The Game\\".  The track is produced by Just Blaze and features Nas and Marsha Ambrosius (The Songstress) from Floetry.   Nas drops the 1st verse and the Game has 2 verses of his own and the beat and the sweet vocals from Marsha take things over after that.  Nas also has a track with The Game and Marsha, \\"Hustlers\\", which is produced by Dr. Dre (What a coincidence) that is on Nas' \\"Hip Hop Is Dead\\" CD.   <br /> <br />\\"Why You Hate The Game\\" is definitely the Game's best work to date.  If he spent more time doing tracks like these and less time dissing G-Unit, less time doing Dr. Dre voiceovers and less time name dropping Dr. Dre's name over 40 times, The Game could definitely be one of the top rappers in the game toady.  He has unlimited potential but when he says things like I am the West Coast version of Rakim, I might even release \\"Detox\\" myself and when he tells Jay-Z to push his album back, you have to wonder what in the world he is thinkingand talking about.  Overall, The Game has definitely showed me that he can release a tight CD without the assistance of Dr. Dre & 50 Cent.  However, Game it's time to move forward.  Stop mentioning Dre's name in every other verse, stop dissing G Unit and let's move on to bigger and better things.   When he does that he will truly be \\"The Doctor's Advocate\\". <br /> <br />James' Top 6 <br /> <br />1) Why You Hate The Game w/Nas, Marsha from Floetry & Just Blaze <br />2) The Doctor's Advocate w/Busta Rhymes <br />3) Ol' English w/Dion <br />4) One Night <br />5) Wouldn't Get Far w/Kanye West <br />6) California Vacation w/Snoop Dogg & Xzibit <br /> <br />Honorable Mention: <br /> <br />Da S____ <br />Too Much w/Nate Dogg <br />Compton

B00005JPE7|4.0|I'm a big fan of the \\"Rocky\\" series, and I was very excited to see \\"Rocky Balboa.\\" I didn't enjoy the film quite as much as I thought I would, but I still recommend it.<br /><br />Here's the basic plot of the film: Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) has been running a small Italian restaurant in south Philadelphia for about ten years. His beloved wife Adrian (Talia Shire, who appears only in flashbacks of the other five \\"Rocky\\" movies) died of cancer three years ago. Rocky has been unable to let go of her, and the first 45 minutes of the movie basically outline the tremendous amount of grief he is feeling. In a way, Rocky is also grieving for his son (Milo Ventimiglia). Now a grown man, Rocky Jr. is unhappy with his job and has tried to distance himself from his father.<br /><br />Rocky ultimately decides that he wants to try his hand at boxing again. He manages to acquire a license and plans to concentrate on small local fights. However, the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), becomes rattled after a televised computer matchup between him and Rocky deems Rocky as the winner. Mason invites Rocky to participate in an exhibition match, and Rocky accepts the offer.<br /><br />Rocky's training doesn't go as smoothly as it did before: he's pushing 60 now and has to deal with arthritis, calcium deposits, and a variety of other ailments. As always, though, Rocky perseveres, and he gets a lot of help from his son and from good old Paulie (Burt Young). The film culminates in a Pay-Per-View matchup between Rocky and Mason in Las Vegas, which is as intense and emotional as every other fight we've seen in the series.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for everyone, but I think the result of the fight was entirely appropriate. Once again, Rocky shows us the importance of fighting hard to keep our dreams alive, despite any obstacles that come our way. The film is very reminiscent of the first \\"Rocky\\" movie, and I really enjoyed that. There are also many flashbacks from the previous five films, and those old clips were a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />Even though I liked the movie, there were a few things I didn't care for. As I mentioned before, the first 45 minutes of the movie were incredibly depressing. Stallone obviously wanted us to focus on Rocky's character more than just the fighting itself, and I get that, but still...it was too darn depressing! Also, Rocky's friendship with Marie (Geraldine Hughes) was interesting at first because of the way she actually knows Rocky from years back, but I think the movie focused too much on their relationship. Marie did not have to be such a prominent fixture in the film. Finally, I didn't like the way most of the fight was filmed. It looked like we were watching an actual Pay-Per- View fight, which seemed very out of place with the rest of the movie's style. Stallone switched to using \\"regular\\" camera angles again at the very end of the fight, but I don't understand why he went with the whole HBO sports film sequence for so long.<br /><br />Overall, I think Rocky fans will really enjoy this movie. It's very bittersweet, but it was nice to have a solid conclusion to the series.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|Got these a few days ago and liked the fit and feel right away. Sound quality is pretty decent so far. Expecting more improvement as they burn in. These compare sound reproduction wise to the grado 325i's I had at 1/3 rd the price. I don't know how these would compare to some high end audiophile rated cans but for use in my studio and for just enjoying music these work very well. I like them!
0312323867|3.0|As much as I loved \\"Something Borrowed,\\" this novel fell flat for me.  I guess I just never warmed up to Darcy.  Her sudden transformation was too \\"all of a sudden.\\"  A person as bratty as Darcy, just does not seem to change overnight like this. But, I still like the way the author paints her characters and the story.  She did a great job of making me dislike Darcy in the first place.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|To my mind, \\"Emma\\" is the greatest of Jane Austen's novels, but the only one that doesn't seem to work very well either in TV versions or here on the big screen. In this peculiarity, the book is surely comparable to Fitzgerald's \\"Great Gatsby,\\" another masterpiece hobbled just as badly when it comes to film adaptation. The problem lies, I suspect, in the great prominence given in each of these novels to the narrator or internal monologist. In the respective film versions, the enriching reflective capacities provided by such characters necessarily disappear.  In the case of \\"Emma,\\" the absence of both the rich ironies and self-delusions found in the heroine's stream-of-consciousness-style monologues robs the film of a great portion of Austen's wit and most of her focus on the heroine's growth in personhood. What we're left with instead is just a light hearted, externally-centered romance, a visually beautiful period comedy with attractive sets, elegant costumes and pretty faces.  If Jane Austen had been what she was once misread as being, merely a gentle-hearted chronicler of Regency romance, this might be well and good. But since in fact she's a much wittier and more profound novelist, any appreciator of \\"Emma\\" is likely to feel keen disappointment in this screen adaptation.
B000J6H1SE|4.0|This was recommended to me by the staff of the local bookstore, and looked original, so I read it.<br /><br />An engaging novel, and one that I liked.  It mixes a lightish story about an old father who marries a gold-digger with the bittersweet relations between two sisters and the deadly serious history of their family back in Eurasia in the past.<br /><br />Much of the action rings trues and surprised me, even the tractor history, which parallels the action for little apparent reason.  The story is entirely original, nothing like any other book that comes to mind.  The old man turns out particularly complex and sympathetic, and no one was simplistically good or bad.<br /><br />There was a little too much Ukrainian lore for my tastes - cooking, culture, history, but I suspect many would find the mix just right.
0823016714|5.0|This is a very well thought out book with superb photos. If you need reference material this book has it. I am using it for practice. One exercise I do is I try to draw the photo reversed, for example if the head is turned with the right side facing the camera I will try to draw the left side facing the camera. Also I will try to foreshorten an expression at a different angle. The only draw back to this book is that it doesn't have any children in it. I am guessing that it would have been difficult to get children to exhibit the expressions found in the book. Overall the book is well worth the price.

B000E1JOSE|5.0|Whether you had 'Live in Austin' or not, you'd sense the aura that accompanied the stellar cast that thronged in awe around the Big O for this recording of the Coconut Grove Sessions. No song is less than compelling. None of the cast are out to upstage the master. It's first rate homage all the way, superbly produced by T Bone Burnett (who must wish, like so many, to have been blessed by vocal chords like Roy's to adorn his own lyrics). All of Orbison's songs have a powerful sense of being dreams, or to have been a way of escaping the dilemna of dreams, and for this reason I have always resonated to the terrible beauty of,'Leah'performed with all its operatic majesty on this night of nights.
0002171856|5.0|I was telling my brother about this book I've had over a year now and felt a review written here would benefit others as well.     The little practical things Wiseman advises may not seem important now, but sure will come in handy if necessary.    How to tell direction with a wristwatch and the sun; Not walking a straight direction back to an abandoned vehicle, but going north or south of it and then doubling back. How to distill water in any kind of land, sea situation. They don't call him Wiseman for nothing.
0743289412|3.0|I am a long-time King fan who usually eagerly awaits his every new novel.  Upon reading some of the advances for Lisey's Story, however, I found that the book didn't immediately grab my interest, and I had a vague sense that I wouldn't really like it.  But, being the devoted King fan that I am, I ignored my intuition (which has always served me very well) and picked up a copy of this book.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, Lisey's Story starts slow.  We are introduced to the main character, Lisey Landon, widow of famous writer Scott Landon, who \\"died young\\" but who is very much a part of the book via flashbacks.  And from that very first flashback of Scott and Lisey at a ground-breaking ceremony for a new university library, I found that I didn't much care for either of them--although Lisey insists that EVERYONE loves her husband, that very assertion made me find him pompous, while she herself seemed to be lacking her own voice (despite being the title character).  Another negative about this book which many other reviewers have also pointed out is King's overuse of special words of speech, or neologisms.  Yes, King was trying to illustrate the importance of words to a story and yes, many couples share a secret language, but there is a reason they don't expose this language to others--it's highly annoying.<br /><br />So why the three stars?  Because, no matter what he does wrong, King can still tell a story, and Lisey's Story is no exception.  While I don't agree at all with reviews of this book suggesting that it is a love story, the main plotline of Scott and Lisey--or, even more specifically, Scott alone--is truly gripping.  Unfortunately, the side plots of Lisey's sister Amanda's mental illness and Lisey's life-or-death struggles over Scott's papers, while necessary to the central story, also detracted from it.  King's use of the supernatural here reminds me of earlier works of his which I haven't particularly cared for, including Rose Madder and Gerald's Game (of course, if you liked those novels, you may very well like this one as well).<br /><br />I have no doubt that some of King's fans will be apt to enjoy this book.  Just don't do what I did--read the reviews, and then trust your own intuition to determine whether this novel is right for you.ald's Game (of course, if you liked those novels, you may very well like this one as well).<br /><br />I have no doubt that some of King's fans will be apt to enjoy this book.

B0002W18MU|4.0|When I first sampled a couple of these songs on iTunes, I was turned off by how frail Johnny's voice sounded.  But, as a fan, I came back to it a few months later, and that's when I was blown away by \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\".  This album is worth buying solely for that song.  For those of you who aren't interested in having albums for only one song, you're in luck.  I think this album, the fifth collaboration with Rick Rubin, is better than American IV.  Johnny Cash's last two original songs, \\"Like the 309\\" & \\"I Came to Believe\\" are both good heart-felt songs.  Album opener \\"Help Me\\" is also quite good, though the vulnerability in Cash's voice can make it a little sad.  His covers of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Further On Up the Road\\" and Gordon Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" are both touching and remind you, that even being so close to death as he was recording these, that he still owns these songs as if they were originals.  My last stand-out track is \\"Love's Been Good to Me\\", which is very sweet and I couldn't help but smile as I listened to it.  This is a good buy, and I hope Rick Rubin does just as good a job on the up-coming American VI.
0688170528|5.0|If you think it is romantic that a girl and boy, who have known each other forever,when they grow up they would naturally start having sexual feelings for each other then you should go and read this book. This books describes how mixing sex with a strong and mature friendship can destroy two lives, especially when one of the person really wants other person sexually but other person doesn't.<br /><br />I do believe that although it's not clear in the story that Emily had difficult picturing Chris as her sexual mate or she is not comfortable with sexual intimacy in general but i think she would have had this problem with anyone because of sexual abuse she suffered in her childhood.<br /><br />I really sympathised with emily throughout the story but in the end author gave me an insight into her head and i was like what a selfish person! She couldn't let chris go to another girl when she herselves didn't want to have sex with him. When she decided to commit suicide she wanted Chris also to die with her. She didn't want to live with him forever, marry him but she wanted him to die with her. And if he didn't want to die then she wanted him to help her die.Why? She wanted to involve Chris in her suicide so that he would never be able to forgive himself for not being able to stop her. I am glad Chris could see Emily for the selfish person she was after she was dead, it would have helped him to get over her sooner and to get on with his life.<br /><br />This story has got another stories about their parents relationship. how  such an event in their child's life can affect both the parents differently.<br /><br /> i have read one more book by Picoult 'Keeping Faith' and found both the book engrossing reads. Picoult raises controversial issues like a child seeing god or teenage suicide and makes you think. Can we ever be sure of what is right and what is wrong?Can we really blame Chris for pulling the trigger( if he did indeed, because it was not clear) under the circumstances?
020161622X|5.0|Excellent book. Although having 8 years of software development experience under my belt, I still found this book enlightening. I knew almost half of what the authors said - but they said it so well that it seemed more convincing coming from them. While reading this book I knew the real meaning of \\"you took the words right out of my mouth\\".  <br /> <br />The book did have some new things that I had not known or thought about before. This is a must have book for Software Professionals. It is full of wisdom. The authors' writing style is immaculate ! <br /> <br />This book was so amazing that I could not sleep until I had finished it, and even after finishing it I still could not sleep just out of the adrenaline rush that it gave me.
B000002KBU|5.0|The literary classics stand the test of time because they speak to the human condition in some meaningful way. Pop culture rarely has a claim to this type of insight, but \\"Blue\\" raised the stakes for what singer/songwriters could accomplish.<br /><br />The appeal of this recording has many facets; to begin, it is obviously a 180 degree look at a life that has experienced its share of joy, along with angst, to produce an effort that allows the listener to see the artist, but also see himself. The giddy optimism of \\" All I Want\\" begins the journey ;  the middle eloquently details \\" Blue\\", the state of being  and the torment of destructive love, something most have suffered. Finally, the tale ends with an observation of the dichotomy between staying in a dark place after disappointment, or fleeing that place, seeing it as a \\"phase\\". In the interim we get to travel to far-flung places ( \\"Carey\\"), ruminate on the longing for home ( \\" California \\" ), and analyze our own contribution to the demise of something special ( \\" River\\" ). One has to be moved by \\" Blue\\", even with some of the hipster inspired  vernacular found in the lyrics. It's understandable that Ms. Mitchell would be disappointed when people fail to respond to her more profound observations in later work, but the foundation for the appeal of \\" Blue\\"  is the confession that any of us could make, though probably  not as articulately. Her four octave range is best used in this recording, too, adding an extra quality that eluded future efforts.<br /><br />Joni Mitchell usurped all performers of that time, and certainly of today's ilk, with this masterpiece. She has many other interesting things to say, but none as enduring as the work here.

B00005JOLI|3.0|17-year old Eragon (Spleers) lives a fairly peaceful life with his uncle.  One day he comes across what he believes to be an odd looking stone.  Soon, he discovers it is a dragon egg, and once that egg hatches, he seeks out the village bum/storyteller Brom (Irons).  He seems to know a lot about dragons, and begins to teach Eragon the ways of Dragon Riders.  Meanwhile, the evil King Galbatoris (Malkovich) sends his minion Durza (Carlyle) to find the dragon and destroy it.<br /><br />\\"Eragon\\" is sub-par on almost all levels.  The worst aspect is that the story parallels \\"Star Wars\\" almost exactly.  I cannot help but wonder if George Lucas is getting a paycheck for this ripoff of a story.  To be fair, I am told that the film differs quite a bit from the book.  Spleers is adequate as Eragon.  Malkovich is fun to watch as always, but he gets very little screen time.  The saving grace in the acting department is Irons, who seems to be having fun despite the film he is in.  If you must see this, wait until it comes out on DVD.

B0007MWZEK|4.0|I am always skeptical when I see claims about gadgets on TV. I saw this thing demonstrated on The View and decided to try it. It is very well made and has some very convenient features. The rechargeable battery provides good power and lasts a good 30 minutes before requiring a charge. The sweeper picks up just about anything but sometimes spits items back out. The segmented handle stays together well and is strong enough for the job. I would have liked to have seen a feature on the battery charger that lets you know when the battery is fully charged. All-in-all, a great gadget at a fair price that really works!

Especially Thelonius!!  \\"Diamond Dust\\" is so beautiful, almost has a magical quality about it. \\"Scatterbrain\\"  and \\"She's a Woman\\", the old Beatles song redone, are great too!<br />It almost sounds Jamaican the way Beck does it.

B00000JPH6|5.0|I watched this movie when I was 4 or 5 years old  and I loved every second of it, it was scary and exciting and a very fun movie to watch. when I was 21 I saw it on sale I knew I had to buy it, great memories and it's a lot of fun to watch although am a lot older now and I don't have that something that made this movie so great the first time. If you are young at heart you should definitely buy it. Enjoy.
B000ENWKN8|1.0|I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux.  Everything after that is garbage.  This album is no exception.  Every song sounds the same and is very predictable.  The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses?  He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money.  He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented.  I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless.  1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again.

B00004TWZF|5.0|This is a wonderful film, although it makes one think how poor and mechanical our modern urban lives are. Two young men, Jacques and Enzo, who grew up together and share the same passion for diving, have a life-long noble competition for who's the best and can dive deeper for longer time. Their friendship will pass through many adventures in which a young American woman will share a part, although she is moved by love and doesn't exactly understand this kind of passion for the sea. The photography is excellent and Luc Besson chooses aptly for the initial and final tragic scenes the Greek islands, the land of the ancient tragedy and the great myths.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|The remastered debut Boston album together with Don't Look Back are must haves for all Boston fans.

Why didn't they do the same for Don't Look Back?  Just doesn't make sense...
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I made the fatal mistake of waiting too long to buy Stefani's monster solo Love.Angel.Music.Baby. and when I listened to it and began to fall in love with it, it was too late. I didn't make the same mistake twice, even though I wondered how she would top her first blockbuster. I don't know if The Sweet Escape tops LAMB, but it comes really close. I do not know why people are hating on her: how could you resist the 80s reminiscent \\"Sweet Escape\\" or the tricked out \\"Orange County Girl\\" or the infectious club-banger \\"Now That You Got It\\". Even when she does ballads, she is the s*it, like in the incredible \\"4 In the Morning\\". The standout track \\"Yummy\\" featuring Pharrell is a must-be single and the Kelis-esque \\"Breakin Up\\" could be a hot one too. I don't know what other people are talking about but The Sweet Escape is a winner.

0618680004|3.0|As a Christian, and evangelical pastor, I read this book with the intent to understand the rising culture of atheism, and to evaluate Dawkins logic and argumentation. On that end, he did not disappoint - Dawkins much too casually dismisses solid reason, uses ill-fitting logic, and can't resist the occasional insulting barb. But, there is something this work gets right: there is a rapidly approaching world-view war, of which the current \\"culture war\\" is only a pre-cursor. Soon it will be simply a matter of naturalists versus  supernaturalists in dealing with the four biggest world-view  issues: Origins, Purpose, Ethics, and Destiny. There will be not much room for middle ground, and for all the intellectually honest regardless of which side you're on, that's a good place at which to arrive.
0609610570|5.0|This book is a succinct summary of all that is wrong in many companies. Larry and Ram analyze many of the most dysfunctional behaviors seen in large corporations and lay out some steps to address them. While many of their stories focus on senior management and execution failures, their suggestions and guidelines work just as well for all levels of management. If you are responsible for planning and getting things done, this book will give you some tips and ideas as well as codifying your \\"gut feel\\" for why some people just don't get things done.<br /><br />My only complaint was that it did not address the problems of getting your information systems to \\"get things done\\". As businesses are increasingly embodied in their information systems I think this is going to become more and more important.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|I didn't expect to love this film as much as I did - especially as it was my very last choice when I was desperate for a movie. Man, am I glad there wasn't anything else on - it would have been a tragedy to miss this.<br /><br />The film itself is the tragic tale of a family of screw-ups making their way across the US to attend a children's beauty pageant. The plot is really secondary to its characters. And what a bunch of characters. My personal favourite is Uncle Frank, a suicidal, gay, Proust professor. (Hell, if I spent my life specializing in Proust, I'd be suicidal too). Considering Steve Carrell's surprising restraint in the role I was surprised that every time I saw Frank I started laughing involuntarilty (even when he was just sitting or standing motionless). Condemned to spend most of the film stuck with the family's sulky, misanthropic son who has taken a vow of silence, Frank serves as our semi-normal proxy into the world of this extraordinarily strange family.<br /><br />The most extraordinary character in this menagerie is Grandpa (Alan Arkin), a foul mouthed heroin using curmudgeon who can't go a single scene without being offensive. In short, I loved him. He had some of the best lines in the film (e.g., \\"Get me some porn... the real nasty stuff\\"). He's the sort of character that you can't take your eyes off, even when he's unconscious, in case you miss his next trick. I haven't seen many Alan Alda films, but if this is a gauge of his calibre then I'll be raiding the video store for more.<br /><br />Toni Collette as the long-suffering mother appears to be the only normal member of the family, although she gives the sense of unravelling at the edges. Olive, the sweet and innocent daughter who wants to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine contest seems to be at the centre of the family and in a weird twist is ultimately their redemption. Rounding off the cast is Greg Kinnear as the Success Coach father, whose attempts at inspiration seem to have the complete opposite effect. Again, like most of the others, he also seems to be coming apart at the seams.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure there was a message to this film, but I'll be hornswozzled if I can figure it. It seems to be about the pursuit of success, by people who have never had it and probably never will. For all his talk of being a winner, the success coach father's life is one of endless failure... but he keeps plugging away. Olive has no chance in hell of winning the beauty pageant, but she goes for it no matter what. Uncle Frank can't seem to win no matter what he does but at least seems to have resigned himself to failure and ultimately finds some meaning in it. The Neitzche driven son, driven to the edge by his pursuit of success is probably the most tragic loser of the group, but his ultimate destruction is also the most amusing (at least to me).<br /><br />I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I adore films about losers, and this seemed like the jackpot for me. Even the Simpsons weren't as pathetic as this bunch. Thanks and triple thanks to Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris for bringing me this glorious display of human wretchedness.

B0000019PA|5.0|Well, this is my favorite album of all time.  I do not know how well I can describe it in a review.  I will just say that it was the first album that I ever listened to that showed me that music can be really meaningful and beautiful.  At first when I listened to it, I thought, \\"hmm, this is pretty cool.\\" but didn't think much more of it.  It takes quite a while to sink in, I think..at least for me and good music.  But one day I listened to \\"Two Headed Boy Part 2\\" and was completley taken.  Especially with the line, \\"and in my dreams you're alive and you're crying.\\"  That was so beautiful; I started crying on the spot.<br /><br />Lately I have become a fan oof the track \\"Communist Daughter\\".  Supposedly it is a childlike description of WWII.  This album was supposedly written about Anne Frank.<br /><br />There is a lot of singing saw, theremin, and trumpet on this album.  It is all very beautiful and moving.  I am not very good at describing things in words!  Most everyone has heard this album already, anyway though.<br /><br />CH-CHECK IT OUT.

Blade Runner.<br />Vangelis succeeded in delivering a prefect album, no other could have fitted better for a movie like Blade Runner.<br />Forgetting the movie, the music in this album is simply: Fresh and relaxing with a mixture of arabic singing in some of the tracks.<br />You don't need to be into any kind of specific genre to appreciate the music on this album. Vangelis uses all mixtures here; voices, horns, drums, keyboards and more, delivering one of nicest relaxing soundtrack I have heard.<br />I personally own all Vangelis's music but this one is my favorite.<br />A 5 star CD for a 5 star movie.<br />Other great Vangelis music:<br />1. Oceanic<br />2. El Greco<br />Other great Soundtrack:<br />1. Kingdom of heaven<br />2. The thin red line
B000IMUYJM|4.0|I saw this in the movies when it was billed as \\"Silent Night, Evil Night\\".  For a slasher flick, it's nicely done, with a well thought out plot.  Compared to today's slasher movies, it's a bit tame, but it's main focus is on keeping your nerves on edge. It succeeds very well, and was an interesting addition to the \\"Evil doesn't Rest at Christmas\\" sub-genre.
B00005NC66|4.0|This is my favourite Godard film, deserving 5 stars for sure, but the picture quality on this version isn't that great - perfectly watchable, and not really hindering the film that much, but I'll be waiting for something better. I heard a rumour Criterion will be releasing this. I certainly hope that's true.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Sweden's Opeth, one of metal's finest artists of this generation unleashes one of their heaviest releases to date.  Since the early 1990's, Opeth have mesmerized audiences with their fusion of progressive death metal.  2002 brought fans a metal onslaught mixed with beauty.  Originally meant to be released as a double-disc with 2003's Damnation, Deliverance found itself to be another gem that Opeth has skillfully written and flawlessly recorded.<br /><br />`Wreath' is a fast and heavy piece, one that immediately catches the attention of the listener with its ferocity and beautiful progressive breakdowns.  Mikael Akerfeld's vocals continue to shine and his death metal growl is amongst the best in the entire genre.  His clean vocals are also worthy of mention.  The title track, `Deliverance,' is one of the best songs that Opeth have ever composed.  This song is a fan favorite and is played on nearly every live set.  `A Fair Judgement' is a beautiful track that contains one of my favorite solos that Opeth have ever done.  `Master's Apprentices' is another song worth mention that has very memorable riffs along with poetic lyrics.<br /><br />Do not be drawn away by six tracks total for this recording.  All five songs (one of them is a short, instrumental song) are over 10 minutes long.  Musically, Opeth are widely considered to be one of the most talented bands in the genre.  Their live performance is also breathtaking.  I have had the privilege to see them perform various times including their Chronology set in Los Angeles.  Deliverance is a marvelous album to have in one's collection.  I know people who do not even enjoy metal, but like pleasure in Opeth's music.  These Swedish masters continue their sheer dominance with 2002's Deliverance.
B000002GQK|5.0|This has always been a favorite of mine. This, however, seems to be almost the forgotten album out of the classic seven. Unlike Seventh Sojourn an album with really great songs but doesn't hang together well all the way through. This one is a classic from beginning to end. This is a darker album than most Moody Blues albums and that might have something to do with the fact that this is not as widely regarded as some but don't let that put you off this is a classic.
1401302378|5.0|The Long Tail is a great book that explains how etailers anywhere of any size can be successful online and details how niche products make a living in \\"the long tail\\"; that area of the Internet where even the most obscure products generate interest, traffic, and purchase. This is a good read.
B000068FWC|5.0|Supertramp's Breakfast In America was originally released March 29, 1979. This is a cool album that's a great listen from beginning to end. Back when this was originally released it was everywhere and you heard it no matter where you went. I really like the songs and I love the way it switches from Roger singing the softer and Rick sing the harder edge songs. If you look at the track listing and were alive back in '79 you'll probably recognize just about every song on here. The Logical Song, Take The Long Way Home, Goodbye Stranger, and so on. The keyboard playing is really tight as is the rhythm section.
0792163710|5.0|This is a great movie as well as being a western classic. I would highly recommend it!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|An interesting film that was not released on a large in theaters, little miss sunshine is a film that is likely to be seen big on the awards stages in the next few months.  Its path will be similar to that of the film \\"sideways\\" a couple of years ago.  An interesting view into a dysfunctional family that again proves that dysfunction can function if given the right ingredients.  Although the dysfunctional family has been played out on film many a time (eg. National lampoon Vacation series of film), this film took a little darker humor, not so overboard with outrageous stunts or even nudity. Yes, some aspect (bringing dead grandpa along) may be a bit off, at least they didn't do a weekend at bernies type script. They worked it in just the once (highway patrol stop), and they didn't do it till the end. I did think the ending was predictable (the routine produced by grandpa), but it was funny.   I would expect at least a few nominations at the golden globes and oscars, and hopefully it will take home a couple. Greg Kinnear does well, and Steve Carrell was great.  Check this one out.
B00005JPCD|5.0|Despite the ending where it gets very, very political, I loved. Heck, I even loved the ending and all of it's political environmentalist \\"subtleness.\\"<br /><br />(A Few spoilers lay ahead, but won't make much sense unless you see it)<br /><br />It was a cute story, lovable, and great. I also loved the social statements that WERE subtle within the Penguin colony (the singing is viewed as a religion). And it cracked me up when they fought so hard to keep singing and only singing as the sole pillar of the social structure, and dropped it like a lead weight when they realized dancing would save them.<br /><br />It doesn't necessarily show men as PURELY evil. I mean, for goodness sakes, why would they put in the trackers as comical relief if they were EVIL?<br /><br />The seal made me laugh, even if it was all \\"evil,\\" looking. In any penguin animated movie, all of the seals will look evil and scary. Why? Because that's how they're viewed to penguins. I'm PRETTY sure less seals will be killed because of this movie than the sting rays that have been slaughtered because of the death Steve Irwin, bless his heart (and I must mention, this movie was also made in DEDICATION to him). And I'm sure there will be some baby seal movie that will be made eventually to counteract this \\"evil\\" look. Wolves get this tagged on them ALL the time in animated movies, and then they made Balto.<br /><br />Anyways, enough rambling, it was a great movie. I HIGHLY recommend it. Don't be put off by ANY of the negative reviews you see here; my entire family went to see it; my parents who are 50+ enjoyed it immensely, my brother and his wife (mid/late 20s) enjoyed it, and my other brother and I enjoyed it (teens/early 20s).<br /><br />Political and social undertones need to be taken lightly, they may detract a little and seem random, and to me the ending was a little cheap, but overall, it was a great movie.
B000AADYRQ|1.0|Perhaps the worst part of the entire album is on, \\"I will follow you into the dark.\\"  <br /> <br />In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule <br />I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black <br />And I held my tongue as she told me <br />\\"Son fear is the heart of love\\" <br />So I never went back <br /> <br />Every time I hear it I cringe. The entire album is a little too affective, even for emo rock. Marching bands of Manhattan is an ok track, and What Sarah Said is also not bad. Brothers on a hotel bed is the most immediately catchy song, but it gets old, and you realize it's really a mediocre to bad song. I'm not a huge fan of Death Cab for Cutie, if you are, you might like this album better than I did. Their best song is still photobooth. <br /> <br />
B000065BPB|5.0|First off let me say this. If you're looking for a good set of headphones only for listening to your iPod, or like device, then I do not recommend these. A small device such as the iPod just can't power these phones like they need to be. Don't get me wrong. They sound good when listening to my nano, but not nearly as good as when I'm using them with my computer or other higher output source. <br /> <br />     That said, I do really like these headphones. The clarity and accuracy is outstanding for a sub-hundred-dollar set of phones. I can hear parts of my music that I cannot even hear on my hi-fi system (which is a good system, but not the best.) The imaging is excellent for closed-type headphones. I prefer to listen to music through these than any other earphone or speaker system I own. I watch movies with them on. I use them when I record. I use them for practice through my guitar amp. And I do actually use them with my iPod when compact earbuds aren't necessary. <br /> <br />     As for the isolation these phones claim...it's not nearly as much as the advertised 32db of outside noise reduction. They quieten the outside world a lot, but not that much. However, if you're listening at a decent level, you can't hear someone talk to you in a normal voice standing about five feet away. If you want more isolation I would recommend the Direct Sound Extreme Isolation phones. I've not actually listened to them, but everything I've heard about them is good. <br /> <br />     Comfortable. That is what these are. I'm an average size 22 year old male and these fit my head very well. I've had these on for hours on end and never once did I feel any discomfort. Even with the extra weight of a coiled cord these headphones are never bothersome. I've gone to bed with them on many times. I usually wake up with them off, but that's beside the point. <br /> <br />     Now to the little things: I like the screw-on 1/8\\" to 1/4\\" adaptor. I'm not a fan of the coiled cord though. You get used to it, but I would rather have a straight cord. Although the ability to stretch has proved useful several times. The quality is on par with the cost. They are made well. Better than cheaper ones, but not as good as high-end phones. That is to be expected. <br /> <br />Overall I generally recommend these Sennheisers. They sound good, seem pretty durable, and are a good value. I initially was going to give them four stars for the fact that there are much better phones out there. But I decided to give them five anyway because for the price you would be hard pressed to find a better set of headphones.
0446672653|5.0|This is a book that can be read at one sitting. Like a magnet, it attracts the interest of the reader from the first page. It should be read especially by people who live in the Middle East where hatred is everywhere. The author has proved the importance of love in our world through the intermediary of the love that emanates form the spiritual world. It is must to read this book. Greatly recommended.

B000GIWS7E|4.0|Coming from a new-found Dream Theater fan, this DVD is no exception to their fantastic music. With the setlist that they have performed, this is an astounding concert - solid as a setlist, solid on a musical level, fantastic as a Live concert. The concert is very energetic. James LaBrie did an outstanding job singing - most, if not all, of his notes were in tune and beautifully sung... much unlike his previous Live recordings. The rest of the band was magnificent, as well. <br />Every song was done well, and may have even made some particular songs that I did not like into some top favorites of mine. I would recommend this DVD as a must buy for any Dream Theater fan, and I would recommend this DVD for any to-be Dream Theater fans. <br /> <br />The only gripes I have with this particular DVD are: <br />I am not a fan of the audio recording on this DVD. I do not know sound technology too well, nor how compressions are done. But, in my particular DVD player, with my particular speakers, the Stereo version of audio sounds horrifically 'blaring'... <br />And my only other gripe is, being a musician myself (trumpet), I can hear that someone, or a few person(s), are out of tune in the Orchestra during the entire second half. This has put a damper on my overall view of the recording, but those two problems combined do not even come close to the overpowering quality of music they performed that night. <br /> <br />Buy it!  This DVD is worth every single penny you pay for it.

B00002ZMNV|5.0|In my opinion, this portrays Metallica in a light that I had never expected, and one that shines beyond any other performance I have ever seen, or heard, of theirs.  When I purchased the CD of this concert, I thought nothing beyond the fact that it was a great album.  One of my favorites.  This DVD shocked me, in a very positive way.  I did not expect too much when I purchased this DVD, except that it would be a visual version of the album.  When I put it in my DVD player, and sat there watching the concert, I was amazed at how well the music was performed. <br />They have their Metallica crunch, they have an awesome orchestra backing them up (of course, with the greatest Rock composer of all time), and James does a fantastic job singing on this concert.  I have yet to hear them perform this well. <br />The concert is surprisngly laid back, but the music pumps it up to rocketing levels.  Truly a spectacular concert.  A job well done. <br /> <br />Think nothing of it.  Just buy it and enjoy it.  =)  You will be glad you did.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd - Pulse. <br />This is the only DVD I have ever purchased before it was actually released.  The anticipation of an amazing concert and DVD was there, and it delivered to every single nerve in my soul.  I expected plenty from the album, Pulse, and the DVD took it to so many levels above and beyond. <br />In my opinion, everything about this DVD is outstanding.  The song selection is spectacular, the music is one-of-a-kind, the light show was wonderful, the performance was perfect and energetic - the entire way through.  I have no disappointments, nor anything negative to say about this DVD, nor this band, nor this performance. <br /> <br />I will recommend this DVD to any fan of Pink Floyd.  If you do not already own this DVD, purchase it.  Do yourself the favor.  I rate this DVD at 5, and I believe this DVD is priced outstanding for the concert that you get.
1400032717|4.0|If you are at all familiar with Asperger's Syndrome, then you will find this book entertaining and interesting.  Mark Haddon subtly takes the reader into the world of this enigmatic disorder, and provides a humorous look at the pecularities of people with Asperger's Syndrome through the eyes of an adolescent boy who struggles to make it through his day to day activities.  A worthwhile read, especially if you have ever known someone who has Asperger's Syndrome or is Autistic.
0307237699|4.0|Perhaps it is too early to begin thinking about 2008 (after all, 2007 hasn't even started), but there is no doubt that Obama will be a powerful force in politics, whether he decides he wants to run for president or not.<br /><br />The most appealing aspect of the book is that he seems like a moderate, and at times, he even leaves room for the fact that his views have not been fully developed. I think that in this era of polarizing views and the entire \\"your either with us or against us\\" movement in politics, this book is a breath of fresh air - air for the hope that lives inside us all. Enjoy.
B000FL7CAK|1.0|I'm deliberately giving this release 1 star for one reason only. The DVDs do not include English subtitles. If you want to back up and figure out what someone mumbled, I hope you know Spanish or French. Oh, and don't get smart and say you'll just use the TV's closed captioning either. The DVDs do not include that, even though closed captions were produced for broadcast. Utterly ridiculous.
0131177052|5.0|Michael Feathers has written a book that is at once very focused on the legacy code problem, but also far more important than what the scary title would indicate.<br /><br />Feathers went where few software developers would dare to tread.  Often hired by organizations to \\"make us agile\\" or \\"make us eXtreme\\" [sic], he found that the teams had already inherited (or built) a lot of code that needed to be wrangled into a test harness before the team could even consider driving forward with Test-Driven Development.  And more often than not, the code was written in C++.  Poor Michael.  (Oh, wait, he got a book deal out of it!  ;-)<br /><br />So, the examples he uses in the book are rather real-world (with the client's proprietary stuff stripped, disguised, or entirely rewritten, of course).  The interesting thing I noted while reading the examples was:  \\"Hey, this code doesn't look bad!  It's a lot like what I would have written prior to my indoctrination into test-first programming.\\"  Feathers emphasizes that even well-written code can suffer from the most dangerous of ailments:  This code is difficult to test.<br /><br />I appreciate his clear, no-nonsense, line-in-the-sand (or stake-in-the-ground, depending on your choice of metaphors) definitions of \\"legacy code\\" and \\"unit test.\\"  If you've met Michael Feathers, you already know that he's not trying to start an argument or cause controversy.  Quite the opposite, in fact:  He's giving concise definitions of the phrases he uses everywhere in the book, so that you can easily tell whether something fits within, or is outside, the definition.  There is no wiggle room.<br /><br />Aside:  Do my projects end up with unit tests that Michael would not define as \\"unit tests\\"?  Yes.  Invariably, my teams have a very small percentage of unit tests (less than 1%) that indeed fail the Feathers definition.  I'm okay with that.  Better to have a few slow-and-ugly unit tests than to have untested behavior.<br /><br />Feathers starts later chapters with statements of common problems.  In fact, the problem is the chapter title (e.g., \\"Dependencies on Libraries are Killing Me\\").  The author then describes the problem, provides examples, gives a general solution or two, and points you to detailed solutions in the catalog toward the back of the book.<br /><br />This catalog is a catalog of refactorings for many legacy-specific code smells (put another way, \\"cures\\" for various \\"ailments\\"), all with the goal of getting the code under test, so that it can be further enhanced without fear.  I tried to read the book cover-to-cover, but the catalog started to intrigue me early on, and I think I finally read the whole book, but certainly not in any particular order.<br /><br />No book is perfect, of course.  The only thing I could quibble with Feathers about is that his catalog--which, like others of this type, gives memorable names to the refactorings--occasionally renames common refactorings, or implies the use of a particular design pattern where it isn't always appropriate or necessary.<br /><br />E.g., \\"Adapt Parameter\\" is a safe, powerful refactoring, but the name might lead you to believe that you need to wrap the offending parameter in a \\"Gang of Four\\" (GoF) Adapter Pattern, when in fact you may want a GoF Proxy (fewer changes to the code you're trying to get under test).  Even that may be misleading, though, because someone may mistakenly interpret Proxy to mean that the parameter has to retain its original type (or an Interface, at the very least).  Not true (think Smalltalk or Ruby).  An object can easily have an identical interface (i.e., set of public method signatures) without being of the same type.  If it swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck...<br /><br />I think \\"Wrap Parameter\\" would have been a better name for that refactoring.  Proxies, Adapters, Facades...they're all different in important ways, but they're all wrappers (aka \\"Yet Another Layer of Abstraction\\").  And our industry needs to be able to embrace such vague terms in order to allow for creative solutions.<br /><br />I don't think Feathers intended to imply Adapter (and my argument is really picking nits, after all, and perhaps my attempt to look smart), but I would ask the reader to absorb the *intent* rather than the *letter* of this (or any) catalog of solutions.<br /><br />And the intent of this book is an important one.  In fact, Feathers brings together quite a few pragmatic areas of today's world of software development:  Test-Driven Development and refactoring, mock objects, design patterns, agile programming practices.  This book gives developers the techniques required to lock quality in while allowing the product to mature.<br /><br />Because of that, I'd say this is one of the most important software development books written at least since the GoF Design Patterns book.  Unlike the Gang of Four book, though, this one is easy to read and comprehend!  ;)d our industry needs to be able to embrace such vague terms in order to allow for creative solutions. <br /> <br />I don't think Feathers intended to imply Adapter (and my argument is really picking nits, after all, and perhaps my attempt to look smart), but I would ask the reader to absorb the *intent* rather than the *letter* of this (or any) catalog of solutions. <br /> <br />And the intent of this book is an important one.

B00005JPE7|5.0|When Sylvester Stallone had his career lows and bombs with Get Carter and the equally depressing Spy Kids films, it was hard to believe the man had once defeated Apollo Creed and took on armies donning red bandanas.

From a fresh script and a crisp yet gritty visual style that harkens back to 1970's pioneer filmmaking, Rocky Balboa is the most exciting and accepting sequel since James Cameron's T2: Judgment Day in 1991. Everything is fresh, but none too far from the original scope of work that the boxing series entails.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa, long since retired, is the owner of an Italian eatery called Adrian's still in his hometown of Philadelphia, PA. Things are not the same, though. His wife Adrian passed away a few years beforehand, while his son is taking off on a career of his own. However, things are starting to shake and move when a computer simulated match names Rocky Balboa winner over the undisputed champion, Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon.<br /><br />Where to start?<br /><br />From Bill Conti's beautiful arrangements to several landmark settings from the originals, everything about Rocky Balboa is nostalgic. However, this is not a remake in the slightest sense, and more importantly this is not a novelty act. The film may highlight on the original over some of the more successful sequels, yet this is a story of it's own.<br /><br />There are new faces while there are some old. It is hard to picture a Rocky film without Talia Shire, but it works so well that it would be hard to take the picture seriously with her in it. The character of Balboa has not been this moving and sentimental since the original. His age shows yet there is more youth than ever as he explores the possibilites and fate of his senior status.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this film seems more autobiographical than ever. Perhaps it is not Rocky being displayed on the screen, but Stallone himself reminding us that all is not vacant in that head of his. After all, this is the man who brought us some of film's most prolific characters, which is why it is so depressing to see his name tarnished in the past decade.<br /><br />In the long run, Rocky Balboa will still prove to be both an excellent film and one of the best footnotes for a filmatic series. Not only is this the best holiday film, it's probably the most motivating one too. When that montage hits and you're moving in your seat, it's okay, you can dance around and clap because chances are every person seated either behind or in front of you is doing the exact same thing.<br /><br />It ain't over til it's over, right?

0375757856|5.0|The Moonstone, written by englishman Willkie Collins in 1868, is considered the first detective novel ever written, and it is also probably the best (Dupin's stories by Edgar Allan Poe were written earlier, but they are not novels, and they are arguably inferior to The Moonstone). Praised by authors such as Borges, but unfortunately underknown today (it is a mystery to me why there has not been a major movie version of this novel), the plot concerns a large indian diamond, the titular Moonstone, stolen years ago by a corrupt british officer, which in turn is stolen from a young woman called Rachel Verinder on her eighteenth birthday. The book is written on epistolary form - actually, each chapter is narrated by a different character, who often view the same events in a different light. The book includes several features that would later become staples of the genre, like red herrings, a large number of suspects, a bumbling detective, a subplot concerning opium usage, but here, they seem fresh. Add to that, a number of memorable characters, including sergeant Cuff, a clear predecessor to Sherlock Holmes, and you have a memorable book (if a bit on the long side).

B000H5V8DG|5.0|Alias is a show that has captivated audiences since it's very beginning when it exploded onto the screen and into our lives. J.J. Abrams, the genius/creator of 'Alias', managed to bring a big-screen feel to a small-screen television show. The gadgets and special effects are incredible, and there are so many twists and turns in the storytelling that it would make your head spin. The show constantly keeps you guessing, and J.J. is the master at cliff-hanger endings, which he used profusely throughout the majority of the 1st and 2nd seasons.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner turns in a stellar performance as Sydney Bristow, a spy who works for SD-6, a company she was told was a black ops division of the CIA. However, Sydney soon learns the truth after SD-6 has her fiance killed when they realize she has told him about her life as a spy. SD-6 isn't part of the CIA...in fact, they are a branch of a world-wide terrorist organization that deals in weapons, technology, and intelligence trade. Sydney contacts the real CIA and becomes a double-agent in an effort to bring down the alliance of SD cells all over the world. She vows to destroy the people who lied to her, manipulated her, and destroyed her life. Her only ally is another double-agent within SD-6...her father.<br /><br />The show was nothing short of breathtaking during it's first two seasons. It's third season was engaging and exciting, but a slightly noticable decline could be seen, and a less than exciting character was introduced...Nadia, Sydney's long lost half-sister. I felt that the entire Nadia storyline and character was a giant step in the wrong direction, and it only got worse when the sub-par 4th season arrived. J.J.'s brilliant cliff-hanger endings were all but abandoned, which sucked much of the excitement and thrill out of the show. Another hugely terrible mistep by the writers was their abandonment of the Rambaldi storyline. The Rambaldi mystery was one of the reasons fans were begging for more, and with each new revelation a tiny piece of the puzzle came together. How could they simply abandon that?<br /><br />I must say that I shouldn't place all the blame on the writers alone. According to interviews, it was pressure from the network which forced the show to move away from Rambaldi. Network execs didn't like the trans-seasonal Rambaldi story arc, and they never did. They pressured J.J. and the writers to get rid of it and come up with something else. Little did they know, the fans turned out to be Rambaldi loyalists, and it was eventually brought back into play.<br /><br />The 5th and final season made strides to recover what they had lost during the disappointing 4th season, but they were limited by Jennifer Garner's pregnancy and, in my opinion, personal issues. It was the shortest season yet, due largely to her pregnancy, and a well-loved character, Michael Vaughn (played by Michael Vartan), was gone during most of the season. Jennifer Garner and Michael Vartan dated for a while before she abruptly broke it off to date (and eventually marry) Ben Affleck. I think the tension on the set was too uncomfortable for her...hence Vaughns disappearance during most of season 5. Thats just my opinion though.<br /><br />This box set is cool beyond reason. The artifact box alone is an 'Alias' collectors dream. In addition to all 5 seasons of the show, you get a small book in which the writers, directors, and actors briefly discuss important aspects of the show, with little anecdotes (like who 'deepthroat' was in season 1), to frequently asked questions (like is that really Sydney depicted on page 47 of the Rambaldi manuscript? Does Irina really love Jack and Sydney?), and it even discusses storylines the writers had hoped would make it into the show, but never did (in a word...Irina). It's a neat little read, and fans will enjoy it.<br /><br />Despite my misgivings regarding the abyssmal season 4, I would recommend this show to anyone. If you have been collecting the individual seasons over time, it may not be worth it to you to re-purchase them in this complete collection...but it was worth it to me. I love the box-set format, and the box itself is just too cool for words. It's like having a little piece of the Alias world.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's an awesome box-set collection to a truly incredible show. Don't miss out!to you to re-purchase them in this complete collection...but it was worth it to me. I love the box-set format, and the box itself is just too cool for words.

0780624890|4.0|Fun with guns swords and vanpires what more could you ask for... How about a better pacing! <br /> <br />The overall film is fun, the extras are fun, the whole thing is fun. But there is unfortunately a flaw that all these kinds of films seem to share right now.  It is trying to shove way too much into the little 2 hour film (if your lucky). <br /> <br />I would say to anyone who's a fan of action, horror, at least  Snipes to get this film over the two other sequals of the same name, tag-lines excluded.  If you liked the others you'll love this one as it has the best plot and acting of the three.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I \\"Love\\" it! This could be the best re-compilation of music ever. I bought the Love album thinking it was just another re-cut of Beatles music. <br />When I first realized that it was a rework, I made up my mind fast...not to like it. I was pleasantly surprised, though, after listening to it completely through a couple times...while on a road trip. <br /> <br />These two gentlemen put out an impressive piece of work with many creative, seamless, transitions... and it has become one my favorite Beatles album overnight. <br /> <br />Sounds great through the car stereo too! That's a really important consideration when investing in music that you may already have in some form. <br /> <br />Next on the agenda...I hope!  The Doors, The Stones, Cream, Bee Gees, Moody Blues, Queen...whomever, they may want to tackle next. I'll be looking forward to more of their work. <br /> <br />
B000BP86OG|4.0|The quick and dirty review:  Good, but not as good as their debut album 'Permission To Land'.  Why?  Not as many heavy guitars!  The heavy guitars, 70's style rocking is what made The Darkness so appealing to us rock thirsty fans in the first place.  Please, no more Sitars...Give me the heavy riffs! <br /> <br />The Good Stuff:  I'm playing this CD in my car ALL the time.  My favorite songs are 'Is It Just Me?', which sounds like it belongs on the 1st album, and 'Dinner Lady Arms' (though I thought maybe 'Nelson' was singing this one).  The opening guitar riffs on 'Bald' are excellent.  Again, needed more heavy sounds like that throughout the record. <br /> <br />The Stinkers: 'Girlfriend' reminds me of the Bay City Rollers, and I swear English Country Garden came directly from the Rocky Horror Picture Show! <br /> <br />Overall, I definately like the album, and have no problem recommending it.
B000JJRIO8|3.0|It is obvious that Tupac's material is becoming more and more scarce, so in my opinion, this album was a mistake. It's the condensed, watered-down version of one of Hip-Hop's greatest assets.  They should stop.  Tupac has one verse on each song, and his verses are what made me give the album the three stars.  Absent of him, its garbage, and unfortunately he doesn't contribute that much to his own album (which of course isn't his fault).  Unless they come out with another 'greatest hits' album or something of that nature, I hope this is the last album. <br /> <br />----Pryncez
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This album doesn't have the same feel as his first one, at least not to me.  However, after listening to it twice over, (it's a pretty short album) I abosolutely fell in love with it. I even like it better than his first album.  It is soft and melodic, the lyrics are clever, and Ray's voice is very sensual.  The overall mood of the album is very intimate. I would say its the perfect album for anyone taking a road trip by themselves.
B000002JPA|5.0|Having growing up in the 80's, progressive rock wasn't much of a thing in my era. The chart rulers were Metallica and the likes, and miraculously lots of us guys were still into Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath (fronted by both Ozzy and up to about Dio). Well, all that have progressed to the 90's and came with it was \\"Dream Theater\\", a band known for their Metallica-Zeppelin influences and their debut album \\"Images and Words\\" just frickin' rocks to this day (thank GOD)! The opening track \\"Pull Me Under\\" was their signature; a hard head-banging number filled with Metallica style heavy riffs, a bit of Sebastian Bach ala vocalist James LaBrie and to the melody in the likes of Led Zeppelin. That's not done yet, the rest of the album is chocked full with the band's amazing musical talents showcasing in all aspects from the brooding and techinical basslines of John Myung, the sheering fluid fingers of keyboardist Kevin Moore, the AMAZING Mike Portnoy on drums and the highlight of the band is indeed newcomer John Petrucci and his limitless capabilities on the guitar. \\"Images and Words\\" is an album everyone can enjoy whether they're from the Progressive or Metal era and are into music that have constant changes. This album is timeless and I haven't got over it yet, I probably won't ever!

B0008ENHTE|3.0|Newman, after \\"Hud,\\" continued his career with films that clearly signified the evolution of the anti-hero into a man who actively opposed the wrongs he saw around him... This opposition was to be effectively personified by Steve McQueen... His early films that included \\"Hell Is for Heroes,\\" \\"The Great Escape,\\" \\"Love With the Proper Stranger,\\" and \\"Baby the Rain Must Fall,\\" all roles which, together with his addiction to motorcycle racing, led to McQueen's personification as anti-hero...<br /><br />This reached its peak in \\"Bullitt,\\" the film which finally confirmed both McQueen's image and his claim to stardom...<br /><br />McQueen is assigned to guard Johnny Ross (Pat Renella). When Ross is gunned down in his dingy hotel room hideout, Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn), the ambitious assistant DA who hopes to expose the syndicate, threatens to ruin Bullitt's career if Ross dies... But Bullitt is suspicious and, when Ross does in fact die, he suppresses the news while he investigates...<br /><br />McQueen's ability to convey Bullitt's contempt for Chalmers' threats - and his knowledge that even though he might lose his job, he would never lose his integrity - confirmed his image...<br /><br />Bullitt was Hud, Seventies style; he knows the world is full of crap but he is pretty sure that it is possible to keep out of most of it...<br /><br />The film is distinguished by a splendid car chase through the streets of San Francisco, with Detective Bullitt in a Mustang, chasing the baddies in their sedan... which takes one's mind off the tedious plot...
B000I5YR42|5.0|This is the CD I would take on a long trip if I was limited to one item. It is a fabulous kaleidoscope of sounds that captivate your senses through this marathon, one hour(YES 60 MINUTES)song/album. The Gods surely whispered in Tchort's ear(the band leader and composer)while he wrote this masterpiece, for it smacks of divine intervention. What is amazing is the fact that it manages to hold your interest (it really absorbs you) and keep you coming back for more. In fact when I first listened to it I was in my car and it mesmerized me. I wouldn't stop driving because I didn't want to stop the music. I keep driving for an hour even though I only went to the post office 2 miles away.<br /><br />Light of Day, Day of Darkness<br /><br />Now what about the music? It is impossible to describe this music but I will try. A soft synth starts out this masterpiece which is soon joined by a subtle tea kettle whistle and some light guitar and drum work at the two minute mark. A childs voice can be heard in the background as the vocalist starts his agonized, melancholy singing about the 2:40 mark. This continues for about a minute and then after a heavy metal interlude is joined by a choir, then after another minute a very crunchy guitar comes in with the singer until the 6:30 mark, whereupon we slow down again and get reflective for about two minutes when the guitars and choirs very heavily chime in. At about 10:50, as good as the music is so far, Green Carnation is just getting warmed up, the music gets even better and we've barely gotten started.<br /><br />I haven't mentioned the symphonic orchestra yet but their presence, mostly in the background, is invaluable. At the eleven minute mark the guitars, choirs and orchestra come together for a half minute leading to a drum and guitar interlude. Violins join in and take over at 12:40 and then the singer comes in joined by the crunchy guitars, singing \\"I think therefore I am, You are a fantasy made by me, I dream this world, When I end, the world will end with me, I am everything you are\\".<br /><br />We are now at the 18 minute mark, at a slow heavy guitar part where the male choir sings for about two minutes and then solo for another minute culminating at one of my favorite parts. At twenty-two minutes and counting Green Carnation puts on their Pink Floyd hats for about five minutes and then becomes Green Carnation again until halftime(about 32 minutes).<br /><br />At the 32 minute mark, a seemingly unrelated five minute section with a solo saxophone and lady singer makes it's appearance. I love lady singers but not this one and I find this section jarring and distracting in a most flawless performance otherwise.<br /><br />At the 38 minute mark we return to the dark brooding passages that we experienced at the 18 minute mark, then a nice keyboard section that sounds slightly Pink Floydish again. This section also contains a great whining guitar solo. Now at 44 minutes(only three quarters of the way through), the music gets reflective again via our great singer and a plunking guitar changing to an organ at 46:30, then the pace picks up with the crunchy guitar a minute later.<br /><br />At the 50 minute mark, the singer and both choirs join the crunchy guitar with a little up tempo section which leads us back to our half time singer and the full orchestra doing they're exceptional imitation of 'Salome' sitar and all. Back to the familiar G.C. sound and beat at 53:30 for a couple a minutes, then slow acoustic guitar and violins, leading to an ethereal sound and a baby talking. Then the Grand Finale and it is wonderful.

B00001QGPR|4.0|I am very surprised to hear some of the bad reviews of this album.  Bowie does another bang up job in my opinion and I found it to be very relevant to my own life and especially in the current state I am in.  I find Thursday's Child to be a superior song about a man regaining control of his life - it is very uplifting for me - 'throw me tomorrow seeing my past to let it go now that I really have a chance ...this is a song about a person changing his life around for the better - I love it.   Next song I love is Something In The Air, this is a fantastic song that chronicles a break up - a personal relationship that doesn't necessarily have to be with another person -... \\"danced with you too long\\" - this could be about an addiction.  Bowie's voice is excellent - his backup singers and musicians are all first rate - the whole album is excellent - Bowie is a fantastic lyricist. I highly recommend it.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|Within Temptation is a talented band from Holland or Netherlands if you prefer who's lead singer is Sharon den Adel and she's as pretty as her voice is. There's a video of one of the songs on the album and she's a knockout. The music is symphonic metal with orchestral and choir backing. It is highly melodic and enchanting. If you know and like the band Nightwish then this is for you.<br /><br />Some of the best songs are \\"See Who I Am\\", which starts with a huge sound then smartly slows down only to come back with the big catchy chorus, \\"Jillian (I'd give my Heart)\\" is just great with it's gigantic intro followed by the choir and Sharon's impeccable voice on the choruses and Stand my Ground\\" is slick the way it starts out sedately then explodes into a \\"don't mess with me\\" warrior mentality with the orchestra and choir. \\"Angels\\" is kind of appropriate with a heavenly Angelic sound and what can you say about \\"Pale\\"? Has there ever been a prettier melody in a song? This version features Jane Doe, which is actually one of their better songs and is fairly hard to find.<br /><br />Taken as a whole there isn't much variety since each song does resemble the others but that homogenous sound doesn't bother me. In some ways it reminds me of a fine musical score where a change of style could be jolting.<br /><br />I am really amazed that there are people that gave this album less than four stars. From beginning to end it's a great album. Is it better than their previous blockbuster, Mother Earth? It's close, I'd say probably not but only by the slimest of margins.<br /><br />Similar Bands<br /><br />Nightwish, Edenbridge, Visions of Atlantis, Dreams of Sanity, Enya, Loreena McKinnett
B000K7VHQE|1.0|There screenplay was wrriten by a man named Michael Arndt.  Michael should read a book by Robert McKee: STORY.  'Story' is a non-fictional book that teaches the art of writing novels, short stories, & screenplays.  In this book Michael would learn why his movie failed on so many levels.   <br /> <br />You see, Michael thought that charaters are the most important element in story telling.  Michael thought all he had to do was develop some interesting and flawed characters.  Michael thought the plot was something that other writers worried themselves about - but his plot would be an organic byproduct of some quirky honest dialogue.  The scenes in this movie serve no purpose but to put his characters in the same space.  The scene where Frank (Steve Carrell) just happens to run into the man he most loves and the man who ruined his life at a gas station purchasing porn - this scene serves no purpose.   I certainly didn't learn anything new or interesting about Frank during that scene.   <br /> <br />The moral of the movie seems to be that Olive and everyone should \\"(forget) about beauty contests\\".  I cleaned-up the language.  OK, suppose we do forget about beauty contests - what's inspiring, uplifting, useful, timely about this message?  How in the World does it relate to Frank's, Dwayne's, or any other character other than Olive?      <br /> <br />This movie contains mildly interesting characters, who were placed together for no good reason.  There is no plot here.
0345404475|4.0|Reviewer H. Lim pointed out that the movie \\"Blade Runner\\", which was based on this novel, helped make this novel the most read by Phillip K. Dick, and even raised the level of Dick as a popular writer.  I read this novel because I had seen (and loved) \\"Blade Runner.\\"  Many normally consider the book better than the movie.  In this case, I strongly disagree.<br /><br />The 4 star rating on Amazon means \\"I like it.\\"  In my case concerning this book, that is not accurate.  It is too well done for me to have given it either a 3 star or even a 2 star review.  But personally, I did not like the book.  And the reason I didn't is because of its philosophical effectiveness, and I disagree with that philosophy.<br /><br />The first complaint I have about the book is its basic philosophy, which is nihilism.  For those unfamiliar with the word, it refers to a view that there is no meaning to life, either real (as there is in Christian theism) or imaginary (as there is in existentialism).  In the story, Rick Deckard is to \\"retire\\" six replicants.  The one day record of replicant retirements is seven, but because these are more advanced, Deckard would set the record with six.  To me, this is nihilistic.<br /><br />The second complaint is the book's theology.  Wilbur Mercer is basically a \\"Christ\\" figure in the book, who is revealed to be a fraud.  As a fundamentalist minister, I found that aspect to be offensive.<br /><br />One thing I found interesting and even prophetic.  There is a TV program, which seems to be on 24 hours, called the Buster Friendly show.  This program consistently mocks Mercer, and is actually the source of proving Mercer to be a fraud.  This makes me think about how today's TV programs -- be it the morning \\"news\\" programs like \\"Today\\", the daytime talk shows like \\"Jerry Springer\\" and \\"Oprah\\", the nightly network news, prime time, or the late-night hosts -- are antagonistic to conservatism in general and Christianity specifically.<br /><br />\\"Blade Runner\\" is based on the book, but there are very few similarities.  Both deal with Rick Deckard, the test to discover androids, and the scarcity of real animals (replaced with electric animals).  The names of the characters common to both the book and movie are the same.  That's where the similarities cease.  In fact, some of the characters in the book are omitted (e.g. J. S. Sebastian's employer in the book, Buster Friendly, and Wilbur Mercer; also, the androids to be killed are down from six to four).<br /><br />The theme of prejudice is true in both the book and movie, and so is the theme about what really constitutes humanity, but the theme of mortality is missing from the book.  The robots do not have the four year expiration date they have in the movie.<br /><br />Rick Deckard has a relationship with Rachel Rosen in both book and movie.  The book is more direct that it involved sex (the movie showed kissing, but did not get any more in detail).  However, Rachel in the movie is more of a love interest and portrayed in a positive way; the book Rachel is not as nice.  Additionally, in the book Deckard was married, which makes him an adulterer; in the original movie, Deckard was divorced (his marital status was not dealt with in the movie, except an apparant absence of a partner other than Rachel).<br /><br />Because of its nihilism, its anti-religious flavor, and the adultery of the main character, I cannot recommend the book.  But objectively, I have no choice but to point out that it was well written and very effective, though depressing (even if you did not have the problems with the story I did.)Runner\\" is based on the book, but there are very few similarities.

But objectively, I have no choice but to point out that it was well written and very effective, though depressing (even if you did not have the problems with the story I did.)
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Starring Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes, The Constant Gardener tells the story of Justin (Fiennes), a rather passionless English diplomat living in Kenya, and his activist wife Tessa (Weisz). Unbeknownst to Justin, Tessa discovers a health-related scandal in Africa, and her detective work gets her killed. Justin begins a quest to retrace his wife's steps and discover the true story of her death. It was an interesting plot woven of world health issues, record profits for pharmaceutical companies, and international political intrigue.<br /><br />First of all, the performance are wonderful. Weisz is luminous as Tessa. She is probably the true anchor of the film. Fiennes gives a nuanced performance as Justin, although I did find some plot-related motivations towards the end to be a little less than satisfying. Also, the environment of Africa is practically its own character in this film. Faces of Africa, landscapes, the hard truths of life there - it's arrestingly atmospheric.
B00005JPE7|5.0|\\"Rocky Balboa\\" is great! This is the best sequel of the franchise. Sylvester Stallone has given us a movie that nearly comes close to the original \\"Rocky\\" (1976) and is the best sequel of the series. His directing and story and screenplay are excellent. The cast led by Stallone is excellent. The music by Bill Conti (who also did the original \\"Rocky\\" & the sequels) is excellent. The cinematography by J. Clark Mathis is great. The film editing by Sean Albertson is great. The casting by Diane Heery & Sheila Jaffe (both of them also did the casting to \\"Invincible\\" (2006) is great. The production design by Franco-Giacomo Carbone (who also did the production design to the upcoming \\"Bug\\" (2007) is great. The art direction by Michael Atwell & Jesse Rosenthal is great. The set decoration by Robert Greenfield (who also did the upcoming \\"Lucky You\\" (2007) is great. The costume design by Gretchen Patch is great. This is an interesting sports film that will keep you entertained.
0316776963|5.0|Sedaris has a biting, morose writing style. He's fascinated with the macabre. He is gay. Although he grew up in North Carolina, he's spent a good deal of time living in France and New York City. He has a wonderful, inventive vocabulary. Taken together, these qualities make for hiliarious story-telling. His accounts of learning French while living overseas are particularly funny. (Note: do not drink milk while reading these sections. It will spew.) And because the book is essays, most of them 5 or so pages long, you can put it down and pick it back up at any time. (Although you will have a hard time putting it down. I read most of it in a day.)<br /><br />Sedaris just has a funny, refreshing voice. Read this book.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is the tale of two cowboys, Ennis and Jack, who ranch sheep together one summer in the 1960's. One cold night, the two men huddle together in a tent to keep warm, and an explosive physical relationship erupts. They both agree that the night was a \\"one-shot deal,\\" but somehow the two men keep finding one another again, throughout the summer. After the ranching gig ends, both men nonchalantly tell each other goodbye, but the separation is painful for both. Cut to four years later - the men have gone their separate ways, married, had kids. But when they happen to see each other again, old feelings almost violently assert themselves, leading to a 20-year relationship that is by turns passionate, furtive, and tortured.<br /><br />First of all, performances by Heath Ledger (Ennis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) are unbelievable. I cannot adequately describe the performance work in this film. Ledger, who I'd only seen in fairly superficial roles - teen movies, not-so-great romantic comedies - totally transforms himself for this role. Tight-lipped, sun-baked, and shamed, his Ennis provides the tension in the film that powers the plot through to its final, saddening conclusion. Gyllenhaal plays Jack, the more honest, self-accepting of the two men, with an emotion that is strong enough to be real but restrained enough to epitomize the tough guy image of a Western. Both lend a haunting quality to the various ways in which Ennis and Jack try to live their lives, denied of the one thing they truly want.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, the tale of two people who love each other but can't be together. This is not untrod territory in Hollywood. However, hanging this familiar storyline on a less-than-mainstream social topic for the movies - homosexuality - proves to be very powerful. The intensity of the two men's feelings for one another, and the delayed gratification that is the bedrock of their relationship, bring their experience into sharp focus for the viewer. Beautiful scenes of mountainous countryside and a strong, simple acoustic guitar accompaniment add to the poignancy. I just cannot recommend it highly enough. It will haunt you. It will make you think. It will move you.<br /><br />Fair warning - there is one brief sex scene between the two primary characters. If you don't warm to that idea, I recommend getting the film on DVD and fast-forwarding through that part. It is not worth missing the movie over.erience into sharp focus for the viewer.

B00005JPDY|3.0|Lack of focus leads to lack of concern for story or characters <br />December 19, 2006 <br /> <br />\\"The Good Shepard\\" may be a lot of different things, but none of these hold it together as a whole. Similar to last year's \\"Syriana\\", \\"The Good Shepard\\" explores the nature and history of the C.I.A. by weaving together multiple storylines, characters, and continents across several decades, to confounding effect.  <br /> <br />Taking place between World War II and the Bay of Pigs invasion, the movie follows Edward Wilson (Damon) a bright Yale graduate who becomes involved with in the web of secrecy that ultimately becomes the C.I.A. A member of \\"Skull and Bones\\", the university's secret society, early in the movie Edward is approached by the F.B.I. to spy on his Nazi-sympathizing teacher. Taking up the offer, Edward begins doing missions for the O.S.S., eventually leading to working in London for the K.G.B. Eventually Edward rises amongst the ranks and is selected to participate in the C.I.A., a newly established U.S. government organization. During this time, Edward gets married to a woman he impregnated, and has a son and wife who he never sees.  <br /> <br />As he travels through the US, Europe, and eventually Africa, Edward works with people he at one time were told were his enemies, he turns on his friends and co-workers when he feels their allegiances slip, and true to the warning he was given by many, he learns can never trust anyone. This is all an excellent idea; seeing the life-consuming power of lies, deception, and espionage through the eyes of one man. In realty, however, the movie moves around too much, trying to cover all the bases, all the while wearing out the viewer into simply not caring anymore.  <br /> <br />When we first meet Edward, it is the 1960's, and he is reviewing a \\"top secret\\" case file while a crack team interprets a black and white photo and audio recording to discover where they came from. Just as our interest is peaked with these events, we flash back to the late 30's, and Edward is mud wrestling while he is peed on as initiation into his school's secret society. Lying nude, he is accepted into their club by a masked black-cloaked figure. Again, just as the audience shifts gears and becomes wrapped up in a much different, but equally as intriguing story, we travel back further, to the mid 20's, when Edward is a boy witnessing his father's suicide. From here we go back to Yale, and his poetry teacher, who seems to be a mentor to Edward, is enticing him to stay in his study for more than just schoolwork. While all of these stories are very interesting on their own, as a collection of 7 to 12 minute accounts, strung together solely because they happened to the same man, they make for a very tedious nearly 3-hour-long movie. <br /> <br />Early on, Edward falls in love with a deaf woman, but must marry another who he had a foolish encounter with. Years later, towards the end of the movie he sleeps with his secretary; a deaf woman. While it may seem that Edward saw this woman as an outlet for his desires of his lost love of youth, this idea is never developed. When his son, who Edward seems to have only spent a few months of his life with, joins the same elite secret club as Edward had done, the 15 or 20 minutes of time spent here are not enough to develop anything remarkable. Ultimately, the back-and-forth time frame and lack of clear focus made for a very all-over-the-place experience. <br /> <br />Many characters Edward encountered throughout his life repeated a warning: you would never be able to trust anyone. Friends he made at Yale became enemies later in life, mentors and father figures betrayed him or Edward betrayed them. It would seem the disorientation and not knowing what happened when or with whom may have been a part of DeNiro's vision. However, instead of getting the feeling I was a C.I.A. operative getting fed bits of intelligence, I began to care less and less about the tiny tidbits,and just wanted my operation to be all over with and done.  <br /> <br />The performances, though great all around, and the locales and shots, though pitch-perfect in mood, made for some excellently-crafted 5 to 20 minute short movies, but as a whole, did not add up to much at all.

B000GRUS22|5.0|Enigma, A.K.A. Michael Cretu, has finally given us a masterpiece nearly ten years in the making with \\"A Posteriori\\". Though I believe it is Enigma's last album, I am excited to say that everything ends the only way it could have started back in 1990: leaving the listener begging for more. <br /> <br />I was probably one of the few, or perhaps many, who was pissed off with 2003's \\"Voyageur\\". For starters, not only did it contradict the trademark ingredients of Enigma's style (ethereal movements punctuated by sexual undertones), but came off as an imitation. It had its moments, but when you find yourself juggling two singers in addition to your own, injecting lame lyrics into songs such as \\"Boum Boum\\", and letting the vocals dominate the musicianship altogether, you know you're going down hard. I was afraid that Cretu had forgotten what Enigma was all about, but after three long years, he's finally given devoted listeners an album worth meditating to, dancing to, and having sex to all over again. <br /> <br />What I like about \\"A Posteriori\\" is that it makes a logical progression from the mess that was \\"Voyageur\\" without disregarding everything and starting with a clean slate. There's only a hint of its predecessor in the opening track, which, Thank God, exhibits its roots with a plethora of Enigma staples such as ethnic tongues and the fading horn. After that, buckle up and get ready for an adventure. I never thought I would hear the same Enigma again, but Cretu masterfully creates something familiar and something new at the same time. The vocals are seriously overhauled this time around, so if you liked Andru Donalds and Ruth-Ann Boyle, you won't hear them on this go-around. For those who never liked Michael's singing, I assure you that it's not as bad as the last time. He chimes in here and there to prevent lagging, but he lets the instrumentation do most of the talking. Speaking of talking, did I forget to mention that Sandra drops in after a long absence to graceus with her wonderful voice yet again?? I swear she's been missing since \\"Enigma 3\\", but it's such a relief to hear her speak again, if not for just two songs.  <br /> <br />In terms of mood, \\"A Posteriori\\" has it in spades. It's the first album since \\"Screen Behind the Mirror\\" to give me chills by its sheer scope alone. The second track, \\"Feel Me Heaven\\", conjures up images of flight and accelerating towards the unknown, and \\"Dancing With Mephisto\\" is by far one of the sexiest songs to emerge from Cretu's catalogue in over a decade. I was somewhat let down when I first heard \\"Hello and Welcome\\" a couple of months back, but fortunately this album contains a radically different version that moves with the flow instead of spoiling it. And I never thought I would say this, but Cretu puts out his best vocals, not to mention ambient strengths, on display with the closing track, \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\". These are just the highlights mind you; the remainder of the songs succeed in unison to plunge the listener into a grand arena of relaxation and primal urges. This album is definitely not to be missed. <br /> <br />When I mentioned that this could very well be Enigma's last album, I was only speculating, but given that the title means retrospection and past experiences, I wouldn't mind if this was Enigma's swansong, because it's a damn fine swansong. Although people don't read these reviews, I hope someone will be convinced by some means to give this one a spin in the future. Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!
B000BTGY1O|5.0|An icon from our past shows us how easy it is to be great.
B00000I3JO|5.0|It's not going to be easy for me to sell you on this, but I'll do my best. I may come off as a little biased here (gee, that's a first), but inside perspectives work best and what review isn't seeded with a little bias now and then? There you go. <br /> <br />Instead of regaling you with an in-depth backstory of The Blue Nile and the time period in which this album was released, I'll just lay out the basics for you. First of all, I don't know too much about these guys except for the fact that they are a Welsh band that has come a long way in their musical endeavors (if the release date of 'Hats' alone doesn't indicate that I don't know what will). I suppose that The Blue Nile is something to be discovered by word-of-mouth or just pure discovery in and of itself. As accessible as The Blue Nile is, they're relatively unknown by mainstream standards, but that is, like most things, a blessing in disguise because what little you receive means a lot more. I accidentally came across 'Hats' while embarking on a brief albeit valuable quest to diversify my musical tastes; afterall you get tired of listening to a particular genre after a while. However, 'Hats' contained two red herrings for me: it came out in the 80's and *gasp* was easy-listening. Let me tell you about easy listening, or at least my initial opinion of it before listening to 'Hats'. Once you've heard Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, or Peter Gabriel, you've heard just about everything easy listening has to offer. The lyrics, the instrumentation, and the production are, from an outset, cookie-cutter. Despite this, I swallowed my pride and gave 'Hats' a listen.  <br /> <br />I loved it. I loved it because it made me do a double-take on how deceptively simple easy listening and softcore music actually is. 'Hats' is probably misinterpreted half the time by people like me because it doesn't fit into a particular mold so to speak. Most people may not like it because it's not an energetic record. The lyrics are pretty cutand dry, the vocals are so-so and there are no engaging hooks to speak of, but the genius of 'Hats' is its atmosphere. The Blue Nile somehow took the sights, sounds and smells of New York City at night and crammed them into seven songs. It's amazing. The keyboards not only refuse to be cheesy but actually enhance the proceedings to glorious ends. Everything sounds so smooth and disciplined that you really have to hand it to these guys. They don't aim too high, and in their case it's a good thing, because anything too ambitious would have easily gotten out of their control and destroyed the record from the get-go.  <br /> <br />It's an album that can sit side-by-side with 'Born To Run' by Bruce Springsteen (in fact, the vocals of Paul Buchanan come eerily close to Springsteen's), because they both deal with city life in a simple manner, but the results are nothing short of epic. If 'Hats' is worth buying for just one track it would have to be 'From a Late Night Train', in which Buchanan chronicles the dismal aftermath of a break-up by murmuring his way through lonely piano chords, a low synth line and distant, weeping horns.  <br /> <br />Trust me: as long as you don't set your expectations too high, chances are you will be in for a relaxing, heartfelt treat. And it just might make you think twice about easy listening and what the 1980's really had to offer. I give 'Hats' my highest praise.

0156027321|5.0|Piscine Molitor (Pi) Patel spends his formative years in a zoo -- the Pondicherry Zoo in India, that is, which his parents own. When he isn't exploring the animal kingdom surrounding him, he spends his time studying different religions.  By the time he's 15 years old, he's a practicing Christian, Muslim, AND Hindu (much to the chagrin of his parents and his religious mentors). In his sixteenth year, Pi's family decides to relocate to Canada to start a new life.  They and some of their animals set out aboard a Japanese freighter ship, headed for North America...But then something unexpected happens.  Somewhere in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the ship sinks.  Pi manages to make it aboard a lifeboat already carrying some strange survivors:  a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  The three former animals are quickly dispatched by the tiger's appetite, leaving Pi and Richard Parker alone, floating on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific, for 227 days each other's only companion.     Lots of authors write about spiritual journeys taken by their protagonists, but I'd venture to say that no one has explored this plot device as creatively as Yann Martel in LIFE OF PI.  Martel has written a brilliant story of humanity at its most elemental, when all the layers are peeled away and survival is all that matters.  The entire novel, in fact, reads as a metaphor pitting our human intellect, reasoning, and faith against the animal instinct that lives in all of us.  Pi's narrative is unflinching, at turns despairing and euphoric, hallucinatory and philosophical, gruesome and indescribably beautiful.  The story is definitely unforgettable, as is its protagonist.  I defy you not to fall in love with Pi! He's so earnest and determined, and his love of life is so inspiring, that it's nearly impossible not to relate to him. Even if his situation seems fantastical at first, even if he gives two versions of his tale at the end, he will make you believe in his and Richard Parker's journey.     There's a deeply spiritual and philosophical message embedded in this novel, but it doesn't overwhelm the narrative by any means.  Martel speaks to the universality of religion, a point of view of which, in today's world of religious strife, I think we could all do to be reminded.  \\"...Hindus, in their capacity for love, are in deed hairless Christians,\\" he writes, \\"just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims.\\"  Essentially, he seems to be saying, we all believe in the same thing, and the mere fact that we believe at all is what really matters.  LIFE OF PI is also very educational in a zoological sense, providing readers with interesting information about animal behavior and zoo life.         I agree with other reviewers here who have mentioned that the first third of the novel drags -- it does.  I found myself wondering where all the glowing reviews were coming from there for a while...But when Martel got to the heart of his story, he hooked me.  LIFE OF PI is a remarkable feat of storytelling, with characters (human and animal) who will resound in your thoughts long after you turn the final page.  The critics are right:  LIFE OF PI will make you believe -- maybe not in God, necessarily, but definitely in the resiliency of the human spirit in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.  A brilliant, fascinating novel -- highly recommended!

When the movie came out I was sorely disappointed because it just didn't do the story justice.  As an author of four novels myself, I must say that the book is always better than the movie.

B000GG4XJM|1.0|Nice music but pointless second release.  What next?  Deluxe edition, 2 CDs, five more songs?  No end to greed in sight is there.
B0009IW98O|3.0|I am not really a Bob Seger \\"fan\\", but I am a fan of Michigan Rock, and no fan of Michigan Rock should be without this disc, as this is a classic example. <br />Bob Seger is one of the most eccletic performers in all of rock, willing to tackle nearly every musical style--sort-of like another Michiganite, Kid Rock, of his day. And that is why nearly every album he's ever put out is like a different \\"phase\\" of his career--what \\"bag\\" he's into at the moment, as well as creating different atmospheres for the album he is trying to create. However, like the aforementioned Kid Rock, and any other Michiganite for that matter, Seger sounds best on what he cut his teeth on first--and that is just basic, raw, stripped-down funky, rockin' soul. And that's much of what you hear on this disc. The basic theme here seems to be trying to funkify \\"O.P'S\\"--other people's music, and like any great Michiganite before or since--from Grand Funk Railroad to Ted Nugent--Seger and his band here reconstruct and even out-perform the originals. This is especially true on the first three tracks, \\"Bo Diddley\\", \\"Love The One You're With\\", and \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\". Bob Seger had probably one of the tightest bands to work with on this album, particularly the organ work of Skip Knape, which was brilliant all through this record, and I've always thought that Seger sounded best with an organ, rather than a piano, behind him (and now he has one of the best organists in rock--formerly of Grand Funk Railroad, Craig Frost, playing behind him in the Silver Bullet Band!) But this album was at least three years before all that \\"Silver Bullet\\" nonsense that I never really cared much for, all that 'grandiose, E. Street-type show band' stuff that I don't really think suits Bob Seger best--but, again, that his \\"bag\\" and wanting always to try new things. The band on this disc was just thrown together between his days in the \\"Bob Seger System\\" and the \\"Silver Bullet band\\" and was just a simple, crackerjack outfit consisting of nothing more than a bass, drums, organ, and guitar. But for the kind of music he did on this album, that's all he really needed. The back-up singers added a nice touch on \\"Love the One Your With\\", and even really outshine the ones Steven Stills used (of course, it's not hard to find a good backup singer in Detroit, they stand on nearly every street corner!)  <br />The last song, \\"Heavy Music\\", sounds like it was a leftover track from his 60s band, that as  some bands did at the time--he tried to pass off as a new song and put on a new album, but with it's Mitch Ryder-style rhythm and old, dusty, studio echo, you can't help notice that it sounds \\"dated\\"--even by 1972 standards! I do believe he had the song as far back as 1967 in two parts as \\"Heavy Music, parts one and two\\" that remained unreleased when his record label at the time, Cameo, went bust, and perhaps with the theme of this album being raw, stripped-down rockin' soul, maybe he thought the time was right for this track to re-emerge here--but it certainly sounds like an earlier recording that he at least \\"tweaked\\" with, sounding really edited down, and possibly layering some of his 1972 band to it. That said, the edited down 2 minutes of this number don't do this racuous tune justice. If there was a \\"part two\\" of \\"Heavy Music\\", it sounds as if maybe it was somehow \\"spliced\\" together with \\"part one\\", to keep the length of this album perhaps shorter, but it does sound like it was \\"tweaked\\" with. But just the two minutes I heard of \\"Heavy Music\\" tell me all I need to know about \\"Michigan rock\\", and is the perfect rock anthem for the music that emerged from that state. Put \\"Heavy Music\\" in what ever full form it might have previously existed in, I would easily give this album \\"5 Stars\\", rather than \\"3\\". As for what the \\"O.P\\" is on \\"Heavy Music\\"--perhaps, just Seger's new band adding a layer onto Seger's old band. <br />All told, this was Bob Seger's best album to me--just for the kind of music hemade, and the kind of band he made it with. Bob Seger sounds best when he's just singing gritty old rockin' soul, with no horn section--just a bass, drums, guitar, and a double dose of organ behind him. The theme of this album is \\"Smokin' O.P's\\" (other people's music), and I've never heard a bad \\"O.P\\" smoked by a Michigan rocker--Bob Seger included!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Now why would it be bad if a low-budget movie with great actors and quirky humor won Best Picture? Simply put, Oscar doesn't go for this stuff. Yeah it'll probably get a nomination but I usually call those  <br />\\"rounders\\", meaning they're solely picked to round out the 5 nominations. Some were great movies, some were merely okay while others were like \\"why's this up here?\\" Little Miss Sunshine is a great movie sure but the idea Oscar will end up choosing this over some \\"historically important\\" but rather empty film\\"\\" is either when they finally got some sense knocked into them or people will think this is some massive budget epic in line with Braveheart or Gladiator. <br /> <br />Thanks to a contestant unable to compete, Olive Hoover is selected to compete in the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. However, family problems including suicide, a really mouthy relative and a struggling self-help guru wannabe prevent her from going. Unless you're in the Hoover family and they go on a road trip complete with a poor working vehicle and any other problem they run into.  <br /> <br />At a certain point, the grandpa of the family rants that they're having chicken again and I definately felt like that with my family. Not a week goes by where someone doesn't order pizza. This is one of those kind of films where it's easily to pinpoint the same occurence in real life complete with all its rough spots. While very \\"R\\" talking, the grandpa has a sweet relationship with his granddaughter that I've seen quite a few times and the angst-filled kid hates everyone yet can't resist the power of a good hug when everyone tries to figure out what to say. <br /> <br />The casting is always essential in a movie and thankfully not a single cast member is interchangeable. Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin and Paul Dano are note-perfect as the father, mother, grandfather and the son respectively. The 2 standouts are restrained Steve Carell who's likable and funny without being overbearingingly so in a Jim Carrey/Robin Williams way. But the real star is actually Abigail Breslin. Known as the too-adorable daughter from Signs (how cute was it when she said she couldn't drink water because of her brother's amoebas) but here she's adorable and sincere without in that kind of cloying \\"isn't she cute? We wrote her to be super cute\\" way. <br /> <br />Expect a double-dip, most likely around Oscars time since the special features are kind of skimpy. We get commentaries and alternate endings which are fine but don't beat the one in the film. Those girls that everyone was cheering over were so creepy, one literally looked like a porcelain doll. So when Olive does her routine, not only is it different and unique but it was actually more thrilling that showed the alternate ending was not the way to go. <br /> <br />Sometimes if a thing gets too big, unfair expectations are placed on it. After the massive hype a film like Brokeback Mountain got, you walking thinking this is the greatest thing ever (and to be honest, I'm one of the few who hated it and it wasn't because of the issue in it) so if Little Miss Sunshine gets nominated and even wins, I'd bet dollars to those fattening Krispy Kremes the words \\"overrated\\" will be thrown around loads. But like a character says in the film, losers is when they're scared of winning and don't even bother trying and this is a film that tries its damnednest.

B00005QAPK|4.0|\\"Spirits of the Dead\\"(1968) presents adaptations of three Edgar Allen Poe stories by three European directors, Roger Vadim's \\"Metzengerstein\\" with Jane and Peter Fonda, Louis Malle's \\"William Wilson\\" (with Alain Delon and Briget Bardout), and Federico Fellini's \\"Toby Dammit\\". The universal opinion is that only Fellini's entry is worth watching and it is indeed, spectacular with Terence Stamp fitting so well in the Fellini's freak show that it is impossible to take your eyes off him. The reason I wanted to see the movie so much was the CD that I bought some time ago - a compilation of some of the most beautiful themes composed by Nino Rota for the films of Federico Fellini. \\"The Ultimate Best of Federico Fellini & Nino Rota\\" includes the tunes arranged in the medleys for 16 films directed by Fellini. These are the full orchestrations (as heard in the movies they come from) and just listening to the familiar melodies brings back the memories and the images. There was one track I kept listening to over and over. It was written for the Fellini's episode in the \\"Tre passi nel delirio\\" aka \\"Spirits of the Dead\\" (1968), \\"Toby Dammit\\". The soundtrack for \\"Toby Dammit\\" simply stands out among the romantic and poetic gems. It is rich, obsessive and creates uneasy and creepy atmosphere which is quite appropriate for an episode that features a desperate actor (Terence Stamp) in a pact with the devil. Besides the score \\"Toby Dammit\\" has plenty of great typically Felliniesque images , an unforgettable ending, and not the least, Terence Stamp who might've played one of his best roles as the famous English actor, drugged and drunk out of his mind who arrived in Rome for the Italian Film Academy Awards ceremony. Toby was also offered the role of Jesus in the Catholic Western but all he remembered that he had been promised a Ferrari for participating in the ceremony and Ferrari he will get...with the ride to hell that looks exactly like Rome at night where every turn takes you to the dead end and the Devil only knows the way out but you will pay him a price...<br /><br />I found all three films interesting and involving on their own terms. I don't agree with the comments that call Vadim's adaptation a failure - it is certainly not. If anything, it is beautiful to look at and listen to and any film featuring Madam Roger Vadim (Jane Fonda was married to the director at the time) wearing the costumes that were certainly inspired by or even reused from \\"Barbarella\\" that was released in the same year, 1968 is worth watching. Vadim changed the short story by transforming a protagonist, 18 years old Baron Frederic Metzengerstein into 22 years old Contessa Frederica but he did not change her character. She is rich, bored, corrupted, and ruthless, a \\"petty Caligula\\", until she meets her cousin Wilhelm (played by Jane's brother, Peter Fonda). Making siblings playing cousins in love tells us something (or maybe a lot) about Vadim and his mysterious Slavic soul and reminds about Poe's own dramatic love for his first cousin, Virginia Eliza Clemm, whom he married when she was only 13 and whose death at the age of 25 from tuberculosis could have let to decline of his own mental state and his untimely death less than three years after her.<br /><br />Poe explores in \\"William Wilson\\" very popular in the Art and literature subject of a man and his double that represents his conscience, his dark and hidden side. The short story brings to mind such famous works of literature as Hans Christian Andersen's \\"The Shadow\\", Adelbert Von Chamisso's \\"Peter Schlemiel: The Man Who Sold His Shadow\\", Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" and Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\".<br /><br />In Louis Malle's short film, Wilson (Alain Delon) confesses his sinful and dreadful life to the priest recalling the outrageous and vicious deeds that have been prevented or disclosed by his exact double whose name is also William Wilson. Two scenes of the short film standout. The first is a simply chilling Wilson's attempt to perform an autopsy on a living woman and the second - Wilson plays cards, cheating shamelessly, with rich and arrogant Giuseppina (Brigitte Bardot almost unrecognizable in a black wig that does almost impossible - makes her look ugly). While it may be not the best Poe's adaptation and perhaps the weakest of three films in the anthology, two Delons for the price of one is reason enough to see it. I am glad that I finally saw the film that has achieved a cult status with years but is not easily available (I had to wait for several weeks for it from Netflix even after I had bumped it to the top). What started with my interest in the musical score by Rota, ended as a memorable watching experience.stand out.

B0006ZFQP8|5.0|As many of the reviews on this page testify, diehard Wagnerites live and breathe a world of their own when it comes to recordings of his monumental operas, especially Tristan und Isolde, and more power to them. As a musician who has resisted Wagner for most of my life, this recording - specifically the refulgent singing of Welsh soprano Margaret Price and the luminous conducting of Carlos Kleiber - is a revelation in every way, clearing away my every objection to the gigantic sound world of Wagner, and creating a kind of conversion to what this composer's music really means. I'm grateful for this. Price, whose singing I've long admired, is called a 'lyrical Isolde', a 'youthful sounding Isolde', an Isolde of 'beautiful sound' in contradistinction, apparently, to the Isoldes of Nilsson and Flagstad, hinting of course that Price's is an Italianate Isolde. Yet, when I read Wagner's score, I find Margaret Price inhabiting every corner of it with unbridled lustre of tone and committment, hardly something contraindicated by the composer. Indeed, hers is a fully human Isolde, noble, passionate, and surely one of this singer's finest performances on disc. I challenge any listener, even the most committed Wagnerite, to listen to her singing of Mild und leise wie er lachelt and find anything but a radiant exposition of a magnificent score. Margaret Price commits the wondrous act of warming Wagner all the way down to his human self, saving, not weakening, every ounce of his musical and dramatic intention, making it greater than many, even many ardent Wagnerites, ever imagined. She indeed forges new ground with her interpretation, revealing deeply Wagner's truth as an artist, despite whatever human flaws he may or may not have borne. As a result, Isolde is understood in a completely vital way, and so is Wagner's genius. It's equally clear that as supreme as Price's singing is she could not have achieved this amazing recording without riding on the gleaming musicianship of Carlos Kleiber, without doubt one of the last century's most revealing conductors. His attention to every detail never wavers, serves the magnificent whole, and the orchestra plays brilliantly. But then, every orchestra played brilliantly for Kleiber - such was his enormous gift. The combined effect is, as I say, worthy of a complete change of heart. With this recording, you will rediscover Wagner, new and shining. Rene Kollo sings Tristan with beautiful lyricism without sacrificing his bitter sadness. Fassbaender suffices, though perhaps Ludwig surpasses, as she usually does. The score, the score! Check the score itself as you listen to this discerning recording - you will find the Wagner of your intense longing! Highest recommendation, especially if like me you've resisted this music before in your listening life.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I remember this movie getting good reviews when it came out, but with school and all, it was out of the theaters before I got a chance to see it (I don't think it did well).  Well, I decided to rent it on Netflix and loved it so much I watch it twice and have since bought it.  I was surprised at how good it was and I believed becaused Keanu and Sandra believed.  I think this is the best work i have seen from either actor, as they are not my favorites.  It is a wonderful story about love and faith and some scenes will really get to you.  This is the kind of movie that when discovered by the masses years from now will become a fan favorite.  If you are looking for a film to buy, take a chance, you will not be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Simply an incredible fourteen episodes of television.  Everything from character to setting to morality is done brilliantly--this is nearly a must-see for anyone. <br /> <br />But among the many other things that Firefly represents, rarely in our television landscape does a show come along that shows such an incredible picture of leadership.  While many central figures in television coast through using pure charisma, Malcolm Reynolds shows us that even in friendship there are times when the good of the whole must come first.  When watching this show, you continually live with the feeling that no one comes above the rest of the crew--thus giving viewers a belief that none of the crew is safe (emotionally or physically).  This gives the show a raw edge that feels very genuine. <br /> <br />If you like the thrill of adventure without the bore of predictability, Firefly is an excellent choice.

0439574285|4.0|This book is a mystery book with twelve individual stories. This book was written a while ago and it was not aimed for young children. Because of this, the book is very dry and reading it will take a while. The stories themselves are good, but it is not a book you will just sit down and read all at once. The story's plot lines are quite original and this book includes some of Arthur Conan Doyle's best stories, \\"The Red-Headed League\\", \\"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\\", and \\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\\". Each story is in the eyes of Holmes' good friend, Dr. John Watson. This makes the book a bit more interesting for the reader. Each story is about 25 pages long. This makes nice breaks for the reader. I liked how this book had each mystery explained to the reader at the end how Holmes figured it all out. By the end of the book, the reader starts to pick out important information used to solve the mystery. I didn't like this book, however, because Arthur Conan Doyle did not give the reader all the information to solve the mystery by yourself. Overall, I would say this is a good book that I would recommend.<br /><br />~Rebecca

0790746905|5.0|EXCELLENT STORY BASED ON SHAKESPEARE'S \\"THE TEMPEST\\" ALSO BOASTS THRILLING EFFECTS,          <br /> <br />AT THE CORE -- THE SUSPENSE WILL KILL YOU -- ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ON ALTAIR-4!  <br /> <br />This very modern looking and well-made film stikes an emotional cord in many viewers and on multiple levels. To make this MGM classic Sci-Fi thriller from 1956 all the more convincing, there is an excellent cast and award winning special-effects, courtesy of Disney. We have love, rage and fear all playing at the same time and it is something to experience -- not just see.  <br /> <br /> <br />WHAT THE 'FORBIDDEN PLANET' IS ALL ABOUT -- [plot spoilers below]  <br /> <br />It's the 23rd century, and a United Planets Cruiser commanded Commander J.J. Adams [Leslie Nielsen] is on a rescue mission to the planet Altair-4. Apparently, the Earth spaceship Bellerophon vanished, 20 years earlier. The Bellerophon's destination was Altair-4. As we soon discover, there is only one survivor, Doctor Edward Morbius the ship's philologist.  <br /> <br />According to Webster's New World Dictionary a 'Philologist' is a 'Linguist', 'Scholar', 'grammarian' or 'lexicographer'. This is significant because what Morbius has discovered on Altair-4 will certainly need both a scholar and a linguist to unravel.  <br /> <br />Strangely and even rudely, Morbius wants no part of any rescue which of course makes Adams very suspicious and they land on Altair-4. What follows is what the film is all about.  <br /> <br />THE UNSEEN CAN BE VERY SCARY -  <br /> <br />As the story unfolds, with the help of excellent special effects, especially for 1956, we learn about the disposition of the rest of Morbius's lost crew and find that he has a daughter too. The two are all that have somehow survived some kind of \\"planetary force\\". As Adams and his crew remain to investigate and to await orders from Earth, that \\"planetary force\\" somehow returns to wreck havoc. If havoc isn't enough then perhaps some fatalities will get Adams to pack it in and scram.  <br /> <br />BUT WHERE IS THIS FORCE COMING FROM?  <br /> <br />Remember, I did say it was scary, it is, especially if you allow your imagination to run away a bit. As time goes by, the force becomes more determined [apparently] and Morbius becomes more disturbed. We learn of an ancient civilization called the Krell, that has become extinct and how this has been a source of major technological innovations that are now part of Morbius's household -- like 'Robby the Robot'. How did Morbius build Robby and what is it that we just don't see? There is a monster in this film and it is about as scary a monster as there ever was, literally indestructible and eternal.  <br /> <br />SO THE FORBIDDEN PLANET IS A MYSTERY TOO!  <br /> <br />Just what is this 'Planetary Froce', who controls it and what is the motivation for it is the mystery. As the film proceeds, the emotions: some of love, some of rage and some of frustration are building as they might within a pressure cooker. Here, the pacing of the film really helps to build the suspense, tension and fear. Yes, this can be a scary film. I thought so 50 years ago and still do today after hundreds of viewings.  <br /> <br />***** THE MAJOR PLAYERS *****  <br /> <br />Walter Pidgeon - Dr. Edward Morbius  <br />Anne Francis - Alta Morbius  <br />Leslie Nielsen - Commander John J.

Thankfully, this [widescreen VHS] version has them. One scene is not important and involves a pet monkey being shot with an electrical charge to keep him from eating a banana which was on the dining room table in Mobius's home. The other and more significant scene occurs during Morbius's little lecture, and show and tell session with Adams and Dr. Ostrow [Warren Stevens] in the underground Krell facility. The specific scene is where Morbius tells Adams to fire his blaster at the Krell metal. Adams does so and he and Dr. Ostrow are amazed to find that the metal isn't warm after being subjected to their weapon.I always felt badly that this scene was missing as it ties into what happens in the end by demonstrating how impervious Krell metal is to melting, even when fired at by 23rd century blasters [particle beam blaster].  <br /> <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: A TRUE SCIENCE FICTION FILM THAT IS 5-STARS IN 1956 & 2006  <br /> <br />This is from beginning to end and very compelling film that has aged very well and is still chilling to watch. It is an excellent story, has a well played cast, modern effects and great pacing that leads to a dramatic conclusion.  <br /> <br />
B000L43AN4|5.0|Tom Waits is probably the only Angel on this world who has seen the devil in the eyes. His Music is truely not from this world, not comparable to anything you have heard before, you just love to drawn in his cosmos and never face the bitter reality again. Nobody describes better the devistating nature of true love, the pain of saying good bye and the joy of sadness. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is his best album because you have never been closer to what really touches the soul of this great musician.   <br /> <br />I am deeply moved, astonished, inspired and thankful for his music and this album and I guarantee you to feel the same.

Very little of this movie is about anything other than these two men and their families during this ordeal.

For John and Will I salute their courage and am very happy they went home to their families. As for the rest of us, we will be glad we didn't have to endure what they did. Bring your tissue, you will need it.

0618680004|1.0|I hear Mr. Dawkins is a smart man. From reading excerpts from the book, it does not look like it. The guy's arguments are as trite and as flawed as those of a drunk maid. I won't go into each argument before having checked out the book at the library, but I have a couple of comments. First, he goes off saying that Religion is to be repudiated because religious zealots (namely Christians and Muslims) are intolerant, whereas atheist scientists are supposed to be tolerant; yet he sounds very intolerant in his attack of religion. So, I'm confused now, are atheist scientists tolerant or intolerant? Second, the fool argues that if the world would just conme to grips with the fact that there is no God, then we would all be better off. Oh yeah? Ever met Mr. Stalin? You seriously think that removing God from the equation will make this planet a heaven? Poor fool. Third, he comes up, all by himself, with the insanely original argument that, drum roll please, the God of the Old Testament is evil. Wow, never heard that before; we really needed a $16 hardcover to hear this one. Uhm, i wonder if the fool can come up with better, more loving ten commandments than the ones found, let's see, weird, in the Old Testament. Finally, if God is a man-made concept, do you really think that phasing Him out will leave men free? Don't you think that mankind will create something else to replace that concept? Would you not be back at square one then? Maybe not; maybe they would replace God with good, old, reliable science (or scientism) with its wise ministers called scientists. I seem to see that the fool wants to replace one religion with another, in which scientists like himself are the high priests. That's not square one for him. He just won the game. You know, with all due respect, I'm gonna stick with Jesus on this one, and listen to Mr. Mark Twain, who once said: \\"It is incredible what men will believe once they stop believing the Bible.\\"

Oh, but the magazine is Runway, a fashion magazine, and despite her initial resistance to change her plain-clothes, intellectual demeanor, Andrea soon faces a choice: be casual and be treated casually (and cruelly!), or be the best employee she can be in the environment in which she finds herself...in order to be treated as the competent individual she claims to be. This challenge is too much for Andrea to resist, even though it takes her further and further from the goals she was pursuing and the people important to her life.<br /><br />Andrea's job is as Assistant Two, replacing stressed-out Emily (Emily Blunt), who has just been promoted to Assistant One, and whose dream will soon arrive: she will accompany The Big Boss to Paris, where she will get wonderful clothing. In anticipation of the new clothing, Emily's food program consists of waiting until she's about to faint, then eating a piece of cheese.<br /><br />The Big Boss is Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), nicknamed \\"Dragon Lady\\" and accused, rightfully so, of putting her career entirely above and over her personal life, expecting nothing less of her scampering, nervous assistants.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci's character helps Andrea into better clothing. He is aware of Andrea's lukewarm attitude toward the Runway vision, and is one of many characters to remind her, \\"Millions of women would DIE for this job.\\" My favorite dialogue between the two:<br /><br />(Song CRAZY that Seal did years ago runs beneath - whoever is doing this version is doing good credit!)<br /><br />Andrea: My personal life is hanging by a thread, that's all.<br /><br />Tucci's: Well, join the club.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|It amazes me that a film close to 3 1/2 hours long never drags for a moment, even with the fact that I watched it twice in the same evening (the second with the DVD commentary). All the acting was universally excellent, but I loved Takashi Shimura as the Samurai leader Kanbei best of all. In this same year he also played a scientist in the movie \\"Godzilla\\". Shimura was mostly known in Japan as a character actor, often in monster or sci-fi films--but in many of Akira Kurosawa's films he is the star. <br /> <br />Slight spoilers ahead. <br /> <br />Look out for Kurosawa's characteristic use of weather to intensify action, especially high winds and the heavy rain of the final battle. Also, look out for the bandits cresting over the horizon as they descend down the long slope toward the beleaguered village for this final battle. The appearance of enemy hoards over the horizon will become a cliché in many later action pictures; remember Kurosawa did it first. <br /> <br />And, like many of the best movies, it leaves several deep questions to be pondered.  Why does this small group of Samurai defend a peasant village against a much more numerous foe?  It's obviously not for money or political advancement.  It's certainly not because these peasant farmers are particularly worthy of their efforts.  The other question deals with the meaning of the term 'Samurai' itself.  Many of the possible answers to these questions are embodied in the problematic 'seventh Samurai' played by Toshiro Mifune, but the film gives no easy answers. <br /> <br />This is the first time I've seen this movie and it has risen to being, for me, the second best film of all time. Only bettered by Welles \\"Citizen Kane\\". This film was remade in the US as \\"The Magnificent Seven\\". I have yet to see this film, but can't imagine it will be any better than Kurosawa's \\"The Seven Samurai\\". <br /> <br />Beth Palladino

He is not a \\"flavor-of-the-month\\" as one reviewer claimed, but an intelligent and thoughtful man who's worried about our future.  I find it irritating the number philosophy students who challenge Harris at every turn in manners that don't seem relevant to his goal.  I understand that some of his comments about mysticism may leave some (including myself) scratching their heads.  But it's okay; I need not agree with every idea Harris puts forth in order to hold his book in the highest esteem.  It seems important that Harris's bold book is actually quite accessible to the layperson.   <br /> <br />This is the first of many books on the subject that I've read, and it is the one that opened my eyes and finally completed my religious deprogramming process.  After reading \\"The End of Faith\\" and Dawkins's \\"The God Delusion\\" I am finally able to denounce the existence of god, with great joy and hope for \\"the future of reason.\\"   <br /> <br />It would be great if this was required reading for the fundies, but they probably won't read it.

B000002KKS|4.0|For a long period of time I was adament about never getting a Sabbath album that did not feature Ozzy because in my mind he was a lot of what Sabbath was. Then, I started to listen to some dio stuff and thought, hmm he's not so bad. And he isn't. He is a good front for this band.<br /><br />However, this is not the same band. Honestly, despite the fact that three members are the same they just don't sound the same. They aren't as heavy and most of the songs on this disc I don't know if you can even consider it heavy metal, outside of the title track.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong this is a good, solid CD, but that's what it is, good. It isn't great. There are great moments but overall, I wasn't blown away like some of you are. Now, when I listen to any of Sabbath's first 6 albums, those I was blown away.<br /><br />Basically, in a nutshell, this is a good album by high class musicians, but it still doesn't compare to the Ozzy years.

Hes not parting ways from Dre but he has gotten too high up the todem pole to be an apprentice. He brings out stat quo, ca$his, bobby creekwater, and a couple others to put them on the hip hop map and is really forming a solid foundation for shady records. He busts some of the rawest, illest rhymes ive heard pretty much since the slim shady lp, and tells the press he dont care what they think of him, at the same time mocking the search for fame in the hip hop world. People will be haters for stereotype reasons but when it comes down to it slim shady is one of the craziest mc's to put out an album. I hope his next album follows this path cuz this cd was sick.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I had been intrigued by the \\"Everything is illuminated\\" previews I had been coming across over the last few months, and I am extremely glad I ended up watching it.  <br />The movie is simply great. The story is deep and touching, and the characters are well developed throughout the movie. They can all be strange and funny at times (to the point where the movie is hilarious) but somehow one is able to sense a deeper meaning behind their seemingly random actions at all times. <br />Alex (Eugene Hutz) was unbelievably funny. Some of the things he says can compare to \\"Borat\\". Elijah Wood did a fantastic job and Boris Leskin added so much complexity to the movie. <br />The feeling this movie had on me is hard to explain. Movies involving the Holocaust or Holocaust survivors are always moving, but this one was moving in its own way-- (illuminating?). It sort of sneaks up on you without you realizing it. One of the best movies I watched this year, I highly recommend it.
B00005JJX8|5.0|I love nearly all of Hitchcock films, but this one is his best for sheer viewing pleasure.  Think about it, in this film you have beautiful scenes of the French Riviera, Grace Kelly looking absolutely stunning in some amazing outfits and Cary Grant as well.  I have watched this movie a few dozen times over the years and do not get bored with it. <br /> <br />After you see this movie you will want to buy a villa in France like Cary Grant did.  Enjoy!
B00005JPAJ|5.0|Some people are divided by this movie, but they would have to admit that it evokes some emotional response in the end (whether positive or negative). I personally was moved. I loved Inarritu's \\"Amores Perros\\", I wasn't fond of \\"21 Grams\\", but \\"Babel\\" is Inarritu's best achievement as a filmmaker. The scope of the story, with the different locations (Morocco, Japan, Mexico, and U.S.), and cultures are connected by a string of events (starting with a gunshot). The tagline well fits the theme in the movie to \\"Listen\\". You can see the many difficulties anyone from any country can experience from a lack of communication in the world and also between families. We live in a world that supposedly has crossed language and culture barriers, but the reality is far from that. Yet humanity still tries and sometimes finds deep connection through compassion. This movie made me ponder this among other things. Some people may think of this movie as similar to the Academy award winning \\"Crash\\", but \\"Babel\\" felt more heartfelt to me. Also \\"Babel\\" was more aesthetically appealing (cinematography and score), and not as forceful in giving a message. I was pleasantly surprised when \\"Babel\\" received the most nominations at the Golden Globes. Especially with two well deserved `Supporting Actress' nominations for Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi. I hope that \\"Babel\\" is as well received at the Academy Awards, because it's definitely one of the strongest films I've seen in years, let alone 2006.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|With the end of the critically acclaimed cult show  Buffy the Vampire Slayer, many fantasy/horror buffs, need no longer dismay.....hot in her footsteps follows the WB/CW smash hit horror anthology \\"Supernatural\\" something for horror/fantasy fans to sink their teeth into. The story follows two brothers, Sam  and Dean Winchester (Jared Padalecki of Gilmore Girls fame and Jensen Ackles of DeVour) as they make their way  cross-country searching for their missing father who has blazed a trail of  vengence killings against monstrous terrors in search of what killed his wife and the mother of his two sons years before. Dean, the older brother, has issues with Sam (Padalecki) who has gone on with his life while he helped Dad go on a demon hunting spree. When Dad ends up missing,  Dean tracks down Sam  in hopes he will help track down Dad. Sam  reluctantly takes out time from school  for a short time but when his girlfriend, Jess,  ends up killed in the same fashion as Mom, Sam is soon hot on the trail also. Each of the first seasons 22 episodes follows the  brothers encounters with strange beings from urban legends and various otherworldly creatures. Filled with laughs and genuine shocker scares, this show takes on the genre where Buffy left off, comfortably  filling  the void with great stories,  good performances and loads of  horror/fantasy fun! A must own for all horror buffs! Complete with episode commentaries from the actors. Six  disc set makes a great gift for one's self or others!
1878424114|4.0|Deepak Chopra's take on success differs from the traditional view in several very unique ways. Have you ever been told that exerting very little effort is a great way to become successful? I didn't think so. However, you'll find that one of Chopra's 7 spiritual laws is actually called the law of least effort, which impressively proves that natural intelligence and abundance are created with ease. Chopra feels that by trying too hard to 'get' instead of give, we are clogging the cycle of abundance that is capable of fulfilling our deepest desires. His conversational yet profound writing style helps drive home these messages, making you feel like you understand a new part of yourself by the end of every chapter. <br /> <br />Warning: If you can't handle ideas that may contradict with your current beliefs, this book is probably not for you. I would encourage you, though, to explore the thoughts of Deepak Chopra with an open mind. My prediction is that you'll find at least one idea in this quick read that will change your perspective on life. At a time when success books seem to be getting a little repetitive, 7 Spiritual laws of Success is like a breath of fresh air to anyone serious about creating a life of abundance and happiness.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|They are back!!!  This is Halford's best effort since Defenders.  Every song is solid with the best vocals and guitar playing yet.  Never have I heard such a complete Priest album (and I have them all in either CD or cassette).  If it came after Screaming for Vengeance, nobody would have minded much.  Other than Loch Ness almost a complete concept album for them.  In fact they rip themselves off and it sounds awsome!! Only the Priest.  Everytime I play this album it gets better and better.  Defenders it good (Defenders, Spread Eagle, Love Bites (best ever never live)) but it is not even as complete as this or Screamin'. Must buy for a diehard Priest/Halford fan (loved Fight's first one).
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Awesome show, don't listen to critics and people who didn't appreciate this film, it is violent and disturbing but for a good and deep and truly compassionate and selfless purpose rather than for glorifying evil and the director's cut gives touching, tear jerking meaning about stillborns and subtly God's plan or destiny. Far better than theater version that underestimated (hmm, maybe not after all) intelligence and spiritual depth of audience and gave in to a cop out shallower version. Get this, for the first time I've ever seen the Director's Cut is a VERY different movie. <br /> <br />Btw, it appears many seemed to have missed that baby being born to one of protagonist relatives or rather the deep meaning of that in RELATION to the protagonist and his mother. Hint: Order of life <br /> <br />Excellent show.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|This album shows so much growth. This album, represents what we all should do in life, get out of our comfort zones and try new things! and for Pete's sake QUIT comparing this album to \\"make yourself\\" and \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E\\"! Throw all expectation out the window and just experience it! Seriously this album isnt even considered a listen at this point its a total experience. From start to finish the album is SOLID. Brandon has one of THE BEST voices in music today. Mike, one word comes to mind when I hear this album, GENIUS! the man is a freakin' GENIUS, hands down. Jose continues to produce a solid foundation, pure excellence! Ben, exetremly wise addition, he was good with THE ROOTS, I think he is better with Incubus and I dont understand all the \\"Where is Kilborn??\\" on this album comments, he's all through this album, oh I guess because there isnt any scratching, some think he's absent from this project, GROW UP! The man is talented in many other areas and with many other instruments. I cant wait to see them in Concert in January!  <br /> <br />Bottom line : CHANGE IS GOOD!! Change is VERY GOOD! <br />
B000I5X81K|5.0|I love this album. The voice is great. I cannot find even one difficult sound in each song.
B0002IQOZA|5.0|I love it.  Christina really brought the Holiday Spirit to life in this CD.  This is one of my most favorite CDs...I'm listening to it right now.
B0000028M7|5.0|I'm still waiting for someone to provide me a meaningful definition of \\"grunge\\" music that does not mention time (late 80's early 90's) or place (Seattle). For example, aside from time and place, I hear few similarities between the early works of AIC and Nirvana. While Nirvana was clearly more influenced by punk bands, such as the Ramones, Meat Puppets, The Vasolines, Black Flag, and Husker Du, Alice in Chains's Dirt owes much to heavier sounding bands such as Queensryche, The Melvins, Black Sabbath, The Doors, and I'll even throw in Grand Funk Railroad.<br /><br />With that said, Dirt deserves the distinction as \\"one of the best ROCK albums of all-time\\"...period (and for that matter, so does Nirvana's In Utero, but I'll save that for a different review).<br /><br />For me what makes this recording work so well from beginning to end is this tension between on one hand the heavy sound and lyrics that ground the soul in a layer of depression and despair, yet countered by the more ethereal guitar playing and polyrhythmic drumming that (successfully)attempts to lift one out of the dirt. Godsmack seems like the best example of this tension between euphoric passages that share the feeling of being high on smack, and those passages that are laced in guilt and disbelief at how one could be involved in the harrowing world of heroin addiction.<br /><br />For me this above-mentioned tension makes this recording as emotionally therapeutic as a Muddy Waters or John Lee Hooker recording. On one hand, the lyrics and subject matter can seem very depressing, but they are delivered in such a skillful way that it can only touch you in a way that will uplift in the end. In other words, although I may have cried somewhere in between tracks 1-13, by the end of the recording I feel better off for having listened. In any case, I would much rather listen to REAL lyrics about REAL pain and experiences than ones that are manufactured and homogenized for the sake of selling records and aimingfor the lowest common denominator (i.e. sex, romance, and more sex).<br /><br />Finally, I believe one other aspect that makes this recording work so well is the modesty of the playing of the instruments. The lack of gratuitous guitar and drum soloing for me is a strength of the recording because it prevents the lugubrious wallowing in depression that is so often heard some earlier rock music. Don't get me wrong, there is a time place for songs like The End (Doors) and Whipping Post (Allman Bros.), but just not on Dirt. A lengthy song of that nature would have crashed the entire recording and would have missed the point.
0671027387|4.0|...makes an interesting combination. Gets cheesy at times, but a fast page turner with enough surprising moments.
0618680004|5.0|One cannot sit on the fence with Richard Dawkin's \\"The God Delusion\\".  Genuine or imaginary believers in God will consider this book a total nonsense - equal to Dawkin's view of their God and religion.  Dawkins puts forward the opinion that bible-believers are absurdly inconsistent when it comes to the interpretation of the bible.  On one hand, they believe that some sayings within their book of faith must be taken literally and then, on the other hand, as found in Genesis, certain biblical tales which do not reflect a benevolent God must not be taken literally.  Also, how can so many uncompromising followers of the Catholic religion have the audacity to claim they comprehend far better the words written in the bible than non-believers do?  Dawkins also, and rightly so, mentions the incongruity of some diehard God-worshippers who should be advocating peace, love and respect for fellow humans but, instead, they spew venom to those who deny the belief of God's existence.  The book is best summarised by George Carlin's quote at the beginning of Chapter 8: \\"Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man - living in the sky - who watches everything you do, every minute of the day.  And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do.  And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever `til the end of time....But He loves you!\\"
B000JK8OYU|3.0|This album suffers the fate of most soundtrack albums that are closely aligned with what is happening on the stage or screen, that you had to be there to fully appreciate it and if you haven't seen the show you're not sure what the point is of certain transitions. At it's worst, this collection sounds like one of those cheesy disco medleys of 60s songs, at its best it's a clever mashup of well-loved songs that leaves you wanting to hear the originals. I found myself inwardly begging, on first listening, for the song I was enjoying not to pointlessly morph into another song I'd also like to hear all the way through without irritating snippets of other songs added in. Really I should have waited for the long-awaited digitally remastered versions of the old albums to come out. That being said, the sound quality is a nice taste of what those remastered versions will sound like, and there are a few songs that are enjoyable to hear with minimal \\"reorganization\\" - Help!, Revolution - and one genuinely fresh version of While My Guitar Gently Weeps given George Martin's string treatment  a la Yesterday.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|From Songs In A Minor to The Diary of Alicia Keys she really is a true performer and she has a rare talent. She is a songwriter/performer/composer. The nine grammys she won was well deserved. I cant wait for her next album. Not counting Unplugged. The songs on this CD is remarkabley beautiful. And her voice compliments them. I hear the reason why she isnt recording is because she's working on a few movies. Hopefully it wont be too long befire she outs another one out there.
B000J103PC|3.0|Overall, The Devil Wears Prada is a pretty solid, fairly forgetable movie. The entire cast really shines, but none as bright as Meryl Streep. She could have come off as a caricature Cruella Da Ville-ish archetype, but instead she's created a very real portrayal of a success-driven business woman who's devoted her life to her work.<br /><br />I was surprised at how little actually happened in the movie. At several points throughout the film I felt sure that something was about to happen, some event about to occur... but that never really happened. Although the plot does seem to move at a glacial pace, the imagery (New York streets and skylines), script, and acting really hold their own and keep an unveventful movie from becoming boring. In fact, it's quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Parts of the story are a bit contrived, and in a lower-budget movie they would have seemed laughable, but willing suspension of disbelief comes in handy here. If you enjoy fashion and scenes where the \\"other girls\\" drop their jaws because they're so impressed with Anne Hathaway's makeover, you will LOVE this movie. If you're not really into that stuff, you'll still enjoy The Devil Wears Prada, you just won't want to buy it, take it home, and wear it.
B000003TA4|5.0|At first I was going to rate this recording with 4 stars, but decided otherwise while reflecting on the creativity, originality, and overall influence this recording has had in the pop/rock music world over the past decade. I suppose one can debate the degree of creativity and originality. Nirvana themselves were always quick to give credit to their influences which included The Ramones, Meat Puppets, Husker Du, and The Vasolines. But in my opinion I don't think one can underestimate Kurt's talent both as a musician and songwriter. It probably seems more obvious when listening to the follow-up recording In Utero, since Nevermind does suffer somewhat from a \\"mersh\\" sound production quality. In any case, the playing of drummer Dave Grohl and bassist Chris Novoselic on this recording prove that Nirvana had paid their dues in spending years honing their musical crafts. Like other notable trios, Nirvana understood that percussion and bass should stand out more in a trio setting. And Grohl and Novoselic seem to relish their roles.  <br /> <br />May be the proof of the originality and creativity of this band lies in the fact that one would be hard pressed to finger obvious historical precedents to such original songs as Come as You are, Breed, In Bloom, Lithium, and Polly. Sure, the blueprints had been laid by the above mentioned influences, but the value added by Nirvana cannot be underestimated; especially by the way of Kurt's poetic lyrics.  <br /> <br />This recording represents a very good starting point for appeciating Nirvana. But of course it should be followed by In Utero which has significantly more passion, energy, and better sound production. I suppose if this recording gets five stars, then In Utero gets 6 or 7. It is admittedly my first choice of listen should I be in the mood for Nirvana.  <br /> <br />In closing I would just like to add that music is a form of art, and it makes no sense to create a linear ordering (where every pair of artists must be compared as better or worse) on the set of musicians. Why is it so difficult to appreciate all of following artists without slamming one versus the other: Mozart, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, Metallica, Nirvana? Why is it that in a supposedly free society some people seem so in a hurry to close their minds to music and other art forms? Ah...Nevermind.
B0002STNQ2|4.0|borders between believable and unbelievable. But as usual Crichton excels at his fort 'technology gone wrong' tales
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Now, this is a prime example of a sophomoric slump. As if \\"Hollaback Girl\\" was not enough murder to the ears, Stefani is back with overblown and annoyingly redundant tracks that would make Fergie look understated.<br /><br />The Sweet Escape is a disappointment in all standards. The debut single serves as a preview of how irksome the tracks are. \\"Breakin' Up\\" wins the top prize and \\"Yummy\\" is so vexing, it makes you forget everything good the Neptunes have put on the pop plate.<br /><br />The only redeeming factors are the Keane-penned \\"Early Winter,\\" even with Stefani's limited vocal delivery, and \\"4 In The Morning.\\" The rest sound like rejected b-sides off her debut sessions, which they probably are considering the quick follow-up.<br /><br />It's highly recommended that Stefani return to No Doubt and to put her solo efforts to rest.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|IGN just voted this their \\"DVD of the Year - 2006\\", so if you're debating whether or not to purchase it, than there's a big hint on what choice to make.  This is another excellent release produced by Charles de Lauzirika, the man behind Ridley Scott's other great special edition releases such as Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Legend, Hannibal, Thelma & Louise, Matchstick Men, and Alien.  I cannot even imagine, especially after Kingdom of Heaven on four discs, what Lauzirika will accomplish with the upcoming Blade Runner set. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven.  If you saw the original, you hopefully enjoyed it, yet realized that it was in fact a very flawed movie which moved at a very unnatural pace especially in the first act.  This version is over three hours long, the other is about two and a half.  The only thing sad about this is that if this Director's Cut would have been the version to hit theatres, this film would've gone somewhere instead of no where.  The footage that has been brought back into this cut has turned the movie into a much more believable tale.  When you realize what was taken out of the theatrical release you will be astounded.  It's amazing to think what story elements were sacrificed only to get an acceptical running time.   <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the movie than you've got two discs worth of a 3+ hour movie to watch here, which includes a few commentaries for that running time.  The 3rd an 4th disc are packed.  Think of the 2003 Alien Quadrilogy combining with the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition DVDs.  Nothing is left out on these 4 disc, and if you own the original release, then you've got 6 discs worth of Kingdom of Heaven to cherish. <br /> <br />If you're a Ridley Scott fan and really wanted to like the film when you first saw it in '05, then this is the version that you'll be satisfied with as long as you can sit through its running time, and I doubt that sitting through a movie this great would be that big of a problem.  I'm not kidding, the original ranges from a 7 - 8/10; this cut ranges from a 9-10/10, it really is that much of an improvement and should really be made the official version of the film. <br /> <br />I highly recommend getting this DVD, even if you just liked Gladiator or something.  It's an excellent movie, and IGN's \\"DVD of the Year\\", so what are you waiting for?
B000IOM0YM|5.0|This DVD is beautifully packaged and essential viewing indeed anyone who can find fault needs to have a good hard look at themselves in the mirror. Featuring multiple early and prime era concerts, TV appearances galore, an early days doco from the UK, interesting and informative commentary by Gene and Paul in the special features and two hidden golden nuggets in the titles, infact its so good you need a slap from a close friend to ensure you are not imagining it all and that you have died and gone to heaven. This is the stuff that many hard core fans have asked for from the band for years and they have delivered in fine form, although most will have experienced the footage in one way or another before over the years in various bootleg formats. Can't wait for the future additions which will span the other great eras and incarnations of this great band my fingers are crossed that they can deliver a good quality \\"Creatures\\" and \\"Lick it Up\\" show. Many criticize Gene and Paul for trotting out the same old stuff but trust me this is special, and that probably explains why it is still in the top ten Billboard DVD charts today (heading back up and not down). The beginning perhaps of a new dynasty around Kiss releases, namely if it ain't new giving us quality products over quantity. And as a final note: if you still can find additions with the bonus discs all three are essential viewing and should be snapped up quick.
B00005JPE7|4.0|better than rocky V, 3 i sitll liked the one in russia but again this was one of the better ones
B000IOM1RI|4.0|It's a pretty cool soundtrack thing, (Although it's not as good as their debut), but I'd think that were would be more reviews for it... Where are the fans?
B000J3FC0Q|5.0|This album is proof that sophomoric slumps are not inevitable. Winehouse returns with a vintage feel that makes Christina Aguilera's recent foray into nostalgia asinine and overproduced.<br /><br />Back To Black is Winehouse's ode to substance abuse. The whole album, from the rapidly infectious \\"Rehab to the the closer \\"Addicted,\\" has recurrent themes of alcoholism and heartbreak woes. The album borrows its name from the best track on the album, which starts out uncomfortably close to th the Supremes \\"Baby Love\\" but becomes a haunting ode to infedelity and its aftermath. Had Sylvia Plath been a pop lyricist this would be her masterpiece.<br /><br />Other standout tracks include the giddy Aretha-inspired \\"Tears Dry On Their Own,\\" the only wake from the clinical depression of the album, and \\"You Know I'm No Good.\\"<br /><br />Her fast-paced lifestyle and drunken TV appearances didn't stop her from delivering a contender for album of the year.
B000002ADT|5.0|Seriously..this is one of the most important and beautiful works ever recorded.  As Jimmy Cobb said about this album -- 'It must have been made in heaven.'  That is one very easy and honest way to describe this album.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have always kept my distance from John Mayer.  I used to think of him as very derivative -- stealing bits and pieces from Ben Harper and Dave Matthews to create a somewhat derivative sound.  This album changed everything for me.  Some elements are still derivative but its clear that Mayer is singing from his soul.  Waiting on the World to Change is like a modern day What's going on?  Elements are borrowed not only from Harper and Matthews but also from old school soul artists like Marvin Gaye.  This album is everything its cut out to be.  Its Mayer at his best.  I have really enjoyed listening to it.
B000JLTRJ0|4.0|Oliver Stone has made a very compelling and respectful portrayal <br />of one of the most inspiring stories of survival in our time. <br />I've seen a lot of movies in my life and this one is one of the few <br />that have stayed with me for days after seeing it. I was engaged from <br />beginning to end. World Trade Center also feels like one of Stone's <br />earlier films like Salvador or Platoon.Very raw. <br />There are a few minor flaws. The only complaint I have is the portrayal <br />of Staff Sargeant Karnes. It simply stands out too much in comparison  <br />to the natural portrayal of the rest of the characters. <br />This is still a good film and an important film. Anybody who snubs  <br />Stone for not making the conspiracy film they expect from him need to <br />get over it and see this. If he wanted to make a conspiracy film he  <br />would have. He wanted to spread some hope. How could anyone have a problem with that? Thank you,Oliver! <br />
B00000JBCP|5.0|I bought this CD because I read Adam J. Jones review, and let me tell you, he is so right, this CD is absolutely fabulous!!
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine Dion's voice is too amazing for words. No matter what albums I receive of hers or what style she is singing, she's amazing. But I'm still extremely partial to this album. This is one of those albums where you can listen to every song and actually like or love every song. The first CD that made me appreciate her talent is still the best to me.
B00006I53S|4.0|This is a great walkabout lens. After using it for a while, it focuses fast and quietly, the IS works brilliantly. Complaints, it telescopes under its own weight after a while. You cannot pan with the IS. If you are using a 1.6 crop factor body (20D, 30D etc.) it is not wide enough. I have noticed that its color and contrast could be better.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I'm pretty much being nice to Richard Donner since this cut of Superman II still needs more work ,but I wouldn't complain too much. For all the efforts that has been put into a movie thats 30 years old, WOW! After all of the reviews I read I really thought this version was going to be bad. Its not,just have to excuse the fact Richard Donner cannot reshoot anymore footage so whatever is still around he has to use! This is not the extended editions to Lord of the Rings people! So whatever budget they had to use the editing crew assigned did an outstanding job at recreating the original vision. This is the only look at what would have been a fantastic sequel if Richard Donner could reshoot, rewrite sequences that appear to be uneven and some plot holes that leave many questions and a completely new ending (since they originally intended the \\"turn back time\\" ending for superman 2 ,but decided to throw it into superman 1). <br />Don't expect Superman 1 when you watch it, just expect a movie that if it were able to turn back time this film would have been by far the most impressive comic book sequel ever.
B000H5U832|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely.  It was geared for a youth audience but I enjoyed it as well.  I had friends that watched and recommended it to me, that's why I made my purchase and I'm not sorry I did!!!
B00002DE2L|5.0|The title says it all. This is the cd to compare to all other performances of this work. Very similar to Karajan's interpretation. So if you like his then you'll love this. <br /> Mutter is at her best and pulls off the visual images in her playing better than any other I've heard. You can feel the summer storm and the chill of the winter concerto. the Trondheim Soloist keep pace and drive the performance in a grand way. <br /> One of my favorites.
0760750874|3.0|I love this book, but this copy is not even 4 x 6 inches.  The print is very small. I would buy a bigger copy if I had the chance again.
B000J10ERO|5.0|I've been a Supmerman fan forever, and I've gotten excited over every tidbit of news about another Supes movie that I can remember. I was a little bothered by the Nicholas Cage/Tim Burton Superman that almost was. This is a character that should not be darkened and made gritty. That's Batman's thing. This movie, though it did have it's slow point, was awfully entertaining. True, Brandon Routh is no Christopher Reeve, but he still nailed the Clark Kent/Superman character. And much kudos to everyone for keeping the John Williams score! My only gripe about that was that it should have been a little longer.  <br />Can't wait until the next one!!!
0743298020|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  The writing is art.  The story unique.  I could not put it down, nor could my daughter.  We anxiously await Setterfield's next book!

B00005JNS0|4.0|I kept hearing about the movie \\"Cars,\\" but somehow I never got around to seeing it. Then lately, I stumbled upon the DVD and purchased it on the advice of my companion. We watched it a couple evenings later. It's an amusing and somewhat touching movie. Dumb, perhaps, but amusing.<br /><br />The story involves Lightning McQueen, an ambitious rookie racecar who unexpectedly finds himself marooned in the old Route 66 Arizona town of Radiator Springs. McQueen was on route to the big Piston Cup Championship in California where he was to compete against two pros with whom he'd tied in a previous race.<br /><br />In Radiator Springs, McQueen gets in trouble with the law and has to do community service repairing the street. As such, he gets to know Some of the town's characters. Sally, a 2002 Porsche, becomes his lady friend. Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet, gradually reveals he was a previous three-time Piston Cup winner. Mater, a beat up but trusty tow truck, helps him realize that there are other things just as important as racing. McQueen eventually goes on to compete in the Piston Cup, where he could have won.<br /><br />It's an amusing story, well told. There are chuckles here and there. The depictions of the cars and the setting of Radiator Springs are interesting. In places, the movie is touching. It'll probably pick up a few awards, but I wouldn't rank it with the best animations.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B000IKHNT8|5.0|The tin came prior to Christmas, which is great by itself! The product arrived in great shape; I really haven't looked inside it yet, since it went right into wrapping paper for the tree right after it arrived! If my son opens it and it's empty, that will be another story! However, I have always had great luck with Amazon, so far no let downs!!! <br /> <br />I was really pissed, along with all of the other folks (my generation), that stood in line for over four hours as kids when these movies first came out to the widescreen, only to have \\"you know who\\" alter the originals (taking out the original \\"ghost scene\\" Vader, and replacing him with the new \\"young Anakin\\"). What the hell was he thinking about? That's like taking and Original Shelby Mustang and trying to put new Mustang parts on it.... It just isn't the right thing to do, and everybody will think your retarded! Please pass this on to George!!! <br /> <br />So needless to say, I was very thrilled to find the \\"un-altered\\" originals for sale!!! I got them before George could screw them up! Yee-haa!! <br /> <br />  <br />
B00005JPE7|4.0|The entire Rocky series has been a great ride.  All of the Rocky films have been inspirational, entertaining, and of course a little predictable.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is no exception, but this film has the same \\"rough\\" edges that made the first Rocky such a hit.<br /><br />Rocky is still back in Philadelphia, but now he owns an Italian restaurant (Adrian's) with Mexican cooks preparing the food.  The restaurant kind of becomes the focal point for a lot of what goes on in the film.  Well, that and Adrian's gravesite.  The scenes at both of these locations work well, and add a lot of realism to Stallone's sixth installment of the series.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone and his films have always inspired me to believe in the impossible; I'm sure many people around the globe think the same.  He has been criticized for riding the success of the Rocky films, but I think the films are great.  I also consider Stallone a man who has lived a full life, giving his all to his work, his family, and himself.  He's made mistakes, but he has always accepted responsibility for his actions and moved on.<br /><br />Stallone had to have doubts about making Rocky Balboa.  But I noticed the people in the theater, especially the generation who grew up watching the Rocky films, seemed to be visiting a cast of old friends as they watched the film progress.<br /><br />The only part of the movie I thought could have been a lot better was the fight sequences between Rocky and Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon (Antonio Tarver).  After all of the amazing boxing matches Rocky has been in, only a match between Rocky and Godzilla would have sufficed a true Rocky fan.<br /><br />The best parts of the film are every single scene with Geraldine Hughes (Marie).  She absolutely steals the show with every move she makes and every word she speaks.  Whether she is telling Rocky about her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III) or giving Rocky a speech about why he should box the current champion (a crazy idea if you ask me), she is so believable that she deserves an academy award for almost single-handedly carrying this film into the Land of Possibility.  Geraldine Hughes is now my favorite actress!<br /><br />Rocky fans will also be happy with Paulie's (Burt Young) return to the big screen.  Age has not made Paulie anymore of an adult, and his dialogue throughout the film reminds us why we all first fell in love with this guy - as creepy as that sounds.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is not as predictable as I thought it was going to be.  It has just enough things going on in the film to keep it interesting, just enough action scenes to get your blood pumping, and just enough romance to make you wonder if Rocky and Marie get married in the never-to-be-made Rocky 7 (Rocky and Marie Balboa).<br /><br />At the end of the movie, the people in the theater broke out in applause.  I think men and women appreciate the hard work Stallone has put into his Rocky films.  I think they were saying goodbye to their old friend - Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />And I think we are all going to miss him!<br /><br />Bye Rocky!  It has been a blast!<br /><br />See ya next review.es an academy award for almost single-handedly carrying this film into the Land of Possibility.  Geraldine Hughes is now my favorite actress!

B000J103X4|1.0|The Doctor's Advocate? How can he be the Doctor's Advocate when the doctor isn't even on his album. Game was a one hit wonder for 2005 just like Mike Jones was. He's nothing now, the biggest mistake he made was turning on G-Unit and look where he is now. He went gold in his first week on his first album but that was only because he had the support of Dre and 50. Now without them, he's simply another trend that is long forgotten and replaced by the next new rapper. This album is just plain terrible. The beats are ok but Game's annoying name dropping and bad lyrics ruin it. You want a true west coast album? Buy Snoop's new album and leave this junk on the shelf because it's one of the year's worst albums.
0743289412|5.0|This book is his best.  I thought I would never say that, as others tied in my heart for the title, but this is the best.  Sad, funny, scary, paced brilliantly, laced with metaphor on writing, living, and what makes us human--and the thin purple veil that separates the physical world from the intangible world of humanity, both the good and evil--it certainly shows all of old SK's last thirty years of novels were merely practice.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|As a big fan of Miami Vice during the 1980s, it was only natural that I would see the motion picture in the theater. However, I wasn't expecting much, since remakes and screen adaptations of TV shows usually flop. But Miami Vice is an exception to this trend - the acting is very good, the action is explosive, and the cinemetography is outstanding with beautiful settings along South Beach, the Florida Keys, Cuba, and Colombia. Colin Farrel and Jamie Fox star as the legendary Crockett and Tubbs. <br /> <br />However, the film is not perfect and there are some criticisms that deserve mention. First, other than the Crockett and Tubbs characters, there isn't much connection to Miami Vice. Secondary characters, such as Gina, Trudy, Switek, Zito, and Castillo - all of which played very important roles in the TV series - are nearly non-existent in the film and only play very minor roles. Also, the movie loses a good degree of Crockett's and Tubb's personas that were so pervasive in the TV program (Crockett as the ubersexual, wise-cracking macho man and Tubbs as the sharp-dressed slickster from the Bronx). Farrel and Fox give good performances, but the movie portrays them as robot-like killing machines more so than than the Crockett and Tubbs fans of the series will remember. <br /> <br />But the movie is fairly good overall...it just doesn't quite feel like \\"Miami Vice.\\" However, any fan of the series should watch the movie. The plot is quite elaborate and the action is over-the-top.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I love this movie and the more I watch it, the more I love it. So original, so fresh, so well acted and FINALLY not another cheesy romantic comedy.  Kate Winslet - has she ever been in a bad movie? She is phenominal as usual and Jim Carrey really shows his depth.  This is a great date movie too because men really like to watch it.  It is definitely one that you need to watch more then once to truly understand it and value it.  Highly recommend
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins presents his usual lucid and entertaining writing style, a joy to read. In every area of life we consider the concept of \\"faith\\" (believing things without good evidence because you want to) to be synonymous with a sort of dishonest intellectual cowardice. But with religion, for some reason it's different. We don't challenge it. It is one thing to believe in a universal creator, it's quite another to think that this being is behind one of our holy books. Religionists like to conflate the two, as if somehow a mysterious universe proves the existence of their particular imaginary deity. Dawkins provides a case against a creator from all fronts. But I do not think he is dogmatic at all, as his critics unceasingly claim. There are no good reasons at all for believing in the god of any of the world's holy books and pointing this out is not a form of dogmatism.
B00006WKSZ|4.0|I walked into Mother's Records in Winnipeg in late 1978 ready to buy Kiss Alive II, but hesitated when I heard a new, different live album playing through the store speakers. This was the first time I had ever heard of Scorpions, let alone their music, and I was quickly absorbed by the album. Suffice to say I left the store with `Tokyo Tapes'  rather than the album I had come to purchase.     Scorpions had yet to reach star status internationally, but in Japan, the second largest musical market in the world, the band were already legitimate superstars. Following the release of `Taken By Force', it was only natural that Scorpions would tour Japan. The response of the fans, plus the sheer energy coming off the stage, prompted the group to record two sessions at Budokhan (only days after Cheap Trick's recordings), and those recordings became `Tokyo Tapes'.    If you don't have any early Scorpions, this could serve as a worthy introduction. They hit all the high points of their first four albums (excluding `Lonesome Crow'), as well as throwing in a few covers (unneccesary, in my opinion), and winning the crowd even more with their rendition of the Japanese folk song, \\"Kojo No Tsuki\\". Even though the sound quality is at times muddled, what shines through is the musicianship. Klaus Meine is on his game, the rythym section thunders, Rudolf Schenker shows adept ability, but it's Uli Jon Roth's virtuoso, and at times otherworldly playing that is the highlight here. His performance alone is worth the price of the album - check out the playing on \\"Robot Man\\" and \\"We'll Burn The Sky\\" and you'll see what I mean. This is the last Scorpions album of any sort that Roth plays on, and his departure and subsequent addition of Mattias Jabs clearly defines the transition between the \\"old\\" Scorpions sound and \\"new\\", cleaner Scorpions sound.

B000J103YI|4.0|This album features awe-inspiring performances from Jennifer Hudson and H-town's own Beyonce as they perform 2 great songs that bring the house down. (Especially \\"Listen\\") \\"Dreamgirls\\" were inspired by Diana Ross & The Supremes, And Eddie Murphy's character was inspired by the hardest-working man in Show-Biz Today, R&B Legend James \\"I Feel Good\\" Brown. It's well worth the money! Beyonce is MY Fiance! \\"Say it Loud... I'm Black and I'm Proud!\\"-James Brown (1933-2006)
B000JJRIN4|2.0|What started out as a wonderful experience in dance/pop music has turned into a solo career that cannot be taken serious anymore. I am talking about Gwen Stefani's career, which increasing is leading to questions of who is the real talent behind No Doubt, because Gwen has not displayed any of the passion that made her a rock princess. Don't get me wrong, I am all for \\"fun\\" mindless music, but not from an artist who is obviously desperate (jumping on the hip hop bandwagon) and is making music that sounds like she was aiming to meet the Christmas/record company deadline. <br /> <br />The sad part about it is Gwen should know better. She is part of Rock's royalty and is generally respected by her peers as being a true songwriter and artist. She is almost 40, a mother, has a 20 year career and is known for her passion. However, it is a fact that she has distanced herself from her main fan base (the people in her age group who cheered her on when she sang \\"Just a Girl\\"). I fear her musical choices are in danger of hurting what she has with No Doubt. Let's take a look of some of her choices: <br /> <br /> <br />*Wind It Up is an embarrassment. This racket of noise is nothing more than a copycat of Rich Girl.  <br /> <br />* The Sweet Escape is one of the best songs on this cd and Akon's vocal makes this song more enjoyable.  <br /> <br />*Orange County Girl is simply bad, high school, and a blatant Hollaback Girl part 2.  <br /> <br />*Early Winter is one of the few shining moments on this cd. The song is beautiful with haunting lyrics. Credit goes to Keane. <br /> <br />*Now That Got It is not special because it sounds like Beyonce's Ring The Alarm who did it better. In fact, Swizz recycled the same police siren for this song. <br /> <br />*4 in the Morning have the potential to be a hit. Most of the credit belongs to Tony Kanal.  <br /> <br />*Yummy sounds like another Pharrell production. If you heard Kelis's Milkshake, then you really don't need to hear this song. Oh,and the lyrics are pretty lame too. <br /> <br />*Fluorescent is another Tony Kanal's production and is a tribute to 80s Madonna.  <br /> <br />*Breakin Up is not easy on the ears and Gwen spends most of the song repeating the same lyrics. <br /> <br />*Don't Get It Twisted is a ska-sounding song about Gwen's missing a cycle and calling her pregnancy the craziest *beep* ever.  <br /> <br />*You Started It is another song that pays tribute to Madonna's True Blue days and one of Pharrell most original production.  <br /> <br />*Wonderful Life is a leftover song from the LAMB session.  <br /> <br /> <br />Another thing that bugs me about this cd is Gwen's vocals. What happened to the emotions, the realness, and the power of her vocals? Even during the Rock Steady days, she were convincing with her singing. But now, it seems she is simply going through the motions. I suspect it's harder for her to go back to No Doubt due to her solo success and eventually may become the worst thing that ever happened to her. However, the mixed response to this album by the critics, her peers and worst, her fans may convince Gwen to step away from the `Alice in Wonderland' persona and become a real artist again. <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|I am a long-time U2 fan.  It was The Unforgettable Fire that made me a music lover and Joshua Tree that made me a U2 fanatic, so my comments have some perspective.  I like this album.  It may not be in their 5 best, but it's good.<br /><br />One thing that makes U2 great is how they evolve as a band.  They reinvent their sound seemingly with each album.  Often it is subtle, but still different and that's one thing that makes U2 great.  This album doesn't disappoint in that regard.  But what's interesting is that \\"Atomic Bomb\\", while unique in its own right, has occasional flashes to prior albums.  U2 fans will find that when they listen to this album, they'll hear songs that seem to belong on their other albums.  That's what made this one interesting to me.<br /><br />For instance, the angry beat and harsh guitar of \\"Love and Peace\\" and \\"All Because of You\\" could easily be a part of Rattle & Hum.  The flowing melody of \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and the romantic \\"One Step Closer\\" could be straight off of Joshua Tree.  The dancy hit \\"Vertigo\\" reminds me of Achtung Baby while the poetic \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it...\\" and \\"Original of the Species\\" contain the smooth pureness that refreshed fans on All That You Can't Leave Behind.  And then, there was the throwback to their early days with the musical prayer, \\"Yahweh\\".  Listening to this album is like taking a mini-journey through the band's career, and it's quite worth it.<br /><br />By far the best song is \\"Original of the Species\\".  It may not get the radio time, but like past unknowns \\"Acrobat\\", \\"Heartland\\" and \\"One Tree Hill\\" it's a great tune that only true U2 fans will be able to appreciate.  I recommend this album across the board and can't wait for the next one.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|As a juior high school student I spent hours and hours playing FFVII and loved it. In my opinion it is and will remain one of the greatest games of all time. This movie does a good job sticking to the storyline and the characters look better then they ever did on the PlayStation. The thing that drove me crazy was that there was very little focus on the characters outside of cloud and tifa. I also feel like they misrepresented the characters of Reno and Rude. The worst part though was the horrible dubbing. Maybe I was more upset because it didn't meet the high expectations I had, but if this had been my introduction to FFVII I would have never played the game.
B0000AQS6R|4.0|All too often, I have found the words \\"National Lampoon's\\" to be synonymous with \\"not funny,\\" but National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is actually a pretty entertaining film.  Christmas at the Griswold's turns out just like you would expect it to, with Clark (Chevy Chase) trying to persevere in the face of one disaster after another.  With the whole family coming over, he wants everything to be perfect - from the Christmas tree he finds and cuts down (er, digs up) himself to the thousands of lights he staples all over the house.  He's not completely stupid, though - he knows his parents and his wife's parents are going to argue throughout the holidays, that his wife and kids aren't all that excited about sharing Christmas with the rest of the family, and that Aunt Bethany couldn't get back in the loop even if she knew where to find it, but he's determined to make this the best Christmas ever.<br /><br />Of course, there are a few things Clarke wasn't counting on: countless problems getting all the decorations up and working, the unexpected arrival of cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his backwater brood in their junky RV, or the unwelcome visits of the aptly-named Snots the dog and a special Christmas squirrel.  Then, of course, there's the cat-related tragedy, the Christmas bonus bugaboo, and that whole police raid.<br /><br />The filmmakers brought together a really good cast for this film.  Beverly D'Angelo is Clarke's perfectly understanding wife, while Johnny Galecki and a young Juliette Lewis play the long-suffering Griswold kids.  The in-laws include Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall, while Randy Quaid is perfectly cast as crude cousin Eddie.  You even have Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a neighborly victim of all the Griswold Christmas cheer and yet another SNL alum, Brian Doyle-Murray, as Clarke's boss at work.  With John Hughes, who could almost do no wrong back in the 1980s providing the script, it makes for a pretty simple recipe for comedic success.<br /><br />This movie never managed to make me laugh out loud, but it is consistently amusing and entertaining.  It's not like you could pack any secret laughter bombs the audience would never see coming because the audience knows exactly what kind of slapstick humor to expect.  Still, it's the simple things, such as Aunt Bethany's blessing of Christmas dinner, that prove to be the funniest.  I might also add that the gross-out humor is kept to something of a minimum, thank goodness.  I won't be making this film a part of my annual Christmas tradition by any means, but it's certainly worth one viewing.r />This movie never managed to make me laugh out loud, but it is consistently amusing and entertaining.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|I remember when I first watched the Pilot on my flight back home.  It was a pleasant surprise, great television!  I'm always on the look out for a show that mixes a television show properly and \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" is that show!  It's great to be able to catch up on the episodes that I missed and see how this show is beginning to grow and develop into a classic.  All I can say is that I enjoy watching these episodes over and over.  The cast and writing is superb.  I eagerly anticipate each episode and can't get enough.
B00005JPDL|5.0|I saw this movie, not once, not twice, but THREE times. A little bit obsessive, I know, but for someone who enjoys romantic comedies as it is...this movie knocked it out of the park for me. I'm not usually a fan of Cameron Diaz's acting, but in this movie she was stunning as Amanda Woods (a wound-up, unable to cry Movie Trailer maker). Jude Law, I really did not expect this character out of him. Jude's character Graham was impossibly handsome and radiated so much charisma, there were a few scenes in the movie that truly made me melt (his smile alone is enough of an incentive to see the movie and well worth the ticket price). Kate Winslet (Iris) was remarkable, as I've always thought she was. Her character's dilemma really struck a chord with me, and I'm sure with everyone who has dealt with an unrequited love. And last but certainly not least, Jack Black's character Miles. I'll admit I did not want to see Mr.Black attempt a romantic comedy role when I first saw the previews for this movie, but after seeing him I very much respect him. I'm glad he went for this role, it shows how versatile of an actor he can be. Miles was a delightful character to watch and easily complimented Iris. I highly recommend seeing this movie before it goes out of theaters (I'm thinking I might have to see it ONE MORE TIME), and most definitely buy/rent it when it comes out on DVD!
1400032717|2.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is typical current book-club fare. The \\"novel\\" attempts to be clever and different, however, it is a light-weight approach that rests on a single concept alone - much like the other books \\"customers who also bought this book bought\\" do, such as \\"The Time-Traveler's Wife\\" and \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\".<br /><br />This particular story attempts to portray the mind of a 15-year old boy with Asperger's syndrome (a type of autism) amidst a canine murder mystery.  Ok, so the premise is interesting; however, the narrative quickly becomes too polished and \\"gimmicky\\" - polished in the sense that we soon become overly familiar and comfortable with the writing, and all the diagrams, lists, puzzles and other attempted corky interludes (such as an appendix with a complicated mathematical proof\\") soon just become tiresome gimmicks. It doesn't help that the main character is given most of the \\"stereotypical\\" autistic traits as often seen in movies such as Rainman.  The murder mystery is \\"solved\\" half-way trough in a rather predictable manner and is simply the catalyst for a family mystery involving the parents. Thrown in at the second part of the book is an adventure story involving a trip, a chase and some family friction before the neatly tied-up ending that includes family harmony and a fluffy puppy...aw[...]<br /><br />The only aspect I found mildly interesting were the conflicting notions of logic and superstition in the narrator's mind.  He quickly and matter-of-factly discards any religious ponderings and is quite comfortable with his logic-induced atheism; however, his illogical superstitions regarding everything from \\"bad\\" colors to predicting a day's outcome based on the procession of cars he sees from the schoolbus are indeed quite amusing. Simplistic - yes, but at least there is some sense of conflict that doesn't come across as utterly contrived.<br /><br />All in all, it is a quick read; however, the impact doesn't linger much longer after the book club discussion is over...<br /><br />PS: the narrative is littered with various factual-sounding tidbits to show the boy's extreme capacity to memorize trivia, but a bit of caution is in order - the author (or editor) should have made sure these facts are indeed correct...for instance, the Vikings did not roam about 2000 years ago!

055357342X|5.0|George R. R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series only gets better with each subsequent volume.  Martin has a flair for character development that surpasses all expectations.  After 3 volumes it is a delight to see real change in characters, especially when you assumed they were typical fantasy archetypes.  Not spoil the read, but readers of the series can expect profound changes in both characters and plot.  This is a book that will hook you and keep you reading \\"just one more chapter\\" no matter what time of night it is.  Martin is the Tolkien of the modern age (and actually more readable than Tolkien).  Anyone who loves fantasy should give this series a try.
B00005HYHA|4.0|Bought this cd with the hopes of superior sound quality. Equipment used...Belles 150 A Hot Rod amp, Conrad-Johnson PV-11 tube pre-amp, Escalante Design speakers, HSU sub woofer. Not that my system is so called high end at about 10k, but I think it is worthy of this review. I paid $200.00 for this version of Dark Side Of The Moon. Having a U.S. remaster and the Mobile Fidelity Gold remaster. Thought I would take the plunge and hope to get something higher in quality. Seldom am I disappointed with remasters. But this one does not do the trick at $200.00 Save your $ and buy the Mobile Fidelity Gold version for $40.00-$60.00. That is unless you have a high end system. Overall the sound is \\"slightly cleaner\\" with a little more depth in bass than the Mobile Fidelity version.
B000002U9W|1.0|I'm a fan of Floyd, but there's a reason the band hated Atom Heart Mother: it sucks. Pink Floyd was in an awkward transitional period between Syd's departure and the escellent Meddle, and this is a sign of just how awkward said transition was. The twenty-three minute, sidelong title track is a piece of crap, other than Gilmour's bluesy guitar. Sure, it pointed (like A Saucerful of Secrets' title song) towards future excellent extended works such as Shine on You Crazy Diamond or Echoes. But you're better off LISTENING to said extended pieces than this one. If comes next, and it's an underrated acoustic piece, certainly the best song here though it doesn't make the disc worth a buy. The record then stumbles with a couple of weak acoustic songs (Fat Old Sun; Summer '68) and closes on a very bad note: Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast. Unless you think the sound of breakfast being made and commented on is brilliant, of course. The cover, however, is awesome.

B000005RYQ|4.0|The thing about the Police is that they had great hit singles, but could never translate that into a truly great album - while Outlandos D'Amore; Regatta De Blanc and Ghost in the Machine are respectable efforts, they're far from masterpieces - same (only more so) with the uneven Zenyatta Mondatta and the unimpressive Synchronity. So a well-made compilation (such as this one) is a perfect buy for potential Police fans, and it may be all you need from the group. A couple album tracks are missing (Masoko Tango; Next to You; Regatta de Blanc; Bring on the Night; Canary in a Coalmine; When the World's Running You Down, You Make the Best of What's Still Around; Rehumanize Yourself; One World), and I'll admit I'm not a fan of Invisible Sun or Tea in the Sahara. But who can deny that Roxanne; Can't Stand Losing You; Message in a Bottle; The Bed's too Big Without You; Walking on the Moon; Don't Stand so Close to Me (in the original mix, no less!); De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da; Spirits in the Material World; Every Little Thing She Does is Magic (My favorite Police tune); Every Breath You Take; Synchronity II; King of Pain and Wrapped Around Your Finger are just classics and radio staples? Not me, that's for sure!
B0007TKNL0|2.0|The most important aspect of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is its vocals.  It is, after all, a show about singing, the most sublime singing in its time.  When a production lacks strong vocals, it has missed the point. <br /> <br />I don't understand how Andrew Lloyd Webber could give us such a life-changing stage musical and condone the frightful casting in this film.  The roles of the Phantom and Christine--played by Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum, respectively--were most the blatantly miscast.  And these are the most significant characters in the show. <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum's voice lacks the maturity and training her role demands.  Even for being seventeen years old, she is unimpressive as a singer--teenage voice students worldwide surpass her without contest.  That said, a teenager has no business singing Christine.  The role requires a level of technique, stamina, mobility, flexibility, consistency, and depth of musicality that only comes with maturity.  Yes, Christine is supposed to be young, and many Phantom movie-lovers listen to past soundtracks or see the stage show, and complain that Christine sounds \\"old\\" in these, because her voice is operatic.  Let me tell you this: most young singers who have studied for a significant amount of time sing just as operatically.  Why?  Because it's the healthiest way to sing, and has been considered the most pleasant to listen to for centuries, so it's perfectly believable that Christine would have a strong but light operatic voice. <br /> <br />Rossum dwarfs Gerard Butler in all their duets.  Butler sounds like the love-child of Satchmo and Kermit the Frog when he sings; my cords hurt just listening to all that throat-grinding.  He grunts his lines with no sensitivity, no phrasing or color...and we're supposed to believe he's the Angel of Music?  I want to hug whoever theorized that Rossum's voice is lacking because she had Butler as her teacher. <br /> <br />At least Rossum begins to redeem herself by looking the part.  Butler, however, could pass for a teenager himself.  Christine deserves no one's sympathy in abhorring such a hottie.  That's all the mask hides: a perfect guy with a sexy scar. <br /> <br />I'm guessing the underage casting, Rossum's underripe voice, Butler's good looks and \\"sexy\\" throat-grinding were all part of a design to snag teen and pre-teen viewers.  But what does the film's soundtrack teach them?  Healthy singing is stupid?  Designating the film's ONLY solidly classical/operatic voice to Carlotta--who properly overdoes it--seems to imply traditional, i.e. real opera is for buffoons. <br /> <br />I think I shudder in unison with other long-time fans of the musical to realize THIS is now the popular impression of \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\"  I've even had arguments with people who consider the show a \\"rock opera.\\"  Funny...many years ago, I had trouble convincing my friends it wasn't an opera!  I guess this is just a musical's fate: it has to shed some excellence in order to fit on the screen.   <br /> <br />If you've never seen or heard \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" I beg you to see it onstage or listen to an original cast album before cementing the movie in your head.  Between the Original London and Canadian recordings, you'll have a perfect idea of what \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" was REALLY supposed to be...until ALW decided to betray us.  Long live the original. <br />
0618680004|4.0|If you've read much Dawkins, (The Blind Watchmaker, The Selfish Gene, Climbing Mount Improbable, and others) it will come as no surprise to you that he is no fan of religion. What is new in The God Delusion is that the evolutionary biologist goes beyond rational disagreement with those who believe, and argues that religion is dangerous and should be opposed on nearly every front. He recognizes that religion has been an important force in art and literature, but gives it credit for little else in the realm of good.<br /><br />Dawkins makes no distinction between radical evangelical Christianity, the Taliban and Jihadist Muslims. The worldview of each is equally intolerant of any other belief, and so ultimately equally dangerous.<br /><br />Dawkins spends about half the book examining historical and philosophical arguments for the existence of God. In doing so, he takes apart the reasoning of many men, noble and ignoble, most of whom are dead. In a historical review such of this, arguing with the dead is unavoidable. Dawkins spends a bit too much time arguing with the more recently dead Stephen Jay Gould, a fellow evolutionary biologist and sometimes nemesis, than is strictly necessary.<br /><br />One thing that particularly rankles Dawkins is the concept of children being born into a religion. They grow up, typically, thinking that their parents' religion is the one true faith. How lucky for them. Dawkins seethes at calling a four-year-old a Catholic or Muslim child. We do not call them a Democrat or a Republican based on their parents' convictions. They are allowed to make that choice for themselves when they mature. Religion should be a matter of choice, not indoctrination, according to Dawkins. Of all his contentions in this particularly contentious book, this may be the least likely to gain traction.<br /><br />Because religion in its multitude of forms is so widely practiced, Dawkins assertions will seem radical. They will not, however, seem irrational. If you are a person of deep faith you will not find the book anything but discomfiting and probably blasphemous. If you are uncertain about religion, you will find it intellectually challenging. If you are agnostic or atheist, you may still feel a twinge of discomfort in Dawkins' bold views. He will test even your beliefs.are a person of deep faith you will not find the book anything but discomfiting and probably blasphemous.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Red Hot CHili Peppers are Red Hot! These last three CD's (Californication, By the Way, and Stadium Arcadium) are all amazing. The funk, the metal, and the pop music all combined to create a special type of genre the Red Hot Chili Peppers can call their own. The lyrics are beautifully mature, but still have that rap/funk feeling to them. Anthony Kelis is one heck of a poet and singer, and with John on guitar, and Flea ripping it up on bass, and with Chad on drums, they have created a masterpeice. Their music is so balanced and yet groovy. It is hard to fathom, it is a masterpiece. Much props to the most talented band ever.
B00005JOCU|5.0|<br />Jennifer Hudson essentially walks away with the film.  Her character is so central to the movie and her bravura performance only enhances what you feel about Effie.  All other acting is very good, albeit Eddie Murphy is a standout, but I can envision other actors in many of the roles.  Astounding choreography, direction and costuming.  This is a high enery film that will not let you down. <br /> <br />I plan to own it on DVD someday.
B00005JPE7|4.0|In 1976, an unknown and struggling actor named Sylvester Stallone wrote an underdog boxing fable and somehow convinced the powers that be to allow him to be cast in the starring role. The success of the film (modest box office hit, Oscar wins for Best Movie and Directing) garnered four sequels of varying quality before the franchise was put in hiatus for 17 years. But, now, at last, the 60-year-old Stallone, feeling his oats again and desiring one last hurrah, brings to a close the Rocky Balboa saga.<br /><br />SPOILERS and a few boxing trivia follow here: If you're any sort of boxing fan, then you know that the heavyweight class has been in steady decline for a number of years now; it's just been fairly recently that Wladimir Klitschko has been imposing his dominance over the sundry contenders/pretenders. ROCKY BALBOA borrows from the real-life lack of an undisputed, linear heavyweight champ and transposes it somewhat onto its movie premise. In the plot, undefeated and current heavyweight champion Mason \\"the Line\\" Dixon (real life light heavyweight pugilist Antonio Tarver) has been knocking out his opponents for a while now but, because of the lack of depth in his weight class and the absence of a fighter who could truly test him, he's considered to be a dubious champion by fans and boxing pundits. Even an ESPN computer simulation refuses to show him respect as it pits him versus a past champion in Rocky Balboa; to add insult to injury, the computer even has Balboa knocking out Dixon. Dixon's manager, who is well aware of his client's prevailing unpopularity, hits on the idea of putting on an exhibition match between Dixon (33 wins, 0 losses, 30 knockouts) and Rocky Balboa (57 wins, 22 losses, 28 knockouts). And, speaking of Rocky...<br /><br />With the loss of his wife and anchor, Adrian, to cancer, ex-prizefighter Rocky Balboa, now 58 years in age, has basically been just drifting. He spends much of his time missing Adrian and, every year, on the anniversary of her passing, he frequents their old hangouts, much to the distress and disgust of his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), who is as unpolitically correct and irascible as ever. Rocky owns and runs Adrian's, a nice, little Italian restaurant, and amuses the customers by regaling them with his fight experiences and accomodating them with photo ops. When Rocky catches a glimpse of the same virtual match on ESPN, his aged motor gets going; he begins to mull over the idea of re-entering the ring and fighting in small, local bouts. Somehow, against everyone's wishes (including and especially his overshadowed son, Robert), he's even granted a boxing license. Dixon's manager and promoter approach him with the offer to fight a 10-round exhibition bout (but with no protective gear) with the current champ; this  challenge proves to be too much for Rocky to resist as he still harbors a \\"beast\\" inside of him.<br /><br />The rest of the movie goes on to depict the by now expected montage of training sessions - including the traditional sprint up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art - and culminates in the highly anticipated match, where Rocky is considered a massive underdog. Even with the fans solidly behind him and chanting out his name, Rocky is hard pressed to beat a champion who's reigning and defending his crown in the prime of his life. In the end, as usual, it goes down to heart, as Mason Dixon finally finds the defining test he's been looking for and Rocky seeks to tame the savage beast within him one final time. I won't say who wins, but let me put it this way: Rocky exits on his own terms.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is, without a doubt, the quintessential underdog, and, obviously, is one of the most universally beloved cinematic creations of our time. The city of Philadelphia has taken the Rocky character on as one of its very own citizens. Rocky, for 30 years now, has simply resonated within the souls of the populace and it's easy to see why. The man isn't too bright, though he does have a certain street savvy and has become wiser over the years. He's innately lovable - a big palooka who works hard and is intrinsically true to himself. He's very rootable. In ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone returns his iconic character to his roots, the seamy neighborhoods of Philly peopled with blue-collared Joes. This film is predominantly a series of low key character-driven scenes, one after the other, punched up, every now and then, by Balboa's occasional impassioned speeches (you could see Sly straining for the Oscar), until the big, showy brawl at the end. We get to hear and ponder Rocky's gravelly, ineloquently vocalized homespun philosophies and realize that, while Rocky's no brain surgeon, he's smart enough to know what matters most in life, a nugget of wisdom he imparts to his unfulfilled and whiny son, as played annoyingly by the plastically smouldering Milo Ventimiglia (who also isn't exactly my most favorite character in HEROES), whose turnaround to his father's side happens too rapidly for my taste. Yes, the pace is deliberate and, at times, threatens to plod. A lot of the flashbacks shown in the first half hour will certainly test the patience of folks unaware of the Rocky history. I even found some of the old clips too much to take as I wanted the movie to advance already. But, in the end, Sly knew what he was doing as these quiet moments do serve to make Rocky's last time in the ring heartachingly more resonant.<br /><br />The other actors aren't shabby. Burt Young inhabits Paulie from such a deep, personal place that I really can't picture him in any other kind of role. Antonio Tarver (who, by the by, after this movie, went on to decisively lose his very next bout to the elderly, blown-up heavyweight Bernard Hopkins) is decent enough as Rocky's boxing foil, although the script doesn't really call for him to stretch as an actor. Geraldine Hughes takes over Jodi Letizia's role as Little Marie, who reappears after 30 years. Little Marie was the girl who told Rocky, \\"Screw you, creepo!\\" after he walked her safely home; this time, she has more of an integral role to play. Marie, apparently, didn't listen to Rocky's advise from way back and has become a single mom with very low self-esteem. We'll never know if a romance will develop between her and Rocky but we are assured of a blooming friendship between the two. Hughes' deft portrayal of the wounded Marie makes you wish good things to happen for her. Unfortunately, not much can be said of the actor who plays her son, Steps, as the audience never really gets a chance to know him.<br /><br />It was nice to see actual folks in the flick who are major players in the world of boxing. Credibility is lent with the appearances of ESPN's Brian Kenny (who's had his own verbal battles with Floyd Mayweather, Jr.), the HBO boxing commentary crew (Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, Max Kellerman), announcer Michael Buffer (\\"Let's get ready to rumble!\\"), ref Joe Cortez (who really does say \\"Remember, guys, I'm fair but I'm firm\\"), promoter Lou Dibella, and the cigar toting boxing historian Bert Sugar.<br /><br />Of course, this movie ain't perfect. The plot tends to drag at times, not enough time is spent working on Mason Dixon's character (although his relationship with his former trainer proves to be surprisingly touching), and I find it vexing that not one mention is made about the brain damage Rocky incurred in ROCKY V.<br /><br />So is ROCKY BALBOA as good as the first ROCKY? No, not by a mile. But, while it doesn't live up to my high expectations, it certainly contains enough graceful moments which affected me at a deep enough gut level that I can honestly recommend it. Needless to say, this movie is best experienced in a rambunctiously crowded theater with folks who are all in the know about the Rocky films. I guarantee you ROCKY BALBOA'll serve up a nice, warm slug of nostalgia. Like I said, the movie's pace is leisurely so take the time to savor the scenes asthere won't be any more after this. ROCKY BALBOA is a fitting capper to what has been an iconic film series. By the way, in an interview on a radio sports show, Stallone made mention that he would like another crack at John Rambo with the intention of making the next movie more character driven as well, as opposed to the last two action oriented sequels. If he can revive Rambo as well as he did ROCKY BALBOA, then count me in.was the girl who told Rocky, \\"Screw you, creepo!\\" after he walked her safely home; this time, she has more of an integral role to play.

1582701709|5.0|I enjoyed the DVD, and, in fact, purchased a copy for my own library.  However, I give higher marks to the book.  Here's why.<br /><br />The book, by virtue of relying only on words, can and does go into greater depth on how to use the secret.  The DVD, constrained by time, takes a more superficial look at the \\"how-tos.\\"<br /><br />The book, not being a multi-media product, is 1) clearer, more on-message and 2) less distracting than a video.  It allows the reader to pace the information for themselves rather than being carried through the information as happens in the video  And taking in these ideas at your own pace, stopping to reflect on the ideas whenever appropriate, is an excellent method of incorporating the content into your own life.<br /><br />That said, some folk simply prefer videos over books.  For them, the DVD may be the better choice.  Those who are looking for more in-depth information may prefer the book.<br /><br />Then again, why choose one or the other?  Get both the book and the DVD.  If you're looking to kick-start changes in your life, neither will disappoint.
B000H0MKGK|3.0|This cd is easy on the ears and mind with some interesting lyrics and guitar chops . I'm gonna listen to it again right now. I like what the boy is up to.
B000JU7NCE|3.0|The \\"Festival 2005\\" DVD is a live compilation of performances taken from their string of performances before huge European crowds that Summer.  The shows are the first recorded glimpse of their current lineup, which features the return of Porl Thompson on guitar but also the departure of multi-instrumentalist Perry Bamonte and keyboardist Roger O'Donnell.  The resulting DVD is sadly limited by both this pared-down lineup and also the frighteningly bad videography/editing.  Still worthwhile for Cure completists, it will nonetheless leave both them and more casual fans frustrated by poor presentation.   <br /> <br />PERFORMANCE - 3.5 stars <br /> <br />Despite an ever-changing lineup, The Cure has always been one of the most cohesive live acts in popular music.  Their shows faithfully recreate their studio material, displaying the members' prowess with instruments while also leaving the bulk of the energy and interpretation to Smith's unmistakable voice.   <br /> <br />However, this decision to scrap all keyboards from the live act is a blatant mistake.  Smith's aim is clearly to project a more muscular tone onto familiar material and in some cases it works well (\\"The Kiss\\", \\"alt.end\\", \\"Shiver and Shake\\").  But in reality, those tracks were the ones that never had much keyboard anyway.  The unfortunate tracks that rely on keyboards are dreadfully incomplete.  \\"Just Like Heaven\\" sounds like a bad cover of itself.  \\"Fascination Street\\" and \\"A Forest\\" are missing critical melodies.  But worst of all, the majestic lead melody of \\"Plainsong\\" performed on guitar makes it sound like a parody of the instrumental closing theme to \\"Top Gun\\".  The lack of keyboards truly ruins a number of these tracks to the ear of any longtime fan.   <br /> <br />Smith's vocals sound as good as ever, although by the time he reaches the tracks at the end of the nightly setlists, he seems genuinely fatigued.  For instance, the first half of \\"End\\" is basically mumbled rather than sang.  The reintroduction of Thompson's guitar style is a big plus - as always, he mixes walls of fuzzed-out feedback with nimble virtuosity (the solo for \\"The Blood\\" is a highlight for him).  I've never been a fan of Jason Cooper's hyperactive style of \\"the more drum fills, the better\\", but he is finally settling into a decent impression of Boris Williams' rhythms.  Simon Gallup continues to be one of the most rock-solid bass players to ever grace the stage;  also, he particularly seems at home with the more aggressive, minimalist lineup.   <br /> <br />VIDEO - 1 star <br /> <br />Remember how bad the \\"Mixed Up?!?\\" album was?  Well, this DVD is to your eyes what that remix collection was to your ears.  And by the closing credits, it's apparent why:  both are Robert Smith vanity projects.  In a classic example of overstepping one's capabilities, Smith co-directed and -edited the piece, and the result is utterly maddening.   <br /> <br />From the first track, you notice that in some shots the colors are so grossly oversaturated that it degrades the picture quality to roughly that of a VHS tape.  Every other amateurish video trick gets thrown in as well:  posterization, chroma keying, digital black-and-white, etc.  But the most infuriating of all is the use of motion trails - think of how really bad movies depict \\"drunk vision\\".  Ugh.  All of this overblown video trickery might still be cool for the midnight showing of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", but here, it's wholly unnecessary.   <br /> <br />The camerawork is also spotty.  First, there is too much reliance on two static angles.  First, a wide shot of the entire stage taken from a good distance back into the crowd.  Second, an overhead shot from the behind the drum kit looking down on the band and into the crowd - this one has all of the visual allure of a convenience store security camera.  The manual cameras also try too many cheesy tricks which distract from the power of the performance.  There's enough emotional punch in the opening lines of \\"The Kiss\\" that it wasn't necessary to choose a shot where the camera jerks and spins in faux mosh-pit fury.   <br /> <br />AUDIO - 3 stars <br /> <br />The disc offers both a 5.1 and a DTS mix.  Both sound very good, with fine separation.  The DTS mix could be regarded as unnecessary since so much of the music is bathed in distortion, reverb and/or feedback.   <br /> <br />EXTRAS - 1 star <br /> <br />Simply put, there are none.   <br /> <br />CONCLUSION <br /> <br />For the price, the \\"Festival\\" DVD does deliver a lot of solid Cure content.  The consolidated setlist is nearly perfect - by the time the encores wrap, even the most jaded longtime fan will be pleased.  Unfortunately, the videography is so engrossed in its own cheap trickery that it becomes a continual distraction from the performance.  Also, the current synth-free lineup shows its limitations on many of the staple tracks.  Ultimately, it just made me wonder why neither of their prior live videos, \\"The Cure in Orange\\" (their definitive live show) or \\"Show/Paris\\", have been put on DVD yet.
0800177177|5.0|Dracula is an unmistakable metaphor for the conflicting good and evil character that resides in humanity.  The primary characters each demonstrate the ability to love, hate, lust, betray, kill, nuture, conspire and exhibit other contradictory behaviors. Each elicited feelings of compassion and revulsion in varying degrees.<br />  The casting, for the most part, was excellent and it was easy to suspend disbelief.  Lucy is the quintessential spoiled, frivolous rich girl; Mina, the devoted friend - strong, courageous and elegant. Gary Oldham was chillingly superb, and as usual transformed profoundly into each persona of the character he portrayed.  Bravo! to St. Anthony Hopkins' dynamic portrayal of VonHelsing, who undisputedly stole the show with his vitality.  He played the role with colossal flair, verve, &eacute;lan and shameless magnetism. Something positive could be said about most of the characters, except Keanu Reeves. His performance was stiff. His character was colorless and he stumbled through the part. The most memorable thing about his character was the transformation of his hair color after escaping from Dracula's castle.  Loved the movie and watch it again and again (ranks with my childhood favorite, Wizard of Oz).
B000060OFT|1.0|Don't waste your money on this DVD. The cars, the guns, the music, and noise take away from the original story. If they wanted to update the story it would have been better to update the language as well. My students and I much prefer the \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" DVD with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. I will not make the mistake of showing this particular DVD to my students again.
0451191153|3.0|A syrupy, unemotional but linear and sophomoric melodrama that parallels Ayn Rand's life (She once wrote scripts for 40s styled melodramas and was married to an architect). It highlights and punctuates one of her most sacred themes: that self-sacrifice ultimately is an anti-human impulse because it requires sacrifice of the only thing that makes us human, our integrity. Told through the life of Architect Howard Roak, who struggles to maintain his architectural integrity in the face of powerful and concerted societal attempts to corrupt and dilute it (for the benefit of society at large), the Fountainhead is Rand's most graphic defense of her philosophy of Objectivism.<br /><br />Roak's soliloquy at the trial in which he was charged for the bombing of a building that deviated from his explicit architectural specifications, is as good a summary of Rand's philosophy likely to be found in her fictional work. In its essential outline, the soliloquy reminds the jury that: Men of vision live for themselves, not for society. Truth is their only motive. Their brains are their only instruments for survival. Man the creator, the visionary, deals with ideas not with other men.<br /><br />I gave the book three stars because, even though it lacks any semblance of artistic merit, it is a clear, unambiguous statement of Rand's theory of society, and however flat, the story was still interesting.
B00006IU73|5.0|I had to chuckle upon reading a couple of the reviews that criticized this CD for not being \\"progressive\\" enough. To me, progressive rock/metal isn't so much about arsty time changes and signatures but about pure musicianship. Porcupine Tree is all of that. And In Absentia, while technically their hardest rocking work, is more than superb. It is their greatest work. If you're looking to possibly add P.T. to your music library, and enjoy artists that demonstrate their mastery of the craft, start with this CD. It will not disappoint.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|There is no amount of praise I can write here to effectively honor this great film. The cast, the script, the direction, and THE ACTING are transcendent. I must have watched Streetcar a dozen times, before I noticed Tennessee Williams' almost invisibly crafted moment of Blanche's triumph. Streetcar puzzled me for years, because I couldn't understand why  Williams would let the Stanley's of this world claim such a brutal victory. Then one day, I was watching for the millionth time and I saw IT! Stanley's defeat and Blanche's (and by extension the pregnant Stella's) salvation. An American Masterpiece.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|The movie is slower paced than an American movie, that is, it moves at a real life pace. <br /> <br />The dialog is in several languages, and the English subtitles are adequate. However I think that the only movie I know of that has excellent English sub titles is \\"Jesus Of Montreal\\", which is quite a different kind of movie. <br /> <br />On the first day of class the professor announces that the class will be conducted in Catalan. The foreign students are shocked as they had been expecting Spanish. When a female student questions this announcement the professor answers they they are in Catalonia and they will use the Catalan language: \\"If you want Spanish you should go to Madrid or Argentina\\". This reminded me of some of the snotty professors I had to deal with in College. <br /> <br />The movie has the comfortable feel of real life situations. It has joy, sadness, and frustrations of everyday student life <br /> <br />
B000001ESP|5.0|This very well may be the best rock album of all time.
B00005JPCA|5.0|At first I was skeptical about Daniel Craig being the new Bond, but after seeing \\"Casino Royale\\", I was wrong. \\"Royale\\" starts off with a heart-pounding chase scene (that could only be in a Bond movie), includes non-stop action, witty dialogue, and, oddly, a different side of Bond. Since this traces the beginning of Bond, we see a vulnerable side of Bond; he makes mistakes, but the best part about this movie is that Craig combines the ruggedness of Connery and the charisma of Brosnan. Definitely one of the top Bond movies. A classic that would even make Sean proud.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|I must say that I could not disagree more with other reviews I'm a huge Miami Vice fan and I went and saw this movie in the theaters and I think that the people who were disappointed in the Movie at the theaters will be happy with the directors cut. I could not believe it when I saw the DVD version. The movie was so much better the additional scenes and of course being able to pay better attention to the movie then you can in the theaters you can really see the small things that can be missed by only watching the movie once. I could not believe how much attention Michael Mann gave to things like when they shoot the 50cal. Sniper rifles how realistic it actually was. If you buy he DVD then you can see how this movie was made and why there is such realism in the movie. If you are a big Miami Vice fan and were let down by the theatrical version buy the Miami Vice UNRATED Directors Cut and watch it I promise you will not be let down by this version of the movie
B00003CXDB|4.0|Good actors and directing. Stone as usual throws in his idealogical slant and has Martin Sheen in the cast to give us the solid socialist perspective. But I think Gordon Gekko though flawed (obviously since he was created by Stone), delivers the right message that without capitalism and the pursuit of profits we as a society would be stagnant and doomed. Sorry Oliver your Friend Castro got it all wrong. From an artistic point of view a good solid movie.
0812550757|1.0|This book was terrible.  I really enjoyed Ender's Game, and have read most of the Foundation series, all of the Hyperion books (which were great), and love to find good science fiction books.  I am not a science fiction expert, but do enjoy good stories.  This was not in that category, I plowed through it- but finally gave up with 50 pages to go.  Don't waste your time.
0393035158|3.0|The author does a great job in pointing out how religous dogmas and belief in eternal life 9after death), are responsible for much of the violence perpetrated throughout history and today. He is especially critical of Islam (with good reason), but when it comes to the Middle East turmoil he almost completely ignores the 800 pound religous gorilla. The formation of the state of Israel by the UN with the assistance and guidance of both Britatin and the US. The reason Palestine was chosen was because the bible said tha god had promised this land to the Jews. The irony is that those that worked the hardest for a Jewish homeland the Zionist (Moshe Dayan, Chaim Weitzman etc), were not religous. Regardless Israel and all the the instability its creation has brought to the region are the result of religous beliefs. The author barely glosses over this perhaps he feared being labeled anti-semetic (though his strong criticism of arab societies could have won him that label undeservedly so). There also at pints seem to be a tinge of neo-conservatism as the author tries to justify the invasion of iraq by Bush as well as the bombing od sudanese pharmacuetical plant by Clinton without questioning Bush's dubious reasoning and deceptive PR campaign, or the timing of the Sudanese bombings (same day as big news on Monica Lewensky was breaking). The book does make some very good points unfortunately in some regards the author attemots to justify some actions by Presidents of the United States that are questionable at best and glosses over extremely important features of the negative effects of religion on world affairs.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I caught this Irish band's performance on PBS a couple of years ago. What immediately struck me about the singers was how pure and clear their voices were. I was hooked within 20 minutes of listening to them. Their performance was even better in person when they recently visited Boston. My favorite songs are \\"May It Be\\" (this was played in the soundtrack of the Lord of the Rings movies) and \\"Harry's Game\\" (an all-time favorite actually). \\"Butterfly\\" is very playful and lively. I can't put a finger on \\"Ave Maria\\" though. It seems both lazy and melancholic. If you like songs with clean lines, where the music does not overwhelm the singer's voice, you will greatly enjoy Celtic Woman.
B000G0O5N2|4.0|I wanted to give the DVD movie three stars, but maybe I don't understand the technology that well.  I have a 56 inch Samsung DLP HDTV with 1080P; I hooked up my PS3 with an HDMI cable and just bought this Blue Ray DVD movie.  The bright colors are absolutely amazing but the dark colors have more \\"grain\\" than my average DVD's when I play them.  With the money I've spent the performance should be spotless, but that's completely not the case.  Am I all alone or maybe something is hooked up incorrectly?   I cannot get the movie to fill the whole TV as well, so top and bottom are cut off, which I believe is normal - not sure. <br /> <br />Sorry, don't mean to ruin the five star performances, but very frustrated with the dark grain colors.  It's very noticeable and was shaking my head the whole time. <br />
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I have a new CD obsession.  I saw a promotion for Decemberunderground while watching South Park.  I was impressed by the music clip.  I think it was \\"Miss Murder.\\"  It had a 1980s sound which is my favorite musical era and I recently have become interested in new bands who demonstrate 1980s influences.  Well, now that I have this CD, it has been living in my computer-side CD player and car stereo.  It has an interesting sound with surprisingly complex choruses.  Vocalist Davey Havok is incredible and the musicianship is superb.  This album is an experience, like traveling through the snow in the places pictured in the booklet, but not on jet skis but, rather an old-fashioned horse and carriage--that flies! <br /> <br />\\"Prelude 12/21\\":  I didn't plan it this way, but I'm writing this review on 12/21.  This track is a perfect opener.  It is dainty and soft at the beginning, then rises with pounding drums and ends with a powerful crescendo.  It prepares the listener for what's to come. <br />\\"Kill Caustic\\":  The heaviest track here!  Not for the fainthearted.  The lyrics can describe it better than I can: \\"So now you'll love these screams, what's left of me.\\"  \\"I was the one to ride that dirty ride that is turning so fast now I cannot hold on but, at this pace, who would want to.\\"  I, for one! <br />\\"Miss Murder\\":  Now for something much more accessible.  Catchy, upbeat track.  I like how the chorus is actually one sentence sang in three verses. <br />\\"Summer Shudder\\":  I love this track!  The chorus is awesome!  Rocks with addictive hooks! <br />\\"The Interview\\":  Slow and beautiful.  The chorus perks things up a bit but it is still very restrained.  The guitar that comes in during the chorus is amazing.  Pious organ closes this work of art. <br />\\"Love Like Winter\\": The best part is the chorus.  The backing vocals kick in and it is quite powerful. <br /> <br />\\"Affliction\\":  Now we're rocking!  A screaming, heavy track like \\"Kill Caustic.\\"  The guitar and bass fly!The chorus is actually tame and accessible but Davey Havok builds it up to some screams to keep the intensity high.  The bridge is great!  When they sing, \\"So stay sweetly numb.  Maintain lifeless love,\\" Wow!   <br />\\"The Missing Frame\\":  A soft, instrumental interlude follows the preceding track.  This track rocks but is not heavy.  It is upbeat and accessible. <br />\\"Kiss and Control\\":  Intense screams with a softer side.  I guess the title matches the feel of this song: \\"City lights, like rain, dance and explode.\\" <br />\\"The Killing Lights\\": The best part is the killer (but all too brief) guitar solo.  Awesome! <br />\\"37mm\\":  Rock song with a powerful beauty.  One of my favorites.  Soft verses, catchy chorus, piano bridge--Everything is wonderful. <br />\\"Endlessly, She Said\\":  Appropriate song to end the album:  \\"I will wait for you,\\" she said, \\"endlessly.\\"

B0000541AM|5.0|I won't waste your time going into details about this movie since you should be filling in your online purchase information instead - still reading?  Stop and go to \\"BUY NOW\\".<br /><br />Okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy guess you need some convincing.<br /><br />This classic movie set against the background of the Bronx, NYC and Brooklyn is a cult classic for a reason, it is great.  Many discuss the allusion to Homer's Odyssey but frankly I could care less, it's just great fun.  I strongly recommend that you buy it before MTV screws it up with a remake (in the works but hotly protested by fans).<br /><br />Just a suggestion but you might want to research some Easter Eggs on this one - there are some interesting things which I will NOT be revealing here.<br /><br />On a final note, if you've read the book by Sol Yurick you will see that the movie bears little resemblance.
B00005V9HA|3.0|..this movie is no classic..pretty gruesome at times..acting, decent...it honestly deserves the title of a 1980's frankenstein meets evil dead at best....dont blow your money on it..if its a fair price, by all means..but dont be dooped into thinking its a rare-out of print classic....peace to you.-
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I read the review posted on April 30th as well as others on this site , so I bought the CD to hear for myself. After listening I failed to hear any Rap(no idea what CD the reviewer on April 30th was listening to)  and as far the the Vocals are concerned I found them to be excellent. Also felt they were better than the vocals on  Bat 2. The CD as a whole is very very good and it seems that some of the reviews posted here on this site are terrorist reviews, written only to be  vindictive and negative,  for some unknown personal reasons and really have nothing to do with the quality of this CD.  Some of These negitive review are totality unjustified.  This CD should be rated 4 and 1/2 stars and should be listened to. There are many many great moments and surprises for the people who buy this CD . I for one would love to see Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman  work together again but until then Bat Out Of Hell III works just fine.
B000GPI15K|5.0|Who would have guessed that Patricia Barber would be the newest entrant in the art song world? She's written in the great tradition of the 19thC and early 20thC classical composers (Schubert, Berg, Randall Thompson, etc.) but in a jazz genre that really makes sense for the material. Thanks for some really great music.

B0000025HU|1.0|This album is a critics' darling, and perhaps the most overrated album of the rock era. It would have made a decent single album, but as a double, it's like sitting through a bad movie. Part of the problem is that the first Clash album truly is one of the greatest rock albums of all time. Even \\"Give 'Em Enough Rope,\\" which often gets bad reviews, is a great record. By the time LC came out, the Clash were billing themselves as \\"the only band that matters,\\" and critics were accepting it as fact. This albums makes it sound as if the Clash were buying a little too heavily into it, too. It is a major dropoff from their earlier work and even when viewed on its own, LC is an uneven, uninspired effort. While it's often named as one of the top albums of all time, it wasn't even one of the best albums released at its time.   <br />This was the really the first chink in the armor of the Clash, and they continued losing steam as they went on.     <br />Songs like \\"Koka Kola,\\" \\"Four Horsemen,\\" \\"Death or Glory,\\" and \\"Right Profile\\" are so tedious that you have to wonder if the Clash believed they could do no wrong. I can't listen to them anymore. The title cut, \\"Spanish Bombs,\\" \\"Revolution Rock,\\" and a few others are superb. Some are just filler. The rest are definitely not 5-star songs.  <br />This would have been about a 4-star album had it been a single album. As it is, the only reason I can see that it got such rave reviews is that the critics were trying to make up for having overlooked the Clash when they were truly great.  <br />Buy the first two Clash albums instead, borrow this one from a friend and burn the good cuts. You'll be able to pick them out easily enough.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|Amon Amarth is one of the last bands out that I still get excited about when a new release is coming out. With Oden on Our Side does not disapoint me at all. Every song is solid. The vocals are mixed perfectly so they are not too loud and out front. The drums and guitar sound amazing. Thank You Metal Blade for signing this great band and funding them with enough cash so they can put out such an amazing sounding CD. I still have not seen Amoth Amarth live but I will try and see them if they come through NYC. Great Work Guy's. Keep it up! Hail Odin!
B000056KAY|4.0|Although it was before my time, as a big music fan I took the opportunity to pick this film up when I saw it on sale. I can see why they tried to re-create the feeling  of these times by staging woodstock 94 and 99, unfortunate that 99 ruined a great thing.  If you like music from that era, this film is a definite must have. The who, Hendrix, Joe Cocker to name a few, but many other as well. Interesting look into Flower power. I don't nessesarily agree with everything in the movie, but this is an important American Documentary.  Something for any Music person to watch at least once in their life.
B000002KDS|5.0|I bought this record when I was thirteen, I think, and just about wore it out.  Then I got older and grew embarrassed and put it away somewhere.  But I was just reading an article about Lou Reed doing songs from his \\"Berlin\\" album live, and the connection with Reed and Bob Ezrin, and that got me nostalgic, so I ordered up a CD of \\"Killer.\\"  Anyway, it holds up.  The crossover with Lou Reed is direct on \\"Be My Lover,\\" which is pretty much \\"Sweet Jane\\" with a singalong chorus added.  \\"Killer\\" is full of highly-arranged, theatrical rock (horn parts, string arrangements), but with plenty of grit and humor, too.  Ok, maybe it's a little over the top in places, but this was honestly a good band, and who doesn't like to play dress-up and celebrate Halloween once a year?  \\"Halo of Flies\\" is wonderful -- it has an overture!  Buying this has taught me not to be so skeptical about the music I loved as a kid.  Now I may have to look into some early Sabbath. . .
6300273199|5.0|This is an important video in the AC/DC fan's library being one of the last thing Bon Scott had a chance to do with the band before his unfortunate early end.  Let there be rock is recorded while the band was on a tour stop in Paris on their Highway to hell tour.  13 song total on the video including Highway to hell, shot down in flames, live wire, and let there be rock. This also includes great behind the scenes footage of the band in the hotel and on the road.  Bon Scott at his pinnicle on vocals, and Angus, that little man has more energy than an H-bomb.  Must have for AC/DC fans, likely someday to come out on DVD.  Check it out if you can. Also noted by another reviewer, Check out Bon Scott's Big Drink in the interviews, you can see they pieced the footage together because the tumbler's level of liquid is goes up and down throughout the movie but in no order....unless they kept refilling it and he'd drink it quickly..which is also plausable.  That's living like a Rock Star.  Entertainment at its best.
B00005JOLI|3.0|-- just not very deep. So let's start with the parts that work. The computer graphics are beautiful, as we've come to expect. The adventure story is classic: the evil tyrant, the secret cabal of rebels just waiting to strike for freedom, the young hero-to-be, unknown even to himself. Dragons are cool, especially when they're done as well as they are here. The castworks pretty well, too, with Jeremy Irons as the mysterious mentor and Sienna Guillory as the magical princess in need of rescue. Her slight resemblance to Tilda Swinton is a minor but enjoyable benefit to the role.<br /><br />The story, written by a 15 year old prodigy, has plenty of excitement - but that's about it. Characters tend toward the one-dimensional, and a few strands in the story seem not so tightly wound with the others. Set your expectations accordingly. The \\"Eragon\\" movie is big and beautiful, it's exciting and kid-safe, and that's enough.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002H2H|5.0|Anyone thinking that the initial segment of \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" might signal that Metallica might be tamer in their previous album, \\"Kill'em All\\", would be in for a surprise. <br />Ride the Lightning's first track might be the fastest and heaviest one on this album, but all of its songs are powerful enough to award it the status of a metal masterpiece. <br /> <br />It's almost unnecessary to talk about classics and set-list staples such as \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", \\"Fade to Black\\" and \\"Creeping Death.\\" And the same goes for Metallica's lyrics, whose content is infinitely superior to anything ever written by a heavy metal band. They've never simply wanted to make us get thrilled by their sound, they've also wanted us to think and reflect on significant personal and political issues. <br /> <br />And die-hard Metallica fans familiar with the late Cliff Burton's eardrum-ripping bass solo at the beginning of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" on the DVD \\"Cliff'em All\\" can only be too delighted in hearing some of those notes in a bass solo on the instrumental track \\"The Call of Ktulu\\". <br /> <br />\\"Ride the Lightning\\" might have been released almost 23 years ago, but its  music is ageless and will always be a must-have for true metalheads all over the world.

B00005OCMR|5.0|Flynn is a programmer, and runs an arcade. He should be a rich games developer, but a man at his old company, Dillenger, stole all his programming and sold the rights himself. Since then, Flynn's been trying to hack into Dillenger's system, to prove that he wrote the games. Dillenger's also written over an old chess program, turning it into a security system that can think for itself and absorb other programs into itself, growing smarter. While hacking after hours for a friend down at his old company, the system catches Flynn and transforms him into data, sending him into the computer. Inside the computer, there is a society, with programs as people, graphics as landscapes, sprites as vehicles and  games are duels to the death. Will Flynn make it out? <br /> <br />It's a special film, Tron. The way it was animated, the design and the \\"landscapes\\". Jeff Bridges handles himself pretty well as Flynn, too. Special features on the second disc of this edition include a whole series of documentaries and animation demos, which were interesting context, I thought. <br /> <br />Recommended for fans of unique animation.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine is about a highly dysfunctional family that travels by VW bus from New Mexico to California so that their daughter Olive can compete in the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" beauty pageant. Olive's dream is to become a beauty queen and the opening scene shows her watching a beauty pageant and imitating the winner. Her grandfather has been helping her to rehearse her talent routine and she practices daily. They can't afford to fly to California, and due to circumstances, they all must go together in the VW bus to California.<br /><br />The father, Richard (played by Greg Kinnear) is the inventor of a \\"9 Step Program\\" on being a \\"winner\\" and his opinions on avoiding loserdom are quite funny. He is suave, tanned, and styled out like a typical \\"motivational speaker\\".<br /><br />Dwayne (the brother) doesn't speak (by choice) and reads philosophy. He hates everyone. He hasn't spoken in 9 months. He wants to be a pilot, and his mother bribes him to go on the trip by promising to allow him to go to flight school.<br /><br />Sheryl, the mother, is a divorcee - Olive and Dwayne are not Richards children. She appears to be the glue that holds everyone together.<br /><br />The Grandpa is hysterical. He has many vices all of which add a lot of humor to the picture. He is Olive's \\"coach\\" for her beauty pageant.<br /><br />Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell) is there as well - after a failed suicide attempt he must live with Sheryl and her family, and can't be left alone, so he's also along for the ride.<br /><br />Okay, so mix all these people up with their problems, and the movie is an absolute trip. Many things happen along the way that could be construed as negative - but overall, the movie, to me, had a positive vibe. You see, Olive is not a beauty queen. She is a plain girl, with a bit of a belly and big bucked teeth. In reality she has no chance in a beauty pageant - but her family, even with all of their problems never tells Olive that she can't do it.<br /><br />In reality most families under stress (to put it lightly...) would simply skip the 800-mile, 2-day trek that they can't really afford, and simply tell their child, \\"Sorry honey, you really don't have a chance at winning and we can't afford it, so you don't get to be in the beauty pageant\\".<br /><br />Not this family. They stand behind Olive in pursuing her dream (win or lose) with confidence, and to me, that was very uplifting and positive.<br /><br />Overall I thought Little Miss Sunshine was supremely funny and very well made.it. <br /> <br />In reality most families under stress (to put it lightly...) would simply skip the 800-mile, 2-day trek that they can't really afford, and simply tell their child, \\"Sorry honey, you really don't have a chance at winning and we can't afford it, so you don't get to be in the beauty pageant\\". <br /> <br />Not this family.

B00005JPAD|4.0|The Departed is the kind of movie you have to pay attention to at all times. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though - you feel sort of like you have been through something after this movie ends. I suppose you could watch it and not pay as much attention - you'd probably still enjoy it.<br /><br />The movie is basically about rats and organized crime in Boston - There's a mob guy working inside the police and there's a undercover officer working inside the mob. So each side is working to find out just who the rat really is.<br /><br />The movie has an all star cast - Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Walhberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin to name a few. They all play their parts exceptionally well. Mark Wahlberg's character is not only serious, but also funny, in that serious kind of way.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Count me as one of those who came to the party late.  I don't even remember Firefly being advertised when it was on the air (which might be part of the reason it was canceled) so I knew nothing about it until the movie Serenity came out. I only found out about the TV show after reading some reviews of the movie by bloggers who attended an advanced screening.  They all gave Serenity positive reviews but it wasn't enough to get me to the theater to see it and I only finally got around to renting it a couple of weeks ago.  <br /> <br />Let's just say that I liked the movie so much I went out and bought the entire Firefly collection the next day and by the third episode I was completely hooked on the show and the characters. The Firefly universe contains all of the fun, humor, and adventure that had been mostly drained out of the Star Wars universe by the prequels. As one reviewer put it, Firefly is what Star Wars would have been if Han Solo had been the main character and he still shot Greedo first.  This show is so good that you may regret purchasing this DVD set only because of the bittersweet feeling of knowing that each wonderful episode you watch is bringing you one episode closer to the end of the series.  I only hope that somehow, somewhere the show will be revived.
B00000JRTX|2.0|The truth be told, I am not a real fan of Hugh Grant.  His mumbling style, the constant running of his hands through his hair, and his \\"blank look\\" look are his trademarks, and they are unique in only one movie.  After that, they are old, old, old.<br /><br />Then there is the plot of Four Weddings and a Funeral.  Hugh Grant's character, along with all of his friends, have no life other than bumbling along at weddings and funerals.  It seems that Grant's \\"profession\\" is trying to have a constant stream of sleeping partners.<br /><br />I enjoyed the scenes in England.  I think the actors were being paid by the number of times they flashed their teeth while smiling.<br /><br />All the characters were shallow, shallow, shallow.  And... well, the scenery was nice.<br /><br />Four Weddings and a Funeral is clearly in need of another funeral... itself.
B000J10EQU|3.0|Even though the story isn't horrible and Brandon Routh's Chrisopher Reeve impersonation isn't too far off the mark, I found this movie too weak to be part of the permanent Superman Genre.  You know, the way the Peter Sellers \\"Casino Royale\\" isn't really a Bond Film.  Of course, I didn't like Superman III with Reeve and never bothered to see Superman IV.<br /><br />What is good about the film?  Well, it has the comic book silliness.  You know, the space shuttle launching from the back of a 747 because it would get more of a boost from them than two solid rocket boosters, and the familiar engines of the shuttle fire powerfully without any observable place for the fuel.  Almost every scene is full of the same kind of nonsense, but it is this daffy disregard for reality is part and parcel of comic books.  I also liked the fact that Superman more or less levitates in this film rather than \\"flying\\" like a jet.  Since he has no \\"thrusters\\", levitating makes more sense.<br /><br />I hated what they did to his outfit.  The cape and boots are too dark and the \\"S\\" signature on his chest is too small and too high.  However, since they were turning the \\"Man of Steel\\" into some kind of metrosexual, using the \\"S\\" as a bodice rather than a shield or breastplate might make some sort of perverse sense.<br /><br />And the inversion of sexual mores is complete in this film with Lois Lane becoming a single mom, the details of which you will have to learn for yourself by seeing the film.  However, if such a plot point had been used in the original superman, well, one would not have required super hearing to notice the instantaneous outcry from the public.<br /><br />My advice is to treat this film the way the middle \\"Highlander\\" films were treated when they decided to get back to the original.  Just ignore it and pretend it never happened and get back to the \\"real\\" Superman in the next film.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey played Lex Luthor pretty straight, as a sort of emotionally void killer.  He is smart and an egomaniac, but doesn't have the inner humor of the Gene Hackman Luthor and Spacey never plays for laughs.  I actually liked his performance.sn't have the inner humor of the Gene Hackman Luthor and Spacey never plays for laughs.  I actually liked his performance.
0393327655|5.0|I read this book backwards.  Well, not backwards figuratively (although I started off with the Afterword).  No, I read it backwards in that I first read Letter to a Christian Nation, in which author Sam Harris addresses some of the questions thrown at him by critics of The End of Faith.  Since Letter, I started reading The End of Faith.  I was immediately struck by three thoughts:<br /><br />1.  This book will not be read by those needing to receive this message.<br /><br />2.  There is much in Harris' arguments that can be gleaned in the first chapter.  At a minimum, encourage folk to read this portion of the book.<br /><br />3.

0688023711|5.0|Ken Follett captures in his unique, exciting style the true life story of Ross Perot's refusal to let the Iranian government hold two of his employees in captivity when they had done nothing wrong.  The book follows the actual events through the capture of the the two employees, the ineffectual US government attempts to release them through diplomatic channels, and the assembly and training of the recovery team.  Follett does an excellent job of profiling the team, detailing their military and professional backgrounds, as well as their personal situations and motivations for volunteering for the rescue mission.  The author also gives an excellent profile of Ross Perot, the friendly, seemingly soft-spoken millionaire with a will of steel.  This book is easy to read, with plenty of adventure and the occassional humorous story to keep it personal and human.  An absolutely outstanding story, it not only tells a true story but teaches important lessons about leadership and loyalty.
B0007PALSE|4.0|I, Robot in many ways is one of those kind of films that you're putting on going \\"oh man, wonder how much this is going to suck\\". Then again, you're dealing with Alex Proyas, director of such cult hits as the Crow and Dark City so even if it was bad, you'd at least now you were bound to watch something visually striking and at least cool. While it does have some trouble spots, I, Robot manages to at least be fun and engaging and worth an investment. <br /> <br />It's the future and robotic technology has become increasingly sophisticated. A new model is being released but cop Del Spooner is absolutely convinced that robots will one day turn on us which is ridiculous to everyone since robots obey 3 laws: they can't hurt or allow a human to be harmed, to obey orders unless it conflicts with rule 1 and a robot protects itself if it doesn't conflict with rules 1 and 2. After the main developer of the robots dies under a suspected suicide, Spooner thinks otherwise and with the help of a gorgeous scientist, he tries to figure out what's going on with the robots. <br /> <br />After the gothic-flavored the Crow and the film noir look of Dark City, director Proyas now goes for the sleek futuristic style and it works quite well. While it does seem like a nerd thinking up futuristic stuff instead of going for realism, like Spielberg's extensive research in a possible future for Minority Report, it does have a great look and certain technologies look great such as the cars. The effects are pretty stellar, in particular the robots where dozens and in one shots what looks like near a thousand or so appear on screen. The one problem is that there's a couple action scenes that were obviously added so it wouldn't just be this thinking sci-fi movie. Granted the scenes are great, including an attack on a car in motion and a demolition happening while one's inside the house are great but they also feel added to appease the blockbuster going crowd. <br /> <br />I think Will Smith is oneof those kind of actors where Will just can't help being Will. Not going after his acting, far from it (in fact, there's some great scenes he has here) but you can't get past moments that make you think of the wisecracking Fresh Prince. Underutilized James Cromwell is always excellent and while not really given much range, Bridget Moynahan is just so cuuute. The real star personally is actually just a voice but Alan Tudyk(Wash from Firefly/Serenity) supplies the voice of Sunny, a robot who's been given an actual personality and he pulls it off admirably. The only thing is certain characters just seem kind of useless. Shia LeBeouf's role for example just seems kind of pointless since it just doesn't go anywhere, same with Spooner's grandmother role. <br /> <br />Is it Proyas's best? No, for me that's the Crow and this is actually the only film that I probably wouldn't get despite done by an emerging talent. It's not a terrible movie by any means but after downsizing movies I've owned over the years, I can look at this one and go \\"yeah I enjoyed it but I doubt I'd watch it again\\".

B000ION23A|4.0|Lucas Nickle has a terrible life.  He's small and the neighborhood bully picks on him all the time.  The wedgies are so fierce they rip his underwear, and he's running out of underwear.  But he always has the anthill he can take his frustrations out on.  Until the night the ant wizard Zoc makes a potion that shrinks him down to ant-size.  Then Lucas has to learn what it's like to life an ant's life or he's never going to get back home.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Bruce Campbell, and Zach Tyler lend their voices to the character.  The movie was based on a book by John Nickle.<br /><br />Besides the adventure and the fantasy of being inside an anthill, THE ANT BULLY offers a lot to think about when it comes to being part of a community.  Lucas's challenges make him think, but they also make young viewers think as well.  In addition, the fast pacing and humorous bits will keep young viewers glued to the television until the end of the movie.<br /><br />A video game was released at the time the movie came out, and some of the gameplay mechanics are obviously inserted in the movie.  Young fans won't know this, but for us old enough to figure things out, we see it easily (such has the hang-gliding from fan to fan sequence).<br /><br />THE ANT BULLY is a great DVD for family night.
055358202X|5.0|Personally, I think this is Martin's best of the series. Reviewers that are scoring this low need to remember that this storyline is not about a particular character or group of characters, rather Martin has an overreaching story arc that follows families and nations. While this type of writing is not typically my favorite, it is Martin's ability to take us from the general overview of entire nations and families to the specific characters and make us care about them that is unique. Yet this also allows him to maim or kill major characters at any moment, which every reader of his that has enjoyed his work must admit really is engaging. Yet this  writing style means that Martin must begin again with new characters. He does so here, yet he rebuilds new characters with the same skill that he has the old ones, and there are enough favorites still around to mix in (Jaime and Cersei, Brienne, Arya, Jon Snow, etc.) to maintain the continuity. Maybe it's just that it's been so long since I read one of Martin's books that makes me like this so much, but this is my favorite so far. <br />
B000ICM5MG|5.0|Rocky Balboa, now an icon of American culture, began his story here. Apollo Creed, a fighter with the class and style of Muhammad Ali, needs a boxer in the heavyweight championships when his opponent breaks his hand. He chooses Rocky, an unknown fighter with a marketable nickname, \\"The Italian Stallion.\\"<br /><br />Rocky is just a decent boxer from Philly who could have achieved something if he had more drive. He lives a futile life of discouragement, surviving on hard work and honor. He's a collection agent for a loan shark, and tries, even then, to treat his clients right, giving them the chance to pay up.<br /><br />When Creed makes his offer to Rocky, Rocky realizes this is his door to freedom, to all he has dreamed of reaching. Creed, though, is the best, and Rocky knows it. He trains hard, but can't forget how good Creed is. His goal isn't to win; that seems unachievable. It is to go the distance, to last through every round. No one ever lasted that long with Creed.<br /><br />Subplots that help provide depth are his love interest with Adrian, perfectly played by Talia Shire, and Paulie's (Adrian's brother) temper and sense of feeling disenfranchised. Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer, Mickey, is a stereotypically sour old man who talks in rough phrases from one side of his mouth who sees Rocky as the embodiment of his own failed dreams.<br /><br />Rocky's relationship with Adrian is classy. He is a gentleman, albeit simple, and even slept on the couch when Adrian stayed at his place. That kind of class is refreshing to see.<br /><br />Meredith, perhaps best known until this as the Penguin on the 1960s' Batman TV series, is a great compliment to Sylvester Stallone's Rocky, bringing a father-like wisdom and care to their relationship.<br /><br />Stallone's own comment on Rocky says it is, \\"All about: pride, reputation, and not being another bum in the neighborhood.\\" I saw it as an American dream. He worked hard, had a dose of luck, and when it mattered, was all heart.<br /><br />The music is as strong as the movie. High school bands played the \\"Rocky Theme\\" by Bill Conti for many years. Watching Rocky's workouts, especially the running and pushup scenes, is inspiring. Mixed with the music, you might catch yourself suiting up and hitting the streets for a few miles after the final credits roll.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Rocky.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comit mattered, was all heart.  <br /> <br />The music is as strong as the movie.

B00005JPE7|4.0|\\"Rocky Balboa\\" AKA, \\"Rocky VI\\" will not be the greatest inspirational sports movie you see. Its grandfather, the original \\"Rocky\\" could argue for that spot. In fact, it might own it. However, no one should compare this to the first Rocky. It is a fun, inspiring movie for 2006, and will be a worthy addition to the sports movie pantheon.<br /><br />4.5 stars for this one.<br /><br />\\"Rocky Balboa\\" is, itself, the great underdog. Critics see it as another installment in the descending and embarrassing series, or, are calling it the best 'Rocky' sequel. Because of the two extremes Stallone has presented us, from one of the best movies ever to some of the dogs of cinema, expectations are low. With expectations across the board, I saw this and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa, circa 2006, is a retired boxer approaching 60. People in town generally give him respect, and space. He is no longer hounded by the media, and no longer chased by his fans. Philadelphia has moved on. They even took down his statue.<br /><br />Now, he runs a midlevel Italian restaurant, and wanders from table to table telling about the good old days. Customers get a meal and a story, and Rocky gets his mortgage paid.<br /><br />His son begrudges his dad for the big shadow. Imagine being Michael Jordan's kid? Such is what Rocky, Jr. must endure, and he wants to be his man. He pushes his dad away in the process. Rocky's conversation with his son outside the restaurant will be ranked among the great movie speeches, and will be quoted everywhere from church sermons to business books to locker rooms.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Rocky is looking for meaning. Like Willy Loman, he wants the older years of his life to matter, and like Loman, he keeps looking to the past to find that meaning. Regular visits to Adrian's grave, autographs in his restaurant, and walks through his old neighborhood remind him of who he used to be. Who is he now?<br /><br />He feeds a needy old opponent of his, helps a single woman and her son with friendship and jobs. He recognizes that life should be lived on his terms, just as he always has. But what are his terms?<br /><br />When reigning champ Mason Dixon, a mix of rap star arrogance and Mike Tyson dominance, wants to fight, Rocky sees it as similar to the opportunity Apollo Creed gave him decades earlier. He's a fool, naturally. The match \\"will against skill\\" is respectful that Rocky's will power is bar none, but he isn't 25.<br /><br />Like the other Rocky movies, good and bad, this is a family film. No profanity, sex, or the usual Hollywood movie gimmicks to kick it into PG-13 or up rating. It's clean, hard-charging, and packed with the message the other movies carried: \\"All about: pride, reputation, and not being another bum in the neighborhood.\\"<br /><br />The movie needs another 10-15 minutes to wrap up some storylines, and some of the lines are cheesy. Dixon's desire to be tested, Spider's reasons for being out of work, and Rocky's friendship to Steps need clearing up. The movie hangs on, but viewers might be left unsatisfied. Rocky makes one monologue too many about continuing to fight and never be beaten, but not so much that it becomes polemic.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Rocky Balboa.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comgnizes that life should be lived on his terms, just as he always has.

0312958455|5.0|LAPD's Harry Bosch is a troubled man with what the lay person would call lots of issues and some serious psychological baggage. His childhood as a county ward was unhappy and troubled, his wife has left him for good and his home is condemned to the wrecker's ball as a result of recent earthquake damage. When Bosch shoved his superior officer through a plate glass window in the precinct office as a result of his interference in an interrogation, he is summarily suspended, put onto stress leave and his return to active duty was stalled pending a positive report from mandatory psychiatric counselling with Dr Carmen Hinojos. Conversations with Hinojos on his personal life vision, \\"Everybody counts or nobody counts\\", together with a review of his family history, prod an angry Bosch into the realization that he (like the LAPD of some thirty years earlier) had swept his mother's murder under the carpet because she was just a prostitute - a life that didn't count for anything and one whose murder wasn't worth the time, effort and expenditure to solve. Against all the rules of his suspension from duty and all of Hinojos' best advice, Bosch pulls his mother's murder book and the scanty box of evidence from the police vaults and sets himself on a belated personal mission to solve his mother's murder and bring her killer to belated justice.<br /><br />In a superb blend of psychological thriller, mystery and police procedural, \\"The Last Coyote\\" is told strictly from Bosch's point of view but Connelly masterfully flicks from one scene to another - the proverbial psychiatric couch of Dr Hinojos' office; the memories of his troubled youth as the son of a prostitute and a ward at McLaren Hall; Bosch's musings and self-recriminations as he gingerly walks the tautly strung high wire of his own nerves and personally evaluates his life, his actions and his conversations with Dr Hinojos; and, of course, the exciting discovery of his mother's murderer as the events of thirty years earlier impact on those still alive today.<br /><br />I think it's safe to generalize that psychological thrillers only succeed when the characters are superbly drawn and I think it's also safe to say that Connelly has succeeded once again in bringing an irascible, self-absorbed and driven yet self-doubting Bosch to life for his faithful readers. We are happily witness to his growth and pain as he meets and falls for Jasmine, a lady whose troubled history competes with Bosch's own!<br /><br />In a marked departure from his other works, Connelly has also treated us to a small slice of mysticism with the introduction of Bosch's dreams of a coyote - his animal totem appearing to him in a vision quest, as it were! It is Bosch's personal identification with the lost, wandering coyote that provides him with insight into his own personal travails as he seeks to re-establish purpose and meaning into a life that is drifting aimlessly!<br /><br />And, of course, like all well crafted thrillers, the ending comes with a twist that will catch you totally flat-footed.

It is a remarkable place full of adventurers, international traders, informers, spies, opportunist Vichy Police, German officers, all rounded out by a superb black singer-pianist Dooley Wilson, the excellent Sam, Rick's only trusted friend...<br /><br />The interesting club so well organized, leads to an open arena of conspiracy, counterspies, secret plans, black market transactions, in which the games and fights are between arrogant Nazis, patriotic French, idealists, murderers, pickpockets and gamblers around a roulette wheel, where a ball could rest on Rick's command against the settled number 22...<br /><br />\\"Casablanca\\" is an adventure film which victory is not won with cannons and guns... The action, the fight, the war takes place inside Rick's walls rather than outside...<br /><br />But who is this Rick? What is his magical power? His secret weapon? Rick is the anti-fascist with hard feelings, the former soldier of fortune who has grown tired of smuggling and fighting, and is now content to sit out the war in his own neutral territory... Even loyalty to a friend doesn't move him as he refuses to help Ugarte, a desperately frightened little courier who is fleeing from the police...<br /><br />Emphatically, Rick says, \\"I stick my neck out for nobody.\\" But we know he will do just that in a very short time, for into his quiet life comes a haunting vision from his past, the beautiful woman he still loves and bitterly remembers... She is married to an underground leader and she desperately needs those papers Rick conveniently now has in his possession... The cynical Rick's facade of neutrality begins to weaken as he recalls the bittersweet memories of his past love affair, memories triggered repeatedly when the strains of \\"As Time Goes By\\" come from Sam, his piano-playing confidante...<br /><br />But \\"Casablanca\\" basic message is a declaration of self-sacrifice... War World II demanded all! The words stated by Rick at the airport had their impact: 'The problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.' It goes without saying that Bogart is incomparable when he seems most like himself... His way with a line makes \\"Casablanca\\" dialog part of the collective memory: 'I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray. You were blue.'<br /><br />Intermixed in this intrigue are all the fascinating and beautifully acted supporting roles... With his customary skill, Claude Rains plays Major Renault, a prefect of police who is like Bogart in many ways... He, too, claims neutrality, but is definitely against the Nazis... He is Rick's most devoted adversary, tauntingly calling the man a \\"sentimentalist\\" and delivering his share of cynically amusing lines... When he makes a small bet and is encouraged to make a bigger one, he remarks that he is only a \\"poor corrupt official.\\"<br /><br />Ingrid Bergman is fascinating as the lovely heroine, the mysterious impossible woman of an impossible love, the tender mood of every man, the love-affair, the quality of being romantic, the traditional woman enclosed by two rivals, symbol of a besieged Europe...<br /><br />Paul Henreid is Victor Laszlo, the anti-Nazi resistance leader, seeking in Morocco the two letters of transit signed by General De Gaulle...<br /><br />Sidney Greenstreet is the black marketeer on good terms with Rick, the rival owner of the 'Blue Parrot,' the acceptable face of corruption...<br /><br />Peter Lorre is Ugarte, the racketeer, the dealer of anything illegal, the killer, driven into a corner by the Vichy police, who has given Rick two letter of transit...<br /><br />Conrad Veidt is the very essence of German rigidity, unfeeling, unconcerned about life, but firmly believing in the foolish ideology of his Nazi compatriots...<br /><br />\\"Casablanca\\" covers many highlights: The Marseillaise against the Horst Wessel song inspiring sequence; the blissful days in Paris; Ilsa's emotional words to Rick in occupied Paris; the champagne toast; Ilsa's request to Sam; the poetry of the magic words and the beautiful voice of Dooley Wilson; Captain Renault's words in the airport; and the farewell...<br /><br />The magic that developed from the teaming of Bogart and Bergman is enough to make a new romantic figure out of the former tough guy... To his cynicism, his own code of ethics, his hatred of the phoniness in all human behavior, he now added the softening traits of tenderness and compassion and a feeling of heroic commitment to a cause... They helped him complete the portrayal of the ideal man who all men wished to rival...<br /><br />One can look at hundreds of films produced during this period without finding any whose composite pieces fall so perfectly into place...

These elements are the music of the cabaret, the lives of the principal characters, and the world outside of their narrow domain...<br /><br />Director Bob Fosse captures the atmosphere and turmoil of the time and place, just before Hitler's rise to power, presenting a multifaceted portrait of a hedonistic, increasingly dangerous society, in which every brushstroke is significant and influential...<br /><br />The cast, headed by Liza Minnelli as an American cabaret star and Michael York as the shy Englishman suffering with the fact that he \\"doesn't like girls,\\" perfectly embodied the characters caught up in the currents of the tale...<br /><br />The film begins with an amorphous view of Berlin's Kit Kat Club in 1930s Germany, and as the view becomes clearer, we meet the nightclub's depraved customers and its host, the charming painted emcee, who sings 'Willkommen' as the cabaret's girls play their musical instruments...

Gradually, however, the cabaret becomes more threatening; the Master of Ceremonies provides the historical and social themes throughout his songs..

B00005JLEU|5.0|I won't bore you with a long review. I just wanted to add my 5 stars to this movies collection of perfect reviews. This is a masterpiece; everyone should be made to see it.
B00005JPE7|4.0|As with many, I had very low expectatioins when I heard about \\"Rocky Balboa\\", the 6th chapter in the classic series about the underdog boxer from Philadelphia turned heavyweight champ.  Given how awful the latest previous installment, Rocky V, was and that Sylvester Stallone is likely on medicare by now, my basic reaction to the prospect of another Rocky movie was that it sounded like a complete joke.    To tell the truth, the only reason I decided to go to see Rocky Balboa was because a friend (who is a self-proclaimed \\"Rocky Freak\\") had insisted on taking me.  I looked at some of the critics' reviews before leaving, and I was very pleasantly suprised to see that Richard Roeper had given it a 3.5/4 rating.  This left me very optimistic walking into the movie theater, and I was not disappointed.  The film was a fitting final chapter in the legacy of an iconic American series, and certainly filled the bitter void that Rocky V left behind.  Rocky went out with pride, not embarassment.  That was supposedly Stallone's reason for making the movie.    The plot centers around a long retired Rocky Balboa.  In the opening of the film, we see Rocky sitting at the grave site of his beloved wife Adrian, who had passed away in 2002.  It is rumored that the character was killed off because the actress who portrayed her, Talia Shire, refused to take part in the film because she felt it would be a major box office flop.  Whatever the reason, it is clear that Rocky misses her terribly, and we see him with his brother-in-law Paulie touring Philadelphia sites that reminded Rocky of his life with Adrian.  It is a very painful experience for Paulie, however, because he regrets that he did not treat Adrian very well.    After this tour, Rocky goes to the Lucky Seven Tavern where he and his old trainer Mickey used to drink together.  There he meets a woman bartender who seems to know him.  Rocky doesn't remember, but the woman informs him that she was \\"Little Marie\\", a troublemaking minorcharacter who made a cameo appearence in the original film, in which Rocky pleads that she quit smoking, only to recieve the response \\"Screw you, creapo!\\".  She introduces him to her child, Stephenson (aka \\"Steps\\") whom Rocky gives a job to at the Resuraunt he now owns in Philadelphia.    Rocky clearly is feeling emptiness at this point in his life, but he would find himself in the spotlight again soon enough.  In a nationally televised episode of ESPN's SportsCenter, Rocky (in his prime) is put up against current (hated) heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (played by real-life boxer Antonio Tarver) in a computer simulated fight.  Rocky emerges victorious, though many ESPN commentators disagree with this result.    This prompts Rocky to consider fighting again. When he tells his son of this, he thinks Rocky is crazy, and the Pennsylvania Athletic Commision refused him a boxing license.  However, Rocky pursuades them to change their minds after a very passionate speech about every American's \\"right to pursue happiness\\".    Much to Rocky's suprise, Mason Dixon challenges him to an exhibition match to capitalize on the publicity of ESPN's simulated fight in an attempt to improve his image.  Rocky is reluctant to accept the offer, and explains that he was only interested in local ameture tournaments and not in \\"getting mangled and embarrased\\".  However, after much thought and encouragment from \\"Little Marie\\", Rocky decides to accept the challenge.  What followed was a classic and inspirational underdog story of hard work and dedication.  But would it pay off? Well, I won't ruin the movie for you. I'll just say that the ending is fairly realistic, but leaves everybody satisified.    I think that Rocky Balboa is probably the best Rocky film since Rocky II in 1980, because it really brings back the \\"pull for the underdog\\" spirit of the first two films.  While Rocky III and Rocky IV were fairly enjoyable, they didn't capture the same spirit because Rocky wasn't really the underdog anymore.  In this way, I think it's good that Stallone waited so long to release Rocky Balboa.  Just like the fight that that it centers around, against all odds, the film comes out triumphant.
B000002LRX|5.0|Of all the records of the post-punk, grunge or whatever era, this one blends so many things together it's one of the most unique and hard-hitters of the era. The lyrics border on bizarre observations of some of the darker realities of our world, but with enough humour that you really can't take anything too seriously. The music is so hard-hitting in ways that few other people have ever done and, yes, like SO MANY of the other reviews, it has aged nicely. Few bands can touch this, period. Patton's soaring vocals and range are an inspiration for empowerment like few others. All the sounds crashing together so well make me wish I'd have caught these guys live during the tour for this masterpiece. Also, like many of the other reviewers, this is among my all-time favorites.
0930289234|5.0|Man I just finished reading this book and I have to say it was one of the best things I've read in long time. I usualy will read anything that is given to me I am not picky but I surely was not disappointed with this book. The characters are well developed and the plot keeps you going all the way through.<br /><br />I don't want to give to much away about the story but it's basicaly about ex-super heros who get tangled up in their own problems and emotions why trying to figure out if theres a secrete plot to kill ex-heros.<br /><br />The style of the art is that of an older style before the over use of photo shop and other graphic programs. And the way the story is told is a unique mix of flashbacks, book chapters, police reports, journals, comic within a comic and classic comic book panals.<br /><br />simply great.
B00005221M|5.0|Here we have the best film version of James Fenimore Cooper's novel, ever! Seeing it in the theatre for the first time in 1992, I WAS BLOWN AWAY! Daniel Day Lewis is a natural and convincing Hawkeye, Russel Means is memorable as Chingachguk, a Native warrior wielding a huge war-club!  <br />An episode during the French & Indian War: A group of three forrest-wandering hunters rescues a group of survivors ambushed by Huron warriors.The party is enroute for Fort William Henry, but arrive to find the fortress under siege by the French. Events unfold that challenge their skills of survival, as they are hunted by the vengeful warrior Magua (played outstandingly by Wes Studi).  <br />The end is climactic, the musical score...powerful! The sound-track itself is a crowning feature in an already great film! <br />Some points of interest: When I attended the Marine Corps Close-Combat Instructor Course, the commanding-officer of the school played this movie for the students, for its realistic lessons in tactical-awareness! The three main characters attended a wilderness-survival school in the Appalachians in preparation for acting in this film.
B00005JPBP|5.0|This was probably the best movie I've seen all year. Like the Usual Suspects, it absolutely requires at least a second viewing. You will not figure out the connections on the first pass. Mysterious, dark, and more than a little quirky, the story is riveting and ends on a surprisingly sympathetic note... not at all what you believe you are heading to as the movie unfolds. I won't give anything away here but it is a great movie.<br /><br />The cast and characterizations are flawless. As a huge Christian Bale fan, I always think each movie I see him in is his best work yet. This is no exception. He's perfect!
0064430227|5.0|There are a number of excellent reviews here, but I just wanted to add that I also think this book is one of the very best out there.  Our 20-month-old loves books, and has a large collection of every kind of kid book.  This is one of his favorites, and we have to read it to him at least once a day.  The combined themes of creating his own world and making decisions about what to do in that world are very appealing to someone of his age... or any age, for that matter.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!
B0002O39A2|5.0|This is a very interesting album from 1972 and certainly one of the heaviest that I have heard from the Canterbury scene.  In fact, the riff heavy nature of this album took me a little by surprise - I think I was expecting something a little lighter.  Khan is (and was) however a quintessential Canterbury rock band; especially with the dense ensemble work, high level of musicianship, and the ever-present sense of humor.  Come to think of it, this album is somewhat stylistically similar to Gong's Camembert Electrique album from 1971 - except not as crazy!<br /><br />The musicians include fantastic guitarist Steve Hillage (acoustic and electric guitar; vocals); incredible keyboardist Dave Stewart (organ, piano, celeste); Eric Peachey (Drums); and Nick Greenwood (electric bass and vocals).  The musicianship on Space Shanty is top notch and there are loads of instrumental passages that show off some pretty dense ensemble work and fantastic soloing by Steve and Dave (they are impressive throughout).  Eric and Nick are no slouches either and comprise an excellent rhythm section - in fact I would love to track down some other recordings by these guys but would not know where to start.  The vocals and vocal harmonies are excellent by the way.<br /><br />Although I have described the music as heavy (and believe me Steve rips it up on the electric), there are some very spacey and quieter sections that feature Dave's soft organ playing and Steve on acoustic guitar.  In fact, some folks have described this album as space rock, although I think there is far too much going on each composition to call this space rock.  In general, each piece features an excellent blend of heavy riffing played in unison on the bass and the electric guitar; intricate ensemble work; and more relaxed passages that feature vocals.  The six pieces are highly melodic and it is clear that they spent just as much time on the vocal melodies as the fancier instrumental passages.  The tracks are not too long (by prog standards) and range in length from 5'32\\" to 9'22\\" - they are all well put together and arranged.<br /><br />This remastered album is pretty good and has great sound quality, restored cover art, song lyrics, and loads of liner notes.  The short bonus tracks include the short (3'31\\") Break the Chain and an early version of Mixed up Man of the Mountains.  Break the Chain is OK.<br /><br />Space Shanty is very highly recommended along with Camembert Electrique.  Steve Hillage went on to join Gong after this album and two heavy/spacey/proggy albums including Angel's Egg (1973) and You (1974) are both highly recommended.ards) and range in length from 5'32\\" to 9'22\\" - they are all well put together and arranged.

B000M341QE|5.0|The Departed was my favorite film in 2006, and probably the best movie I've seen in the theater in several years.  The plot and the setting were very compelling, but the best part was the incredible cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg and especially Jack Nicholson were all outstanding in their roles as cops and mobsters.   <br /> <br />At times, I have felt that Nicholson gets way too much credit for his acting, and that he seems to play the same iconoclastic rebel in all of his roles.  I was wrong: Jack Nicholson is one of the best parts of this movie.  Nicholson is superb as a Boston mafia boss, and he completely dominates most of the movie with his persona.  You never quite know what he is going to do, and have to watch in anticipation.  While not quite as dominated a presence, DiCaprio is also excellent as an undercover cop trying to infiltrate the mob.  Throughout the film, he appears calm in many scenes, but exudes a strong frantic sense, as his life hangs on a thread as he tries to hide his true identity.  Matt Damon is great as a dirty cop if for no other reason than you spend the whole film hoping he gets his come-uppance.  Finally, I really enjoyed Walberg as an intense detective whose angry exterior betrays his disgust at being unable to lock up Nicholson and a deeper class resentment.  I do wish his character had gotten more screen time and been explored a bit more.  Hopefully if the DVD has deleted scenes, some of them will have Wahlberg in them.   <br /> <br />The Departed explores several fascinating themes.  The first, is obviously identity.  Many of the main characters spend much of the film grappling with who they are and where they belong.  Dicaprio is torn between being a cop and upholding the law and assimilating himself as part of a violent criminal organization.  Similarly, Damon works as a decorated cop, but he works diligently for criminal Nicholson.  Questions abound about whether the characters are completely good or bad, and it is unclear if they themselves know.   <br /> <br />Another great theme is that of change.  The first scenes in the movie show Boston's (violent) resistance to the school busing of the 1970s, while Nicholson laments how the city and its culture have changed.  Throughout the film, Nicholson and other show degrees of disgust to how they feel Boston's character has been tainted by new people and classes.  I thought this was very interesting, and well fits Boston, a city that is rapidly changing from what it was for generations.  For example, many parts of South Boston, where a lot of the movie takes place, have become gentrified and less Irish working class.   <br /> <br />I could talk about The Departed for hours, as there are hundreds of interesting parts worth discussing.  Needless to say, it's a splendid movie.  While there are some parts that don't quite make sense -- for example, it seems very unlikely that Nicholson could be so brazen and escape justice time after time -- but they are few and far between.  The best movie of 2006, no doubt about it.   <br />
B0006J28KU|2.0|Actually, the acting was close to perfect, and all roles were developed nicely, so kudos for casting (but how can you miss with this cast???).  The big weaknesses here were the plot and the direction.  These were very sophomoric.  Seriously... right down to the last scene. Predictable.  I actually guessed the last line in the movie right after the coffee house scene.  Plot and screenplay were very poor. Unoriginal.  Cinematography was uninspired.  Actually... a bad movie made no more than 'OK' by a stellar cast.<br /><br />Ok.  I watched this movie again a few days ago... and I have to say it.  This movie sucks.
B0002MJT0I|5.0|Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid, after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests with a revolting script. Like poor Dracula, they run out of things to do.<br /><br />But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead. In the vein of Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive,\\" it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.<br /><br />Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete, who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).<br /><br />Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub.<br /><br />\\"Shaun\\" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. The heroes don't even have guns (since the UK public don't get them), and so our heroes fend off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. That gives an idea of how serious this movie is.<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" isn't so much a zombie movie as a love story with zombies -- a very funny one, with lots of gore. We're treated to slackers in love, Shaun drifting obliviously around London withoutn noticing the undead, and some very entertaining dialogue (\\"Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet...\\")<br /><br />Later on, he's forced to shake off his obliviousness in order to save his loved ones, with a bat as his only weapon. And maybe some commandos in a tank. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.<br /><br />Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it. Frost is a good annoying sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend.<br /><br />As a bonus, music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? \\"Stone Roses?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"...Second Coming?\\" \\"I liked it.\\" \\"Dire Straits?\\" \\"Chuck it!\\" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.<br /><br />While it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof -- rather it's a zombie movie with wit, love and comedy. By not taking itself too seriously, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" ends up revitalizing a genre that seemed like it was... well, almost dead.in a tank.

B000F6IOC0|1.0|This movie has absolutely no plot.  It basically just follows Selene and the now hybrid Michael around as they try to find the first Werewolf, William, as they are being chased by the first Vampire, Marcus.  It has a lot of action, but there's no plot, at all.  All it is, is they run around, shoot stuff, Marcus kills the person they just met shortly after they leave, and then he drinks their blood to get their memories.  And by the way, the effect of vampires gaining the memories of those they drink the blood from was used way too much.  It was basically spammed,over, and over, and over, and over, from the opening of the movie, to the end.  I guess that's subliminal messages for you, all Marcus and Selene do is suck, and the move outright sucks.  And due to the memories that comes with the blood sucking, there are dozens of flashbakcs, half the time it's to events that just happened five minutes ago.  Apperently, their target audience had severe alzheimers.     <br />So to sum this movie up, mindless violence, random decapitations, loads of blood sucking with flashbacks constantly, and absolutely no plot whatsoever.  Save yourself time and money and pass up this peice of garbage.
0307237699|2.0|The Audacity of Hope sets out to make the reader believe Barack Obama is THE answer to America's problems and he is a leader who will unite and not divide.  This may very well be the case but I feel  manipulated after reading this book, almost as if he was trying to become what he thinks Americans are looking for.  He presents himself as all the things lacking in our present leadership and this is manipulation in it's finest form.  He seems to say all the things liberals want to hear and even placates conservatives.  This makes me wonder what he actually stands for.  When I detect this, all else is lost.  I've heard Mr. Obama speak many times and he comes across the same in his book.  Smooth, way too smooth.  As an example of his ability to speak from both sides of his mouth...depending on who is listening, he speaks against the war in Iraq, saying we need to pull out and have no business being there BUT, he thinks America NEEDS to go into Darfur and make things right.  Both countries suffered torture and death at the hands of ruthless people but since our country  is against the war right now and really into African causes, he thinks Darfur is a noble cause to fight for.<br />Obama has talk show hosts drooling over him as the next savior and after reading The Audacity of Hope I feel he himself believes the hype.  As I read some of the other reviews here I see more drooling and looking to this man as if he's God.  Be careful, be very careful.
0440416027|5.0|David Almond's Printz Award Honor Book, Skellig, brings readers immediately into the story and involves readers intellectually, spiritually and emotionally. This page-turner tells the story of a boy called Michael. His family just moved across town, his baby sister is on the brink of death and his parents are all nerves, when he discovers a winged man in his garage. His new friend, Mina, is the only person he can confide in.<br /><br />Skellig is an adventure through many different realms, a beautifully crafted dance between dreaming and waking. Michael learns about evolution, poetry, and love as he helps the winged man, Skellig, remember how to fly. The parallelism between Skellig and Michael's sister regaining their strength and choosing life is done with skill and grace. As Michael and Mina befriend Skellig and pray for Michael's sister, they learn that you don't have to have wings to be an angel.<br /><br />Michael, a dynamic protagonist, learns valuable life lessons in the course of the novel. Mina, a strong and intelligent female character, guides Michael through a hard time in his life. The two develop a remarkable and deep friendship, helping those in need and learning from their experiences.<br /><br />Skellig is a mysterious adventure without a definite answer to the wonder at the events that unfold. It touches on many complicated and sometimes difficult issues we all encounter growing up, including school, friendship, family, love, and death. I would highly recommend this book to any young reader, particularly one with a curiosity for the mysteries of life.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|There are so many positive reviews for this movie but I can't seem to understand why...maybe I missed something during the movie.  I will say though that the performances by Ralph Finnes and Rachel Weisz were brilliant.  They had amazing chemistry on screen and their relationship was completely believable.  The story behind the movie was great, I just didn't care for the film.  The DVD jacket promised an intellectual thriller with a climatic ending never to be forgotten.  The premise of the movie boils down to \\"Corporations.. specifically pharmaceutical companies.. are bad. In this case, the evil companies decide that it's easier to kill various people, including foreign diplomats and their families, rather than fix a drug that allegedly kills people.  This is not a film I'd recommend to anyone.  Try Hotel Rwanda.
0312330537|2.0|Protagonist Lin is like a fig newton, crusty outside and ooey-gooey inside. He can take on bullies and corrupt guards in prison, but he's a nauseating softie for friends and one green-eyed, expatriot lady.  <br /> <br />I thought the tale of an Aussie busting out of prison and settling into Bombay as a slum doctor was very imaginative until I learned it's what the author did. Like many an autobiographer, Roberts tells about a pure hero whose only fault is a little naivete. Well, he's such an insufferable Galahad, it's unbelievable -- this sap is an unreliable narrator really. <br /> <br />And he badly needs an editor. Lin undergoes what seems like thousands of adventures in this 900-page tome and never seems to learn much from any of them. Stuff just happens. Roberts is a decent writer, with some nice turns of phrase, but after 900+ pages, he still couldn't wind this thing up, just dropping hints about yet another adventure. Who cares?

B000GFLKF8|4.0|Gifted director Spike Lee did a brilliant job in coordinating his impressive cast of actors with an intriguing and convoluted script written by novice Russell Gewirtz, in the crime thriller \\"Inside Man\\".  Lee, the New York city icon, used panoramic camera angles in depicting his adopted home town, particularly the Wall Street area, as a backdrop for this drama.  Lee made effective use of flashforwards in presenting the plot, a cleverly contrived bank robbery that quickly spiraled into a hostage taking standoff.<br /><br />Criminal mastermind Dalton Russell played by Clive Owen led a well trained team into a Manhattan bank where they quickly assumed control.  Forcing the large group of hostages to strip and dress in the same outfits as the robbers, he homogenized the confined group.  Hostage negotiating NYPD detective Keith Frazier played by talented Denzel Washington, a cool cerebral yet compromised investigator owing to a recent bust that went bad, wall called in to deal with Owen.<br /><br />The bank was owned by Jewish chairman of the board Arthur Case played by veteran Christopher Plummer.  Plummer was prepared to go to great lengths to maintain secrecy of his affairs which were documented within a safety deposit box located at the bank.  Plummer had been a Nazi collaborator against his own people harvesting untold riches which he used to start his banking empire.  As a result, Plummer called in smug and refined power broker Madeleine White played by Jodie Foster to help maintain secrecy while she negotiated with Owen.<br /><br />We soon see that there is an ulterior motive to the affair as Owen appears to be stalling for time.  Washington realizes that things are amiss but is shackled from pursuing his investigation by higher ups.<br /><br />The movie concludes with an unexpected interaction between Washington and Owen highlighting the mutual respect each man had for the other.
B00005V9HH|3.0|Knowing that I was behind the times I decided to catch up with \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" the critically acclaimed, Oscar winning film from 1995 that launched Bryan Singer's directorial career. I found it to be decent, but not worth the hype. The intricate plot involves a group of criminals who come together to pull off some kind of job on a boat. We watch, after the fact, as Verbal (Kevin Spacey) tells his version of the story to the detective. What at first appears to be a mind boggling heist turns out to be just that. Writer Christopher McQuarrie seems to want to keep his audience at a distance as the script has a very cold veneer. No characters are given any warmth and there is nothing even resembling a sense of humor. It weighs down the entire film and we are stuck taking this elaborate punking as though it were high art. The script thinks very highly of itself. But with an Oscar on its side who am I to argue?<br /><br />The film would probably be best enjoyed by those who like nice, intriguing capers, but it is not my cup of tea. All the trappings of an overly complicated plot are here, only it provides no real pay off in the end. Well there is a pay off that is explained in the shocking twist ending, but it is so forced that you will be forgiven for feeling played. There are no hints and no warning signs so that when the rug does get pulled out for under you the only thing that it results in is a sore rear end. If we wanted to we could look at this film and say that it serves as a celebration of storytelling, but if that is what it wanted to be then it should have tried harder at telling its own story.  And it is not just the lack of playfulness that bugged me (though for the record I'll take \\"Ocean's 11\\" over this any day), but also my inability to be drawn into these characters in this situation. I'm certainly not going to blame the actors, Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne are especially on target. No, something was missing, and my instincts tell me that it was humanity.<br /><br />It is interesting that this is what started Singer's career, a career devoted pretty much to men who fly. Take the character Keyser Soze for instance. Here is a man who would fit right in on one of Marvel's pages. He's shadowy and stalks through the night striking terror in the hearts of many. Of course the myth is bigger than the man, but the build up is done quite well. As is a lot of this film, and I really have no intentions of dumping on it. The pacing is smooth in that it keeps everything going but never threatens whiplash. And for all my qualms with the story I was interested to see how it turned out. What story was true? What was on the boat? What were the usual suspects actually doing there? And so it goes and that is the fun to be had. All caper movies have a twist ending, and as I mentioned earlier so does this one. I was just hoping that it would have been a tiny bit more creative than the whole, \\"Let's take the least likely ending possible and make that our ending\\" bit. A for effort, but no recommendation from me. ***humanity. <br /> <br />It is interesting that this is what started Singer's career, a career devoted pretty much to men who fly.

I doubt that it looked (or sounded) this good in the theatre.  It is not a film for everyone and I'd suggest it only for fans of Lynch.  It is mostly a very dark and slow moving film but on HD DVD, it is just magnificent!

Hail to the Thief is no exception, although it was somewhat harder for me to get into than the Bends and Ok Computer.  <br /> <br />Pros: -An excellent album with several great songs (Great songs on this album are 2+2=5, Go to Sleep, There There, Drunken Punchup at a Wedding, Where you end and I begin, Myxomatosis, and A wolf at the door.) <br />-Inventive and Unique like you would expect from Radiohead <br />-Its Radiohead <br />-A very diverse and excellent collection of songs <br /> <br />Cons: -It doesn't really flow <br />-contains some songs that are mediocre and some that are tedious <br /> <br />You have to give this album a chance because there is a lot of good stuff here. There is a good chance that you will hate this album the first time you hear it, because I did. Don't give up on it. It gets better each time you listen to it. <br /> <br />Buy this album! You won't regret it. <br />
B00005JPEG|5.0|I saw this lovely film this past week in Chicago at a preview showing and was simply delighted by it.  Only five years ago this would have been a Miramax film, but following the messy departure of the Weinsteins from Miramax to form their own production company, they are distributing this joint production.  Set in the early decades of the twentieth century, in a sort of extended Edwardian age, the film possesses a wonderful period feel and look.  Like the best of the Miramax films, it feels like a time capsule more than a contemporary production.<br /><br />With only some shame I have to admit to knowing very little about Beatrix Potter.  To inject some autobiography, I was not read Potter as a child and though after my divorce I raised my daughter, reading to her constantly, there was an agreement that on her periodic visits to her mother she would be allowed to read her Beatrix Potter (because of a Potter obsession by her own godmother) and Laura Ingalls Wilder.  I read my daughter every other children's' writer, but was forbidden to dip into either of those.  So I saw this biopic knowing next to nothing about her.  The film seemed to me to give a good impression of who she was.  She emerges in the film as a sort of timid feminist, not a activist, but quietly insisting on taking her own path.  Though there are flashbacks to her childhood and the final quarter of the film focuses on her moving to the Lake District, most of the film deals with the period of partnership and eventually romance between her and her publisher, Norman Warne.  One suspects that of necessity a great deal is left out, but as it exists it is compelling.  I did a bit of checking on the Internet and discovered that she was not 32 in 1903, so the film obviously fudges some numbers, but as presented the film still provided a delightful portrait.<br /><br />Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is wonderful in the title role.  I have seen photographs of Beatrix Potter and there does not seem to be much of a resemblance between the two.  To the film's credit, they do a great deal to de-emphasize Zellweger's loveliness.  She isn't exactly plain, but she isn't as beautiful as usual.  But she brings a delightful simplicity to her role.  Ewan McGregor is fine in his role, but unlike their unfortunate film DOWN WITH LOVE, his role is not equal to hers in this one.  He manages to be everything he needs to be.  Emily Watson plays his sister.  There are movie stars and there are actresses, and she is an actress.  I have always been amazed at much her various roles can differ from one another.  A lot of actresses, unfortunately, as they near the age of forty, have probably reached close to the end of their career.  Watson is so splendid, however, and those huge eyes so expressive, that you sense that she probably hasn't reached half of her eventual film resume.  I'm certain we'll be seeing her in roles thirty-five years from now.  It was good to see Bill Paterson as Beatrix's father.  He has always been one of my favorite supporting actors and for my money we have always seen far too little of him.  Veteran British actress Barbara Flynn is excellent as well as Beatrix's mother.<br /><br />Chris Noonan directed the film.  The last time we encountered him as a director was in one of the most delightful films of the nineties, BABE.  I have absolutely no idea what he has been up to the past decade, but this film has some of the same lush look that BABE did.  Interestingly, animals feature prominently in both films.<br /><br />The last part of the film, that centers on the beginning of the final chapter of Potter's life as a farmer in the Lake District, features some of the most stunning landscapes you can ever hope to see in a movie.  The end of the film indicates that Miss Potter left 4,000 acres of Lake District property to the National Trust.  I hope that some of those scenes were filmed on some of that property.<br /><br />Finally, I want to add that while I've never been one to beon the lookout for \\"family\\" (which to me usually are synonymous with \\"boring\\" or \\"bland\\"), this film, which could easily receive a \\"G\\" rating, is a film that any parent could feel comfortable showing any child.  Younger children might find it a bit slow, but any fan of Beatrix Potter, whether young or old, will surely enjoy this film.  Indeed, as someone who cannot count himself among her fans (entirely through a complete lack of acquaintance), I can attest that those unfamiliar with her work will love the film as well.sually are synonymous with \\"boring\\" or \\"bland\\"), this film, which could easily receive a \\"G\\" rating, is a film that any parent could feel comfortable showing any child.

B000056K04|2.0|I loved every DMB album up until this one. After 10 years of making the most profoundly wonderful music, the law of averages has finally kicked in for Dave and crew. I have been a fan since 1997 and loved everything about this band. Every album and every song was superb!  <br /> <br />This album is a HUGH departure from the tradition Dave Matthews Band that all true DMB fans know and love. This album has also made a division between old hardcore DMB fans (fans of the REAL band that includes all 5 members) and new DMB fans (the \\"I heard it on the radio and liked it\\" fans) <br /> <br />This album does not include all 5 members as Leroi and Boyd are almost non-existent leaving just the guitar, bass, and drums ie. the meat and potatoes of a band. Every band has a guitar, bass and drums making them sound just about like every other band out there. Now how many bands do you know that have a fiddle and a sax/wind instruments in them? DMB used to be one of them. You won't find the adrenaline pumping fiddle solos or the heartfelt wind work on this album. <br /> <br />Next we have Dave playing electric guitar and co-writing the majority of the songs over a weekend and boy does it show. He co-wrote these songs with the new producer Glenn Ballard who plays piano on this one as well. The only song that is a work of art lyrically is The Space Between. I also like Everyday as well only because its an evolved form of a true DMB song, #36 (Hani Hani). This one is a real treat to see live as the band will sometime play both #36 and Everyday together. <br /> <br />Yes I will say again...Dave plays an electric on this one. Big mistake going from what your traditionally known as being acoustic then going directly to electric...just ask Dylan about this one. I felt like I Did It was an assault on my ears and took my breath away and not in a good way. My jaw dropped to the floor in disbelief and I just could not believe what I was hearing. This was not Dave Matthews Band! The only song that the electric worked with was The Space Between due to it being a dark and sad ending to a relationship. GREAT poetry and lyrics to that one and that song saves the a star from being a 1/5. <br /> <br />There are a lot of reviews on here that are saying that it took a few listens before they really liked it. I believe that these are fans that are just in denial and I can't blame them. Did it take a few listens before you fell in love with this band? When I first heard Crash Into Me and Too Much I was just floored and could not believe the sounds I was hearing. Not with this so called DMB. A band with a sax and a fiddle that makes it work!!?? WOW!  <br /> <br />Take the 4 things out that make DMB, DMB and you get a mediocre any band. The 4 things that make the formula of Dave Matthews Band work are the uplifting and awe inspiring explosive fiddle solos from Boyd (Ants Marching), the emotional wind works of Leroi (Say Goodbye), Dave's lyrics (#41 and I'm not a big fan of Dave's vocals but thats on every album...I wish they would put out an all instrumental album), and the tricky timings, rhythms, and beats of Carter (#36 Live at Red Rocks), all of which pretty much do not exist on this album. <br /> <br />This is not DMB and if you do buy it at least you won't buy it under the false pretense that your buying a DMB album. Go get any other album besides this and Stand Up (which is even more disappointing then Everyday) <br /> <br />Hardcore DMB fans...you have been warned.

B00008FECG|5.0|It is only recently that I finally got a chance to view this extraordinary movie. <br />To tell you the truth I was quite surprised by this film. <br />You have to watch several times to understand all the subtleties of the exercise,because it is one,a magnificent one to booth,for so many wonderful actresses are being shown here. <br />Joan is particularly bitchy as Crystal,and I am quite sure that she didn't get extra female fans after this role. <br />Rosalind Russell gives also an exceptional performance. <br />Very enjoyable movie to watch,and plus it is possible to get it at very reasonable prices. <br />An extra-treat is the color fashion-show of Adrian beautiful creations
B0002CHIJW|2.0|I'm all for a disturbing film, but this one just made me sick to watch.  The savagery that was committed in this film and the lack of inspired and cheesy revenge made this just a complete rip off of last house on the left.  At least last house was done with some taste, some depth to the characters.  There was no merit to this movie, and the only reaosn I gave it 2 stars was becuase it did what it set out to do, which was disturb the viewer with violent images.

B000BFH2S2|5.0|This DVD is simply wonderful. Michael shows he definitely is one of the top young performers out there today. There is tremendous anticipation for his fans as they await his next production. But, for a new fan such as myself this DVD is one that I'll easily enjoy watching many times more. You really cant go wrong with this CD/DVD combo if you have any interest at all in jazz and/or big band music. I didnt think I was a fan of either until I stumbled on Michael's music. You may find yourself as a new fan too if you arent already!
B00009P1O2|5.0|This was the first concert DVD that I ever purchased and not only do the band put on an amazing show, but the special features are outstanding.  This is one of the best packaged concert DVDs ever.  Queen were one of the best live bands along with the Who, the Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin.  Knowing how many overdubs of vocals and guitar went onto almost any Queen song, you would think that it would be very difficult for the band to effectively play these songs live, but they do it and more often than not the songs sound better live.  As one would expect, the cameras are the most friendly to Freddie since he was the lead singer and in many ways the personality of the band, but Brian (probably the most down to earth), Roger (probably the funniest member), and John (probably the most quiet) get plenty of camera time.  Everyone is on fire here.  Freddie sings his heart out.  Okay, he chooses not to hit all the high notes but give the man a break.  He was ill and how could anyone expect someone to always have to sing that high every day and night on a tour.  He makes each song work without having to hit all the high notes, and Roger (and sometimes Brian) helps him out plenty with the vocals.  Speaking of Roger, he is an excellent drummer.  I think it's a factor that is often overlooked.  His drumming is amazing particularly on \\"Radio Ga Ga,\\" but also on everything else.  John is an excellent bass player.  He was probably the least visible member of the band, but this is the man who wrote their biggest song \\"Another One Bites the Dust.\\"  Brian's guitar playing is extraordinary throughout the whole show and there are plenty close ups of him playing.  Brian is such an original and inventive guitarist, and he was just as much the creative genius that Freddie was.  Hey, the man BUILT his signature guitar.  This guy is one of the best guitarists in the world.  The performances here are classic and the set list is fantastic.  Highlights include, \\"One Vision,\\" \\"Now I'm Here,\\"\\"Under Pressure,\\" \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\\" \\"Radio Ga Ga,\\" \\"Is This The World We Created,\\" \\"I Want To Break Free,\\" \\"A Kind Of Magic,\\" and of courese \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" I could keep going.  Even \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" is great and I'm not too fond of the studio version.  The sound and camera work are both great but unfortunately, the camera doesn't get a lot of shots of Brian (my favorite member) towards the end of \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" but it doesn't take away from the performance at all.  However, a nice surprise is when the band decide to insert \\"Friends Will Be Friends\\" between \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions.\\"  Brilliant and clever idea since everyone would expect those two songs to be meshed together.  The set of cover tunes is also fantastic.  You get excellent interview footage with Brian and Roger, Queen rehearsing for the concert, some footage from the Friday concert, and a multi angle feature for four songs.  This DVD is a real treat for all Queen fans or anyone who is a fan of good rock and roll music.
B000002MX7|5.0|AWE.SOME.  Now repeat a million times.  Love this CD! \\"Through the Fire\\" takes me to my knees.  Agree that it would have been absolutely perfect if \\"Sweet Thing\\" had been included.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
B00003XAQ6|4.0|While it doesn't have much to do with the music in this review, in 1995 I obtained Tears For Fears' \\"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\\" .  This was one of the best albums of the 1990s, namely because of the Spanish musical influence that was infused into a mainstream music sound.    One of the songs on \\"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\\" was an album called \\"Sketches of Pain\\".   \\"Sketches of Pain\\" was an outstanding song because of the use of classical Spanish guitar and percussion.   Part of the reason for the title of that Tears For Fears song was a play on the famous Miles Davis album, \\"Sketches of Spain\\", which was Davis' album that had music with a Spanish influence.    While Miles Davis is basically a household name, I cannot say that I was familiar with a lot of his music.    When I realized there was a connection in how Tears For Fears' \\"Sketches of Pain\\" related to Davis' Spanish Themed album, I became more curious about checking out this recording.    Without doing much research, I assumed this album would be a jazz album with a classical Spanish influence.   Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a more classical music sound that would have the Spanish theme infused. <br /> <br />\\"Sketches of Spain\\" is a collaboration between Miles Davis and Gil Evans.   Davis and Evans had begun a partnership in 1957 that saw Davis contribute his trademark horns (Trumpet and Flugelhorn) while Evans focused on the arrangements and conducting of the music.    Prior to \\"Sketches of Spain\\" there were two efforts.   The first was 1957's  \\"Miles Ahead\\" that saw Davis and Evans engage in a big band/jazz feel.  The second was 1958's \\"Porgy and Bess\\" which was an arrangement of songs from George Gershwin's opera, \\"Porgy and Bess\\".   \\"Porgy and Bess\\" also saw the combination of Davis ane Evans move toward something that had more of a classical feel to it.   I'm sure this provided a lot of the impetus for the duo to do something more in the classical space. <br /> <br />\\"Sketches ofPain\\" has its roots around Spanish Classical music.   The original 1960 release consisted of five tracks - two are covers of existing Spanish Classical works and the other three were original compositions by Evans.    The Spanish works that are covered are Joaquin Rodrigo's 16+ minute masterpiece \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\" and Manuel de Falla's \\"Will o' the Wisp\\".   Those familiar with Spanish classical music will know the names of Rodrigo and de Falla.  This collection was re-released in 2000 and consists of three additional tracks including another original composition by Evans as well as a full alternative take and alternative ending of \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\". <br /> <br />The cover songs, \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\" and \\"Will o' the Wisp\\" are going to have less of a reliance on Davis' horns.   While Davis' horns can be clearly held throughout the near 20 minutes of music that make up these songs, there is going to be a heavy reliance by the other musicians that contribute to these tracks.   When you get into the four original tracks that were composed by Gil Evans, you will hear a big difference.   The music is going to focus heavier on the trumpet and flugelhorn of Miles Davis.   As you listen to the original tracks, it is amazing how Evans was able to integrate the sound to give the entire \\"Sketches of Spain\\" album a very homogenous feel - i.e. the sound of Spanish classical music.   In particular the track, \\"Solea\\" proves to be as strong as the work by the legendary Rodrigo and de Falla.   Listen for the Spanish military-flair in the song that is the result of some terrific percussion work. <br /> <br />Another thing that really stood out was that even though this collection has very much as Spanish Classical music feel.   However there are many segments that could have easily been used as soundtrack info for a feel such as a James Bond movie.   While it wouldn't be the hard-rocking sound of Paul McCartney's \\"Live and Let Die\\", I could see parts of these tracks inJames Bond films.   A prime example of this comes from the classical \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\" piece itself.  You can also hear the \\"soundtrack\\" sound  from some of Evans' original work such as \\"Song of Our Country\\". <br /> <br />One thing that's worth noting is that while this is a Miles Davis album, much of the credit does need to go to Gil Evans.    Davis does a superb job at playing the horns, but as mentioned above, it is Evans who finds a way to give this album the homogenous sound.   It is also Evans that finds another avenue for Davis to deliver his sound.    \\"Porgy and Bess\\" opened the doors for something besides his trademark jazz sound.  \\"Sketches of Spain\\" helped take Davis to another dimension.   The music shows outstanding musicianship.  My only minor beef with this collection is that it really isn't going to make you \\"get up and dance\\".  It almost has a calm and somewhat somber quality to it. <br /> <br />This collection includes an outstanding collection of liner notes that will provide additional insight into the band.  This includes the original liner notes that appeared on the back of the album cover that were written by Nat Hernoff who was a co-editor of \\"The Jazz Review\\".    Phil Schaap provides an additional write-up (on the re-release) that discusses \\"The Making of Sketches of Spain\\".   The liner notes also include production and musician credits.    Overall, this is not going to be the place to hear classic Miles Davis jazz, however it is going to be a place to hear some outstanding Spanish-infused classical music.  This is going to provide some high quality music and if you have an appreciation for music, this is going to be something worth investing in. <br />
0307341542|4.0|Sometimes a book is just fun to read, not because it's destined to be a classic but because it carries you along on an interesting ride.  Our heroine, Camille, leads a mundane life as a reporter for a second-rate newspaper (although her boss sounds like a gem), and tries to make a name for herself by investigating a murder in her old home town.  Her familiarity with the town and its residents allows her to insinuate herself into the investigation, but the best parts of the story revolve around her relationship with her bizarre mother.  We learn more about the Camille of the here and now as she reveals her difficult past.  Okay, so the ending is kind of funky, but the bulk of the novel was a pageturner.

B00005JPE7|4.0|When the original ROCKY debued in 1976, audiences were entranced more by the man outside the ring than the fighter inside it. Sylvester Stallone played Rocky as a man who had frailties mixed in with his swatting power. We cared about him, perhaps even more so when he lost a close decision to Apollo Creed.  In the four sequels, Stallone gradually placed more emphasis on a storyline played by the numbers.  We still enjoyed his Rocky character, even if he slowly left his source of interest, his appealing mixture of inner fears masked by an indomitable will.<br /><br />In ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone comes full circle.  Both are pushing sixty, far past the age of an action star.  We can see lines in Rocky's face that are probably not the result of makeup. But what we do not see is a ridiculous figure of a man who keeps coming to a dance when he no longer can move.  We see him as a man of immense dignity, content to play greeter to patrons in his restaurant, but still grieving over the loss of his wife Adrian.  We see him embroiled in a number of relating issues. He has a son who seeks to escape the long shadow of an imposing father.  He meets Marie, a now much more mature woman whom Rocky told to give up smoking in the original ROCKY.  He meets her son with whom he tries to have the sort of relation that he cannot have with his own son.  But this is after all a ROCKY movie, and these relationships have a built in limitation.  Rocky knows there can be no romance with Marie, not with the ghost of Adrian still fresh.  Her son floats ephemerally in and out of the picture.  Rocky's son is a walk-on as well.  The focus is on Rocky being yanked out of retirement to have an exhibition match against Mason Dixon, well played by real life boxer Antonio Tarver.<br /><br />Those who find fault with ROCKY BALBOA tend to emphasize the film's admitted faults.  In an exhibition fight, the limit would be six rounds with headgear.  Mason Dixon has been blamed for being a puerile version of Clubber Lang, from ROCKY III.  Yet, Tarver is convincing as a man who has his own demons.  It is hardly his fault that he, like an earlier Rocky, has run out of worthy contenders. Tarver plays Dixon as a fighter who seeks his own place in the boxing pantheon. And against Balboa, Dixon finds a worthy if elderly opponent against whom he may measure his own greatness.<br /><br />What emerges in ROCKY BALBOA is a film that combines the best of themes that look back to past glories and places them in the context of how those glories can fit in against a man whose only glory is to dance one more time against the Astaire of the ring.  ROCKY BALBOA is a worthwhile coda for Stallone to bring to a satisfying end the saga of a club fighter who can yet entertain us even after nearly three decades.ROCKY III.

B000002KDX|5.0|America's self-titled debut CD is terrific. The number one single from it, \\"A Horse With No Name\\", has an important environmental message in the final verse, \\"Sandman\\" is very psychedelic, and the album's other hit, \\"I Need You\\", which hit number nine, is a sensitive ballad reminiscent of the early Bee Gees. The other songs, especially \\"Riverside\\", are forgotten gems, and the band members' belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug smuggling was unjustly convicted makes AMERICA an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.

Your friends will see why the green, as they read.<br /><br /> Prolific writer Vida Winter famously left out the final tale, the thirteenth, in one of her books.

B0001XAS1W|5.0|With YEAR OF THE CAT, Al Stewart enters his best period musically. He'd found a sympathetic producer in Alan Parsons, whose production added much-needed muscle to his music, while Stewart's folkie leanings prevented Parsons from overdoing things. The closing title song uses the \\"mystery woman\\" theme to describe a feeling about being slightly \\"out of your time\\", and thus describes why I hang up pictures of pretty actresses as a deterrent to thoughts of going to food-related reunions at my old school, but the other songs are also quite good. The fact that a couple of Stewart's albums have dated poorly takes nothing away from the excellence of this one or its immediate successor, TIME PASSAGES.

B000HT3Q14|3.0|This film is very much a Terry Gilliam vehicle, as his fans will easily discern upon watching this film. Apocalyptic and dark, yet visionary, the film is trademark Gilliam, with dreary, depressing sets. It is sci-fi with a time travel twist.<br /><br />The year is 2035, and the future of mankind seems grim and forbidding, as the human race is relegated to living underground, never seeing the light of day, after a killer virus has decimated its ranks. James Cole (Bruce Willis), a designated criminal, volunteers to travel into the past to obtain a sample of the virus that became a killing machine, in hopes of helping scientists discover a cure, as well as getting a pardon for his supposed crimes.<br /><br />Cole has little information with which to work. All he knows is that in 1996 he is to search for a radical group called, \\"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys\\". In some way, that group is affiliated with the deadly virus. How, why, or where are questions for which he must find the answers. Like searching for a needle in a haystack, Cole tries to piece the answers together, while trying to separate fantasy from reality. He finds it increasingly difficult to do so, as time travel begins to take a toll on him, given its erratic peculiarities.<br /><br />In his travels, he comes across the seriously disturbed Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who seems to have something to do with that for which Cole is looking. Jeffrey also happens to be the son of a scientist, Dr. Leland Goines (Christopher Plummer). Cole, mistaken for being mentally ill when he reveals his mission, comes under the care of psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Reilly (Madeleine Stowe). All of these individuals are, in some way, intertwined with his mission, but not in the way he may have originally thought. How much the past is a part of the future, and how much the future is a part of the past, is a question that the viewer must divine.<br /><br />Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance, taut and well nuanced. Madeleine Stowe is compelling as the initially doubting doctor, who later becomes a believer of Cole's apocalyptic message. The always urbane Christopher Plummer is also excellent as the scientific genius and father to the troubled Jeffrey. It is Brad Pitt, however, who steals the show as the mentally unbalanced Jeffrey Goines, giving a virtuoso performance that won him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />This film was a difficult one for me to rate, being torn between awarding it three or four stars. I finally ended up awarding it three stars. While I liked the film, I found it to be too dark and depressing for my tastes. If you are a big fan of Terry Gilliam, however, add one star to my rating.e Stowe is compelling as the initially doubting doctor, who later becomes a believer of Cole's apocalyptic message.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|It has been said that Americans tend to ignore the productions of those who oppose them politically - they prefer to consider only views that reinforce what they already believe.  From the slant of many of these reviews, it would seem the case.  This reviewer finds Mr. Gore to be one of the dullest of presenters but have to admit he makes a compelling case.  Political sound-bytes cannot discredit the evidence.  Watch it whether you happen to agree with his political views or not and see how your eyes might be openned to another side.<br /><br />Mr. Gore does a good job of defining the problem.  My own view is that there is indeed a problem but I fear Mr. Gore's solutions would be more government involvement and I think that would only make matters worse.  It is government involvement now in the form of protecting American businesses that has caused part of the problem.  Further government intervention in the free market will likely only make it worse.  The problem is real, the solution is what seems to illude us.  Yet, at least Mr. Gore is willing to be the voice of one crying in the wilderness rather than burying his head in the sand and pretending not to see.  Give him his due, watch the movie, learn from those with whom you may not entirely agree.  Then consider what the solution might be and let it guide your vote.  It may be a matter of life and death.

B000K2RD3U|5.0|Gentle Giant's fourth album has been reissued and remastered by Repertorie for CD. The remaster sounds terrific. The new version sounds better than the U.S. domestic release and is a slight improvement on the Japanese reissue that was put out in a replica of the original album sleeve a couple of years back. It's slightly warmer sounding than previous editions with quite a bit of sonic detail. Should you upgrade? To me this is the best sounding of the reissues but some people will be happy with the Japanese pressing from 2001. That edition sounds fine but for me this one wins hands down. Considering the fact that the original mastertape is well over 30 years old, that's quite an achievement. Although the person who remastered this isn't credited they've done a splendid job.<br /><br />If you don't mind the fact that the carboard sleeve isn't an exact replica of the original release, then this will be the best version to buy. Since the sound (at least to me) is more important, I'm happy with this limited edition remaster.  I've posted a copy of the original cover artwork for comparison purposes. Also, the lyrics that were on the inside of the original sleeve are missing in this redesign by Martyn Dean (brother of cover designer Roger Dean)but it would have been difficult to read them anyway.<br /><br />They will also reissuing \\"Three Friends\\" in Marchof 2007 in a remastered edition. Hopefully that edition will not have some of the sonic sloppiness that marred the Japanese re-release from last year.<br /><br />There is, however, a poster included that duplicates the original inside of the album sleeve with the original graphic (which was the cover image rendered in blue and white). Lyrics are included here (which is probably just as well as the original lyrics would have been too small to read)along with a brief essay about the band's history (similar to the other Repertorie releases).<br /><br />So should you get this if you have the previous CDs? Absolutely.The remastered sound brings this album into the 21st century on a par with some of the other top notch remasters of GG's works. If you have the Japanese edition you may want to do an A-B comparison to see which you prefer but to my mind this edition wins with a warmer slightly fuller sound. This edition is limited to ONLY 3000 copies so I'd suggesting snatching this up before it goes out of print and demands the high prices that the previous edition out of Japan did when it was released bck in 2001.<br /><br />Just an addition: There appears to be a flaw that occurs on \\"River\\" and \\"Think of Me With Kindness\\". According to Eroc (who remastered this) the flaws don't appear on the master he gave to the manufacturing plant so it appears that something happened during the process of transferring the master to CD for pressing. No word on a reissue at this time.tered sound brings this album into the 21st century on a par with some of the other top notch remasters of GG's works. If you have the Japanese edition you may want to do an A-B comparison to see which you prefer but to my mind this edition wins with a warmer slightly fuller sound.

B0000027RL|5.0|What else can I say. The most deep of the big four of grunge, they really stood apart from their peers. Eddie Vedder is a great singer, who has tons of depth that some people can't reconize.  I am glad that the band decided to stick together, because it's refreshing to see that a band like this is still putting a stop to lame psuedo-grunge bands like Creed and Nickellame.  Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, and Nirvana can't touch this.
B000HT3P7E|4.0|I love this show.  I really, really do.  I've seen every episode countless times and I like my Monday nights uninterrupted so that I don't miss a moment.  But this season set is kinda crummy.  Sure, it has a lot of commentary, but things are missing here.<br /><br />First of all, full screen instead of wide screen?  Major flaw.  I saw the episodes in widescreen format originally, so I'm not used to this full screen presentation.  There's no reason I can see why this set is not in widescreen.<br /><br />Secondly, and I'm sure it has to do with money and copyrights, but a TON of music in the season is changed.  Nada Surf's \\"Inside of Love\\" from \\"The Slutty Pumpkin\\"?  Yeah, gone.  And that song fit the ending for the episode so perfectly.  The song in its place doesn't do the moment justice.  Additionally, Chumbawamba's \\"Tubthumper\\" is eliminated from the scene where the group eats in Lily's apartment/Chinese restaurant.  Sure, the Belle and Sebastian song and others that were written into the script are there, but it seems like everything else is changed.  CBS: If you're going to put a song in an episode for when it airs and don't plan on getting the rights to it for the DVD, don't put it in at all!  I still have a couple of episodes left to watch from the set, and I sure hope that the song at the end of the finale isn't gone...
B00005OCMR|5.0|My son (8) quite enjoyed watching this movie, but probably I wanted to see it more having enjoyed it at the movies back in 1982. The actual film doesn't seem any better than I remember it in terms of picture quality, although apparently Wendy (Walter) Carlos's film score has been recovered as the original analogue master tapes had badly degraded. This 20th anniversary edition also has a second DVD of stills, inspirational designs by artists Syd Mead, Peter Lloyd and Jean \\"Moebius\\" Giraud, and a new 88 minute documentary `The making of TRON' that is far more interesting to adults than kids. The documentary goes on a bit but has cast interviews etc. and is worth a view. Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner (TRON) are very good considering they were the first to act against a blue screen for mostly the whole movie. David Warner is excellent as MCP and Sark, reprising his equally superb role as The Evil Genius in The Time Bandits (1981). Peter O'Toole had turned down his role (as he didn't fancy acting against a blue screen). TRON is actually a Hewlett Packard BASIC simple debugging command of the period, and stands aptly for \\"Trace On\\". So as we all know, \\"That's TRON. He fights for the users\\". Let's hope he's still out there. Interestingly, first use of the term `Users' has been credited to this influential movie.  <br /> <br />A sequel called TRON 2.0 was in the works, but only the visually outstanding computer game version was released in 2003. Despite it's innovation, on release TRON did relatively badly in the cinema (where it looked at its best), and ironically the well received TRON arcade game spin-offs made the most profit. Rumour has it that traditional Disney animators refused to work on this movie because they feared that computers would put them out of business. In fact, 22 years later Disney closed its hand-drawn animation studio in favour of CGI animation, following the rise of Pixar. TRON wasn't considered for an academy award for `animation' at the time,as it was felt that computer aided design cheated (it was nominated for both Best Costume and ironically Sound). In the \\"solar sail-ship\\" sequence, look out and see, for a brief moment, the cross-hatched silhouette of Mickey Mouse on the ground made to look like part of the terrain.  <br /> <br />So the films worth owning as an historical cinema milestone, although the plot was a bit ahead of its time as many preteen boys, the target audience, naturally weren't quite so into computers and game consoles back then, and arcade games tended to be in 18+ locations. However it s well worth another watch, and the storyline can still hold most boys attention for one viewing (try renting if you don't want to buy even at this knock down price). The film is clearly the grand daddy of the films like Spy Kids III and Scooby and the Cyber Chase, and is probably better than both.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Although I was born 8 years after this CD came out. Michael Jackson's Off the Wall is one CD I recommended to younger crowd. However, my favorite song of all is \\"Get on the Floor.\\" Every time I play this song I always get up and groove. The only one song I don't like on this album is \\"She's out of My Life.\\" Every time I hear this song I begin to roll my eyes. Although Michael Jackson doesn't look me any more and always in the media. I always love him and his music!!
B000IAZPKM|5.0|This concert DVD is an absolutely masterpiece. A total must buy. Kamelot is maybe the best metal band out there at the moment. They deserve all the success. Buy this inmediately and you will understand why.
079073320X|5.0|It's a beautiful movie. The search for extraterrestrial life is combined with a search for romance and a father, who has passed away.<br /><br />Even the former president Bill Clinton appears. I wonder how they did this... Perhaps they simply invited him to be a star in the movie.<br /><br />The movie tries to ride on the fame of the president, and on the fame of Adolf Hitler too.<br /><br />Well, I identify with what one of the guys says in the movie:<br /><br />\\"1) If there is intellignt life in the universe, it is probably too far<br /><br />  away and we can't get in touch with it<br /><br /> 2) It's possible that there actually is no other life form in space.\\"<br /><br />For me, it is clear: there is nothing in space, that wants to talk to us.<br /><br />But the movie is enjoyable anyhow.<br /><br />The special effects are as good as they should be,<br /><br />although there is a vibrational space travel scene, which is somewhat annoying.<br /><br />Jodie Foster plays a very driven and ambitious research scientist,<br /><br />so she conveys the hope of finding extraterrestrial intelligence to us<br /><br />in a very sincere way.
B0000035E7|2.0|<br />Nirvana was NOT the original band to pull grunge out of the popluations' pockets. Bleach was an underground compilation that was never publicized until later. Alice In Chains, though, hit the radio waves 11 months before Nirvana did, with \\"Facelift\\", which was released on August 28, 1990, while Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" was released on September 24, 1991. So who can honestly prove that Nirvana was the origin of grunge???
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Simply put - if you haven't seen this movie, see it. It's set in the future, but is really a commentary on the current state of the world. Amazingly filmed and a real pleasure to watch. <br /> <br />The DVD is great - I whip it out for a watch whenever there's nothing else interesting on.
B000I0QK74|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of Christmas music -- it is in my top 5 all-time favorite Christmas CDs.  If you want to feel the beautiful spirit of Christmas all around, build a fire, sip your favorite Christmas beverage, and enjoy the ride.  If \\"the secret of life is enjoying the passing of time,\\" this is a great way to spend some of it.
B000IU3XTM|3.0|Unless of course you want to delve deeper into depression.  You have been warned!<br /><br />To be quite honest with you, this CD didn't live up to my expecatations.  There are some hauntingly beautiful songs on here, but as a whole, it's missing something...doesn't quite flow.  It's not all bad though: I love Damien's voice and his collaboration with Lisa Hannigan - they sound absolutely great together.<br /><br />So, if I had to listen to this or some other folksy singer like, let's say, James Blunt, then I'd listen to this hands down...even if I was depressed as h*ll.  Even though 9 doesn't live up to its predecessor, it's still better than 90% of the garbage out there.<br /><br />Peace out.
B00005JKDR|3.0|Enough has been said about Monsters Inc.'s content and what the story is all about in all the other reviews. The three stars are all and only for the movie itself (mostly the outstanding story). <br />Why, one must ask, does the DVD not feature equal technical possibilities as known from other recently issued DVDs? <br />The cinema version was in wide screen, why is there only a 4:3 version on the DVD and no (e.g.) 16:9 version? This mishap (or deliberately by professional philistines?) costs TWO stars!
0316743003|5.0|This book is a gem on many levels: <br />1) On the history and development of spy planes: This has been covered by many previous reviews on this book. So, I won't write more here. <br /> <br />2) On creativity: There are a lot of books on creativity. Many of them are trivial. Most are written by people who themselves have not design or deliver noteworthy innovations that are of national or international significance. This book is different. It is written by a person who has contributed innovations at, and even run Skunk Works, which has delivered innovation after innovation that are internationally significant. <br /> <br />How does a smart scientist or engineer determine if an organization is a place of major technical inventions? This book tells you the characteristics of such organizations. How do you organize and run a place that can deliver breakthrough innovations at bargain prices? This book gives you the principles on how to do it correctly. <br /> <br />3) On cold war and patriotism: This book gives you a glimpse into the cold war, and the hair-triggering tension of nuclear war between U.S. and the ex-Soviet Union. Also, it shows the patriotism among the U.S. government officials, top military echelons, pilots, and civilian scientists and engineers. Even more, it shows how Skunk Works' technologies tipped the power towards the U.S. <br /> <br />4) On biographies: This book is a partial and vivid biography of both Kelly Johnson and Ben Rich. Their personal traits, both strengths and flaws, are clearly described. <br /> <br />5) On Navy's major shortcomings: Kelly's fifteenth principle of rather to starve than to deal with the Navy is nothing short of astonishment. The descriptions of the Navy's sticking to Aegis frigate rather than Skunk Works' SWATH ship, and preferring traditional submarines rather than stealth submarines are so, so astounding. Right now, U.S. has the world's greatest naval power. U.S. naval power could have been much, much greater and thecost to the tax payers could have been much, much lower cost if the Navy had adopted stealth technologies from Skunk Works. <br /> <br />6) On the harmful effects of government interferences, wastes and bureaucratic madness: Reading this book and you can understand why we spend so much in defense and get so little in return. <br /> <br />Overall, this book deserves more than 5 stars. It should be read by CEOs and CTOs (Chief Technology Officer) of every major and high tech corporation looking for ways to leapfrog the competitions. It should be read by every Secretary of Defense and officers in high military echelons looking for military technologies to surpass other nations. It should be read by every bright scientists and engineers looking for a place to work where major innovations can be produced. It should be read by every science and engineering professors on how to educate future generations of science and engineering students that can create and innovate. <br />
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce is the epitomy of what a true performer, artist, and song writer should be. This CD has put her in a catergory all by herself. What I love about this album is that she has choosen a wide variety of sounds. She didnt stick to what she is known for. And she did them all well. You can ride to the whole album without skipping any songs. You can dance, you can cry, and you also can relate. The grammys for this album was well deserved and the respect needs to be given when her name is called. I would love to meet her and tell her I am truly a fan. In concert she definalety knows how to work the stage as well as the crowd. I cant wait for her to go back on the road so I can dance and sing along.
B00005QGAT|5.0|...awful cover on this special edition.<br /><br />Buyers realize that record companies do want to make visible distinctions between original releases and re-mastered editions, but to make as drastic a change as this one borders on sacrilege.<br /><br />The original back cover is a shot of Jackson sporting a modest Afro, a killer smile, and the nose that he was born with. This special edition has a photo that comes closer to being the Michael from the \\"Thriller\\" days, a few years from \\"Off the Wall.\\"<br /><br />The Epic record executive that authorized this \\"travesty\\" should be severely reprimanded.<br /><br />That said, \\"Off the Wall\\" is a more consistent album than its successor, the mega-selling \\"Thriller.\\" Besides the chart-toppers (\\"Rock with You,\\" \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\\" and \\"She's Out of My Life), the \\"B-sides\\" are A1!<br /><br />\\"Workin' Day and Night,\\" \\"Get on the Floor,\\" the title cut, and the Stevie Wonder-influenced \\"I Can't Help It\\" are as vibrant today as they were over a quarter century ago.<br /><br />The bonus features on this edition can be, for the most part, avoided.<br /><br />Anyway, it is the music that counts and it's here in spades.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|The cd is obviously not real.  I used to own the exact same cd and it was completely different.  The cover was printed on a cheap printer.  DON'T GET SUCKERED LIKE I DID!
0783226845|5.0|This is a great movie and Al Pacino certainly does a great job of playing a difficult and enigmatic character.  I particularly like the ending where the Colonel brings forward his best qualities that are laying dormant for much of the movie.  If you are familiar with Enneagram types, this character is an Enneagram Eight.  This type is known to have a gruff exterior, a fear of vulnerability, but a very big heart.<br /><br />There is a lot of drama, funny moments and a plot that will hold anyone's attention.  The movies makes the point of the importance of good character and points out a lot of the hypocricy of contemporary society in both direct and indirect ways.  Also, this movie is interesting because of the struggles with uncertainty, ambiguity, the problems of being human and the problems inherent in living up to high ideals.<br /><br />The young companion of the Colonel also does a great job in this movie.  As the plot develops, a significant and moving relationship forms.  This is a nice inspirational, humorous and entertaining movie.  How can you really miss with Al Pacino?!
B000003TAR|5.0|A number of punk recordings in my cd collection became irrelevant after I first heard this recording: one of the most intense, high-energy, angst ridden, and poetic recordings of all-time. I prefer the sound production of this recording much more than the more mersh sounding Nevermind. On one hand there is more noise and distortion, but on the other it has the feel of a good live album in which I'm sitting in the first row if not on stage. Usually the production goal is to make a band sound note-perfect slick and polished, but Steve Albini seemed to be going for \\"clarity of raw noise and sound\\", if that makes any sense. It worked! Rhythmically, Dave Grohl and Chris Novelesic just play incredibly fast and heavy throughout.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I was as upset as anyone when the series ended, and by the way it ended. Too many loose ends, unanswered questions, plot holes, etc. Having said that, there has never been a series as intriguing, exciting, and enthralling as Alias. I bought seasons 1-4 as they became available and watched them at least 5 times each. I was not the least bit hesitant to buy the boxed set when it first went on pre-order. I would have liked more extras, but what it has are great.  <br />If you didn't really follow the series when is was broadcast, do yourself a favor and watch it on DVD. If you already are a fan you probably already have other DVD sets. Do YOURSELF a favor and buy the boxed set. <br /> <br />Another word for the true fans. Okay, I became an Alias addict as soon as the first episode aired. I am such an addict that I am writing an Alias novel as therapy after the series ended leaving so many plot holes and unanswered questions. So, I was shocked when I recently watched season one DVD's of The Pretender, which aired from 1996-2000 (ending 1 year before Alias aired). I was totally blown away by the following similarities between the two shows. And since The Pretender came first, it was Alias which copied ideas from The Pretender. <br /> <br />Here is my list of similarities between The Pretender and Alias- just from the first few episodes of The Pretender: <br />1- A young boy is at a center where he's being studied and his special abilities are being groomed for use by some secret group (Alias tie- Project Christmas), 2-he builds a tall building out of an erector set(Project Christmas wooden block puzzle)demonstrating his abilities. 3-The man who is directing this use of the boy is a Dr. named Sydney (Alias main character name), 4-who is played by the actor who played Dr. DeSantis in Alias. 5-The boy grows up in the center and eventually escapes. He goes into hiding from this powerful organization, taking on a new alias each week and using his abilities to right wrongs (like Sydney in Alias- see #24). 6-He is a combination of the Sydney Bristow and Marshall Flinkman Character on Alias. 7-The main character is trying to find out who he really is and what happened to his real parents(Alias-Sydney and her mother,Irina). 8-Familiar Alias type phrases, one of which is \\"decide whether you are going to be a scientist (spy) or a mommy- you can't be both,\\" the female lead says to Dr. Sydney\\"(very similar to what Irina told Sydney about being a spy and a mother in the last season of Alias). 9-Jerrod speaks many languages (Sydney does too). 10-He flies airplanes(Sydney does too). 11-Jennifer Garner (Sydney in Alias) once guest starred in The Pretender(2 years before Alias aired), playing a character named Billie VAUGHN(her boyfriend in Alias was named Michael VAUGHN). 12-The actor playing Jerrod is MICHAEL WEISS(as in Alias characters MICHAEL Vaughn and another main character, ERIC WEISS), while the name of the actor who plays the creepy bad guy at the Centre trying to hunt down Jerrod is named Richard MARCUS (as in Alias character MARCUS Dixon).13-The female lead, Miss Parker, who is teamed up with Dr. Sydney is a hard, driven, ruthless Alias character Irina Derevko. 14-Some of the graphics in The Pretender are Rambaldi(mysterious 15th century Alias character)-esc. 15-There is a black female director at the Centre(Alias tie- Director Chase at CIA). 16-Sydney Bristow's mother, Irina, was unquestionably the power behind much of the evil in Alias- Miss Parker's father is the head of the Centre. 17-When Miss Parker was young her mother supposedly killed herself, but as the show progresses Parker discovers that her father may have killed her, or that she may actually still be alive (Alias- very like Irina). 18-In one episode the bad guy boss of a law firm is named Mr. Sloane(name of main Alias bad guy for 5 seasons). 19-In the same episode a guy wrongly accused of a murder has the first name Marcus (again, Alias- Marcus Dixon). 20-Sloane goes to jail (also in Alias). 21- Last line spoken to Mr. Sloane in that episode at the end of that episode of The Pretender-\\"Now you have all the time in the world.\\" (Same last line said to Mr.Sloane in Alias).22- A recurring number holds the key to a mystery behind the Centre- SL-27 (Alias- #47). 23- Dr. Sydney, who feels responsible for his brother's death, speaks to his brother, who appears to him from beyond the grave(Alias- Nadia, Sloane's daughter whose death he is responsible for, appears to him from beyond the grave). 24- They start each episode of The Pretender explaining that the main character is a Pretender- a genius with the ability to become anyone he wishes. That is the essence of creating an effective alias- something Sydney Bristow did every week. In fact, she explained to another Alias character that to pull off an alias you have to become that person. So, the essence of being a Pretender is the same as creating an Alias. <br /> <br />Alias was a GREAT series, but I have never heard anyone address how heavily it was influenced by The Pretender.
B000FQ4M58|3.0|Meat Loaf's entire career is somewhat of a joke--he has spent 30 years as a musician and released two important albums that were completely controlled by Jim Steinman (even though Steinman did not receive producing credit on \\"Bat out of Hell,\\" his presence is clearly seen in the liner notes and felt in the sound of the music). <br /> <br />However, Meat Loaf apparently thinks that the magic isn't in his collaboration with Steinman but in the titles, since he went ahead with a \\"Bat out of Hell III\\" album in spite of Steinman's refusal to be involved.  And Steinman's presence is sorely missed. <br /> <br />The album is essentially made up of four classes of songs:  The metal songs, the lower-tier Steinman songs, the true Steinman masterpieces, and the pop songs.  The metal songs are dull, lifeless, and bordering on embarrassing (and considering Nikki Sixx's presence, not surprising)--covering up one of rock's most powerful and distinctive voices with pure guitar crunch that a four-year-old could write and play.  The lower-tier Steinman songs (none of which were written for the album) have a similar feel to the \\"Dead Ringer\\" album--as though they are ideas that Steinman had but decided weren't good enough and moved on from.  The Steinman masterpieces (\\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now,\\" \\"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be,\\" \\"Bad for Good,\\" and \\"Cry to Heaven\\"--again, none written for the album) certainly pick up the album, though in all cases there are stronger earlier versions of the songs, thus leaving the usually definitive Meat Loaf versions as disappointments.  However, the real saving grace of the album is a group (\\"Alive,\\" \\"What about Love,\\" and \\"Cry over Me\\") of catchy pop tunes punched up with string arrangements and the odd power chord--which are truly excellent, following in the tradition of the best non-Steinman Meat Loaf outings such as Diane Warren's \\"I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth)\\" by only loosely touching on Steinman's style instead of attemptingto copy it directly. <br /> <br />The most interesting moment on the album is, without question, \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now,\\" when Meat Loaf apparently confronts the legend of Steinman head-on by tackling one of Steinman's best, most difficult, most popular songs without him at the helm.  (And, by the way, Steinman wrote the song in the mid-'80s and would not let Meat Loaf sing it, so he did not write it with Meat Loaf in mind.)  The surprising part is that it actually works.  Meat Loaf's rearrangement of the song as a duet is inspired and wonderfully interesting, making for at least an improvement on the watered-down Celine Dion version but not quite reaching the majesty of the original Pandora's Box recording (I think the song still hasn't reached its full potential, so hopefully there's another one coming sometime in the future). <br /> <br />Overall, Meat Loaf is in very fine voice--the finest of his career, in fact--but Steinman's absence leaves the album as nothing more than a high-quality non-Steinman Meat Loaf album along the lines of \\"Welcome to the Neighborhood.\\"  The album is definitely not worthy of its title, but it's not as bad as I feared and in fact it works out to be a decent album.  Highlights:  \\"It's All Coming back to Me Now,\\" \\"Alive,\\" \\"Cry to Heaven.\\"

If you are imbued with any inkling of environmental consciousness and sense of responsibility, watching this documentary, minimally, should cause you to reconsider your energy consumption habits and even make some small change, however it also has the potential to inspire you to greater heights - and therein is the beauty and strength of this film.

1577311523|4.0|Eckhart Tolle has mainly one message in this book, which is Q and A format, based on what he says are the questions usually asked of a spiritual teacher. The title says it all: his message is that we should live in \\"the now\\" and not in the past or future. He echoes the thinking of other spiritual traditions in urging us to silence the chatter in our heads and instead, be \\"fully present\\" in each moment.<br /><br />His teaching reminds me of the concepts of Gurdjieff, which are much more complex and well-developed than the simple presentation in this book. A good introduction to Gurdjieff's teaching is Charles T. Tart's book, Waking Up, which I recently read. The Gurdjieff teaching is that most people are \\"asleep,\\" their minds too busy with internal chatter to be present in the moment, too busy tending their \\"false personalities\\" to find their deeper selves.<br /><br />Despite its simplicity of message, Tolle's book is helpful because he is essentially correct in stressing \\"the power of now.\\" He also makes clear that spiritual ideas cannot be learned on an intellectual level, but must be felt and experienced. You cannot feel the connectedness of all things while your mind is busy fretting about yesterday and worrying about tomorrow. Tolle draws on many spiritual traditions and freely quotes Jesus, often giving new and refreshing interpretations.<br /><br />Sprinkled throughout his answers are mentions of a coming shift in consciousness for the human race and references to a growing number of humans who are enlightened. I found these references a little jarring and off-topic. He does not say how he knows this shift will happen. I'll acknowledge that if all people lived \\"in the moment\\" it would eliminate a lot of scheming and plotting of one group against another; if everyone felt fully connected to everything in the universe, we would stop destroying our planet and learn to get along. And as much as I love the whole idea of the human race shifting into a higher level of consciousness (a higher vibration, if you will), I think this is in the nature of speculation and does not immediately serve the purpose of helping me and you experience the power of now. In fact, whenever Tolle goes off his essential message, he makes less sense. What you can take from the book is this: practice living in the present and silence the chatter in your head and you will be at peace.level of consciousness (a higher vibration, if you will), I think this is in the nature of speculation and does not immediately serve the purpose of helping me and you experience the power of now.

He also gives tips on gear, software, paper and everything else related to digital photography.  His first chapter on Getting Really Sharp Photos will improve the quality of your photos tremendously, even if you've been taking photos for a couple decades as I have.

B00005V3Z4|1.0|I went into this movie with no preconceived notions, having read only the DVD case and nothing else.<br /><br />I like a film that challenges the viewer to find their own meaning and doesn't just blatantly spell out every little nuance...<br /><br />But there is a big difference between a movie that challenges the viewer and one that just throws disjointed and half realized notions at you, and then expects you to make some kind of cohesive sense out of it.<br /><br />I liken this film to being given a box of interestingly shaped and coloured puzzle pieces, which then, fail to actually fit together in the end.<br /><br />The film, The Jacket, did the whole time travel/twist on reality thing much better, even though it too asked the audience to stretch their imagination and use their minds, but the difference is, that this puzzle was solvable, as all of the pieces given, in the end, fell into place, and yielded something.<br /><br />Granted, that something might be different for each individual, but the point here is that something could be made of all of the pieces given.<br /><br />But with Donnie Darko, the end result was more like a who done it, where the killer turns out to be someone who just suddenly popped up in the last 2 seconds of the film, a cheat, if you like.<br /><br />Anyone can take a bunch of interesting concepts and throw them into a film, and tell the audience to figure it out for themselves, but that doesn't make it a good film, just a bunch of interestingly shaped and coloured puzzle piece that fail to actually fit together in the end.<br /><br />The emperor's new clothes, is what this film is trying to sell, but I'm not buying.
B00006IU73|3.0|Pink Floyd wannabee's with a touch of Radiohead and a pinch of Dream Theater. Sounds good but it's not. It just leaves you wanting something better. Just listen to Symphony X. The most irritating thing about this one is you would also hear touches of Justin Timberlake like vocals or phrasing but very faint which is a no no for prog rock listeners. Genesis with Gabriel did not sound boy bandish not a bit and so does the Alan Parsons Project when they try to sing the queit notes and harmonies..but this one really does. Listen to Dream Theater Instead.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|Synopsis: John (Matthew Settle), a recently laid off history teacher from the United States, follows a series of synchronistic events which lead to a remote area in the Peruvian rainforest. Upon arrival he finds romance, adventure and a new way of perceiving reality based on 9 mystical insights that may bring to fruition the next step in mankind's spiritual evolution.<br /><br />Based on the best selling novel by James Redfield, `The Celestine Prophecy' ('05) is an engaging film with some of the most beautiful scenic cinematography I've seen in quite some time. I was also impressed by the cast which delivers strong, heartfelt performances, doing their utmost best to provide an enjoyable evening of entertainment along with their spiritual message.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this film is first and foremost an instructional tool for New Age teachings on the nature of spirituality and the method of reconnecting with divine energy. So if you're not sympathetic or open to the message you probably won't stick it out to the end. I recommend you give it a chance, you might learn something.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban's third album is as good as the first two.  Some of the songs are not typical Josh Groban, something I didn't expect, but still enjoyable just the same.  Some of my absolute favorites...\\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\"-so inspring, \\"February Song\\"-simply amazing, Mai, In Her Eyes, Un Giorno Per Noi, Lullaby, and Weeping.  Truth be told, this CD is fabulous.  I've listened several times and I truly enjoy every song.  Great job once again Josh!
B000J103PC|1.0|No character development whatsoever.  Entirely predictable plot.  The writing like a first play, from talented high school senior.     Compare it with a film with complex characters for whom crises of integrity genuinely matter.  Like \\"Magnolia,\\" for example.  Or \\"All That Jazz.\\"  Films like that are chocolate cake.  This is a Twinkie.    Meryl Streep is a great actor.  Too bad she's not in it.  What a shame.
0345452585|4.0|I really enjoy reading Jonathan Kellerman's novels, and THE CONSPIRACY CLUB was no different.  This novel, however, does not feature Dr. Alex Delaware, the protagonist of most of Kellerman's books.  It is instead a standalone novel featuring a much younger (and troubled) protagonist, 32-year old Dr. Jason Carrier.<br /><br />This novel is much slower paced than the Delaware books, and takes a long time to get started.  The \\"mystery\\" in this book is also impossible to solve because Kellerman withholds key information until the last minute.  So if you're looking for a tightly written plot that plays fair with the reader, you may be dissatisfied with THE CONSPIRACY CLUB.<br /><br />Still, this novel is fun because Kellerman's writing is so good.  I found the dialogue and descriptions in THE CONSPIRACY CLUB to be first-rate.  Most of the characters in this book strike me as real people, flawed but decent.  The romantic relationship that develops in this book is very well done.  The descriptions of the day-to-day routine of a psychologist at a large hospital are fascinating to read and sound true-to-life.<br /><br />This novel doesn't entirely work as a thriller, but I enjoyed it for what it was.  If you like Kellerman's style of writing, THE CONSPIRACY CLUB is a good choice.  I give him credit for trying something different.  On the other hand, if you're trying Kellerman for the first time, I would recommend his early Alex Delaware books instead, because they are much more exciting and fast-paced.<br /><br />Three and a half stars.

0440241588|3.0|THE BROKER isn't much of a thriller.  However, it is enjoyable for what it is: a story about an American man suddenly dumped in Bologna, Italy, and trying to make his way through a culture very different from his own.  John Grisham is an enjoyable writer, and I liked his descriptions of Italian life and culture.<br /><br />The spy plot is pretty negligible here, and I didn't believe it for a minute.  If you're looking for a tightly written suspense story, you won't find it here.  There are MANY scenes in this book featuring the main character taking language lessons, touring Italy, etc.  These scenes are well written, but pretty much stop the momentum of the suspense story.  The book is therefore relatively slow paced for a Grisham book.<br /><br />Still, this book was fun to read, and an enjoyable way to pass the time if you like Grisham's writing style, which I do.  I thought THE BROKER was better than THE LAST JUROR and THE KING OF TORTS, because I found the subject matter (Italy) more interesting than those books.<br /><br />I therefore give this novel a mild recommendation.  THE BROKER is decent entertainment, although not nearly as good as Grisham's earlier work.  If you're looking for a fast-paced thriller, my advice is to look at the work of newer writers like Lee Child, Michael Connelly, Harlan Coben or Joseph Finder.

B00005JPDS|4.0|Starring Will Smith, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a highly recommended film about Chris Gardner's rise from homeless, medical equipment salesman to Wall Street stockbroker.<br /><br />Far from the typical Hollywood feel-good film, this isn't the sweet, happy tale the commercials and trailers promise.  Instead THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is the dark story of an intelligent man whose entire life falls apart after a series of bad decisions and unfortunately timed consequences.<br /><br />As it begins we viewers know that everything will eventually turn out joyfully, but never does director Gabriele Muccino spare us the pains of this single father.  Instead we are left in our seats, cringing for two hours as Gardner faces a biblical struggle to be a caring, loving father while living in a homeless shelter and trying to get a job at a competitive San Francisco brokerage house.<br /><br />Radical for a big Hollywood film, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is surprisingly pro-American and pro-capitalism.  As Smith himself has noted in countless interviews, this is a true story that never could have happened in any other country.  Though no one could ever say that Gardner had an easy time, the film shows how one man succeeded in changing his life through his own intelligence and hard work.<br /><br />Recommended to those who appreciate rags-to-riches stories, this film can be appreciated on many other levels.  First it offers a sympathetic look at an African-American man who is determined to be a hero in his own life and in the rearing of his only child, played by Smith's real life eight-year old son Jaden.<br /><br />Second, the film is visually interesting because its set designers and costumers are obsessive in their accurate depiction of the home d&eacute;cor and clothing styles of the early 1980s.  Third and most importantly, the film promotes a view of African-American men that we never see on TV, in newspapers or in other films.<br /><br />My only quibble, and the reason I cannot give THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS five stars is that the actions and motivations of Gardner's wife, played by Thandie Newton, are not fully explained.  There has to be a reason that she left her son to live with his homeless father, while she moved to another state.  Unfortunately the filmmaker never revealed it.<br /><br />--- Regina McMenaminon I cannot give THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS five stars is that the actions and motivations of Gardner's wife, played by Thandie Newton, are not fully explained.

B00006I53S|5.0|A very nice upgrade from the kit lens that comes with the rebel xt or xti. Focusing is fast and accurate also the ring allows you to tune the focus when needed. Lens is not to heavy, I spent 2 days walking around disneyland with this lens and had no issues. Image stabilization is a nice feature to reduce camera shake but it does not stop action in low light, only a faster lens will do that(f/2.8 or f/1.8).. I almost always have this lens mounted on my camera, the kit lens is history.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|A witty script, wonderful costumes, unbelievable scenery - this should have been a very enjoyable period film, especially since Gerard Butler is on the screen for the majority of the time.  But once Sarah Polley opens her mouth, the film goes flat.  I cannot believe she was the best of what was available for the role.  I am thankful that her involvement is minimal.

B000C65Z1G|1.0|One of 2005 most disappointing films. Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles had made before the great gangster film \\"Cidade do Deus\\" about the brutal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. So expectations were high for his second film. Alas, he choose as its material a recent novel by John Le Carre, an exciting writer of spy novels in the 60s and 70s, but someone who has since the 90s been very disappointing in his work, turning the moral ambiguity of his earlier books into shrill indictments of the West in his later ones (not that he does not have a few points here and there in those books). So, from this unpromising material, Meirelles has made a truly awful movie. Basically, the plot is about a timid British diplomat (Ralph Fiennes) trying to solve the murder of his activist wife in Kenya (Rachel Weisz, playing an insufferably smug individual). Fiennes character eventually finds that she was on the track of evil western pharmaceutical companies testing new drugs on African patients without obtaining their fully informed consent - not Africa's most pressing issue. What is most disturbing about this movie, though, is that Africans are basically used as props, useful for the filmmakers to show their superior moral status over other whites. Africans are at most exotic objects here, not subjects of their own lives. You never get to hear their own voices in this film. <br />

0767805712|5.0|This is very innovative science fiction. It is just so intriguing not only in its central theme but as a very interesting story filled with many fascinating character complexities and interactions. Once you start watching this movie you cannot turn away from it.  Once you see it scenes keep coming back to you for several days. It is that engrossing. I wanted to watch it again the next day. It is so different and appealing. I wish this DVD was in widescreen but honestly the film is so good that you just look beyond that. There is a certain intimacy about this film that I can't seem to describe  but it just captures you.

The songs have Sarah's signature sound stamped on them, and provide a very relaxing, and enjoyable listening experience. This is a great CD to put on, snuggle up in front of the tree and just sit back and enjoy!
0618680004|5.0|I live in a country where you have to have religion. You somehow can't choose not to have a religion. We only have major religions, and sects are not allowed.

I felt like reading Erick Von Daniken for the first time so many years ago.

B00005V4O5|5.0|Honestly, the music on this album is so moving, so inventive, so unique, that trying to explain it to someone is almost futile. You would benefit yourself immensely if you just stopped reading my review right now and immediately bought this album.<br /><br />This music does not easily fall into any category, but if you are a fan of progressive rock/metal, alternative, classical, or just a music fan in general, then you NEED this album. If I had to choose one word to describe the sound it would be EPIC.<br /><br />The first track 'Of Two Beginnings' gives you an idea of the diversity, emotion, and complexity that will captivate your ears when listening through the entire album. Starting with a mellow, eery mood and Daniel's soft melodic vocals beginning the story of this concept album, not even a minute into the song the atmosphere changes dramatically with the vocals becoming a deeper emotional yell backed by pounding riffs, various background vocals, and wailing guitars - within 2 minutes the song is back to a mellow mood again before immediately taking you into the next song with a loud melodic guitar piece that almost makes you cry.<br /><br />The entire album is full of climactic mood changes, intelligent lyrics, and unpredictable complex song arrangments that defy normality. The drumming, keyboards, strings, vocals, and other sounds are arranged in such perfect beauty that the listener can only sit in wonder and amazement at the quality of sound coming forth from their speakers.<br /><br />My personal favorite track is 'Trace of Blood', an epic 8 minute tale of a couple's emotions over having a miscarriage, full of great guitar work and hauntingly moving vocals. 'Dryad of the Woods' is a beautiful 5 minute instrumental piece that has just as much emotion as any of the songs accompanied by Daniel's broad vocal range. There is no bad song on this album, and one song runs into the other making a complete musical masterpiece.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: Do yourself a favor and buy not only this album, but every POS release. If you have to choose one more to buy after 'Remedy Lane' then purchase 'The Perfect Element 1' - another masterpiece, but you cannot go wrong with any music by this band. The new album 'Scarsick' is coming out next month!ut every POS release.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|At seven dollars this movie is a steal.  Michael Mann is a meticulous filmmaker and he has done great work creating a sleek, economical thriller.  Tom Cruise is crisp and kinetic as the incisive and very efficient hitman Vincent.  Jamie Foxx in particular impressed me with his turn as the sympathetic but flawed cabbie caught in Cruise's orbit.  The character of Jada Pinkett Smith is something of a device, though she makes the most of her time on screen.  There is a scene between her and Foxx at the beginning of the film that has a really great vibe.  The dialog throughout is smart, tight and at times darkly funny.  As many reviews have pointed out, the cinematography is striking.  Mann has a keen ear and an uncanny knack for marrying music and imagery on film, and I so liked the soundtrack to this movie that I bought it (a first for me).  There are a couple of implausibilities, but nothing unforgivable.  The bonus features are very good and a director's cut would have been icing on the cake.  Worth it at twice the price.
B00005JPDJ|5.0|I saw this movie last nignt and loved it! I can't say enough good things about it. The entire cast was great. I think Kate Winslet is a wonderful actress who doesn't get the credit she deserves and Cameron Diaz is great as well. I really was not much of a Jude Law fan until last night. I think I fell in love with him and now I see why everyone thinks he is so hot. Jack Black was also very good in this movie. His performance was very funny and somehow heartfelt. If you are looking for a feel good kind of movie that is funny and also romantic you should definitely go see this. I would go see again.
B00005JPDY|5.0|The Good Shepherd is a very very good film that I would be reluctant to recommend to many because despite it having a fictionalized history of the genesis of the CIA as its setting, and its cold look at real spycraft, it is really a very quiet and cerebral character study of the sacrifices one man makes for the sake of his country, and the toll taken not only upon himself but also those around him by the life of duplicity, distrust, compromise and real betrayal that this engenders.  I don't know how a 2-1/2 hour movie with so button-downed and taciturn a central character as Matt Damon's Edward Wilson will play in multiplex land, but I give all due credit to Damon for embodying this tightly-wrapped, detached man and Robert DeNiro as director for having the courage to center his film on such a cool and enigmatic protagonist.    Using the 1961 Cuban Bay of Pigs disaster as a framing device, we flashback to 1939 Yale and we see Damon's Edward Wilson as a young Eli soon to be inducted into Skull and Bones where he will join the American WASP elite.  I'm glad DeNiro spends a bit of time here as we see Wilson as a brilliant and sensitive young man, seemingly with both heart and humor, with a potential to go in many directions in his life.  A telling secret of his life is revealed in his Skull & Bones initiation, and soon, for several reasons, he is singled out for the World War II OSS clandestine service and sent to London, England.  But not before impregnating the sister of one of his elite brethern and duly marrying her on the eve of his departure.  This marriage will be costly to Edward immediately and eventually to his wife and son as the years progress.    Wartime London intrigue ensues and later postwar Berlin and the beginning of the Cold War.  We watch as Edward not only learns his craft, but we see how he begins to shelve his emotions, tighten his grip on himself and don an impenetrable mask of detached stoicism. Edward Wilson is becoming \\"serious and humorless\\"and as he shuts-down only glimpses of the younger man appear. Through these scenes we also meet several key characters in the espionage game that will play important parts throughout the story, not the least being the man who will be Edward's opposite number in the KGB, code named Ulysses.  The KGB man tells Edward he is code-named \\"Mother\\" and that his propensity for silence is noted and respected.  Both men realize their opposite will be formidable and that this will be a very serious and deadly game they are about to play.    Edward returns home post-war to a marriage with a stranger, a son he doesn't relate well to and has little time for, and to the deadly games of the Cold War, dueling with the KGB in proxy wars around the world while coping with moles and betrayal and the internecine wars of bureaucracy.  It all comes full circle in ways tragic and sad.    Matt Damon had an incredible challenge playing a man so closed that almost no one knows him.  Apparently a composite of several early CIA founders, most notably the brilliant, mole-obsessed James Jesus Angleton, this character is a man that expects betrayal, can trust no one around him and ultimately cannot trust himself in the form of his own emotions.  Damon somehow conveys the man's inner anguish without breaking his stern outer resolve.  And yet we see flashes, glimpses of the man's regrets, of his lost capacity to love and give of himself.    There are coincidences and some doubtful scenes and situations that Edward particpates in or witnesses that seem a bit contrived but are necessary to broaden the scope of the film, and it is a truncated history by necessity.  I can't speak to whether some of the methods and tactics as shown, in particular one interrogation scene, are accurate for the period, and the assertion by a defector that the Soviet Union is bankrupt and hollow rings false for 1961, but overall the mood and tone of the piece seems right.  The nonchalance of the privileged elite in assuming leadership roles and the WASP heritage of the OSS and its offspring is presented well and no doubt persists into our world if you think of the Skull & Bones contest of the 2004 Presidential election.    At any rate, I applaud DeNiro and company for taking on such non-General audience material. This is John Le Carre territory, and has much more in common with the Alec Guinness versions of his spy stories as seen in the TV productions of \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" and \\"Smiley's People\\", with an equally inscrutable central character, than Bourne or Bond or whatever.  This is espionage carried out by a polyglot confusion of often damaged people: patriots, true-believers, careerists, liars, cheats, thieves, sadists and worse--the callous, greedy and corrupt.  As one of them says spies are ultimately \\"romantics\\" and romantics are ever doomed to disappointment and failure.  The DeNiro character (based on Wild Bill Donovan, founder and legend of OSS)says \\"in the end we're all clerks\\" or \\"bootmakers for the King\\" as another says.    Watching the idealism of Damon's Edward Wilson harden into the ruthless pragmatism of the cool and calculating ultimate bureaucrat was a chilling and worthwhile experience for me.  It is a hard, often cruel world we live in, and the world these people inhabit is very hard indeed, and we cannot expect the people we ask to live there not to be somehow affected. Edward's final compromise with himself and his ideals is that he can make no compromise with who he is and what he does.  They are now one and the same.  Ideals have been replaced by sheer, rigorous efficiency, and conscience by lies within lies and secrets within secrets    The cast supporting Damon (Hurt, Turturro, Baldwin, Crudup, Jolie, Gambon et al)is fine. The production likewise. In an interview DeNiro said that he hopes to continue this story with at least one more film.  I hope this one is successful enough that he gets the chance to do so, as I would like to see this story takenforward all the way up to our times.  I remember when films like The Spy Who Came In From the Cold or All the President's Men could be hits.  I hope this film can find its audience as well, for it is a fine effort.

B00005JPE7|5.0|At the surface, this film is simply nothing more than a Rocky film, a fitting end to one of the best sagas in film history. Then, after you see the film, you start to see and appreciate the film's depth - just as was the case with the Oscar-winning original.    The film is not about boxing, so much as some of its weaker predecessors, it's about believing in yourself, staying true to who you are, and never giving up hope.    Rocky Balboa, who now is running his own Italian restaurant aptly called Adrian's, is struggling to find his true place in life after he hangs up his gloves. As he has said many times in previous films - \\"I'm a fighter.\\" It's all he knows and it's all he wants to do, and as a result Rocky is a bit of a lost soul, seeking meaning and happiness. But what happens when he gets one last opportunity, one last shot at glory?    A heart-warming movie that will have you cheering from start to finish. A nice touch is that we are once again reconnected with several characters that truly bring the series full circle and return it to its roots - from little \\"Screw You Creepo\\" Marie to Spider Rico, the same man that Rocky fought in the opening sequence of the first film.    Another interesting note about this film is the way that the antagonist, Mason Dixon, was portrayed. He is not a villain, an opponent we are supposed to hate just because he is fighting Rocky, a la Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago. Instead, he too is a man struggling to find his own way and to overcome his own adversity as well.    This movie is obviously a must-see for any fan of the series, but it's a must see for any movie fan who needs a reason to believe in the power of the human heart.

B00023B1LC|2.0|The Bourne movies are extremely boring. The pacing is slow and the plots are uninteresting. Jason Bourne is an unlikable character and has no personality what so ever. I honestly cannot understand why anyone likes these movies. Instead of this movie series I recommend Casino Royale which is a lot more thrilling.
B000J10ER4|1.0|The first Superman movie was a great one, the second one, almost as good.  But since then, it has been one disaster after another.  The first four movies had the late Christopher Reeve, a very fine actor.  This movie has Brandon Routh, an actor with a big grin and not much else.  He is just about the sorriest actor I have ever seen.  The rest of the cast was not much better.  Only Kevin Spacey did his job but his part was so poorly written, it didn't really matter.  This movie certainly made some money but artistically, it was a total waste of time.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|Why would we need this? Why, because we are bored with the originals? Not hardly I hope. This Photoshop-like Beatles CD collage is an insult of great works that needed nothing to make them desirable to be listened to \\"again\\". The music never stopped being listen to. This CD reminds me of the crass colorized versions of classic black and white movies just so they could hold the attention of the feeble minded tv brains. The only positive thing this CD does is make it clear that the master tapes need to be gone to again as a source to reissue normal recordings once again as the latest technology is far better than it was when the first CDs were made in the 80's - and only George Martin should do this - without his clever son. I wish Amazon could let me give this CD a rating of zero or less, or less than even that.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie kept my attention and still provided a twist or two WITHOUT violence or obscene sex. (The best I've seen for a long time.)  After viewing it on an airline, I actually purchased it to view again.
B00005JPE7|4.0|The writing isn't that great and the acting is hit and miss, but this is one of the better Rocky films. Stallone ended the series on a high note with this one.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Ever so often a REALLY good sci-fi movie pops up.  I viewed this movie while traveling and purchased it for my library.  (Definately a keeper.)
B000IU3Y3W|1.0|Dont waste your money on this filth. I was duped again by the sticker on the cd/dvd set. The dvd does not have any live footage. Your bonus is that you get to watch a reel to reel start up and watch pictures of the concert. I was beligerent when I noticed this as I cannot take it back now that the package has been opened. Buy the cd instead and save about 8 to 10 bucks. The cd is fantastic with awesome versions of Cowgirl in the Sand and Down By the River! Dont be fooled by the writing on the package. The company that put this together must have been very desperate to make some money. Why would you want to put still pictures on a dvd? Beats me! Hope this helps everyone as none of the other reviews seem to mention this!
B00000I07P|5.0|I love Slippery When Wet so much. It has a lot of great songs. I was blown away when I first listened to it at the start of this year. I'm only 15, I love the 80's and most kids my age don't listen to this kind of stuff but I think it's awesome! Bon Jovi is one of my favorite bands and I highly recommend this album. Rock on 80's music!
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil's \\"Comalies\\" is the best album I've ever listened to. I thought that couldn't be possible, but it's true. Song after song was just as good as the previous or even better. I couldn't believe what I was listening to. Cristina Scabbia has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard and I like the edge that Andrea Ferro brings. It's just the right amount without taking away from the true voice of the band.  The guitars are great and the<br />drums are also good. What a great Band and what a great album. Anyone who loves music should immediately get this album, you won't be disappointed.
B00005OM5L|2.0|I bought this title expecting a great recording. Unforunately, the recording was VERY dissapointing, visuals are not clear as they should be and the audio was very flat with poor discrete 5.1 channel seperation. I bought this title to enjoy on my high end system and was very dissapointed. It goes without saying the Eric Claptons music and performance is not the issue...
B000H5V8DG|1.0|The discs are packaged in cardboard sleeves that scratch the discs.   <br /> <br />It will arrive already scratched with some discs being unwatchable.
B000024QML|5.0|This record belied the transition of the Pet Shop Boys in the US from superstars into  cult figures.After eight radio friendly years,their songs suddenly were not played on stations as much as before.Instead,a strong and smaller legion of fans took them to their hearts mostly on the dance halls.In the UK and Australasia,however they still enjoyed considerable airplay.And as a breaking point,this album enshrines the quality of their artistry at its best.Tracks such as CAN YOU FORGIVE HER which opens the disk,and I WOULDN'T NORMALLY DO THIS KIND OF THING which follow ,speak of strong human emotions.Their big gay fan base get GO WEST(an old Village People tune done better)and LIBERATION.DREAMING OF THE QUEEN and TO SPEAK IS A SIN are cleverly tinged by English humour while YOUNG OFFENDER sings  of the highs and lows of a young man's life.
0385720920|4.0|While I found this a bit harder to read than Invisible Monsters, Fight Club, or Lullaby, it was ultimately a very satisfying read.  Pahlaniuk's characters are more surrealist collages of ideas than characterizations of human beings, but in spite of that they come through the shattered, refracted lens of Pahlaniuk's twisted world view to emerge as very sympathetic people.  All of us are confused and perplexed to some extent, whether we admit it or not, or most of us do silly and ridiculous things at some point to feel better, to feel connected to other people, to feel a part of something bigger than ourselves.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that many readers have been shocked, disgusted, or simply uninterested in Pahlaniuk's unorthodox storytelling, to say nothing of the truly bizarre sex acts and other outr&eacute; behavior in this story.  This kind of writing is most definitely not for all tastes.  Having grown up on William S. Burroughs (\\"Naked Lunch\\") and Henry Miller (\\"Tropic of Cancer\\"), Pahlaniuk's collage approach to plotting and his exaggerated depictions of dark human behavior are more amusing than disgusting to me.<br /><br />What has annoyed me about his work in the past is the constant snarkiness, the smart-aleck finger-pointing at every hypocritical aspect of modern life.  \\"Choke\\" actually tones this down somewhat and I was left with a moving and poignant sense of hope as the novel ended.<br /><br />As always, I enjoyed Pahlaniuk's crisp, lean prose and his wealth of strange ideas.  I'd recommend this novel for anyone who is a fan of William Burroughs or Jerzy Kosinski (if you think Pahlahniuk's work is dark and disturbing, try Kosinski), or who enjoys surrealism in any form.
B00005AQP4|4.0|Originally released in 1975, as this title looks to be Mike Oldfield's third lp on CD reissue. Personally, I don't remember all that much about Oldfield - except of course - for his Grammy award winning debut 'Tubular Bells' record. Maybe not my cup of tea - here but as I always give credit where credit is due - I have to admit that 'Ommadawn' is most definitely a most compelling piece of 'New Age' work. Two lengthy tracks here - for you listening pleasure \\"Ommadawn, Part 1\\" (19:23) and \\"Ommadawn, Part 2\\" (13:54). Mike Oldfield plays several instruments - like guitar, bass, keyboards and percussion. The album's complete line-up is simply too extensive to list here. Would likely appeal to fans of Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre and Mike Metheny.
B000F3AAUW|1.0|I soooooo loved that song \\"crazy\\" that I just had to have this cd and was so disappointed in their non-compliance with their brilliance that I am ready to give it away.  My favorite song is not more than three minutes and the orgasm is over before you know it and some sludge of a song comes before and after.  His brilliant vocals are only shown in the coveted song and the rest is some hip-hop that I don't connect with at all.  I am so mad at their collaborators as to their ignorance in what hooked us in the first place.   Give me more \\"crazy\\" sounds and I will be satisfied.
B000000IRB|3.0|I recently purchased the Japanese version with the obi strip $200.00. Please save your money and buy this Mo-Fi version. I have both now. The Japanese (so called collectors issue) is slightly and I mean slightly better. The only way to tell the difference is if you have a high end system as I do. So again please save your $$$$$$$$ and buy the Mo-Fi cd which I rate as a 3 and the Japanese version as a 3.1 for sound quality.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|While I concur with other reviewers in that there is a strong Sabbath and Zeppelin influence, I hear influence from Uriah Heep. This is true especially in the song \\"The Joker and the Thief\\".
0307346609|5.0|This novel struck me as perhaps one of the finest in the genre. While it dealt with some of \\"hack and slash\\" of zombie killing, it focused more on the social, economic and political issues of a zombie uprising.  <br /> <br />Told from many different points of view this novel formed a gestalt akin to \\"Syriana meets Day of the Dead\\". It cleverly skewers politicians, pop culture icons, the post-industrial man and the American military machine. Each vingnette could have been the precis of an entire novel in itself had Brooks wished to flech them out further. <br /> <br />Each \\"voice\\" that Brooks uses speaks of very different values and politics as it approaches the common (though uncommon) problem of a zombie uprising. A must read for anyone that enjoys zombie literature.
0743424425|5.0|The Shining is the first Stephen King book I ever read, and even after reading many more books--some his, some not--it remains my favorite book ever. It not only scared me, it conected with me deeply. The movie with Jack Nickolson in it is also my favorite movie. I didn't read a new copy though, I read an old one that had a kind of magic to it, which added to the experiance. By the way, my real name is Krag Jerry Kerr, not June Elain. That's just a spoof.
B000068FWC|4.0|This albumn is a prog/pop super albumn, one of the best of the 70's in that category in my opinion. That is, it has enough ear candy pop for mass appeal, and enough prog to please the more discerning listener. So as not to sound condescending, it may be better to say that it bears repeated listenings even by the most critical music fans. It is an almost perfect creation, balancing the many musical components in a heady swirling mix to a 5+ star effect, but I can only give it four because of the remastering. The music 50% is a five, and the mastering 50% is a three.  If you've no interest in the technical analysis, then skip to 'BUT ANYWAY' at the bottom. I know that it has been out a while, and I admit my analysis is a little late, but I only just tried this version. I compared it with the previous edition, and found some interesting, but not unexpected results that I would like to share. I didn't compare cut for cut, but after a couple I decided to cut it short because of an obvious trend. I used a cheap everyday radio shack sound level meter using C weighting, slow response speed, just like one would use to balance a surround set up. I checked the peak, and average spl of the louder portions of the tracks, and found that at the same volume setting the remaster was 4 to 8 dbs louder. Supposedly it takes a 3 db difference to be detectable to the human ear. Just in case, I also compared a couple of the quietest passages in an effort to eliminate any possiblity of an increase in dynamic range that could account for the difference. I found that those passages showed the same results, 4 to 8 dbs higher on the new one. It is accepted wisdom that people will usually say that the louder recording sounds better. Now about the sound fidelity. I could not find , and this is just to my ear, any significant difference in the fidelty of the sound between the two recordings. The remaster may have a slight edge in spots, but it seems fairly miniscule at best. However, some other reviewers disagree, and their opinions should be considered too. I'm NOT an expert, BUT if you are interested in investigating this phenomenon a little closer, then you will find a fairly lively debate about whether current digital mastering techniques are better or worse for bringing out the full potential fidelity of music recordings. {Kind of like the argument that you videophiles are having about modern film editing techniques. They're too much for me!} Of course it isn't really about fidelity so much, but about the emotional impact that music has when listened to via the different possible media through which it is presented. All recorded music is compressed to some degree or other, usually substantually. Often it is deliberately further compressed if possible, and the loudness also boosted, as presented by radio stations for example. (Didn't we get promised full dynamic range with the introduction of CD? Does anyone remember?) Any old head audiophile has had a dynamic range expander or two. In this case it seems that the compression hasn't been tampered with. BUT ANYWAY, if you don't have this albumn, then buy the remastered one. If you're looking to jump from the old one to this new one, then I would advise you to get a listen first, if there is any possible way. Great albumn either way!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Another major blunder by TV bigwigs, cancelling this show. With it's unusual look at our venture into space, well developed characters, great story writing and unobtrusive CGI, Firefly was a sure fire hit. Scifi at it's best. I've watched it hundreds of times and still there only so many episodes, will there ever be more, one can only hope. Maybe another movie? After all Star Trek made seven movies after they ended, why not Firefly?
B000002KE2|5.0|When I first listened to Black Sabbath as a kid, I was afraid. I was afraid that some adult was going to figure it out. I could tell Ozzy Osbourne was singing about some pretty intense things. He was telling me about a world that I had never encountered. I thought that just by listening to this, I was going to Hell.<br /><br />How fun it all was! That first taste of rebellion and fear, the breaking free, the still vibrating inspiration all alive in this music. When I listen now, I can still revisit that feeling of fear that struck my heart in youth. Still, I would listen again and again. While I have long since abandoned other music from that era, Sabbath stayed with me. Somehow there was always a place for them waiting in the annals of rock music history. A branch of rock-n-roll became hard rock, and it is very clear now what was clear early on, that the hardrock genre would evolve a great deal as a result of the contributions that were coming from Black Sabbath. A genre of razor clear blues riffs, with grate and dirt, spit, and confusion, all taken into directions, angles, and awkward spaces that we had never gone before.<br /><br />Rhythm and bass that flows like a warm, rolling river, sometimes rapid, unpredictable, and choppy, sometimes heavy, thick, and melodic, but always moving forward, always driving the train toward some certainty that only Black Sabbath heard before us. These albums are laden with vocals that can haunt, entrance, inspire, or enrage, and all of it emanated from a young man with an old soul, a clear original, John \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne. Be afraid again, be in awe again. Black Sabbath is a journey worth taking.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This series sets the standard for historical documnetary film making. The entire series is incredibly well edited and the narration is well written and delivered by Lawrence Olivier. Beyond the footage from all the theaters of battle and the homefronts, what really sets this apart are the countless interviews with eyewitnesses and key participants that bring the thoughts and feelings of people at different stages of the war into full understanding. A key attribute of historical study should be to get beneath the seeming inevitability of events past to understand that at the time other outcomes and courses were possible. This fine documentary does that and opens up new avenues of thought about WWII for the viewer. As the generation that lived through these times fades from history this documentary increases in value as a memorial to the most turbulent times of the last century.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My wife and I watched the DVD three weeks ago at home and immediately regarded it as \\"Movie of the Year\\". The CG is stunning as expected, but it's success is primarily attributed to the great story/script and the outstanding details which captivate its audience all the way. I had the impulse to write a review immediately then but had been stopped by the many negative reviews that complained it's too targeted at adults and not so good for kids as other Pixar movies. I thought, \\"May be I am really too old (40) and so I have rated too high an animaion that tributed to the aged or the veterans.\\" However, last night, when we were in a mall watching an AV shop showing it in a 42\\" 1080P True HD Sony LCDTV, together with many little kids and their parents, we were attracted not only by the fantastic video effect (We only have a 29\\" CRT at home and were astonished by how much visual details we missed), but how parents got to drag/pull/tow their kids away. In one case, a father simply put his 3-4 yr old son on his shoulder like a bag of flour and walked away. The cute beautiful angel, with his smiling face, waived \\"Bye! Bye! Car, Car.\\"
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina has one of the greatest voices I've heard. I believe she was born to sing. She's a risk taker I love that. Another great cd.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one of the best love stories. It is completely worth watching. There was great chemistry between the main characters - nice eye contact. I like movies where you can really feel that love, the heat, that special magic. You truly want them to find each other and be together. Sometimes less is more so I'll say this...It's really good.
0743298020|4.0|\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is a Goth-edged literary thriller told by Diane Setterfield, a woman who obviously loves reading, books and story telling.  Here's a style sample:  \\"Her eyes were too full of beauty to leave room for anything so mundane as intelligence.\\"  Hey, Oscar Wilde would have been pleased to have written such a splendid dig.  <br /> <br />The story revolves around a shy, young biographer who is charged with writing the true life story of an aging literary lioness who has spent most of her adult life systematically falsifying her personal history.  The assignment becomes a journey of personal growth for the biographer who is haunted by her twin sister's death.  Without giving the plot away, it's safe to say that one of the things she discovers is the great truism that \\"all families are dysfunctional.\\" <br /> <br />Ms. Setterfield's work is so deft that it's hard to believe that this is a first novel.  You don't get this good without doing a lot of writing.  Sure, guys, this is a chick book; but the story telling is so compelling that \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" transcends that medium.  It gives the pleasure center a first rate massage.      <br />
B0009A40ES|3.0|Relatively speaking, that is.<br /><br />This is an interesting, if a bit over the top, portrait of a psychopath gone bananas.  Presented in white, white, and more white so that the red, red, red of the blood will be all the more contrasting, this approach coincides with the ultra, ultra sophistication of the Harvard and Yale grads working on Wall Street who are so, so very venal and superficial.  This is a slasher film that will appeal equally to heartlanders on a date night, and to those blue coasters who need a little titillation.<br /><br />[And then suddenly Bateman takes over my review]:<br /><br />Yeah, RIGHT.  Who cares.<br /><br />Personally, I don't usually watch slasher films, being above that kind of stuff, but this is stylishly done--and I do like style in my blood splattering.  Where director Mary Herron screws up is in not realizing that only an idiot sociopath would be so stupid and self-destructive as to so carelessly kill so many people.  If there is one thing a sociopath never wants to do is to bring pain upon himself.  Don't you think, considering the ending, that Bateman is going to be caught?  Huh?<br /><br />[Resuming control of my review and droning on]:<br /><br />...although the terms \\"sociopath\\" and \\"psychopath\\" are often used interchangeably, there is a clear tendency for \\"psychopath\\" to be reserved for violent sociopaths.  Another reason \\"psychopath\\" is correct is because this is a postmodern update of the classic Hitchcock slasher movie Psycho (1960) starring...<br /><br />[Again taking over]:<br /><br />Shut up. Who cares who it starred?  The point here is that this film--we're talking about MY film-- is a TOTALLY INACCURATE portrait of a true psycho--I mean sociopath.  We don't make ourselves so vulnerable to the Criminal Justice System.  We are NOT intent on self-destruction.  Believe me if I ever decide to get my jollies by slashing someone up, I will make absolutely sure I can get away with it.  Only low IQ psychos like Scott Peterson get caught.  And, by the way, what is with this chainsaw business?  I mean he tosses it down the stairwell so that it crashes on the floor from how many stories above, and it still works so he can use it on \\"Christie\\"?  Give me a break.<br /><br />Oh.  You think that it hit her while still running, huh?  Ha, ha, ha!  Nice shot, dude.<br /><br />[Again resuming control]:<br /><br />..notice too that the ending allows for a sequel, yet has all the trappings of an ending.  We know that he is going to be caught and yet...<br /><br />[Coming back out of the screen...]:<br /><br />We know nothing.  The cops are stupid.  Nobody will believe...<br /><br />[Shoving him back in...]:<br /><br />...the emphasis on the conspicuous consumption of expensive food and wine, drugs, cigars, the indulgence of any kind of animal pleasure is, on one level a statement about our society--well, Wall Street society--but on another level is part of the usual Hollywood seduction of the audience.  This is the fast lane.  Wouldn't you like to live in the fast lane for a bit, but of course come back (after they run the credits) to your own way of life?  Isn't this the essence of escape?  Go to the movies, rent a DVD, kick up your feet and escape for awhile, and maybe there will be a catharsis, as the Greek tragedians intended.  And when you turn off the set and go to bed you realize that nothing in your life is so extreme and nothing in your life is really that far gone, and yet you have experienced vicariously an extreme emotion, and as a bonus you can feel superior to those Ivy League sickos.<br /><br />In truth this is a slightly tongue in cheek slasher/serial killer flick.  It's a satire of sorts.  It is as slick as slick can be, thoroughly engrossing with fine acting from especially Christian Bale who plays Bateman.  The direction is as tight as a well-strung banjo, the script nearly hypnotic in its seductive power, the New York ultra hip sets eye-widening as seeing the Taj Mahal while the sidebar-like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny.  Best joke: they're in the restroom of a fancy eating establishment and doing some lines and the guy in the next stall gets a little uptight because they're loud and screams out, \\"Will you keep it down. I'm trying to do drugs!\\"<br /><br />Also funny is how Bateman says what he really thinks and nobody takes him seriously, and how he slips up from time to time and nobody notices.<br /><br />Incidentally, Reese Witherspoon has a minor part as exactly the kind of clueless woman who might very well marry a psychopath.  I liked this touch because I have known a few non-violent sociopaths and I often wondered if their spouses had a clue.  Clearly Reese's character did not.<br /><br />Also excellent in support was Chloe Sevigny as Jean, Bateman's adoring (but also clueless) secretary.  The idea here is that women are so bowled over by Bateman's alpha male credentials that they can't see the real person.  The only character to really realize who Bateman was (and she ended up listening to that knowledge a little late) was the streetwalker.  Well, Jean gets the picture finally as she peruses Bateman's graphic notebook.  (By the way, somebody got paid to draw all the stuff in it.  I wonder who that was.  Was there a mention in the credits, something like, sick psycho doodlings by...?)<br /><br />Finally: real life irony.  The character that Bale played in a movie immediately before this one was Jesus of Nazareth in a TV drama called Mary, Mother of Jesus (1999).  As Casey Stengel used to say, you could look it up.as seeing the Taj Mahal while the sidebar-like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny.

B0000BYM3K|2.0|This may be the most mediocre of all the Maiden albums . I like the fact that they stick to thier guns , but at this point Bruce Dickinson's solo albums blow this stuff away .
B0002XMF5I|2.0|I'll never understand the cult-like following that this album has.  The studio production is the worst I've ever heard of any album released by a major recording outfit.  Geezer is buried in the mix.  The drums sound horrible.  The lyrics appear to have had almost no creative thought put into them.  For the most part, the songs have a \\"phoned-in\\" quality to them.  The only highlights that save this from a one-star rating are some of Gillian's masterful screams & a couple of decent & fluid solos from Iommi.<br /><br />This is for Sabbath completists only, if you ask me.
B000I5X81A|1.0|It must be tough to be Eric Clapton, I am serious. At the height of his profession, Clapton is not afforded the opportunity to stumble. When I have seen him live he has ripped the guts out of his guitar and spilled them on the stage. He's the best. <br /> <br />And, this album is not worthy of him. If this were an EAGLES album I would give it 3 stars, maybe 4. But this album is Clapton snoozing in the back of the tour bus. PASS on this, my friends.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Look, global warming is a theory based on junk science. Ever notice the whole movie claims 'at this rate'.....Using this, a cop can nail me getting on the freeway-for at the rate I am accelerating, I will be going 500 mph..... <br />Aside from the above, I am a believer in helping our environment. Please be careful where you get information on this. A prime example is Al Gore's interview-onboard his PRIVATE jet. That is called a limosine liberal. Another fact to put in perspective is the production costs of a hybrid vehicle burn more pollutants than the average 70's gas hog would in a lifetime.  <br />This movie is just political crud.
B000K7VHPU|3.0|Interesting premise that never quite achieves its potential narratively or cinematically.  And the special illusions that Norton's character performs onstage aren't really that interesting anyway.<br /><br />This film, like \\"The Prestige\\", never quite fires on all cylinders.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell is quite good in this, though.  His character is far more interesting than those of the movie's two leads.

I was LUCKY enough to be a kid when this came out and got to experience it at a young enough age to REALLY absorb this by watching it 9845049 times with my dad.  I AM SO HAPPY THE ULTIMATE EDITION CAME OUT because the one before it was CRAP.  I bought the one before it (the version without Tangerine Dream) and threw it away.  I love this movie so much, you have no idea how bitter I was that I had to do that.  The is the apex of fantasy film and I hope you get this version for your experience of it.  =]

I tried playing this one but the player rejected it each time and reported \\"unable to play this disc.\\"  After some investigation, I determined that Blu Ray discs are region encoded, such that a player purchased in North America is only capable of playing discs intended for North America (region A.)  Unfortunately, the disc that I got from Amazon is not appropriate for playback on a unit purchased in North America.  Look into this before you buy.

It may be fun to see some familiar faces for awhile, but then you realize after about a half an hour that your glad you've moved on to new friends and possibilities. I absolutely loved the first four Rocky films, so don't take me for a Rocky hater, I'm far from one. But Rocky Balboa is not a good film. The pacing is slow and boring, the story is way past played out and the final fight scene contains the least amount of actual \\"fighting\\" that I have ever seen in a Rocky film. Antonio Tarver is the worst \\"villain\\" as he is basically devoid of any emotion in this film. There is no real beef between him and Rocky. On the whole the story line is utterly ridiculous and even though I tried to tell myself that this is just a movie, I still couldn't get past some of the nonsense. For instance, in this \\"exhibition\\" match for charity, if one of these men were knocked down twice in one round the fight would have been stopped. No exhibition fight would ever go the distance with it's participants cut and bleeding. So be prepared to suspend your belief in reality for the 1:42 minute running time of this film. It's clear that Stallone was unhappy with the way the series was ended (Rocky V was an utter train wreck), so he has basically come back to finish the series with some class and dignity. The question is...who cares? Some people will I'm sure, but I guess I'm way past the point of caring. Recommended only to hardcore Rocky fanatics.
B00004W50T|5.0|It was very brave of the Band to open their debut album with  the long, slow and dark \\"Tears of Rage\\" . They were praised for this at the time, but now more than three decades later, the song may scare away new listeners which is really a big shame because is one the Band's greatest and probably their most influential album. It's not that \\"Tears of Rage\\" is a bad song; it just may take some time to get into it.<br /><br />\\"Music From Big Pink\\" was actually the only Band album with two equally important songwriters; by their fourth album \\"Cahoots\\" keyboard player and occasional drummer Richard Manuel had completely stopped writing. This was really a shame, because his material on \\"Big Pink\\" equals that of Robbie Robertson. The relaxed and slightly whimsical \\"We Can Talk\\" is one of the catchiest tunes on the album and in my opinion an early Band classic. Another outstanding Manuel tune is \\"In a Station\\", which somehow reminds me of the legendary Danish band the \\"Savage Rose\\".<br /><br />Darker Manuel tunes like \\"Tears of Rage\\" and \\"Lonesome Suzie\\" may be harder to get into, especially for people who have not grown up with the music of the Band. Interesting to hear the jazzier and faster alternate version of \\"Lonesome Suzie\\" among the bonus-tracks; actually I find that version more appealing.<br /><br />Of course Robbie Robertson turned out to be their main song-writer and he also shines here on the debut-album. \\"The Weight\\" is more or less their signature tune; a great song showcasing all three lead-singers. In fact one of the great things about this great group is that it had these three singer whose vocals blended uniquely; especially on their earliest albums.<br /><br />Another Robertson classic is the organ-riff  based \\"Chest Fever\\" which eventually becane a Garth Hudson live tour-de-force.<br /><br />The bonus-track are all good, though several lack in sound - \\"Basemant Tapes\\" sound. The last tune \\"Ferdinand the Imposter\\" could really have been great; also the country-inpired \\"If I Lose\\" is also quite charmingalso the country-inpired \\"If I Lose\\" is also quite charming
B00005JPCD|5.0|I'm an adult and I have seen this movie twice.  I love it!  There are definitely two messages to the movie.  The first one is about being different.  The second one is about saving the environment.  I think that it is a movie that everyone should see... whether you are young or old!

B00065MDSQ|5.0|This is a very good KC album and although it doesn't get my highest rating it is still a classic. King Crimson had just compleated what at the time was going to be their last American tour. David Cross was out of the band and this was going to be the last one. Actually, the song Providence was recorded on their American tour with David. This album also reunites the band with Ian McDonald(an original member), Mel Collins(from Poseidon thru Earthbound), Robin Miller and Marc Charig(from Lizard and Islands). The album opens with the cool instrumental Red which is heavy enough to make Jimmy Page run for cover. Fallen Angel and One More Red Nightmare are great songs rounding out the first half in fine form. Providence is a cool improv from their American tour. Starless starts out as one of the most moving songs that the band has ever performed. After the lyrics, Robert holds a pattern while the rest begin to open the song up quitely at first, but not for long. This part of the song sort of reminds me of a standoff at gunpoint before turning into a free for all shootout before finally giving way to the refrain which reminds me of a Pheonix rising from the ashes. I should also point out that some of my favorite Bill Bruford playing occurs in this song. Then again, everybody on here is execellent.
B0000691U1|3.0|Duke Ellington in trio form is where I like him best. \\"The Pianist\\" and \\"Piano In The Foreground\\" are my favorite jazz albums and I highly recommend buying them before \\"Money Jungle\\" if you don't own them already.I think the reason why people rate this album so high is because of the line up of big name musicans. \\"It has to be good it's Ellington. Roach, and Mingus, there brilliant\\". Yes Ellington and Roach are brilliant but on the other hand Mingus almost single handedly ruins this album. I can't even sit through track one, it is awful. I don't care if your an angry bass player, get a hold of yourself and play the damn instrument like your not having a seizure. People say his playing is \\"outside the box and different\\". I say I don't care how technicly difficult your playing is or how outside the box it is, if it sounds like crap than it is crap. If you can honestly tell me that you like the sound of Mingus playing a fury of the same note over and over under Ellington's melody than your lacking in taste. He is not bad on every track but I would have been much more satisfied with a diffent bass player. Ellington is great and the melodies are good but I highly recommend the other trio albums first.
B00064WSNM|5.0|This is a great album! Most of this album is recorded live with the audience removed and overdubbed in the studio. The only two completely studio bound songs on here are The Great Deceiver and Lament. I really like this album and many songs have become classics for the band. The Night Watch is a beautiful song based on the famous painting. Lament starts off mellow and builds to a rocking finish. Trio is a moving instrumental. Starless and Bible Black rendered here in an instrumental version as the lyrics had not been written yet is wonderful and the same can be said for Fracture.
B000IOM0WY|3.0|The video quality is sub par compared to other titles.  The DVD port is much better with no digital artifacts.  I guess they were in too big a hurry to release this great action flick.  The digital artifacts at low light level are terrible.  I borrowed a friends copy and they were both the same.  Movie is as good as ever despite the poor video quality.  Motion artifact on the DVD are eliminated on the Blu-Ray version.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|It's probably impossible to truly bring Dune to the screen.  Much of the novel is intellectual and abstract.  It sets itself in a complex universe that could take an entire movie just to set up.  But David Lynch makes a good stab at it.  The movie is worth watching.  Dune may be flawed but it is never boring.  It a mess, but an entertaining one.  Herbert himself was pleased with the movie and you can't beat that as an endorsement.  There are moments in the film which are truly exceptional.    The obvious comparison is to the Sci-Fi miniseries.  The miniseries, which I also recommend, has the advantage of better coherence, better adherence to the book and the absence of the embarassing weirding modules.  The portrayals of Chani, Irulan and the Harkonnens are far superior.  And Fremen culture -- the keystone of the book -- receives a far better treatment.  I know a lot of people prefer the monstrous baron of the Lynch movie.  But I prefer a Baron (and a Feyd and a Raban) who are smarter and deadlier.  The Baron is supposed to be a formidable opponent, a skilled tyrant, not a cackling embicle.  Feyd is supposed to be nearly Paul's equal in a lot of ways.    However, Lynch's version has several triumphs of its own.  The acting is notably superior.  Pronchow's Duke Leto Atreides towers over Hurt's somnambulent performance. MacLahan is good in the lead role.  Sian Phillips and Patrick Stewart are nice additions -- especially in the extended version.  Visually, the movie is a feast. Yeah, the FX are a bit dated, but the set design, costumes and navigators are wonderful.  And I like Toto's score -- even as it gets repetitive and/or cheesy.  It has some laughable moments (Halleck charging into battle with the family pooch stuffed into his jacket) and some amazing ones (Paul addressing the Fremen mob).    In the end, of course, a movie has to stand on its own two feet.  They are not supposed to be straight transcriptions of the book.  Both versions of Dune do well in that regard, capturing the essentials of the book while adding their own touches.    As for this DVD -- finally, we have both version of the movie.  Again, both have their good points.  The Alan Smithee cut has a far superior opening narration and some nice touches.  But it has a tendency to be repetitive and many of the scenes are STILL not finished, with the blue glow missing from the Fremen eyes.  Despite the claims of the spotlight review, there was *never* a six-hour cut of the movie.  Both Lynch and Dilorentis have repeatedly denied this.  The initial four hour cut was a rough cut just to see what they had and much was cut or compressed.  Specifically, numerous scenes were compressed into Paul's \\"Water of Life\\" test.  Three hours is close to the limit of what was shot.    I realize this review is primarily targeted at Dune fans.  For those of you who have never encountered the Dune universe, I would recommend both the movie and the miniseries.  I had not read the book when I first saw the movie and was intrigued enough to eventually read the entire series.  It stands reasonably on its own as a amazing, if sometimes incoherent, spectacle.  You won't regret the investment of time or money.
B000JVT09C|5.0|This is an exceptional video encoding.  I have been unhappy with several other titles in Blu-Ray but this restores my faith in the product.  It is a great sequel to the original series and lots of cute twists.  Video quality was first rate from beginning to end.  Best Video out of 11 titles I own.  Convinced me that there is hope for Blu-Ray despite its cost and Digital Rights Management issues. <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I've seen this four times now.  I even got my husband to see it, and he enjoyed it as much as I did.  Hilarious!  Everyone and everything in it just gels.  All those who didn't enjoy it, relax and watch it again.  I'm looking forward to receiving this DVD for Christmas.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|This is not our grandpa's Slim Shady. What is going on with Em is that he is manuevering himself into the main stream of hip hop and gangsta rap. What use to be a unique and interesting sound for Em (slim shady LP through Eminem Show) is now tired silliness (encore, curtain call). When Em got into the game, a was BETTER than on top of his game, he was in a league of his own. I mean who rapped about the things that Em rapped about? Nobody right? The fact that he lit a fire under the the rap world fueled his success. The only problem with lighting a fire under hip hop, is that if it doesn't catch (I.E. Gangsta rap, Crunk music, Hyphy movement), your left looking a tad burned out, and frankly; wierd. Em realizes this and refuses to fall off, and shouldn't given that he IS the one of the best lyricists in Hip Hop today. Whether than make more and more music to be considered \\"Classic slim\\" by the shady faithful, and obscure by everyone else, Mathers answers his critics, his competition and the game with the Re-Up.  <br /> <br />As a stand alone album, the Re-up features some exceptional talent. Theres the Pacs of the game and theres the \\"Mike Jones'\\" of the game, and these rappers lean viciously towards the Pac end of the talent stream. There is a certain swagger you are able to come with when your entire team is overacheiving on they're respective tracks. Easily distinguishable from the pack are Em and 50 which are respectively the most and least talented of Shady Records newest posse (I'll leave it to you to guess which is which). The rhymes are hard, even if some of the songs are dated. Just like in any other CD you have songs that are bangers and songs that coast. This album has more bangers than most, and proves that you can still blow out the bass without breaking out the 808 that many artists have become so fond of. Em's new found energy is complimented by his loyal and highly talented apprentices and coligues. Of these rappers, Stat Quo, Ca$his, and Bobby Creekwater uses the album as a launchpad, spitting some of the most memorable lines in the album.  <br /> <br />Don't let the name fool you. This is closer to what you would expect from a G-Unit album than anything the Em faithful will endorse. If you liked \\"You don't know\\", the radio banger that served as the album's first single, than expect to be in LOVE with the rest of the CD. If it seemed more like a G-Unit joint featuring Eminem (which it wasn't by the way), than you may want to consider rethinking your purchase. Either way you go, understand that Em is in tip top condition, and his almost \\"crunk\\" since of energy is a refreshing addition to his already sick lyrical prowess. Just don't expect to have an OD and wristslitting party to the lyrics like you may have been able to do with previous Em Lps. Despite it being a new Shady and more guest heavy than any Em album on the shelves right now, it is gangsta rap at it's finest, and trunk bangin, mind blowing music greatness.

B000002OCB|4.0|Released in 1971, the CD continued a trend to have legendary blues artists record with popular British rockers who were well versed in the history of the music.<br /><br />Howlin' Wolf and guitarist Hubert Sumlin were joined by Eric Clapton (g), Bill Wyman (b), Charlie Watts (d), Jeffrey Carp (h) and other musicians, including Steve Winwood, Ian Stewart, Ringo Starr and Klaus Voorman in what was a tribute to the blues legend. Howlin' Wolf who was not in good health at the time of the recording, but he still packed a punch on these blues standards and - at least one time - showed who was the boss in the studio.<br /><br />There is a false take for The Red Rooster where Howlin' Wolf stops the recording and chastises Clapton on the way he was playing his electric guitar. Clapton and the rest of the band then convince Howlin' Wolf to play his acoustic guitar along with singing, which follows in the second take.<br /><br />The choice cuts include I Ain't Superstitious - Starr and Voorman are the rhythm section - Highway 49 and Wang Dang Doodle, where Clapton unleashes some wicked guitar work.<br /><br />There are other collections that have recordings of Howlin' Wolf in his prime. But for fans who want to hear the influence of blues on British rock musicians or those who may not be familiar Howlin' Wolf, The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions is a great starting point on the trek filled unfortunately with great artists who are nearly forgotten with the passage of time.
6305327041|3.0|I'm not typically a Tim Roth fan, in fact the work he did in Planet of the Apes was so convincing I couldnt ever see him playing an enjoyable or particularly likeable character. From the moment Roths character goes out to start his shift at the hotel you get a feeling this guy has the best of intentions.<br /><br />Each of the \\"Four Rooms\\" contains a different story, with different characters, Roth being the only connection between the four. Some smaller plot elements tie the four rooms together as well. These are slight and might be missed, but help to make the movie more whole.<br /><br />My favorite \\"room\\" is the Tarintino room. Once you see Quentin you know things are going to get really funny, really dark, kind of weird but always worth the price of admisssion. His is the last of the four rooms though.<br /><br />Antonio Banderas' room is also great. Although hes not a major part of this room, because the story focuses on his two kids in the scene, his reaction to the mischief the kids get into is awesome! Very fuuny.<br /><br />Madonna has a nice little role as the head of a witch coven. In their room they are trying to raise a goddess, and need some \\"special\\" help from Roth.<br /><br />Depending on how you like your comedies this movie may or may not be very funny to you. I liked it becuase I thought it was a bit smarter than  slap stick comedies...Roths caricature of the proper British bellboy is the absolute best part of the movie as a whole.<br /><br />Not perfect but worth owning and worth watching again and again.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is a rarity.  I don't know of many other holiday movies that make me laugh so hard, and at the same time tell a good story.  My kids like it almost as much as I do. <br /> <br />Chances are, if there ever is a sequel, it won't have the same magic.  But that's OK.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|Why would someone want totally different mixes? But that's what someone below wanted. I got around to a second hearing today after getting this hot off the press (don't want to burn out on it), and I'm spending a pleasanter evening than if I were to plop on one of the regular albums. It's simply about time that someone put together something like this record, isn't it? Almost everything I'm hearing sounds new and fresher, and the songflow is pretty nice too. Some of these have to be built around alternate takes, e.g., \\"Yesterday,\\" and when they're this good we're lucky to have them. George and son also bring out many clearer backing vocals and lots of crisp, sweet instrumentation for which I didn't even know to listen before. I would have loved to hear something done with \\"Rain,\\" my favorite Beatles tune, but oh well. I'm happy to let Martin play with Beatles tapes when it's this smartly done.
0380002930|1.0|I cannot believe all these 5 star ratings.  You have got to be kidding me.  And the slams of those who rated it 1 star.  I'm not stupid, I have a master's degree, intelligent and an avid reader of GOOD literature.  This has got to be the most boring book I've ever tried to read.  I have to read this book as a Battle of the Books coach.  I finally quit half-way and relied on Cliff notes for practice questions.  I never quit a book half-way.  I'm not even going to make my students read this incredibly horrid book.  I'm still just not getting all of the hundreds of 5 star reviews.  What?  What?  What???
B00005JNS0|3.0|I have enjoyed many G rated \\"kiddie\\" movies over the years, but this is not one that I would ever watch again.  The movie starts off somewhat exciting, but as soon as you start to get into the action, it becomes boring and uneventful.  I felt like the majority of the movie was like a long, slow story about how the main character learns humility.  Okay, maybe this would have been okay, but not for most of the movie.  Somewhere along the lines there has to be more action and humor.  The funny moments are few and far between.  Most of the humor relies on jokes about how the other characters are presented.  How this is supposed to be funny for a over an hour is beyond me.  You giggle about how the characters talk for a few minutes and then you look for more, but you don't get it.  After all of this, the movie has a rather boring ending that almost makes you feel let down after you have waited for so long for more action.  In the end I would have to say that this one is a rental only.  I would never watch it again and the kids that I know were all unimpressed.  Nobody asked Santa for this one.
B000002NBY|5.0|Paul Simon's \\"Graceland\\" was stored away for awhile in my big book of CD's, but I pulled it out recently and added it to the smaller book of favorites in my car. More than halfway thru a trip from Louisiana to Tennessee, we listened to it, and I rediscovered what a perfect record it is.  From the attention-grabbing opening accordion chords of \\"Boy in the Bubble\\" to the enigmatic closer \\"The Myth of Fingerprints\\" Simon fuses American (pop, rock, country and zydeco) with the music of Africa (particularly South Africa) to create an unmatched listening experience.  The title track makes you think about the nature of love; \\"I Know What I Know\\" and \\"Gumboots\\" merge South African music and rhythms with American lyrics; \\"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\\" again takes an African beat, but the story could take place anywhere; \\"Homeless\\" and \\"Under African Skies\\" move the whole scene to Africa.  I don't know instruments well enough to list the seemingly countless assortment that Simon included.  This review doesn't do justice to \\"Graceland\\", a great CD.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|\\"World Trade Center\\" is the 2nd film released in 2006 to dramatize the events that transpired on September 11, 2001 (one of the most tragic days in United States history). Released a few months after the harrowing, depressing \\"United 93\\" this film also tells the story of normal, everyday people trapped in horrific circumstances with heroic outcomes. Although the outcome of this film is admittedly better than that of \\"United 93.\\" The film is directed by Oliver Stone, a director who is no stranger to controversy. When I heard he was doing a film on the subject of 9/11, I expected a film in the vein of \\"JFK\\" or \\"Nixon\\" <br />or \\"The Doors.\\" True stories, with his own theories and versions of events. Watching \\"World Trade Center\\" there is little evidence to suggest that this is an Oliver Stone film. The directing style is different, the storytelling is different. Only one scene seems like something out of an Oliver Stone film (Jesus with a water bottle) and I read that Will Jimeno actually saw that. The movie starts at 3:29 A.M. in New York, as Port Authority officer John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) wakes up to head to work. Stone does a great job of underlining how normal the day was for New Yorkers before the first plane hit the first tower. The imagery of the plane's shadow and the smoke from the towers is very haunting and very realistic. Knowing what we now know, it's interesting hearing the characters trying to figure out what's going on. Anyway, after the second plane has hit the second tower (although most people weren't yet aware of that), McLoughlin and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena from \\"Crash\\" who deserves an Oscar nomination for his work here), along with others, rush into the WTC to help the people still inside. Barely inside the towers collapse, leaving McLoughlin and Jimeno trapped under 20 feet of rubble. The two men trapped under the rubble, trying desperately to keep their minds off death is intercut with the lives of their wives. Donna McLoughlin (Maria Bello, who also deserves an Oscar nomination) fights desperately against the fact that her husband might be dead, while trying to convince her children that, without a doubt, their father is still alive. Meanwhile Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who also deserves an Oscar nomination), who is pregnant with the couples second child, deals with the fact that her husband might not be coming home. Out of the two female leads, Bello is the best. Wearing blue contact lenses to make her character more realistic, she blends just the right amount of integrity, bravery, and attitude to make this one of the best performances of the year. One other subplot involves a former U.S. Marine named Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), a man who leaves his job and goes searching for survivors in the rubble. While \\"United 93\\" used harsh realism and left you feeling depressed, \\"World Trade Center\\" uses harsh realism and makes you feel uplifted. A film about people trapped in places can feel disjointed, as if the screenwriter lost his way and made excuses to get his script into the 120-page range (this can be seen in a film called \\"Hard Candy,\\" which is good but has what I just mentioned). This film has the feel of a movie that knew exactly what direction it's taking from the beginning. \\"World Trade Center\\" is an important film, a great film, and a massive improvement over Stone's last film \\"Alexander.\\" It's got great cinematography, great performances, and is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B00005JP9V|2.0|and i don't know why people, critics or viewers, would give this movie a such high praise. through out the whole movie, so many old cliched scenes appeared in other futuristic movies, blade runner, the fugitive, the witness...and lot of others have sneakily churned and mixed into this clueless movie. in 2037, people are still driving 30 years ago old car, the weaponries used to fight each other are still the same. the only difference in 2037's england, the rebels are mainly naturalized or illegal arabic muslins? human beings lose the ability of fertility and one black young woman got pregnant and it's a miracle and the only hope of human beings and civilization? why england and all the other countries fall into chaos, why? just because nobody can have kids anymore? what a ridiculous scenario is this? why almost all the futuristic movies only painted the future so hopeless and so dark? the guy's ex-wife is an activist, a rebel, but for what? against what? how the h..l that black woman got pregnant? why a group of the rebels at first want to save her and later want to kill her? what is the purpose of michael cain's hippy role? owen escorts the pregnant woman running away from....?<br />then hit by a bullet in the last escape scene, dies in the small boat, then a ship named 'tomorrow' appears in the fog...well, symbolize the human civilization still has hope, just by one kid? does it mean only this black young woman could conceive and she would produce more babies? why 99.9999999...% women lost the ability of pregnancy? does it mean that all the men cannot produce sperms anymore? or all the women cannot produce eggs anymore, they lose the periods, the menstrocycle pregnancy would totally lose around 2037? what caused it? or is it possible that only all the women except one have lost their fertilities but all the men still got their sperms produced normally? or all the men and women have both lost their abilities to produce their next generations? if just one woman and a man could bear child, where's that man? because without that man, that woman could only have one child, either male or female, she or he still cannot produce off-springs. but if that man could be found and could keep that woman pregnant many times, their children then had to commit incest to produce the next generation. if all the other women lost their pregnancy ability and only that woman still has the fertility ability, and all the men still have the ability to produce sperms, they could make and keep this woman continue to pregnant, there still got the incest problem ahead in the future. but if you believe we were all came from adam and eve, then we have to accept the fact that we are all the product of a long history of incest. can you accept such fact?<br />the other logic question i'd like to ask the screenwriters and the director is this: if all the men and women lost their abilities to have kids, they definitely would have lost their hope and would have definitely lost the urge to fight, because why people fight? why people become so selfish and so greedy? because they would like to and have to accumulate more money, more belongings for their next generation, the more, the better. if without children, without their offsprings, what's the purpose of doing anything? becasue their lives would be the last existences on earth, there would be no sense of trying to do anything anymore albeit fighting against each other or one another, it would be totally senseless and meaningless.<br />this is such a stupid movie based on an absolutely illogic premise and scenario. to think how great, how meaningful this movie is would just prove that the way of your think is illogic and senseless.<br />as to this movie itself, you better think about it again, there's nothing new but cliched scene after scene, chasing, fighting, escaping, riot, bombing, bloody gory...so just tell me what else is new? eh...well, you see, the only hope of the human beings is saved by a group of more sensible and generous arabic muslin immigrants. other than this, there's nothing worth mentioning here.generous arabic muslin immigrants. other than this, there's nothing worth mentioning here.
B0000027FQ|4.0|This was Accept recorded live on the 'Metal Heart' tour and it is exceptional. I love this band so there is very little they could do wrong.All the hits are here \\"Balls To The Wall\\" \\"Love Child\\" \\"Breaker\\" \\"London Leatherboys\\" and my personal Accept favorite \\"Screaming For A Love Bite\\"! The production is top notch,all the instruments are clear,Udo's voice is as cutting and perfect as ever,in fact I can't really think of a thing wrong with this. In my opinion,this is a far superior release to \\"The Last Chapter\\" although I know many would disagree with me..yes the later live album is longer and has more songs but it also contains filler material where as \\"Staying A Life\\" has one great song after another. If you love heavy music I highly recommend this,it feels like you are truly at an Accept concert and that's the way any live album should be!<br /><br />The Upside - All their best songs,including many from \\"Metal Heart\\" and \\"Balls To The Wall\\",excellant production and it's available for a great price!<br /><br />The Downside - I honestly can't think of any<br /><br />The Bottom Line - Play this at maximum volume,turn down the lights,and you'll swear you are in the front row. This is heavy rock at it's finest.The Donutman says so!!!
0743454537|2.0|This book was extremely well written and gripping...until the end. The conclusion was just unnecessary.  Not the tearjerker type of book where you get a good cry.  This was just cruel and meaningless. It seemed the only reason for this type of conclusion was shock value.  Since this book I am scared to pick up another Jodi Picoult. This book ruined it for me.I loved a Perfect Match and had mixed feelings about The Pact, but this is it. I will not read another Jodi Picoult book unless it comes with a disclaimer.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|Great album if your into melodic death metal. musically this album is great, a bit slower paced and melodic than their earlier stuff but just as good if not one of there best releases. Hegg's vocals are one of the best in the genre, and amazingly he's understandable most of the time while still being brutal. favorite songs are Runes to my memory, astapor, gods of war arise, and cry of the blackbirds, although all the songs are good, no a bad one on here.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is an awesome album.After the not-so Magickal Mystery Tour,they decided to get back to the music,and no theatrics.Many people associate this album with Charles Manson.How anyone could link a song about a British playground slide to racial revolution is quite amusingly outlandish.Many of the songs were written on their trip to India, to visit the guru.Also Mia (O'Sullivan)Farrow and pop-star Dovovan went along to the Maharishi's ashram for spiritual enlightenment.Mia's sister was having growing pains and typical teeny troubles,and thought going on the journey to the Far East, would help.John and Paul wanting to help cheer her up,penned a song for her.Hence,the song ,'Dear Prudence'.The song 'Bungaloo Bill' was written for Ravi's mahout.Yet,whether they saw him shoot a mad elephant is not known.John most probably read ,'Shooting an Elephant',by George Orwell.Which helped him develop the song,\\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\".- Pete Best was bested out a few years earlier,in 1962.Best's mother was the daughter of a ranking Indian-British diplomat,who was seen as a servile boot-licker.A lackey of the British Empire,John Lennon must have thought.Pete later became a qualified civil servant himself.If you know the history ,behind the music,it adds to the listening experience.Happy Xmass !Updated: Feb.6th.2008.==The Maharishi Yogi,the Beatles' spiritual guru leader and the inspiration for their \\"White Album',died of natural causes today.He passed over at the ripe age of 91,in his adopted homeland of Holland.
B0002S94OS|3.0|i got this album about a year or so ago because i heard they were pretty good, and read a few reviews that said these guys were good. Well i was a bit dissapointed when i first listened to it, and still am.  Although they aren't terrible or anything, it just all seems kinda bland.  Gave it 3 stars because the music isn't all that bad, but the vocals kinda blow in my opinion, sounds like he's trying to hard. And dont think its because i like clean vocals, i generally don't, i listen to stuff thats alot more harsh/undicipherable then this that sounds better. My advice is listen before you buy, and if you like it, enjoy, if not remember there is alot of stuff out there better than LOG
0316779989|3.0|The lead story in this book is hysterical, and was definately the best of the group.  The author has a great style, inserting creative names and products throughout his writing to make humorous points and help the reader laugh at some of the idiocies of the holiday season.  I especially enjoyed both the lead story (about working as en elf in Macy's during the holidays) and the story about school Christmas pageants.  Both left me laughing at the holiday and feeling cheerful about the season.<br /><br />The remaining stories were not as enjoyable, and a bit dark, especially when dealing with the death of an infant and the plight of the poor.  While amusing, they did not express the holiday spirit in a way I was looking for as I read the book on Christmas Eve.  The last story I found somewhat tasteless, though it started well and had some exceptionally funny lines.<br /><br />Overall, a book with very funny lines from a funny author, but not a \\"feel good\\" Christmas humor book like I had hoped for.

0393316041|5.0|I affirm the positive comments of the other reviewers. I am a truck driver and dairy farmer and just finished the books on tape version of this book. I want to run away to graduate school and get at PHD in physics. I hated science in school. <br /> <br />I especialy recommend this book because it affirms  true learning. It really doesn't start until you fall in love with a subject and go after it just for the fun of it and for the most part on your own. Much of the book is about his love of physics and scientific exploration. He touches upon how to do education wrong with his stories about science education in Brazil and his  work selecting K-12 science texts for the LA school system. My independent road of becoming a dairy farmer affirms his thinking, and I am so glad I did not try to get an Ag degree.

He was heard on radio and seen in comic books.  In 1941, a brief cartoon of Superman was shown in the movie theaters with the voice of Bud Collyer as &#34;Superman&#34;.<br />  Kirk Alyn made his appearance as &#34;Superman&#34; in 1948 with Noel Neill as &#34;Lois Lane&#34;.<br />  Superman returned again in the form of George Reeves as Clark Kent/Superman in &#34;Adventures of Superman&#34; (1952-58).  Noel Neill returned as &#34;Lois Lane&#34; and Jack Larson began as &#34;Jimmy Olsen&#34;.  George Reeves was growing tired of playing &#34;Superman&#34; and was upset that he would be typecast.  He committed suicide, June 16 1959.  This was dramatized in the motion picture, Hollywoodland (2006).<br />  The most poignant motion picture of &#34;Superman&#34; came in 1978 with Christopher Reeve (no relation to George) in the title role.  He had been an actor on the soap opera &#34;Love of Life&#34;.<br />  [[ASIN:B001EBWIT0 Superman: The Movie (1978)]] was a super-hit with Christopher Reeve and three more movies were made with him:<br /> [[ASIN:B001I9OI9Q Superman II]] (1980).<br /> [[ASIN:B000QD3YAO Superman III (1983)]] (1983.)<br />[[ASIN:B000ION23U Supergirl]] (1984).<br /> [[ASIN:B000IJ79XE Superman IV - The Quest for Peace (Deluxe Edition)]] (1987).<br /><br />  In 1995, Christopher Reeve was in a debilitating horse-riding accident that left him paralyzed from the neck-down. He needed the assistance of a breathing-machine so he could breathe.  With improvement, he was able to act again wheel-chair bound and even appeared in a couple &#34;Smallville&#34; tv-episodes.  Reeve died October 10, 2004.<br />  On August 14, 2004, Brandon Routh was told he was the new &#34;Superman&#34;. He used to appear on soap operas, One Life To Live (2001-02), Port Charles (2001-02), General Hospital (2002-03).<br /><br />  Superman has been away for 5 years to find out the truth about his birth planet, Krypton.<br />  He arrives back to Earth in the same way he arrived as a toddler.

B00005JOLK|3.0|Eragon finds a stone while hunting for deer in the forest. Its an egg, in fact, a dragon egg, and it decides to hatch and mark Eragon as its rider. There aren't many dragons left in Eragon's world, and the ruler (who rules because of his own dragon) wants any other riders out of the way... <br /> <br />I thought it was pretty decent at the time, but the more I think about it, the less I know why. There's mention of elves and such, but the only fantasy characters seen are the dragon and a couple of soldier-types. I've got a couple of plot questions as well. <br /> <br />It's okay, not terribly inspiring though.
B000FSME1A|5.0|A.N. (Apocalypse Now) has to be one of the most wonderfully eccentric efforts among the great movies. Coppola's personal homage to the intensely idiosyncratic and pessimistic Conrad novella about an educated and culturally refined white explorer who reverts to barbarism, the movie is no different from its inspiration.<br /><br />The whole movie is a metaphor for the dark and violent side of human nature that our fragile \\"civilization\\" is supposed to have supplanted, but cannot destroy. In the book, Kurtz reverts to his baser, more primitive, and barbarous nature, unable to resist the allure of the dark side. In the movie, the characters are no different, and the thin veneer of civilization is seen to be just that, a superficial and even false facade below which lurk the repressed but unspeakable and forbidden urges that modern civilization is supposed to have conquered but really has only temporarily repressed.<br /><br />Symbolizing that fact, a brooding, tenebrous, oily pall of a mood hangs over the whole movie like a dark curtain, infusing it with the hallucinatory ambience of a premonitory and nightmarish dream, similar to the great Renaissance artist, Beccafumi's paintings--whom Conrad would have appreciated as a kindred spirit.<br /><br />Even the actors sometimes seem like they're walking around in a waking nightmare, with the great Brando emerging from his cave like some strange homunculus crawling out of a Medieval bestiary. He seems reluctant to even speak his lines, as if not wanting to disturb the gloomy, introspective mood of the movie, contrasting with the voluble Dennis Hopper's character. A.N. is a magnificent, sprawling, dark, brooding, and intensely personal vision of a movie that people probably either love or hate, but whatever its ultimate fate, it stands as one of the great movies of its decade.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|This movie is great; very well organized, script is wonderfully written, the soundtrack is awesome, the performances are terrific, and the way that the story is presented is incredible.  It will captivate your attention from beginning to end.  It is Biblically and historically accurate.  The movie is very violent, but there are popular video games that are more violent and the content of James Bond movies are worse than the Passion of the Christ. <br /> <br />The movie has some parts that are not mentioned in the Bible, or history, but do bring the movie to life and/or help develop the Gospel in the movie.  For instance, in the movie, Satan follows Jesus the whole way trying to tempt Jesus not to die on the cross so that Jesus would not provide salvation from sin, and when Jesus dies, Satan is screaming from Hell because he realizes that he has lost the war. <br /> <br />While I may not agree with all the little details, I whole-heartedly agree with the Big Picture presented in the movie.  Jesus Christ is not just presented as a good man and good moral teacher; but also as the Son of God, Savior and Redeemer of the world, the promised Messiah, Sovereign Ruler of the University, and descendant of Israel's King David and the future King of the Jews who will restore the throne of David forever. <br /> <br />When I first saw that Hollywood was making a movie about the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ, I thought, `Oh no, here comes another secular version of Jesus.'  But when I saw the movie in theaters, I was blown away. <br /> <br />Christians can definitely use the Passion of the Christ as a witnessing tool.  The movie does not present the whole Gospel.  There are lots of little abstract lines, such as: when Jesus is carrying the cross, he says to his mother, \\"I am making all things new.\\"  The movie does not thoroughly explain the whole story, but it presents a good part of it.  Therefore, Christians must be ready to explain the rest.  <br /> <br />`The Passion of the Christ' has been called anti-Jewish; but it is no more anti-Jewish than `Schindler's List' is anti-German.  Is Tolstoy's `War and Peace' anti-French?  Is James Fennimore Cooper's `Last of the Mohicans' anti-American Indian?  Is `Red Dawn' anti-Russian?  Is Orwell's `1984' racist toward anyone?  I believe the answer is `no'.  For all of the Jews and Gentiles who condemned Jesus, a significant number believed that Jesus Christ was innocent and followed him.  Besides, despite all that happened, Jesus willingly went through everything. <br /> <br />Anyone who truly understands the Christian Bible will understand that the Jews, who are also the children of Israel, are God's chosen people forever, (Gen. 15:18, Gen. 17, Ex. 6:4-5, Lev. 26:42-45, Deut. 4:31, Deut. 4:37, Deut. 5:2-3, Deut. 7:9, Deut. 8:18, Deut. 10:15, Jud. 2:1, 2Sa. 7:24, 2Kings 13:23, 1Ch. 16:15-17, 1Ch 17:22, Ps. 105:8-10, Isa. 54:10, Jer. 30:9, Jer. 31:33, Eze. 20:5, Eze. 37:19-28, Da. 11:32, Hos. 1:17, Hos. 3:5, Zeph. 2:7, Zech. 10:6, Zech. 12:5).  God spoke of the children of Israel when he said \\"They will be my people and I will be their God,\\" (Gen. 17:8, Ex. 29:45-46, Lev. 26:12, 2Sa 7:24, 1Ch. 17:22, 2Ch 6:1-11, Ps. 50:7, Jer. 7:23, Jer. 11:4, Jer. 24:7, Jer. 30:9, Jer. 30:22, Jer. 31:1, Jer. 31:33, Jer.32:38, Jer. 50:4, Eze. 11:20, Eze. 14:9-11, Eze. 34:24, Eze. 34:30, Eze. 36:28, Eze. 37:12-13, Eze. 37:23, Eze. 37:27, Eze. 39:7, Hos. 1:10, Hos. 2:23, Joel 2:26-27, Zeph. 2:9, Zech. 8:8, Zech. 10:6, Zech. 13:9).  Moses also spoke of the promised Messiah when he said to Israel, \\"God will raise up another prophet like me from among you,\\" (Deut. 18:15).  God spoke through the prophet Isaiah about the Messiah when he said \\"It is too small a task for my Holy One to redeem Israel, I shall make him a light to the Gentiles,\\" (Isa. 49:6-7).  Jesus Christ said of the Law of Moses and the prophets, \\"I have not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it,\\" (Matt. 5:17). <br /> <br />Many of us are familiar with Mel Gibson's recent law violation, when he was pulled over for drunk driving and then slandered the Jewish people.  I do not hold it against him since he was quick to confess and admit he was wrong; he asked for forgiveness; he agreed to restitution and he is working to not make the same mistake again.  I hope other people will forgive him too. <br /> <br />This is a great movie for everyone regardless of age, race, or creed.  Since it is violent, Parents should watch this movie before allowing children under 14 to watch it.  Eastern Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Atheists, Agnostics, Homosexuals, Humanists, Animists and even Satan worshippers should watch the Passion of the Christ. <br /> <br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" will stand alongside with other epics like \\"The Ten Commandments\\" <br />
B000E6ESL2|4.0|A significant trait of intelligence is the capability of abstract thought. It's what separates human beings from every other animal. High level abstract thought also separates the Everybody Loves Raymond crowd from those who are actually capable of following along with something that is slightly more complex than a Fisher-Price toy. <br /> <br />That said, this movie is not enormously complex. You will catch on partway through and by the end everything will make sense. This isn't Mulholland Drive. This isn't something that will take you hours, days or weeks to understand or even require someone else to explain to you. And if you watch it a second time, you will pick up on significant transitions and dialog that lend a lot of impact to the story. <br /> <br />Anyone who would call this an \\"artsy fartsy\\" film has probably strayed out of the comfort zone of the Disney DVD section and should go back. Just because this isn't Arnold shooting bad guys who \\"hate freedom\\" or some skittish chick running from a big spooky ghost doesn't make it \\"artsy\\". <br /> <br />Anyone capable of abstract thought and at least some minor degree of introspection can see the cleverness and beauty of this movie and the surreal sense of what it represents. That a lifetime in whatever conceived reality it is experienced, can exist in a few passing and final moments.

B00005JOIH|5.0|Of all of Spielberg's serious films, the ones that get the most attention are Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. The former was a masterpiece, a true testament that he's more than a blockbuster director responsible for directing Jaws and Jurassic Park. The latter was an unflinching look into war during World War II but I preferred Schindler's List better. That is until Munich where sure it didn't have the impact of the other 2 but as overall film, I find myself wanting to watch this again which is rare since the other 2 didn't even do that. While it does have its problems, the story and the filmmaking talent on hand prove to me Munich should've won Best Picture. <br /> <br />The story is based on one of those \\"it could've happened/might not have happened\\" stories so it's purely speculative and dramatized. During the 1972 Olympic Games, terrorists held athletes of the Israeli Olympic team hostage. Eventually all 11 were killed so the government wanted those responsible brought to justice. They get Avner, the Prime Minister's former bodyguard, to lead the way with a team of 4 to track down those responsible. What they find though is that this is not a battle easily won and there's more on the line than just casualties. <br /> <br />After shooting the cool-but-immensely-flawed War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg jumped right in and shot Munich incredibly quickly. The result was an incredibly captivating look into how we try to fix the world's heavy problems but finding it too difficult to know when it'll end. The fact it's not an incoherent mess is one thing, but the fact it's to me one of his best films is quite a feat. You can always count on him to have memorable images and certain scenes, such as a scene entirely in silence is riveting while a transition from a bullet-riddled wall to rain against a window is just as great. <br /> <br />The casting is quite dead-on too with the standout being Eric Bana. He had the right idea with Hulk but it was probably justthe direction for that movie but here he seems quite tortured but then you see someone get back some of that humanity he feels he's losing when his daughter calls him \\"daddy\\". We also have the current Bond Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz (the boyfriend in Amelie) as well as Geoffrey Rush who plays Avner's \\"handler\\" in a way. Also some attention to little-known Ayelet Zorer playing Avner's wife. <br /> <br />One thing that's been increasingly in popularity is the dual releases where we have just the bare-bones version, usually with awful cover art while we have the 2-disc special/collector/ultimate edition but oddly Munich was barely made available. While I can still find Lemony Snickett or War of the Worlds, Munich didn't seem like a lot of copies were sent out, in fact most stores hadn't even heard of them here. So if this one is what you want, either hunt like mad or just order online since it's a worthwhile one to get, unless they forgot to put something and they'll be a super edition later on. <br /> <br />Probably won't have the massive acclaim and staying power of Schindler and Private Ryan in public's eye but this is one film that I wouldn't pass up.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|This movie sure takes the viewer on a wild ride, this film had so many<br /><br />interesting sets and I really got into the darkness episodes, although<br /><br />it didn't make alot of sense in places, it makes up for the lack of a plot, just how you'd want to throw a \\"plot\\" into this disorientation, I<br /><br />didn't want a plot, I felt like it was a big maze and one eye-opener set of visuals after the other, kept me clued to this film. Very graphic in spots, fire and brimstone, dig the wardrope designs on this movie, and the soundtrack music<br /><br />was industrial doom and led you along.  Atmospheric and well acted, this film<br /><br />has some of the best dreamlike direction I've seen in the horror genre<br /><br />in quite awhile. Those horror movie buffs raised on  killer slasher movies<br /><br />with blood and sexual atmosphere will most likely be bored with this<br /><br />one, I like the unpredictable chills and the creatures, bugs, were well<br /><br />done. I know this comes from the video game which I have not experienced,<br /><br />its done fine with me on it own merit.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I really like this flash unit.  The reason is simple: it is small and unobtrusive.  Most flashes add weight and bulk to a camera, and I often find myself deciding not to attach the outboard flash to my DSLR.  This flash, by contrast, is small and barely noticeable on my D80 or D200.<br /><br />This is a no-frills flash that simply does its job and does it quite well.  It supports Nikon's excellent iTTL flash system.  Granted, if you are shooting a wedding or some other professional engagement, this would not be the flash of choice; the SB600 or SB800 would do better.  But for casual shooting where more than the built-in flash is needed, this unit is extremely nice to have.  And of course by using this unit instead of the built-in flash of one's camera, the user can get more shots from the camera since the flash does not drain the camera batteries.<br /><br />The unit uses convenient AA batteries, which of course are readily available. I'll take this over those sometimes hard-to-find exotic batteries that some flashes use. It is well-constructed and with a guide number of 21, does a good job.  Highly recommended.
B000I0QLZU|4.0|Lara Croft started out as a videogame heroine in Core Design's TOMB RAIDER series, which at last count has six sequels on the shelves spread over 1996 to the present.  She's a world-class traveler, an expert in history and looting tombs (although with only good intentions), a martial arts expert and fantastic pistol marksman.  She's also good at jumping and solving puzzles.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie does a terrific job of bringing the physical side of Lara to the silver screen, and she's beautiful to look at.  Jon Voight, Angelina's real father, plays her father in the movie.  Iain Glen plays the villain, Mandred Powell, who's working for the Illuminati, the secret society devoted to conquering the world for their own nefarious purposes.  Noah Taylor plays Bryce, Lara's computer-savvy partner-in-crime.  Daniel Craig delivers a lukewarm performance as Alex West, a rival tomb raider who has shared romance with Lara in the past.  Simon West directs.<br /><br />The movie opens up with a blistering action piece that sums up what a lot of the Tomb Raider games were all about.  An all-out fight and escape inside a tomb with guns blazing.  Then the story segues to Lara hurting over the anniversary of her father's death and finding a mysterious clock that her father left for her.  The planets are due to line up in one week, and the clock will lead her a powerful artifact that can stop time itself.  Then Lara is up to her pretty little neck in bad guys and the race is on to find the two pieces of the Triangle of Light.<br /><br />Although the action is fast and furious, it's light on characterization.  We don't really get to know much about Lara that wasn't revealed in the games.  And the bad guys are just evil, would-be world conquerors that can be gotten out of any ARE WE NOT VILLAINS catalogue.<br /><br />TOMB RAIDER succeeds as a great B-movie, but it isn't anything more than that.  It's a chance to see a wellknown videogame heroine strut her stuff with awesome special effects and beautiful surroundings and authentic looking backgrounds.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of the movie is beautiful to watch.  Everything is so clear it looks like you're watching picture postcards in motion.  If you like the movie and own a Blu-ray player, this is definitely one of the movies you'll want to upgrade to in this format.ecial effects and beautiful surroundings and authentic looking backgrounds. <br /> <br />The Blu-ray version of the movie is beautiful to watch.

0790731509|4.0|The rebel character in Hollywood after the death of James Dean went through a period of transition and did not gain definite new characteristics until the late sixties...<br /><br />The three established rebel/anti-heroes in movies were Paul Newman, Warren Beatty, and Steve McQueen...<br /><br />In 1967, screen audiences were exposed to two new rebel hero characters, Clyde Barrow, a rebel without a cause with enough guts to strike out against any bank, and Luke Jackson, an anti-hero 'born to lose,' but a man full of pride and dignity...<br /><br />\\"Cool Hand Luke\\" resumes Newman's career as another rebel, a non-conformist, a perfect hero who beats the system wherever...<br /><br />Superbly directed by Stuart Rosenberg, Newman exhibits a complete arrangement of emotions invading every nuance and implication... Resources of his true command of his technical acting are breathtaking in their impact... The motion picture (nominated for 4 Academy Awards) won him his 4th Academy Award nomination...<br /><br />Newman is again a cynical loner, but he's also charming, and everything is calculated to involve us with him; like \\"Hombre,\\" the film begins and ends with closeups of his face, but here, appropriately, he has an engaging smile...<br /><br />The opening, where he drinks beer, unscrews tops from parking meters and mumbles to the arriving cop, recalls Dean's drunken incoherence at the start of \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\"--an apt title for Luke... He breaks rules for no apparent reason, wherever he is, including the chain gang to which he's sentenced...<br /><br />Unlike Paul Muni in \\"I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,\\" who steals only to eat and is turned by society into a hardened criminal, Luke is a criminal from the start, and his crime isn't motivated by hunger... It's a meaningless anti-authority gesture--the existentialist \\"gratuitous act,\\" committed purely for the sake of committing it... Luke engages our sympathy not because he is economically deprived or the product of an unhappy home, but because for him the act of rebellion is its own justification: he's the perfect sixties hero...<br /><br />Initially, Luke alienates the prisoners by his indifference and sarcasm, and the top dog, Dragline (George Kennedy) picks a fight with him... Luke is severely beaten but keeps fighting, and this--plus his continual defiance of the guards--wins him the men's respect... Their admiration grows when he proves he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs, one after the other, in only one hour, another gratuitous act (\\"somethin' to do\\").<br /><br />But Luke gradually becomes a victim of the excessive admiration, rebelling because they expect him to, which leads to a pattern of escapes and captures... As the warden says, \\"What we got here is a failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach.\\" Even though Luke becomes subservient after torture, he again escapes... Dragline admires the way he fooled the guards while planning all along to escape... But Luke says he really did break down, and asserts: \\"l never planned anything in my life.\\" Even his last act is motivated not by heroism but by impulse...<br /><br />The physical punishment Newman's characters often undergo reaches an extreme here, as Luke constantly invites pain (in his fight with Dragline, he says, \\"You're gonna have to kill me.\\"). Underlying his sometimes vigorous rebelliousness is despair at a cruelly indifferent world... But the men need a hero, and Dragline perpetuates the myth, telling them that he had \\"that Luke smile\\" to the very end... We last see a montage of shots of Luke smiling--the men's vision of him as unbeaten and almost immortal...<br /><br />Newman's performance is among his best, and Luke is one of his definitive studies of non conformism... As in \\"Hombre,\\" he underplays, but in a loose, relaxed, \\"cool\\" manner... He's affecting in a wide range of moods: quiet detachment, wry contempt, raw courage, exhaustion, exuberance, gentleness, anger, resignation...<br /><br />There's a superb1y understated scene in which Luke's dying mother (Jo Van Fleet) visits him... Like Rocky Graziano, he says he tried to live cleanly, but could never find a way... But the mood is quite different here: instead of intense emotion, there are on1y ingenious expressions of uneasiness, regret, sadness, acceptance... Newman conveys his unspoken affection entirely through his glances and reactions, as she wistfully remarks that she once had high hopes for him...<br /><br />The actor even survives the film's pretentious attempts to make him a mock-Christ figure... Besides the obvious sacrifice-resurrection parallel, he's even shown in the exact crucifixion position following his fifty-egg (Last Supper?) ordeal... There are two badly conceived dialogs with a God he doesn't believe in--after which he realizes, \\"l gotta find my own way,\\" a rather unconcealed statement of existential despair--but Newman performs them with quiet conviction....<br /><br />His mock religion is better suggested by the bottle opener he wears in lieu of a religious medal... And the despair is effectively dramatized in his reaction to his mother's death... The men leave him by himself, and he sits on his bed, playing the banjo... With a sad, breaking voice, he sings a religious parody: \\"l don't care if it rains or freezes, long as 1 got my plastic Jesus...\\" He looks down and begins crying, but sings faster, obsessively, withdrawing into himself and expressing his utter loneliness in a world that has no God... It's one of the most moving scenes in all of Newman's work...<br /><br />Paralleled to \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" is a character study, which works beautifully, very well-made with sense of graphic imagery and cinema view, a good-looking film with superb photography in Color, extremely good as an entertainment...nation...  <br /> <br />There's a superb1y understated scene in which Luke's dying mother (Jo Van Fleet) visits him...

B000G8P1VE|3.0|NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE was the first of the disgusting, obnoxious college movies that quickly poured out onto the silver screen to occupy the short attention spans of the teens and twenty-somethings.  It also introduced the idea of toga parties, which had never really been part of the college experience before then.<br /><br />It was also John Belushi's first film and launched a successful career there until his unfortunate death.  The movie was also a very young Kevin Bacon's first screen role, and it played host to an ensemble of actors and actresses.  NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE also has the dubious honor of being the most cheaply made film ($3million) to ever make as much of a profit percentage as it did.<br /><br />As with all college films of this ilk, there's an ongoing rivalry between the obnoxious fraternity house and the Dean.  This one is well done, developed, and executed.<br /><br />Although it doesn't quite stand the test of time because of the film's fading and the slower pace of the movies made back in 1978, you can see the germs of all the best ideas that spawned VAN WILDER, P.U., and dozens of other films.<br /><br />Some of the gags have to be seen.  You just don't get as much impact hearing about them.  Such as the dead horse in the Dean's office and the chain saw moment.<br /><br />However, the HD DVD format simply doesn't work well enough to warrant buying the additional disc if you've already got it in your movie library.  The intro music sounds great through the surround sound system, but it quickly pales as the movie begins.  Also, the video looks faded and poor, not much upgraded from the original version that's also included on the disc.  All things considered, though, this is probably the best that could have been done because the film stock from those years didn't necessarily fare well over the years.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|The movie opens with a genteel British diplomat whose hobby provides the title, falling for a fiery human-rights activist Tessa (Rachel Weisz), after she harasses him during a speech...They're soon married, and she follows him on a placement to Kenya...<br /><br />There, Justin (Ralph Fiennes) becomes increasingly uncomfortable with Tessa's strange relationship with Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kound&eacute;), a black physician, doing...well, he's not sure what...<br /><br />Suspicion of her brutal assassination soon falls on her confidant Bluhm as he was the last one seen with her, and he's now missing...<br /><br />Justin's journey for answers takes him on a tragic odyssey fraught with mystery and peril... Haunted by memories, Justin undergoes a personality change to become more assertive when he uncovers a huge conspiracy that will stop at nothing even to make money at the expense of helpless Africans, who can't fight their own fight...<br /><br />The film is visually brilliant, and the best aspect of it, is the murder mystery... Is Tessa really in love with Justin? Is she having an affair? What is she really up to?<br /><br />Based on the best-selling novel by master thriller writer John le Carr&eacute;, \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a fine love story wrapped up in a parable which has real power and it has credibility... It depicts the breach between the rich and the poor and demonstrates quite well that the world is deeply corrupt...<br /><br />Fiennes' character, Justin, is a minor member of the diplomat corps more interested in his garden than in other people, until the passionate, radical world of Rachel Weisz's Tessa turns everything on its head... Justin respected Tessa's spirit and her conviction and idealism... And because of his love for her, he had to finish what she started... Of course people don't want the information to get out and they will do anything to silence him...<br /><br />Rachel Weisz won her first Oscar on March 5th, 2006 for her impressive performance as the beautiful, kooky young woman, whose passion for her cause initially overshadows her gentle side...e performance as the beautiful, kooky young woman, whose passion for her cause initially overshadows her gentle side...  <br /> <br />

B000JRYNXE|5.0|The first time I listened to this album, I wasn't that impressed. The more and more I listen to it, the more addictive it becomes. Everyone has heard \\"Wind It Up\\" by now, some people love it and some people hate it, but this album has so much more to offer. The best songs are: \\"Yummy\\", her mellow collaboration with Pharell, \\"Sweet Escape\\", another collaboration, this time with Akon. It has a catchy pop/reggae sound. \\"Now That You Got It\\", which is probably my favorite. This is a fun song with a good beat that I could listen to over and over. Another song I could listen to again and again is the reggae-ish \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\". Last but not least, are the 80's inspired \\"Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Early Winter\\", which are both terrific songs. They're probably the best-written and her voice sounds great on these songs. I listen to these songs when I'm on the treadmill and they're so fun and upbeat, it makes the time pass very quickly.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Mostly of whom are men, it just goes to say why we women consider men in general to be a-holes. <br /> <br />This movie is beautiful, the singing is excellent and riveting, the brilliance of Andrew Lloyd Webber, well what can be said? As for Gerard Butler, do they come any hotter? I think not.  He is brilliant in this performance and his 1 1/2 yrs spending on the singing portion of this movie shows his devotion to learning and preparing his voice and then doing what needed to be done. The young 18 yr old actress in the lead role is Emmy Rossum and holds her own with the likes of hot stuff Butler and always engaging Minnie Driver (who has a much smaller role but totally fits in this movie so well).  <br /> <br />I have not and will not buy this movie. I watched it on HBO, tivo'd it, and keep it for viewing in the future. I've probably watched it a dozen times and I pick up pieces here and there that I hadn't noticed before. <br /> <br />Tell the guys to go to the sports bar and you ladies sit down cuddle up on the sofa under your afghan, candles lit, a hot cup of tea, turn your stereo speakers up and watch this movie! With your mom or your girlfriends. You'll be choked up at the beauty of this movie rendition.   <br /> <br />I must say if you are a bit older as I am, and appreciate the beauty of how movies used to be made, you'll enjoy this.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I've not been lucky enough yet to be in the same space with Ms. Mckennitt, so I'm eagerly awaiting the virtual nights at the Alhambra, via PBS. <br /> <br />She is unquestionably an original mind, a magnificent writer and certainly one of the crucial interpreters of world music on the planet.  Each of her offerings has been a course in world history for those of us who choose to follow her threads, and work out the tapestry.   <br /> <br />I'm troubled, though, by the advent onto the scene of a young woman who must be.....should be.....could be....Loreena's daughter?   I'm referring to Joanna Newsom, and perhaps you're all familiar with her, but I just came across her work 'YS' about a month ago. <br /> <br />Encapsulated, YS is a peculiar, disturbed, inward, magnificent, stunning work.  It affects me in a troubling way, because I feel this young woman might be in over her head, though her lyrics show an immersion in and a mastery of influences; some of the same ones that Loreena has found as inspiration.  Both artists seem so related, or linked, both musically and physically (by thier images), that I'm having trouble sorting it all out.  Loreena is confident traveling the world.  Joanna still seems to be in the (albeit perfectly appointed) schoolroom.  Both of them always want (and all deities bless this urge) to \\"go outside\\". <br /> <br />If they haven't met yet, they need to.  If they haven't performed together, they must consider the possibility.  Loreena is not only a scholar, but (as I said) an incomparable...voice..interpreter?....for \\"the old ways\\".  Imagine Loreena mentoring Joanna.  Or the other way around?  As mothers and daughters do.  The whole scenario makes all my little hairs stand up!!!   <br /> <br />'The Ancient Muse' is of course my major holiday gift for all my friends, no matter of what persuasion or origin.  Just as an aside, if there is anyone out there who has not yet read David Abram's 'The Spell of the Sensuous', you'd better.  It's not anew book, but it's fast becoming a classic.   <br /> <br /> <br />Surely I'm fantasizing, because I don't know about or follow anything of Ms. Kennitt's personal life....all I wait for is her next artistic effort, and I am in bliss with \\"An Ancient Muse\\".
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie is the smartest, sexiest I have seen. It's also a prime example of why I love James Spader. This man is never afraid to take a risk. Occupies a spot on my list of top ten fav's.
0307237699|3.0|A very well written book. The author mesmerizes the reader with his thoughts, ideas and suggestions on America and its future. While agreeing with the auhor's concepts, there is still something amiss; a feeling that between the lines something is not being said: on purpose, or from a perspective devoid of true focus. A recommended read for those who have hope.<br /><br />Richard Neal Huffman - author of Dreams In Blue: The Real Police
B000J4QWNQ|5.0|I was glued to my seat the entire time this movie was on. Great movie, would have loved to have seen it in the theater, but once again I fell victim to the advice of blind critics. The plot was solid, complex requiring you to pay attention to piece the story line together, the action was non-stop, and the acting was on point. Do yourself a favor buy or rent this movie and decide for yourself.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I remember listening to the opening track, Airbag, and thinking, What is this? Never heard such strange music in my life. It sounded so foreign (maybe cause I was naively used to the simplistic approach to music rather than the obscure and complicated that I now have grown to adore). Before, I was listening to a lot of Coldplay, namely A Rush of Blood to the Head, and noticing that everyone was quick to label them Radiohead-lite or a complete ripoff. So that's why I decided to check them out for myself to see what all the fuss was about. I purchased OK Computer first because the critics kept calling it a masterpiece and it was always #1 on their lists of greatest albums (Q magazine had them beat out classics like Pink Floyd and the Beatles!). Upon hearing it, I wasn't disappointed but very intrigued. My instant favorite was No Surprises because of Thom Yorke's haunting vocals, then I immediately fell in love with Karma Police (Phew, for a minute there I lost myself...). Paranoid Android was/is majestic and before I knew it I was in love with the entire album! Yes, even Fitter Happier. Climbing Up the Walls is eerie and spooky, while Let Down is simply beautiful and Electioneering is wild and crazy - which I love. The best album ever in my humble opinion. Now, I'm a HUGE Radiohead fan and they're all I can listen to at the moment. The only downside: whenever I listen to a new band I always try to compare them to Radiohead and they never seem to be good enough.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I had heard a few very good songs on this album, Blind as a Bat in particular, but I was hesitant about the other tracks. So I decided to get the album solely for those songs I knew I liked. I have to say, there are many more tracks that I enjoy now that I've had the opportunity to hear them.<br /><br />\\"Alive\\" is a very emotional, lyrically-driven song. \\"If It Ain't Broke, Break It\\" has some fantastic guitar work on it and shines as well (it is probably my favorite track on the album). \\"The Monster is Loose\\" is a pretty good song but I wish Meat Loaf would stay true to his Wagnerian/Steinman roots and shy away from heavy/nu metal. \\"If God Could Talk\\" is one of the better songs, along with the aforementioned. I love the choruses also, without them I wouldn't give this album a 3.<br /><br />Although I wish Jim Steinman and Meat Loaf had collaborated on it and wrote more, original tracks, it is a worthwhile effort. Child's songwriting ability isn't up to par with that of Steinman, but he has talent, and that especially shows through on the second track. But please, get rid of John 5. You don't need Marilyn Manson extras on your albums.<br /><br />I also commend the use of Marion Raven, Todd Rundgren, Brian May, Patti Russo (who I think has left the Meat Loaf team). I don't think Jennifer Hudson's voice is as harmonic and in sync with Meat's on \\"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be\\" but it's still a good addition. Todd Rundgren and Brian May really add something to the guitar motivated tracks.<br /><br />Any other singer/musician could not make this work. Meat Loaf is a very gifted and versatile singer who can, after 30 years, sound just as fantastic as his seminal effort. But because Meat's got so much talent he took a patchwork album and brought it to an amazing standard. Kudos to him for that and I hope he sticks with Steinman for his next album.<br /><br />My favorites: Cry Over Me, What About Love, Alive, Blind As a Bat, Bad For Good. My least favorites are In the Land of the Pig the Butcher is King (which I believe is filler, but why with 70 minutes of music?), Seize the Night, and the title track, which is a disgrace.ch I believe is filler, but why with 70 minutes of music?), Seize the Night, and the title track, which is a disgrace.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I just wanted to say that Charmed was and still is my favorite TV show.  I was upset to see that it ended so soon and to find out that 7th Heaven is still going.  I really wish that they continued it for a couple more seasons to see Phoebe and Paige have children of their own.  I found that I liked Charmed a lot better once they got rid of a certain actress.  I hope they decide to start it up again, but I doubt it.  I liked Charmed so much because it gave me an escape of reality for a while.  It gave me a break and I really go into it!  Thanks!!
6305388458|5.0|Monty Python's Life of Brian is a comedy masterpiece. It is second only to their first production, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\", but even then it is great. There are two or three scenes that are hysterically funny, the \\"Stoning scene\\" and the \\"Biggus Dickus\\" scene with the centurions. I would buy this film for those reasons right there.<br /><br />But another thing that struck a cord with me, was the scene where Brian falls off the building and the space ship miraculously saves him by picking him up and taking him for a ride. This scene was so random it was funny. Another scene, where Brian and, I believe, Judith are shown nude. It was pretty much full frontal. I didn't expect this especially when considering Holy Grail was PG, but that's exactly why it was funny. Because it was nasty. There's just something funny about 1970s British folks running around in Judea bare naked that makes me laugh.<br /><br />The opening scene with the Wise Men and the baby is also pretty funny. They always, in at least one instance, have one of Python's play a woman. And her voice is also very high. Other highlights include, the man in the jail, Pontius Pilate's speech impediment (lol), \\"we've got to haggle\\", the Stan \\"I Want to Be a Woman\\" scene, the gladiatorial games,  and \\"Look on the Bright Side of Life\\" (heck, the entire movie is gold), which is kinda ludicrous when you realize that the guy is about to get crucified. C'est la vie.<br /><br />These guys are geniuses; or, were. R.I.P. Graham Chapman. Your legacy lives on in the laughter of millions.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I LOVE THIS SWEEPER!, VERY LIGHT AND CONVENIENT.  I HARDLY USE MY FULL SIZE VACUME NOW.  HOWEVER AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF WEEKLY USE, THE BATTERY NO LONGER HOLDS IT CHARGE.  I NOW NEED TO BUY A NEW BATTERY. <br />
B00005JMYI|5.0|This movie's comedy is not everyone's cup of tea because it's very unique. This is a very random film and it takes a real lover of Will Ferrell (and a person with unique sense of humor) to laugh it \\"ow now brown cow\\" and \\"the human torch was denied a bank loan.\\" But if you like that sort of thing, then you will absolutely love this film. I did.<br /><br />Pairing David Koechner, Steve Carell and Will Ferrell made a great cast, plus the addition of many other fine actors, although I myself don't really care for Fred Armisen. Later on, Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins appear in the Battle of the Newsteams, which is one of the high points of the film. Brick Tamland (Carell) and his absolute stupidity are hilarious, like the times when he is, out of no where, just holding a grenade, when he says the most idiotic things like \\"I love lamp\\" and \\"I'm Brian Fantana\\", and when he kills the \\"guy with a trident.\\"<br /><br />I personally believe that the dialogue and the \\"Afternoon Delight\\" song are what made this film. To hear Will Ferrell's take on what \\"San Diego\\" means is highly amusing. I love everything about this film, honestly. Ferrell's rendition of \\"Aqualung\\" by J-Tull was also pretty nice.<br /><br />If you don't like random dialogue and you prefer a more intelligent comedy, don't buy or watch this film. If you like Ferrell's work in Talladega Nights (directed by the same man, Adam McKay) and his brand of comedy, then you will love this movie.
B000002ARV|5.0|Johnny Winter was poised and achieved heavy acclaim at the time of this release and his next \\"Saints @ Sinners\\" which also should not be missed for relative tight blues rock so in tune at the time....hailed as \\"comeback\\", Indeed, Still Alive and Well is a solid recording and this fine sounding CD featured tight blues from this Powerhouse Trio...An occasional mellotron (Todd Rundgren), piano and flute sweeten out the mix as the Winter band never strays from it's roots covering usual old blues covers, new tunes from the band and the occasional Stones (and bonus Dylan Cover) covers, in this case a really fine reworking of \\"Silver Train\\" that was heavily played on FM radio in New York at the time of \\"Goats Head Soup\\" while also covering the Stones \\"Let It Bleed\\"..<br /><br />Dylan's 'From A Buick 6\\" (Highway 61 Revisited)is an added workout,Rick Derringer's \\"Still Alive And Well\\" is a kicker and the sweet \\"Cheap Tequila\\" and low down accoustic \\"Too Much Seconal\\" are the standouts.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Beautiful production values enhance the entertainment value of this latest adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel. The storyline itself will win over any moviegoer, even those who usually balk at period pieces and classic literature. The characters are likeable and the sets are exquisite.<br /><br />Elizabeth and her sisters, from an impoverished family, are even more eager to make the \\"great marriage\\" that all young laides of the time were expected to find. Elizabeth, however, just can't bring herself to marry a man she doesn't respect no matter how much it helps her needy family. She surprises herself when she finds love and fortune with the man she least likes.<br /><br />Fine performances as well as a great story make this movie one not to be missed for those unfamiliar with the novels, and fans of Ms. Austen won't be disappointed with this newest remake.

B000JBXXZ4|5.0|The word of the day here is \\"consistency\\".  Since the beginning, Incubus has consistently given us album after album of innovative, clever, and all around COOL tracks.  Brandon Boyd consistently leads with celestial articulation, more so in this album than any other, I'd say.  Boyd remains one of the few male vocalists in modern rock that can not only hold a tune, but hold it well, and this album showcases his talents faultlessly.  While this album exhibits many members' skills and dexterity, it also makes their songwriting abilities LOUD and clear.  Jose Pasillas II, colliding drumsticks with cymbals and the fabric of his instrument, with Mike Einziger close behind on guitar, tearing it up as always, Ben Kenney's battering bass, and DJ Kilmore (`nuff said!) complete the seraphic dynamic that defines Incubus' experimental, memorable, and indestructible essence.    From the get-go, they have set the bar very high for themselves, as well as for any band that's looking to create something worthy of comparison to the creative, virtuosic overlords of \\"good music\\"... Incubus.  But, keeping with the word of the day, they remain consistent, all the while reinventing themselves once more for another rollercoaster of brand new sounds, styles, and emotions.    To those of you who may be left wondering if this album is, in fact, memorable... I challenge you to name two Incubus songs (from any album!) that sound alike... or, for that matter, sound like any other band around these days.  Do your ears a favor and buy this album.  It's a perfect change of pace from all the unworthy bands that somehow manage to take a seat in the limelight these days.    Incubus brings you home again.

The band color lends to getting dirty pretty quickly, but just use a toothbrush and some liquid soap under running water to clean it.  I'd recommend it, but don't run the space shuttle off its accuracy.

B000GFSY84|3.0|Hands down, this romantic comedy is a Hugh Jackman vehicle, as he totally steals the show from Meg Ryan. Jackman plays the role of the Duke of Albany, Leopold Mountbatten, an English nobleman visiting his uncle in New York in 1876. At his uncle's behest, Leopold is to find a rich socialite to marry, so that he may replenish the family's depleted coffers.<br /><br />While at a ball in his uncle's New York house, awash with rich and eager heiresses, he notices a stranger who had earlier caught his attention. He follows the stranger and finds himself in the year 2001, as he falls through a portal in time. Landing in the apartment of Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), the stranger whom he had followed, he soon meets Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's former girlfriend of four years and a modern day everywoman. Let the games begin.<br /><br />What follows is nothing earth shattering. In fact, it is pretty predictable. Leopold and Kate fall in love, though the big question is why, as there is nothing to suggest why they should. Meg Ryan does her usual Meg Ryan thing, though she is starting to get a bit little long in the tooth to be playing the brash, cutesy ingenue. She is, in fact, getting to be quite tiresome in these sorts of roles, as she plays them all exactly the same, making them virtually indistinguishable one from the other. She needs to extend her range, before her adoring public stops adoring her.<br /><br />Jackman, however, does a star turn with his gently effective and ingratiating portrayal of Leopold. He is simply sensational. Charming, handsome, and warm, with a light British accent that rings true, he is totally believable as a chivalrous gent from another time. Jackman totally upstages Ryan without meaning to do so. It is a good thing that he does. Were he not to have done so, the film would most likely have totally tanked. Clearly, Hugh Jackman is big time, leading man material.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber is unappealing as the film's erstwhile time traveler and Kate's ex-lover, Stuart Besser, who, it turns out, is the great, great grandson of the Duke. Moreover, it is not believable that Stuart and Kate would ever have dated, much less have been lovers for four years, as there is no chemistry between them. Still, it is more believable than the relationship which blossoms between Leopold and Kate. The happy ending also makes Stuart's and Kate's former relationship somewhat distasteful, if not downright incestuous, in retrospect.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is fine with an excellent performance by Breckin Meyer in the role of Charlie McKay, Kate's somewhat goofy, but lovable, cute, younger brother. Bradley Whitford of West Wing fame also gives a winning performance as J.J. Camden, Kate's smarmy boss, who ultimately has second thoughts about what constitutes professional behavior and lets the cream rise to the top, so to speak.<br /><br />All in all, this is a moderately entertaining film, all but forgettable, but for the memorable performance of Hugh Jackman.and Kate's ex-lover, Stuart Besser, who, it turns out, is the great, great grandson of the Duke.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut is great fun to watch.  I like how it is a more cohesive story and overall it's a much stronger movie.  There are problems however.  The end is ridiculous and really makes no sense.  But overall I liked this cut much better.  The only thing I thought was a little overdone was the part where Superman regains his powers.  What I really liked was the fact that they got rid of the synthesized score from the Lester cut & used the redone Williams orchestrational score to heighten the movie.  It makes it great and I liked the beginning better.  Overall this movie is better.  It is more complete, however there are some parts from the Lester cut that were good, like the scene where Lois finds out about Clark is better in the Lester cut.  Overall, I prefer the Donner cut, but it is too bad that these two filmmakers couldn't have collaberated to create a better movie, but thats the way it is.
B000CL53MW|5.0|As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on \\"Million Dollar Movie\\". I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br /><br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as \\"Kong\\", and who is, indeed, king of the island.<br /><br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious \\"Kong\\".<br /><br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious \\"Kong\\" is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of \\"Kong\\". Notwithstanding the fact that \\"Kong\\" has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br /><br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls \\"King Kong\\" and takes him back to New York with them on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, King Kong makes his debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br /><br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago. It is a truly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!Bravo!
B000005RFQ|4.0|If you're part of the \\"Ozzy is Sabbath, period\\" crowd, skip this one.  Ian Gillan claims to have been \\"the worst vocalist Sabbath ever had\\" but it is an interesting and enjoyable mix of the talents of both parties.

B000GSBBFO|3.0|This is a somewhat interesting, Dr. Kay Scarpetta mystery, replete with its usual attention to forensic detail, as well as a myriad of subplots. Though not her best novel, it still manages to entertain the reader.<br /><br />Once again, Dr. Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner, finds herself on the hunt for a serial killer, when the body of an elderly, dismembered woman is discovered in a Virginia landfill. Moreover, a mutated, high tech, variant small pox virus appears to be on the loose, and Dr. Scarpetta finds herself receiving taunting emails from the alleged killer, signing as \\"deadoc\\". Couple all this with an overly ambitious and unscrupulous law enforcement agent named Percy Ring who arrests an obviously innocent man for the elderly woman's death, and the reader has an intriguing mystery to unravel.<br /><br />Homicide Detective Pete Marino is pivotol to the success of this book. His relationship and repartee with Dr. Scarpetta contribute to many of the book's highlights, and it is he who gives dimension to the book, as he is simply a wonderful, down to earth character. Dr. Scarpetta's relationship with FBI Agent Wesley Benton is less memorable, as he is on the periphery of the story, for the most part, though in the end he provides closure for the torch Dr. Scarpetta was carrying for her ex-lover, Mark.<br /><br />The only real fly in the ointment, however, is the continued appearance of Dr. Scarpetta's niece, Lucy, who is an obnoxious character. In the real world, Lucy would not be allowed to hold the position of responsibility that she does in the book, due to her compete immaturity. She is a loose cannon waitng to misfire at any moment. It flies in the face of her professionalism that Dr. Scarpetta seems unable to fathom this, but blood is thicker than water.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat surprising, though in retrospect, the clues are, in fact, there for the reader to discern the identity of the killer. The problem is that the resolution occurs almost too abruptly, as if the author had only a limited number of pages in which to wrap it all up. While the book moves somewhat slowly for the most part, the last few chapters move at lightning speed. A better editing job may have helped make this book into a more cohesive, better written mystery. Still, Kay Scarpetta fans will find something to enjoy in this offering.oo abruptly, as if the author had only a limited number of pages in which to wrap it all up.

B000001F3C|5.0|Someone at college had recommmended the rock group U2 in 1984 and I went out and bought the casette. I know that back then I hated the church and religious people so bad that when the song \\"40\\" came on the tape, I fast-forwarded over it. Yet, I started also having weird dreams as I listened often to this cassette on my walkman. Some of these dreams I found out to be prophetic-like dropping out of my grad school the first quarter because of too much work my advisor had given me. I was Christian before I got married and started having marital problems.I guess the problems I had with my ex-wife and her family actually killed my Christian faith! Maybe, the music on the casette, which is apocalyptic in nature did start stirring up the Holy Spirit in me and I did not realize it. And on and on until after 2000 when I did my study on the Psalms I came to the 40th Psalm on which \\"40\\" is based and I had to say I was also singing a new song myself. I came around full circle religiously, so to speak. Yet they still do hate me in the church!<br />I could also say that walking to college through the snow and bare trees in the winter through the park near my apartment, the songs like NEW YEARS DAY seemed to match that mood. As well as at grad school at MSU, I remember walking down the hall of the Chem building singing SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY to myself when no one was there!<br />I think because of its references to nuclear war and the apocalypse that the Federal Pigs really hate this album! I was talking on the phone to a MSU coed in 1985-1986 and she seemed to equate music by U2 with homosexuality. But I think the artists are married men. I was in chemistry and the MSU chem department was getting big bucks from the Energy Departmement who makes the atom bomb! She used to also equate the TV series MAGNUM PI and the DUKES OF HAZZARD with homosexuality. Must be those twisted government pigs. Our minsters in America who area secretly affiliated with the pigs obviously don't want to give a bad name to the atom bomb or make us fear that muclear war might destroy the world. I know that when I had bought a U2 RATTLE AND HUM concert t-shirt from a big man's clothier, I used to get hate from older people when I went to the grocerys tore. My JAMES DEAN t-shirt also evoked hate from older people. I think it is more that just loser Toledo's \\"Midwest Mentality\\"!<br />From my military training concerning nuclear war and later from listening to Radio Moscow, I could see that Reagan was a nuclear maniac. And after leaving grad school, I joined the nuclear freeze movement-at least I was on their mailing list. And our ex-Marine mailman would make remarks as he delivered their newsletter. It looked like the FBI had inflitrated the SANE/FREEZE nuclear protest club as one newsletter had what they called \\"PEACE WITH JUSTICE DAY\\" where the featured speakers were two defectors from the Soviet Army talking about what bad people the Soviets supposedly were. I was also earlier a fan of Hal Lindsey and a believer in the End of the World and Nuclear Armageddon. So, in the end, I decided that America gets what it deserves in the end!name to the atom bomb or make us fear that muclear war might destroy the world.

B000L212HW|2.0|Reign of Fire is a film that got off to a great start and immediately fizzled thereafter. The film quite simply is about a dormant race of dragons who are awakened from their underground slumber and lay waste to the earth. Mankind is reduced to living hand to mouth in medieval like enclaves.<br /><br />The film's opening scene was quite promising. A young English boy, Quinn, visits his mother who works underground in the mines. The miners discover a mysterious, hidden shaft. There, they awaken a sleeping, fire breathing dragon, who immediately makes mince meat of those around it. Quinn and his mother try to escape, but only Quinn makes it, sheltered by his mother's body, as she makes the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />Twenty years later, the earth is a desolate wasteland. The dragons have propagated, and the skies are filled with their alien presence. Clusters of surviving humans lead a medieval, hardscrabble existence, huddled against these fire breathing monsters that prey upon them. Quinn (Christian Bale) heads such a group.<br /><br />One day, out of the blue, a group of Americans led by Denton Van Zan (a buffed up, gravelly voiced Matthew McConaughey) arrive at Quinn's enclave. There is a clash of wills and some animosity between the two groups, but ultimately Quinn and Van Zan join forces to try and change the course of history and save mankind in the process.<br /><br />Quite frankly, the movie is dull and laughable, with plot holes, bad acting, and ham handed direction. While there are some interesting special effects, this alone does not make a movie. Though ambitious, the film simply tanks, lacking the underpinnings of a good script to sustain it as it lumbers to its grand finale, breathing its last to the viewer's thankful relief.
B000HBKCDC|2.0|I want to start by saying I am a fan of Sarah McLachlan.  I have most of the albums she has recorded over the years including some on high quality vinyl.  Many of her songs are references for my listening. <br /> <br />That being said, I found this album very disappointing.  The same old melodies slowed to a funeral march.  I first listened while my wife and I were wrapping Christmas gifts.  The CD repeated a couple of times and when we were finished I realized that none of the music had really distracted me from my wrapping.  I decided I needed to listen more critically so a couple of days later I sat in my easy chair and played the CD.  My impression, overall, was poor.   <br /> <br />Her signature vocals were beautiful - as expected.  What disappointed me was the overly glum tempos and depressing interpretations of what are normally spirited and festive songs.  Christmas time (for me) has always been a time of cheerful celebration with family and friends.  The tone at my house is light and jovial with laughter carrying the day.  I found the music on the album to cast a gloomy climate.  My wife commented that she found the music actually depressing.   <br /> <br />I am one of those who does enjoy music with darker lyrics and melodies.  There are times I can sit and listen to the brooding tunes of Tori Amos, Suzanne Vega, Dave's True Story, and Sarah McLachlan herself for hours on end. . .just not in the form of Christmas music. <br /> <br />If you enjoy darker moods during the Christmas season and are a fan of McLachlan's voice you will probably enjoy this album.  Personally, as much as I enjoy her vocals, I cannot find much to like about this work.  It has seen the last play in my house. <br />
B000H5CBMI|4.0|This book recounts an amazing tale of courage, fortitude, and the will to live, despite dire circumstances. The author, Joe Simpson, and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, attempted to ascend a perilous section of the Peruvian Andes. Near the summit, tragedy struck when Joe, up over 19,000 feet, fell and hit a slope at the base of a cliff, breaking his right leg, rupturing his right knee, and shattering his right heel. Beneath him was a seemingly endless fall to the bottom.<br /><br />When Simon reached him, they both knew that the chances for getting Joe off the mountain were virtually non-existent. Yet, they fashioned a daring plan to do just that. For the next few hours, they worked in tandem through a snowstorm, and managed a risky, yet effective way of trying to lower Joe down the mountain.<br /><br />About three thousand feet down, Joe, who was still roped to Simon, dropped off an edge and found himself now free hanging in space six feet away from an ice wall, unable to reach it with his axe. The edge was over hung about fifteen feet above him. The dark outline of a crevasse lay about a hundred feet directly below him.<br /><br />Joe could not get up, and Simon could not get down. In fact, Joe's weight began to pull Simon off the mountain. So, Simon was finally forced to do the only thing he could do under the circumstances. He cut the rope, believing that he was consigning his friend to certain death. Therein lies the tale.<br /><br />What happens next is sure to make one believe in miracles. This is an absorbing read and one of the great stories in mountaineering literature.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Considered by many the best American movie, Citizen Kane is a story about a man's accumulation of immense power and betrayal of moral principles that guided that man at the beginning of his quest.<br /><br />Citizen Kane was made by RKO Pictures Inc in 1941 who gave Orson Welles freedom and resources to create this movie. Orson Welles was only 24 years old at the time. Ambitious, controversial, stubborn and strong he created this movie going through a drama outside the studio, in the real world, as intense as the drama depicted by the movie. Citizen Kane is the story of a powerful publishing magnate who started his career by managing a modest newspaper to arrive at an incredible power and influence. In the real world this character is believed to be William Randolph Hearst that inspired the creation of the character in the movie: Charles Forster Kane (played by Orson Welles).<br /><br />The main theme of the movie is about the possibility of a man to accumulate such a huge power that would transform such a person into a tyrant with unlimited means of dictating others how to live their lives and play roles that seem appropriate at the call of the moment. In the past, this fear of living in a society dominated with cruelty and caprice by a powerful magnate was present in many novels and movies created in the first half of the twentieth century. The movie might look a little bit outdated to the current situation. It is unconceivable that anyone could control the media with the same absolutism as Charles Foster Kane did. However, the psychology of possession of power remains intact and relevant today as it was a hundred years ago. The movie depicts the corruption of the soul that increasing power exerts incessantly on the successful person to the point where reality becomes an extension and a consequence of the individual will. If you become too rich (and too powerful) you loose the opportunity to become a great man.<br /><br />I liked the filming techniques Orson Welles used in the movie to create tension, emphasise a message and to manipulate perception and tunnel your focus on a particular element. There is this scene where filming camera is rising above El Rancho building, going past an electric signage, and then closing up on a skylight glass with rain pouring heavily blurring the image below, and then as if going through the glass closing in on the Susan Alexander sitting on a table covered with white cloth. There are many other settings that will get your attention throughout the movie and make you wonder how in the world they did it with no computers, but only with imagination and subtle understanding of how human perception works.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is a great movie. It is not something that will relax you, but it is a movie that will take you in the past and helps you understand a thing or two about the people that lived in that era.  You have to keep that in mind when you watch it because this is not a James Bond movie.n Welles used in the movie to create tension, emphasise a message and to manipulate perception and tunnel your focus on a particular element.

B00005JPDJ|2.0|Cameron Diaz is her usual adorable self, Kate Winslet is a bore, Jack Black is a disaster, and Jude Law is the best actor of the bunch in this film. <br /> <br />Even Cameron Diaz's looks can't save this one, it's a boring tale of three people having relationship problems that come to a head around the holidays. Diaz and Winslet's characters house swap to get away from their romantic woes, and you can predict the outcome early on. <br /> <br />Winslet's character gets involved with an old Hollywood screenwriter and his old fogey friends, which slows the film down and bored me to death.  <br /> <br />If you watch television, you have seen the the only two scenes which are mildly funny from the trailers hawking the film.  The one thing I really detest about viewing movies being billed as comedies is anticipating funny scenes that never materialize, which is what 'The Holiday' constantly achieves, it makes you feel let down and disappointed too many times. <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|1.0|My sixth grade science teacher (mid-70s) was a liberal.   <br /> <br />I learned... there was a limited supply of fresh water, which left me fearful of brushing my teeth.   <br /> <br />I learned... \\"at the present rate of consumption,\\" we were going to run out of fossil fuels by 1988.   <br /> <br />AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL.. I learned... to be an environmental activist. My teacher orchestrated protests.  We would dress in our heaviest winter outerwear and he would lead us in protests against the automobile and American industries which were causing THE COMING ICE AGE. My teacher concurred with the leading environmental experts of the time in promoting the Ash Cap Solution. We needed to cover the Polar Ice Caps in Black Ash to WARM THEM!  Everything I was taught, was wrong.  The fashions change, but the alarmist mentality of environmental extremism continues and it is given a good wash and wax for exhibition in this movie.  <br /> <br />During my screening of \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" I laughed out loud. I couldn't help myself.  I received glaring looks from ignorant audience members who know only the environment fashions of today.  However, I couldn't get the pictures out of my head of huge protests of college students marching in 70 degree weather wearing gas masks and winter coats, oh so few years ago.

B000GFLE86|5.0|I am a huge Madeleine Peyroux fan so don't expect a whole lot of objectivity from me. I love everything she sings. She has a style and persona all her own. Her sense of humor pops through at odd times. More than any other artist she is constantly being compared to Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Shirley Horn, etc. My feeling is that if you want to hear a CD that sounds like Ella Fitzgerald, go buy an Ella CD. Don't purchase a Madeleine CD and then criticize her for not sounding like Ella. When I want to listen to Nancy Wilson, I put on a Nancy Wilson CD. I don't put on Bob Seger and then criticize him for not sounding like Nancy. I suspect a lot of music listeners are stuck in a rut. When Diana Krall changed her style on Girl in the Other Room she received the same treatment except curiously she was criticised for not sounding like herself (that is, how she's supposed to sound). Singers evolve. Listeners need to do the same. Half the Perfect World is a beatifully sung and orchestrated CD. There's not a bad cut on it. Period.
B000J103PC|4.0|First things first, Meryl Streep is always great, even if the movie isn't, she always is.  Fortunately, in the case of the Devil Wears Prada, the Movie and the acting was very good.  I watched this with my wife, per her request.  I am glad that I saw the movie.  It was very enjoyable.  It did not necessarily touch the heart strings as it seemed to strive for at times, however, Meryl Streep's character stayed true the entire film.  I would recommend this movie and give it a solid 4 stars.  I am not really sure why/how anyone would give this movie one or two stars, it must be one of those like it or hate it films.  I liked it!

B00005QCYC|1.0|JP movie doesn't play without skips and jumping back to a previous scene. Buying this Universal set was the last straw for me. Th previous Universal Monsters set didn't play either. I refuse to buy another Universal DVD again. And they wouldn't replace it like Warner Bros. does.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Just got the DVD this week.  I have seen it three times already and am still laughing out loud throughout the picture.  Alan Arkin is great and the actor that plays the son is wonderful. <br /> <br />
0618680004|5.0|Though I am not quite halfway through the book, I am thoroughly enjoying it. I enthusiastically recommend it to all, but especially to people like myself, who has grappled with faith and doubt my entire life, and appreciate the clarity of thought and rigorously logical approach that Dr. Dawkins takes, as opposed to what I have been hearing throughout my life in a religious environment.  <br /> <br /> <br />I did however, have a question that I'm hoping others might weigh in on. While I have long have serious doubts about any kind of organized religion, I believe (number 2 on Dawkin's scale, page 50) that there exists some spiritual realm that we are only sometimes privy to. These sentiments are not based on blind faith - they are the product of numerous experiences. For example, a dead relative appearing sharing information that no one could possibly know. A  close friend who had a near death experience on the operating table and his remarkable story. A bizarre dream that I had that would take too long to explain. And much more. <br /> <br />None of this passes for scientific evidence, and I ask that it not be scrutinized - that simply isn't the point -- but it does, in a very personal way, point to the existence of something - a \\"soul\\" maybe, I'm not sure. I wasn't looking for this belief, and, as a mathematician, I'm not entirely comfortable with it, but too many such things have happened in my life to be ignored. <br /> <br />So what does one do when one has a very personal spiritual sense that does not point to any religion per se, but doesn't feel comfortable in the athiest camp either? Are there other readers in my boat?  <br /> <br />Last, what do you think Dr. Dawkins would say about it? <br />
B000JVT092|2.0|At best, this was a mediocre take on the Man of Steel and at worst, it was a complete dud.  I don't know anybody who loved this movie, and even those who liked it had many problems with it.  Director Bryan Singer and his writers made many questionable creative decisions in bringing Supes back to the silver screen. <br /> <br />Anybody who has seen the recent Batman, Superman and Justice League animated shows know how tremendous those are.  So now I will state the obvious question: Why don't the bigwigs over at Warner Bros. dispense with bringing in overrated big name directors such as Singer and give the reins to guys who know the material inside and out, such as animated series gurus Paul Dini and Bruce Timm?  Pick basically any individual episode of the Superman cartoon; it was better than Superman Returns.  I credit that with the knowledge of the characters.  All Singer looked at was Superman the Movie and Superman II; there's a lot more to Superman than that, and I guarantee you that Dini and Timm would not have given us a sequel, but a fresh take.  The less said about Superman Returns, the better.
B0000057C5|5.0|I've no ideas what these guys are saying, but I love the music.
0679720200|5.0|I should make it clear that I did not read the \\"americanized\\" new translation, but rather the orginal english translation that comes off as more formal.  I must say i'm rather interested in reading the other translation now, to see if the same atompshere is retained using less formal and language that may not appear as detached.<br /><br />Some how in school they skipped having us read this book sadly, as I feel that young people in particular would benefit from understanding the world of absurdity that the character of Meursault finds himself unwittingly engaged in.  In a world where stories like \\"Fight Club\\" are popular among young men, many a young man of that strain would find it very rewarding to spend sometime understanding Camus's world of Meursault, a character who's alienation in society is unavoidable, as he is just being himself.  I felt connected in a way to the character who is constantly dealing with an irrational society, but that can never completely deal with him.<br /><br />  The book reads very quickly and smoothly.  The story while very based in the mind of the character, never lets itself get over indulgent in detail, or when demonstrating its points it never comprises the flow of the story.<br /><br /> It will be a certain recommendation to others from myself from now on for sure.
B000002L80|4.0|I actually came across this album a couple years ago, but at the time I only really payed attention to the big hit, \\"And She Was.\\" Then I checked it out again, and realized that each of these songs is catchy and solid. Sure, it's not as quirky or goofy as moments in older releases, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have greatness. It does. The album especially has a good album-ending punch with \\"Television Man\\" and \\"Road to Nowhere.\\" \\"Road\\" was actually pretty unconventional compared to the remainder of the album even though it was one of the hits from the album. And yes, David Byrne sings more mid-range here. He actually does sound British at points, like in the chorus of \\"Creatures of Love.\\" Quirky lyrics like \\"I've seen sex and I think it's okay\\" and \\"I wanna make him stay up all night\\" make the album memorable. It may not be an elitist favorite but it still connects to younger people, including me, a fan who isn't even 20 yet.
0553573403|4.0|I am finishing Book Two of this series, and in looking back at Book One I can say that Martin set up the series well.  I am only giving four stars, though, because there were times as I read A Game of Thrones when I felt \\"let down\\" that certain good guys came out with the short end of the stick.  It was a little depressing that there was so much evil overcoming good.  This seemed to subside quite a bit in Book Two.<br /><br />One other aspect of the book that bothered me was that there are certain characters who at first seem good, then evil, then get depicted as good again, and then back to evil.  This continued in the second book of the series and I'm hoping that the characters become more solid in their intentions as I get ready to start Book Three.  But this vascillation DOES keep the reader guessing and gripped.<br /><br />Those two criticism aside, I really enjoyed this book.  Certain characters held my attention more than others, and I liked that Martin didn't \\"drag\\" any of the story lines.  The story \\"moved\\".  In A Game of Thrones, and continuing in Book Two, Arya's plot has been the most intriguing.  I am reading quickly to get to the chapters devoted to Arya.  Daenerys is my second favorite.  I am really pulling for these two characters as the series pushes forward.<br /><br />And for those who say this isn't \\"Fantasy\\".  You are wrong.  Unless, of course, your day-to-day life consists of the walking dead, dragons, etc.  Those things don't happen in my life, so I'm inclined to believe the Fantasy genre this book is labelled with.  Magic enters this series more markedly in Book Two, even if you don't get to see it much in this one, so stick with it.
B000LC55F2|5.0|There a very few movies that  one wants to see again immediately after viewing,The 6th Sense is perhaps the daddy of them all,the viewer wants to see exactly how he has been tricked and if it was fair play.This is one in that category for me. I had hoped there would be deleted scenes and perhaps a full length  commentary on the dvd but it looks like that was wishful thinking.This is a very entertaining movie top drawer in all aspects and bear in mind it is sci-fi but not of the bug eyed monster school...more in the line of The Others or Rosemary's Baby where reality is somewhat stretched..Anyway it is a must see in my opinion. Two other late 2006 movies also fall into this category,,The Illusionist and The Departed, the viewer will profit from second or even multiple viewings.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|This movie has the feel of a Raymond Chandler novel brought to the big screen.  Think about the \\"The Long Goodbye\\" with Elliott Gould, then turn the protagonists into high-schoolers.  Brilliant stuff.    I enjoyed this movie immensely.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|Well after watching this DVD for a few weeks and really looking it here is my review. <br /> <br />First the DVD cover. It looks very nice. :) They also picked a very nice title to. <br />Ok the first DVD. I really like the songs they picked to play.The camra work is just great and the people there had a lot of great energy for the band to feed off. Great stuff My fav songs on there are <br />Soul Society, The Edge of Paradise, Center of the Universe, The Haunting, Moonlight, and When the Lights Are Down <br /> <br />Know the great parts are: <br />Elizabeth (parts I, II & III), and March of Mephisto you could take those two songs the the New York Met house if you wanted to. They were just the best. The Drum solo was rocking. :) <br /> <br />Ok on to the 2nd DVD for a 2nd DVD it has a lot of good stuff. There could have been more but hey it's still a lot I well break it down here <br /> <br />HaloVision with Khan - I liked seeing the behind the scenes stuff. Though I'm like that with a lot of movies so this was a given that I would love this. On top of that I like the Q&A. <br /> <br />Up Close with Thomas Youngblood at home - Kind of reminded me of MTV cribs. It was nice to see where Thomas lives <br />Casey Grillo at ddrum - This was kind of cool seeing Casey picked out his drum set that he would be using. <br /> <br />Up Close Interview with Casey Grillo at home - Again like MTV cribs and I liked seeing where he lived. <br /> <br />Up Close with Oliver Palotai - I liked this becuase you really got to learn more about Oliver. <br /> <br />Interview with Simone Simons from the band Epica - This was one I have seen it before and nothing really new is learned. It's only good because you get to see Simone. <br /> <br /> <br />Ok on to the videos <br />The Haunting - I really like this video and it has a nice feel to it. <br /> <br />March of Mephisto <br />March of Mephisto (uncensored) - Why they did not just have the uncensored video put out is beyond me. But it's cool that you get both of them <br /> <br />Serenade - I have not really looked at this at so. <br />Making of \\"The Haunting\\" - It's a cool video well more like music video. I wish they would really showen behind the scene things and talked with people about the video <br /> <br />March of Mephisto - Live at Sweden Rock 2006 - Very great live number and seeing those flames go up druing the summer. Man that most have been hot for them. <br /> <br />Miscellaneous: <br />Photo Gallery including 2 slide shows of concert photos and band's private photos - Very nice photos here. <br />Band Member Biographies and Top 5's - I loved this showing what the band members like and did like and so on. <br />Discography - This is a meh. <br /> <br />All and all I really have been enjoying this DVD. There is a lot that keep you coming back from the live show to some of the parts on the 2nd DVD.
B000HIVO64|3.0|Okay, I'll have to get this point across: I really love Beck. I pretty much enjoy every one of the major label albums from the '90s. Well, I think \\"Sea Change\\" was a bit overrated but good, and enjoyed \\"Guero\\" slightly more. Unfortunately, while being like a counterpart to that album, this album forgot to fix the last problem: We get a few flashes of brilliance but have to sit through painfully average and directionless tracks. <br /> <br />\\"Movie Theme\\" is possibly the greatest track Beck's made in the past ten years, kind of like what Radiohead may have sounded like if they covered \\"Pay No Mind (Snoozer)\\" on to \\"Kid A.\\" Nigel's classic production shines on this particular track. So yes, there is highlights. \\"1000bpm\\" shows that Beck's creativity has not ended and songs like \\"Think I'm in Love\\" and \\"Strange Apparition\\" show that Beck can make the catchy pop song. Then there's funky stuff like \\"Cellphone's Dead\\" that shows that the funky hip-hop of \\"Hell Yes\\" from the last album was no fluke. The first two thirds of \\"The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton\\" are pretty good, but the last track seems like such a waste of space of the album. <br /> <br />The other tracks range from decent to forgettable and mediocre. What's disappointing about most of the mediocre tracks is they SOUND good but then when it gets to the climax or chorus, the song goes nowhere. Hopefully it will end up growing on me and I'll find out I'm wrong, but time hasn't told me that just yet. Most of the unmentioned tracks are not bad but still feel like filler. Also, some of the songs go on longer than they needed to. So, I think if the album was cut down, it would be amazing.
0307346609|4.0|It's no secret Brad Pitt's Plan B production group has acquired the film rights to Max Brooks' excellent World War Z.  The book's journalistic-vinette format will not translate well to big-screen adaptation.  Unfortuately, some of the stories will be edited out.  Let's just hope Brad's boys keep the basic story line about the worldwide RESPONSE to the zombie epidemic intact and don't turn \\"Z\\" into an MTV-inspired clunker complete with running zombies.  Great book!  Great film?
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah Mclachlan has most beautifully and soulfully captured the essence of winter.........listen to it at night, by candlelight, as the cycle of light reaches the solstice in December....you are in the moment.  The CD has been a catalyst to engage my heart and soul this Christmas.  Thank you, Sarah
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|I was not impressed with the features that supposedly make this a 2-disc \\"Special Edition.\\"  The first DVD in this set is the exact same DVD of the regular 1-disc DVD with no additional features such as a running commentary or a director's cut.  For a movie that's listed in the top 250 films of all time on IMDB, not having even a director's commentary is appalling.  As for the second DVD in this set, the \\"Special Features\\" DVD, there are three short featurettes and a rather forgetful music video.  There are shortcomings: despite the heavy detail of costuming, sound mixing and production direction, the featurettes only skim a few production points.  The featurettes are standard PR issue from the studio.  No deleted scenes, no comparative storyboarding, no blooper reel, no outtakes.  Where's the fun?  Unless you want to know more about the graphic novel, see a music video or learn about the events surrounding Guy Fawkes (events you can easily find similar information about on the Internet), the standard 1-disc DVD version would suffice.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Watch and learn what the rich will do to get richer and what the poor will do when they get desperate. Syriana shows us the world as it is, not the simplified good guy/bad guy world in which most people choose to format their minds. The primary question is which is worse - the brutality of those who live in a world of desperation? or the murderous greed of those who will stop at nothing to turn their millions into billions.
B0000029GA|4.0|Some people may look at the album and complain, \\"there's only 9 songs.\\" (\\"Genesis\\" is merely an intro track). But honestly, I think one thing that made hip-hop go in a downfall is unnecessary excess. That's what makes listening to this refreshing even over 12 years later. All of the tracks are great, too. Yes, it is somewhat overrated, but mainly because critics don't give other great later albums a chance, even though they are great. I don't like it when elitists won't even acknowledge \\"It Was Written.\\" To call tracks particular highlights is somewhat of a stretch, since they are all great. However, probably because it's the track that I'm most familiar with I tend to really enjoy \\"The World Is Yours,\\" which shows that he can make catchy songs that do not have to be disposable or nonsense. \\"Illmatic\\" is worth a listen to anyone who respects hip-hop. It's not just a \\"historical landmark,\\" it is an album that is also respected for its legitamacy. Also refreshing is that while the period this was out was mostly gangsta flare, Nas was willing to talk about other interesting life subjects. And yes, even after all of these years, Nas is one of the greatest emcees around, especially of the mainstream. And he doesn't need to use many guests to back this up, nor any real interludes.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I recently purchased the widescreen version of this acclaimed HBO miniseries. I was hesitant to do so at first because of some reviews claiming that this version was really the full screen version with the bottom and top of the picture cropped out. <br />  This version is true widescreen. I watched the Bonus Disc (disc 5) and they show clips from the full screen version aired on HBO. When compared to the identical scenes of the same clips on the other discs, you can see the missing parts, on the sides, that are missing on the full screen version. The top and bottom of the picture aren't cropped out! <br />  This box set is outstanding, with great picture and sound. \\"From Earth to the Moon\\" along with \\"Band of Brothers\\" are two of the greatest miniseries ever done for television. HBO knows how to do it right! <br />
B000IOM0YM|5.0|all you have to do is watch live at the summit to see how awesome kiss really is
B000J10ERO|2.0|I must confess: When I saw the movie at the theaters, I hated it. However, after returning home, I suspected that there were a lot of scenes cut from the movie, so I found a site with scans of the movie's \\"trading cards\\", which contained a lot of material that helped clarify the plot. So... I became interested in finding those missing scenes. The most interesting of all seemed to be the \\"Return to Krypton\\" scene.<br /><br />So... today I went to the supermarket and found this DVD. I joyfully bought it and played disc 2, expecting to watch ALL the scenes mentioned in the trading cards in their full glory.<br /><br />The \\"return to krypton\\" sequence was nowhere to be found. I feel that the marketing guys behind this release did it ON PURPOSE, expecting to sell you this same DVD with that scene added a few years from now as a \\"platinum edition\\" or something like that.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is a masterpiece in every way. Every single song is amazing and complex. Do yourself a favor and go to the music store right now to get this because it rocks!
B000E97X66|5.0|This album completly rocks!  Unoriginal, I know, but that statement was invented for albums like this. If you're a fan, don't wait another second.  And if you're not, this album could make you.  I agree with the other that list \\"Kittys Back\\" as the highlight of album full of hightlights.
B00005OM5L|1.0|i love eric clapton and sometimes when you buy concert dvds they stink so you have to be careful. but reaseaching this every one said it was great. wow they are so wrong claptons playing on i shot the shariff was so bad i had to turn the thing off. i showed it to my freinds and they agree for clapton being such a god W.T.F. listen to the solo from i shot the shariff you'll see.                       sorry to every one liked it
B000B86S1Q|3.0|One reason I enjoyed this book is due to the fact that I live in Dublin, so was able to identify with much of Ms. Ahern's descriptions and language used in the story. I was touched, and amused, laughed out loud, and shed a tear, but I felt a little slighted at the end of the story. I felt she rather rushed the ending, and just jumped off the edge to finish it up. I suppose because of this I will feel compelled to read the sequel to the story. I feel this is a rather light read, more for the beach or the airplane, not somthing that will give you that take me away feeling.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I don't think this movie is worth one dollar. It does have useful information, but if the intent is to help the people save the planet, then why not just give it away, and ask for donations.<br /><br />There are a lot of moments in this film that I thought were totally irrelevant, and focused on the life of Al Gore.<br /><br />I feel like I got tricked by all of the positive reviews into contributing to a campain for Al Gore.<br /><br />Don't pay for this film!
B000I5X80G|5.0|If this is what NY and Crazy Horse were like at peak, more please.... <br /> <br />Young's biography \\"Shakey\\" suggests this concert was drug-fuelled and there are suggestions of this in the sniggering laughter during the band's introduction, but non-the-less the playing is brilliant. Surely this CD contains the definitive version of \\"Cowgirls in the Sand\\"! All other tracks are tight, with decent harmonies and outstanding guitar sections.  <br /> <br />My only reservation - surely another 2 or 3 tracks should have been included.
B000JCETC4|5.0|david gilmour is amazing he is and always will be one of musics greatest soldiers keep it up. i just listen to this album and realax. the music is so amazing and smile is such a great song i learned how to play it on guitar and sing it all the time .
B000002UDB|4.0|Again, I'm generally against Capitol's massacre of the Beatles' albums pre-Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band HOWEVER, this is one exception where the US version is lightyears better than the UK double EP set which sold horribly. That being said, though it's been adopted by Apple, and generally accepted as a studio album, I still consider it to be a compilation of the Beatles' later 1967 work..and thus not being a studio album. <br /> <br />That being said, it's a great compilation. Probably more psychedelic, but certainly not as important as its predecessor. It has the rocking opener, Paul at some of his best lyrics with \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" the fun, but trippy instrumental \\"Flying\\", George's trippy \\"Blue Jay Way\\", Paul's fun number \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" and Lennon's epic \\"I am the Walrus.\\" <br /> <br />And that's just side 1 - the songs from the film <br /> <br />The second half is why i refer to this album as a compilation - it's just a bunch of singles - but it's a bunch of damn good singles..well except \\"Hello Goodbye\\", that one's just okay <br /> <br />Paul's \\"Hello Goodbye\\" opens the second side of the record. While it has nice guitar parts, and a dangerously catchy melody, though the lyrics make a fun singalong, they're quite trite, and can grate on the nerves in excess. That being said, it's still a good song\ <br /> <br />John and Paul both have their reminisicing songs back to back. John with his masterpiece \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", with John at his height of philosophical lyrics, and Paul's catchy \\"Penny Lane\\" Both have great qualities, and both are great in their own way <br /> <br />Baby You're a Rich Man is a nice song. An underrated gem, but nothing extra ordinary. Don't get me wrong, it's a great song, but one of the weakest, if you ask me. <br /> <br />All You Need Love is John's emotional anthem, and a pefect, and fitting closer to the album, and the year 1967, which featured the \\"Summer of Love\\" <br /> <br />I'd give it an 9/10
0393327655|4.0|Every so often someone has the courage to point out the evils of religion, as Sam Harris has done in The End of Faith.  He presents a thoughtful revelation of the forces of God, as they are embodied in the acts of His self-righteous warriors. There have been times when writing such a book would have been too dangerous--when the power of those who speak for God was too great.  Such times still exist today in the Middle East and may come again to North America.   <br /> <br />Authors must lean on what they know best, but I think The End of Faith would be more powerful without the physiologizing.  Harris's account of religious faith (or the lack thereof) would have profited more from further elaboration of the associated linguistic, cultural, social, and psychological processes than from his frequent allusions to associated brain functions.  Psychological processes such as believing, perceiving, learning, and understanding can no more be reduced to (or explained as) neurological processes than neurological processes can be reduced to chemical reactions.  In fact, understanding the functions of the brain requires a clear understanding of psychological functions, not the other way around. The source of faith lies not in our neurons but in the evolution of our language and culture, and in each person's psychological development. Once we fully understand the development of faith in the individual, we can then discover correlated processes in the brain--and better understand the brain. <br /> <br />This quibble with Harris is minor in light of his contribution to our understanding of the negative role of religion in world affairs. He has taken on the most intractable delusion in human history, and no doubt he will lose his battle.   But each generation needs someone who is willing to take the risk and alert the public to the dangers of religion, and Sam Harris promises to become that person for this generation. <br /> <br />William M. (Bud) Gardner
B000JK8OYU|5.0|In perusing the reviews of this album one word comes to mind: Goldilocks. Seems that like the fabled porridge, some find it too hot, too cold, or just right. Put me firmly in the \\"just right\\" camp.  <br /> <br />The \\"too hot\\" crowd tells us that these are sacred sounds not to be tampered with. And yet, I'm certain that some of these purists have, at one time or another, tried to hunt down such rarities as \\"All My Loving\\" with a five-beat high hat intro and marveled at how this makes it sound different and unique versus the more common version. Sure, they'll say that at least it was released while the band was still together, but did the band have anything to do with the differing versions? Probably not. It was either producer George Martin or, more likely, an Abbey Road engineer cutting together tapes for a foreign release inadvertently leaving in the count-in.  <br /> <br />The point is: there's never any satisfying many purists with anything put together post-1970 - unless it's mixed exactly as it was pre-1970. <br /> <br />The \\"too cold\\" crowd feels that Martin and Son, Ltd. didn't go far enough in mashing together the fab sounds. Of the naysayers, I'm more inclined to side with this bunch. I love what the producers did with Drive My Car/What You're Doing/The Word and  Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You Without You  and would love to hear more of it. However - it is the soundtrack to a Vegas show and they've got to appeal to a broad audience. Sure, it would be great if a show was put together for a bunch of Beatles scholars so that they could pick out what came from which song, outtake or alternate version, but as John Lennon once sang, \\"that's reality.\\" Maybe we'll get more adventurous mash-ups (and they're not really mash-ups, in the sense that it doesn't involve two or more bands ... what we have here is The Beatles vs. The Beatles) in the future. Time will tell. Meanwhile the \\"too hot crowd\\" can fret. <br /> <br />The highlights: A George Martin-scored version of George Harrison's acoustic take of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps;\\" the aforementioned Drive My Car/What You're Doing/The Word and Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You Without You; \\"Hey Jude\\" with the buried bass line shown the light of day (hopefully someday the remaster/remix of the full version will also accentuate this); an amazingly powerful mix of \\"Revolution\\" that even John Lennon might approve of; and a beautiful collage of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" from demo to take one to final version.   <br /> <br />The lowlights: very few. The transition from \\"Blackbird\\" into \\"Yesterday\\" is very awkward. Big deal.  <br /> <br />There are worse ways to spend (as priced at the moment) ten bucks. Take a look at some of the other Amazon Top Ten CDs. I'm sure you'll find a few ways. <br /> <br />Also, if you've got a 5.1 surround setup, by all means get the two-disc version with the audio DVD. Have a cup of tea, turn off your mind, relax and float downstream. <br /> <br />5.1???  Oh dear ... I can hear the purists fretting now.... <br /> <br />PS: Forgot to mention the fourth camp. The people that flat out hate the Beatles. The less said about them, the better. <br />
0783226845|5.0|I finally saw what all the \\"hoo-hah!\\" has been about when I stumbled into this Pacino tour de force yesterday on HBO. Changing channels, I caught this about five minutes into the start, and Al Pacino would not let me go for the next two-and-a-half hours! He won a Best Actor Oscar for this with good reason as the \\"Colonel\\" who uses his bluster to hide a deep depression. Forget about the career Chris O'Donnell has had since then, for Pacino could not be as good or believable, especially in the climactic scene, without O'Donnell to play against.  <br /> <br />Brace yourself for a scene on location in Brooklyn that's a little undercut today due to a shot of the lower Manhattan skyline with the Twin Towers visible, but the movie and Pacino are so powerful, it is not really distracting. <br />
B000M341QE|5.0|It's nice to see a movie, this day in age, where action, comedy, drama, plot twists, and many different actors are balanced nicely, and a movie that doesn't totally screw up in the second half. I have to admit, I was worried during the first half. By the time the titles comes up on screen, you forget that it hasn't come up yet. Normally, the title is shown in the first two minutes. Here, it comes only after a lengthy story set-up. After this scene, a few other sequences detail the worst possible aspects of a movie. There's loud rap music, so loud that it is not in the background, but covering the dialogue. A nasty remark is made about Puerto Ricans, and although the rap music stops full-on, the racial comments keep coming. The first half of the movie is great, mostly because you have no idea what is going on. Random text messages are sent, people have conversations about things that don't seem to relate to the plot, and random acts of violence knit the various characters together (i.e. two men are beaten to death by one guy, and the bodies are found by a second guy, whom the first guy happens to be trying to arrest.) I worried that all of this would screw itself in the second half. So many things were being introduced that a less talented director would have surely left plot strands dangling.    But then the second half hits, with a glorious jolt of humor, violence, and great acting. In the same moment. So, in that respect, the movie is a relief. It's far more enjoyable upon a second viewing when you know that things won't be ruined. It's also better to watch it on DVD than in the theater, because when I saw it in the theater, I missed alot of conversation, and on DVD I could go back and clear up plot points. But I'm digressing.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|After the first viewing of this film you realize that you really need to see it a couple of more times to be sure you get it all in. And when that happens you begin to realize that there are a lot of questions. Questions that relate to your good ole USA and the powers that be who are running the show. Yes there is violence and honestly that was my biggest question at the end. IS violence a viable option for those citizens who are acting in accordance to their patriotic duty? If you love your country are you going to cross the line and fight for it when civil disobedience doesnt work? The only thing I have to say i disagreed with was the idea that the religious zealots were part of the problem - i think thats a little far fetched. True religions of the world have always made it a better place and these zealots that are portrayed dont look at all like those who feed the poor and care for the helpless. I do see the relation between the idea and our \\"administration\\" linking themselves to the midwest through using a religious front to aquire votes. The wachowski brothers fell for it too i guess.  <br />Overall - this is a must see - over and over again.  <br />

6305949980|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the few truly visionary motion pictures of the last couple of decades.  The bizarre story is one only Tim Burton could tell, and he brings that story to life with some of the most impressive animation I've ever seen.  Stop-motion animation requires infinite care and patience to create, and one could easily forgive any slight hitches that result - but you'll find no imperfections at all here, as the animation rolls along beautifully and naturally.  As for the story, I found it good but not great, but the dark and imaginative vision behind it all more than makes up for any flaws in the writing.<br /><br />Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, has grown bored of all the scary shenanigans to which his land is dedicated to producing, finding little joy in topping his past accomplishments each year.  Wandering off alone, lost in thought, he happens to come across a sort of holiday crossroads, which leads him to Christmas Town.  It's a world like nothing he's ever seen before, and the Christmas magic quickly captures his heart and soul - so much that he returns home to refashion Halloweentown in the guise of Christmas Town.  He has a hard time communicating the spirit of Christmas to the townsfolk, but his perseverance pays off in the transition of the local industry from scary items to Christmas toys and gifts (unfortunately, gifts such as shrunken heads aren't exactly what little Johnny or his parents are particularly looking for).  As Christmas approaches, Jack prepares to don the red suit and white beard, hook up his remodeled coffin sleigh to the reindeer created by the local mad scientist, and sail off into the night to deliver toys to all the good little boys and girls - after he has the real Santa Claus kidnapped, of course.  Only Sally, a rag doll who loves Jack from afar, sees just what a disaster this is in the making.  With Santa suffering torture at the hands of the Bogeyman, it looks like Christmas is doomed for sure.<br /><br />I don't see this as a children's movie, although children will no doubt be delighted by all of the dark and wacky animation.  I also found the somewhat rushed ending somewhat ambiguous, especially in terms of Jack's feelings for good old Halloween.  Still, the film does evoke the Christmas spirit somewhat and certainly proves entertaining with its wonderful soundtrack, incredible animation, and dark humor.s doomed for sure. <br /> <br />I don't see this as a children's movie, although children will no doubt be delighted by all of the dark and wacky animation.

B000F5GNX8|2.0|As much as I want to jump on the bangwagon and praise how clever this movie is and wow look how they poke fun of all the action/thriller sterotypes...but I'm not too aware of many action thriller with gay private eyes and mumbling narrators.  Silly me, I was actually trying to make sense of the story I was watching...which truley turned out to be a waste of time.  Why?  Because the movie audience has no idea about this mystery crimer writer that everyone in this movie holds in such high regard.  And when the whole story unfolds-it does absolutely nothing for me.  Downey and Monaghan have absolutely no chemistry.  And Gay Perry made no sense to me-unless he was just there to solely feed the audience the plot.  I laughed maybe once and then afterward forgot the joke I found amusing.  Overall, it might be up your alley...it just wasn't up mine.
0895260131|5.0|Islam is attacking the West and agressively expanding into Europe, because this is what the Koran calls on all Muslims to strive for. Robert Spencer agrees with the likes of Osama Bin Laden that Islam is not a peaceful religion and has not been hijacked as our more diplomatic leaders like to say. It would help the cause of peace if greater authorities and experts on Islam and the Koran than the author would make an effort to refute him point by point. The numerous passages Mr. Spencer selects from the Koran strongly support his opinion of what the main message of that book is. But as the author was sifting through those holy writings looking for items for inclusion in his book: Was he \\"fair and balanced\\" in his selection process?  To have a meaningful answer to this question you have to be an expert on Islam.
0618680004|4.0|Mr. Dawkins is a very intelligent and accomplished scientist with a severe hatred for any organized religion. After reading a good part of this book, I still have the same opinions of religion and science. He makes many valid points concerning how religion has hampered the development of science through the ages, and even now in modern times. <br /> However, he quotes various sources from modern, back to the beginning of creation and weaves them together to back his theory. Dawkins studied human behavior and it shows in how he uses the fear of violence when he attacks the historical atrocities brought on by religious beliefs. He agrees with the theory that we should be content with the wonders of our world and the use of science to understand it better. Then strikes at your heart by saying how the belief in God has kept us from these wonders. This book strongly parallels the beginning of Mein Kampf.  <br /> If we were all Atheists, with no God in the picture or even imagined, then the arguments would be over who's scientific theory is correct. As other scholars would rise to the debate, people would pick sides and follow theoretical beliefs the same way they follow different religions now. Science would become the new religion.  <br /> In the early 1900's the world's greatest minds gathered to compare notes on the Darwinism. They concluded that the human race was evolving from animal to something higher. Blacks were obviously the lowest because they were more physically developed and less mentally so. Asian or Mongols were the most advanced, (slight in stature but the smartest). Then whites were in between these two with the attributes of both. \\"Mongolism\\" is so named from an unsuccessful \\"genetic leap\\" from white to mongol. Get the picture? They twisted the facts to prove their theory.  <br /> A very informative and entertaining read, but only folks of like mind looking for answers to their existence through science would be influenced by this. <br />

0393327655|5.0|I don't think I am alone in fearing for the safety of Sam Harris.  His book is by far one of the most courageous books written in years.  I worry that some nut-job is going to try and hurt him, and after going to Mr. Harris's website I learn that he is afraid for his own safety as well. <br /> <br />And that I suppose is the point of the whole subject.  The very religions we have all been conned into \\"respecting\\" are the greatest practitioners of bigotry, prejudice and ultimately death. <br /> <br />I have been non-religious all my 53 years and have had to hide that fact from damn near every person I have met, worked with, worked for, done business with or wished good luck.  If you can actually think critically, if you believe in and practice science, if evolution makes sense to you, if you believe that babies are born good and not with \\"original sin\\"... then you too have had to keep your mouth shut... and watch America destroy herself in the name of \\"God\\"! <br /> <br />Sure, there are other very good books that address the same issues as Mr. Harris, (like \\"Disciples of Destruction\\" by Charles W. Sutherland) but Sam Harris has done a darn good job of launching a defense against the insanity overtaking our society at the right time and has managed to get some attention as well.   <br /> <br />I was particularly impressed with his articulate and reasoned argument that religious moderation is barely better than religious fundamentalism.     It is hard to have to swallow his argument when so many really wonderful people in my life are religious moderates, but ultimately I believe Mr. Harris is right. <br /> <br />I only wish his title was a statement of fact.  I only wish that after having read the book I didn't feel like we are doomed.  I only wish that after reading the book I didn't worry so much for my daughter's future and start thinking about a more rational country to immigrate to.  Sweden is too cold so Canada is my country of choice.  What with global warming and the lunatics taking over the USA and much of the rest of the planet, it seems like a good idea. <br /> <br />Until then, I am going to do what most of you do, keep my mouth shut.  I wish I had balls of steel like Mr. Harris.  But if I did I would lose my job, most of my friends, virtually all my business associates and probably be run out of town covered in tar and feathers.  All courtesy of the God of love and tolerance and his faithful followers.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It is criminal how US airwaves ignored singles like SORRY,GET TOGETHER & JUMP. All of them deserved to hit the Billboard Top 10! Not in a million years that will happen now...Sniff. <br />As for songs that were not released as singles: FUTURE LOVERS,I LOVE NEW YORK & FORBIDDEN LOVE are phenomenal songs. The lady gives the best of herself here;I love the mature Madonna, and frankly I do not miss her 80s era at all. Madonna is here and now, I just wish americans would appreciate her more as the musical treasure that she is-I mean: the rest of the world played all her Confessions singles throughout 2006 exhaustively! <br />After HUNG UP (A song that is beyond perfection)hit only number 7 in Billboard, I wondered : will Madonna ever have a number 1 in the US? And I still ask myself that; does she still have a chance in the US charts? <br />So,please Madonna,keep the songs coming,show everybody how it is done... forget movies, children's books,fashion, and bring back your mammoth songs for 2007! Thank you Madonna from one of your millions of fans around the world. <br />
B000002KYR|5.0|I love this album, I wore out the cassette version when I was a teenager and now I have the CD. Every song is great, it's one of those rare CDs that I can play all the way through and enjoy every song. Everyone says that they couldn't believe that ZZ Top was being played on MTV back then, but you have to consider that MTV was a different animal back in 1983, you could turn on MTV back then and actually hear some good music. MTV wasn't the piece of crap waste that it is these days with their whiny reality shows and non-stop hip hop music. Anyway, I really like my other ZZ Top CDs, but Eliminator is my favorite by far, I would give it 6 stars if I could.

6305841861|5.0|Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn is the sequel to the ultimate experience in grueling terror. Evil Dead II is the definitive cult flick and perhaps my favorite horror film (top five at least). Bruce Campbell takes on the role of Ash once again in this hilariously horrific sequel to a legendary movie. Few sequels live up to the original and fewer still surpass it. This is one of those rare instances. This movie is out of this world. Sam Raimi is a genius with a camera and has gone on to create some damn fine films. He deserves every amount of success he has gained. The script is inventive, highly original, and funny as all hell. It's a mix of horror, laughs, and gore; or splatstick as Campbell calls it. Once again, Campbell's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission. If that doesn't get you the laughing deer head will. Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn is a true horror masterpiece. A completely original concept, some screwy camera angles, and one Bruce Campbell make for an entertaining combination. If you don't like it, \\"I'll swallow your soul, I'll swallow your soul.\\"
B000IU3Y1O|1.0|As a long standing fan of DM, I truly think this compilation was not needed.  Why do we need yet another greatest hits collection?  This collection does span their career thus far, however, it is missing a lot of their \\"best songs\\" including:  Policy Of Truth, But Not Tonight, Sun And The Rainfall, Told You So, Lie To Me, Here Is The House, Fly On The Windscreen, Nodisco, My Secret Garden.  I guess the boys from basildon needed $$$$$$.  This is a good collection for the casual fan or the completist, but definitely not worth the money for the die hard.  I think DM could put together an album of strictly album tracks (non singles) and it would sell like hotcakes.....
B0000844IT|5.0|Most people would say you can check your brain at the door before you watch this film, but I beg to differ. This is genuinely intelligent stuff here folks. The director, Sam Raimi, reminds us in this film what it is like to have fun. From the film itself, as well as the DVD featurettes, it is apparent that Mr. Raimi is having a blast doing what he does best. It shows too. Granted, there is not much in the line of plot or theme, but these would be totally gratuitous in this escapist piece. Instead, we are given a fantastic adventure, appropriately tongue-in-cheek special effects, and an ode to The Three Stooges. The facial expressions of Bruce Campbell alone make this film well worth its 80 minutes. I don't want to give away a single joke, because the experience is just too much fun. So, do yourself a favor. Watch this film without being so hard on yourself. Yes, you are allowed to laugh. There can be non-sardonic humor in modern day America. Sam Raimi proves it.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Regardless of your political stance, your like or dislike of Al Gore and his presentation of this information in the film... how do you argue with facts such as the recent changes in climate and weather conditions? Let us all be humbled by Mother Nature and give Mr. Gore credit for trying to inform the masses to take baby steps in making a difference.  If everyone made subtle changes in their lifestyles we COULD have an impact on our children's future and the future of our planet.  How hard is that?  To NOT try is to accept that you are selfish and short-sighted.  Kudos to you Mr. Gore for this truly eye-opening documentary, and your commitment to share your knowledge with us.
B00005R24K|5.0|It's the early 80's, what do you expect? This is a scary scary film. And I think I know why films now a days can't hold a candle to films like Halloween and Evil Dead. And that is because a photo copy is never as good as the original. That is the bottom line. Directors don't care about a lot of the material that they are filming today, especially when it comes to horror films and that is because they don't write their own stories. They do someone elses work. But not Evil Dead. This was Raimi's baby from the outset. When films like the two mentioned were filmed they were filmed by two directors that were complete unknowns. They had no pressure to make a great film and they did it on an incredibly low budget. Halloween was made for $150,000 and Evil Dead for $50 000. So what that meant is that the directors could stick to their visions but they had to find innovative ways to do so. Their budgets didn't allow a heap of special effects so they had to rely on what they knew. And that was, how to create atmosphere using the camera. And Evil Dead is one of the best at doing that. There is one scene in this film that I will never forget and that is one of the early scenes where the cast arrives at the cabin. Here we see a long shot of the cabin and it has very eerie music playing. This shows the cabin as being menacing. It lets you know that there is evil in that cabin. And that we are in for a hell of a ride.<br /><br />Sam Raimi made a masterpiece here that I believe stands the test of time. You can put this film up against any of today's so called horror films and I guarantee you this scares you more. Raimi cares about his movie and he does everything to make you feel the terror that the cabin people feel. We are scared and disgusted at what happens when one of the women goes outside alone at night and meets a tree that does unspeakable things. And when the book is first introduced.... that is horror movie history there. What a brilliant concept. A book that is evil. I have often wondered about such books. We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times. But here we have a book that has weird incantations from another world and another language, and you just know that as soon as some idiot utters the words that they are not supposed to say, well they won't be around much longer.<br /><br />The Evil Dead is a miracle. It was made on a rock bottom budget yet it is scarier than any Hollywood movie that is made for 20 million could ever hope to be. If you want to truly experience a frightening experience, rent this film, it knows what it wants to say. And it knows how to make you afraid. So be afraid. Be very afraid. You may never look at the forest the same again.have often wondered about such books. We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times.

B000000993|5.0|Tool does not fit into any genre...yes, their music is heavy, but it's much more than \\"heavy metal\\". Their lyrics have a definite intention and are well thought out. The band's education can be heard throughout each song, lyrics as well as instruments, everything is intricate and detailed. You don't just HEAR it. You're drawn in to truly listen. I strongly suggest Undertow and if you enjoy it run out right away and get Aenima, Tool only improves with age!
0618680004|5.0|I have read several review about the errors contained in this book and I am getting a little tired of the trivialities.  Dawkins does not make compelling arguments outside of what is 'expected' for readers to know.  This does not mean his claims are less true, it simply means one should not completely accept his arguments as truth until discovering some background information of your own (e.g. evolution).<br /><br />As a book for converting believers I believe this would fail miserably.  The attacks are so strong that it would root any believer firmly to the ground.  The same could be said if a Christian Theologian attacked my atheism (although the arguments from Theists are weaker by default).<br /><br />I would urge people who are interested in this topic (many seem to have bought the book already) to pursue authors such as Sam Harris, David Mills, and David Eller.  These authors may prove to be less acerbic about the validity (or lack thereof) of religion.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima is trully a conerstone of the 90`s alternative age (if there was ever such a thing), its a record filled with both power and introspection pushing away all the clitches that make heavy metal so absurd and redundant. \\"Stinkfist\\" pounds away like nothing that has come out of your speakers. \\"Aenema\\" sinks its rage before exploding in glory and \\"Third Eye\\" brings it all back home. A true masterpiece.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Amazon's review of The Prestige is rather dismissive, particularly of the second half of the movie.  I saw the movie in the theater and am eager for the DVD.  It is a movie that takes patience and asks for close attention, much the way a magic trick can.  The three acts of a magic trick are explained early in the movie--The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.  The movie itself can be seen as a magic trick, with the overall plot divided into the three parts (I didn't come up with that realization on my own, someone pointed it out to me.  But then I started thinking about the three-part structure, and found that individual acts in the plot--such as Angier's Denver experience with Tesla's machine--can also be divided into the three parts of a trick).  Understanding the layers within layers is not necessary to enjoy the film, but seeing them definitely adds a dimension.  I am looking forward to watching the movie several more times to see if my hunch that there are three-act tricks to be found throughout the movie, not just a time or two, is right.<br /><br />Christian Bale is, as always, compelling.  Hugh Jackman is very well cast here; the role and direction brought out his best acting.  Scarlett Johansson is underused but I actually like that.  She is an intriguing distraction who is more and less important than she appears to be.<br /><br />The movie requires a person to pay attention and think.  Not enough movies do that these days.  Nolan does not cater to the casual, mindless moviegoer, and if his final product is less than perfect--if his reach exceeds his grasp--he can be forgiven for trying too much rather than too little.
B00005B36H|5.0|Try listening to Lateralus - the third album from prog-rock boogey men Tool - in the dark. Go on, I dare you. If you make it through the first two songs of its chaotic dementia without running for the lights, you're a stronger person than me. The hordes of recent shock rock wannabes dress in black and paint their faces with blood just to get the Christian Coalition's goat. Tool does it because, well, it just comes naturally.<br /><br />Of course, there's something to be said for intentionally scaring yourself silly. For the same reason The Exorcist is fun to watch, Lateralus is exciting to listen to. The song names alone (\\"Ticks and Leeches,\\" \\"Eon Blue Apocalypse,\\" \\"Faaip De Oiad\\") offer a taste of the slightly disturbed thinking that went in to making it, but they can't really prepare you for its disorienting swirl of drums, cult-like chanting and otherworldly guitars.<br /><br />In even the scariest horror film, there's always at least a couple moments of respite to let you catch your breath. On Lateralus, those breaks come in the form of short tracks filled with somber machine-like wailing. \\"Parabol\\" draws you into a comfortable womb of calm, as frontman Maynard James Keenan (fresh off his work with his side project, A Perfect Circle) sings almost lullaby-like. But just as everything begins to feel safe, an extended scream of feedback disturbs the quiet and \\"Parabol\\" morphs into the searing \\"Parabola\\" without missing a beat.<br /><br />As one song fades into another, Lateralus begins to feel like one continuous neurotic jam session, with songs evolving, mutating and recreating themselves in slightly different forms. Not unlike flipping the pages of the album's cover art to \\"dissect\\" the two-dimensional man, peeling away the layers of Lateralus reveals fascinating, yet disgusting innards we didn't really want to believe were there. And at nearly 80 minutes, the album takes its time delving deep into the entrails. The trilogy of \\"Disposition,\\" \\"Reflection\\" and \\"Triad\\" alone clocks in at a whopping 25 minutes of constant guitar fuzz and science fiction sound effects. Listen closely, though, and despite its apparent chaos, each note is exactly where it should be.<br /><br />The line between scary and ham-handed cheese is precariously thin, as we've been reminded over and over by the countless horror movies that clog cineplexes. By the third installment of Friday the Thirteenth, the fear-factor had long since been diluted. But Lateralus proves that Tool still know how to crawl into your brain and raise the hairs on your neck - whether the lights are on or not.s in at a whopping 25 minutes of constant guitar fuzz and science fiction sound effects.

B000HIVIOW|4.0|From the moment you hear the tinkling piano keys that play over the opening titles, you know \\"The Snowman\\" is going to be a heartbreaker. Unfortunately, there may be more heartbreak in store for those who purchase \\"The Snowman\\" on DVD believing they are getting the version they remember.<br /><br />There are at least three versions of this film: there's one that's introduced by the author, Raymond Briggs, and features an entirely instrumental score (the version I first saw and still prefer.)<br /><br />Still another version retains the Briggs intro but includes a vocal version of \\"Walking In the Air\\" that, in my opinion, breaks the magic spell that the film so ably casts.<br /><br />And, finally, there's a version introduced by David Bowie. I'm not sure whether that features the boy sorprano on the soundtrack or not.<br /><br />I'm also not sure which of these versions is THE original that earned an Academy Award nomination for 1982.<br /><br />However, this particular DVD is guilty of false advertising. The David Bowie introduction promised on the cover (and in the description at Amazon) is nowhere to be found. Instead, this particular edition is identical to the one released on a disc in tandem with \\"Father Christmas.\\" In other words, you get the Raymond Briggs introduction and the vocal rendition of \\"Walking In the Air.\\" (But, remember, no Bowie.)<br /><br />Although I'll always prefer the purely instrumental version of the film, \\"The Snowman\\" remains a delightfully sweet and sad story in every incarnation. It magically captures the melancholy of Christmas as superbly as it conveys its joys. Animated in lovely pastel-like colors and given considerable dramatic weight by Howard Blake's hauntingly beautiful score, \\"The Snowman\\" brings Raymond Briggs' short story to brilliant life.<br /><br />Brian W.

B0006GAO5Y|5.0|\\"Rocky\\" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, \\"You have to be a moron to want to box.\\"<br /><br />Rocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before \\"Rocky\\" was \\"Weekend at Kitty and Stud's,\\" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in \\"Rocky.\\" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.<br /><br />Stallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.<br /><br />He lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.<br /><br />After he returns from his \\"job\\" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.<br /><br />But things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. \\"An Italian found America,\\" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.<br /><br />But Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.<br /><br />The most entertaining thing about \\"Rocky\\" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, \\"Are you sure she knows I'm coming?\\" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.<br /><br />And the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, \\"This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!\\" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.<br /><br />Things like that are what make \\"Rocky\\" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in filmsall the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.<br /><br />But the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, \\"Rocky\\" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with \\"Rocky\\" all the more.spoofed in films all the time.

B000002LRX|5.0|BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER COMPOSED!!! I remember in the 90's playing this album before I went to bed at night and when I woke up in the morning...seriously. If there is any album since 1992 that has surpassed or even matched the brilliance of 'Angel Dust' then I am ignorant of it's existence.<br /><br />Mike Patton is widely regarded as one of the best vocalists ever, with his broad variety of singing styles all being displayed alternately throughout this beautiful masterpiece. My favorite song is probably the opening track 'Land of Sunshine', but with so many other great songs I don't think I can really claim that with complete confidence.<br /><br />If you want to have nightmares then listening to tracks like 'Caffeine', 'Malpractice', or 'Jizzobler' before falling asleep will most likely do the trick. The hard guitars, and high pitched screams of Patton on these tracks are frightenly unreal. 'Angel Dust' keeps you attentive, sometimes venturing into mellower piano led portions, sometimes boardering on the edge of being considered death metal.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have mentioned, the greatness of this album cannot be described in words - THIS ALBUM IS ESSENTIAL TO YOUR MUSIC COLLECTION!!!<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: Get Faith No More's last two albums also! Although not on the same level of brilliance as 'Angel Dust', FNM's follow-up album 'King For a Day - Fool For a Lifetime' is still a GREAT album, and sees the band experiment with a differnent style again. 'Album of the Year' was more predictable than anything they had done previously but still is a worthy addition to your collection. Fans of Mike Patton should also check out his other projects - most notablly Mr Bungle (which he was in before joining FNM).
B000IHY9SE|4.0|this was a pretty good album.  I didn't know what to expect when I heard Em was releasing a new one, at first I thought it would be solo, but then I saw that it was a composition of songs from his other artists so I wasn't sure how good it would be.  But much to my surprise, it was pretty impressive.  I especially like the lyrical talent of Ca$his and Stat Quo, they seem to have styles different from commercial rappers but still manage to sound pretty good in the mainstream.  Overall, this album was pretty damn good.
B000A59PMO|5.0|hi i am a new watcher of this series having discovered this series after reading some good  reviews. The  rave reviews are right on and why is it great. WEll for one the cast is superb the writing is original and edgy. The lead actor kristen bell is perfect but so is everybody else. There are genuine twists adn turns in the plot and the viewer is constantly surprised at the turn of events.  One other thing is that series builds in intensity so keep watching.

B000065V9Y|5.0|After the (understandable) commercial success of and (inexplicable) critical praise for So, it's good to see Peter back in top form here.  Am I the only one who despised So?  I thought it was Peter Gabriel Lite; empty, hollow, insubstantial, a pale pale semblance of glory and grandeur past (although I am partial to the Gabriel/Bush duet).  Us, on the other hand, contains songs which are genuinely moving.  There is real emotion here, not the manufactured variety found on So, and the musical and vocal stylings are pleasantly reminiscent of Security. <br />There are a good variety of songs here, from the irresistibly propulsive \\"Steam\\", to the infectious and hilarious \\"Kiss That frog,\\" to the sublimely beautiful \\"Washing The Water\\" (easily my favorite track).  This album may not be as innovative or brilliant as \\"Car\\", \\"Scratch\\" or Security (all of which were so astonishingly good that they hardly seem designed for mere mortal ears), but it maintains a consistent high quality throughout, and is emotionally resonant.
B000J10EQU|3.0|You can tell Singer has respect for the original Donner film, just by starting the film like the original did and not going for some flashy cgi wowzer opening like the X Men movies do. I enjoyed this film, not as much as I had hoped for but still as superhero movies go it's up there, nowhere close to the spiderman franchise, maybe right next door to the Fantastic 4, entertaining, fluffy but not very filling. Personally i think Brandon Routh did his best to portray a character that diehard and may I say fanatical people will always associate with Christopher Reeve, Reeve did his version I say give Routh the chance to step up to the challenge and not be forever in Reeve's shadow. <br />As for Lois Lane, horrible the casting was bad , enough said.  Kevin Spacey is a great actor , no denying that, but Luthor needs a little more than being dark and sarcastic, he needs that kind of presence that makes you believe this guy would smile in your face as he chokes the life out of you, like Hackman did so well. Obviously the flying scenes were pretty good, with the help of CGI you could believe this guy was flying around Metropolis.  All in all not a great film but not that bad either, hopefully Singer has listened to his fans and will correct the glitches for the upcoming The Man of Steel.
B000001FA4|5.0|Heavily produced, and yet easily the most consistent and high quality effort the band has put out.  A giant evolutionary step forward from War, and much better than the spotty Joshua Tree.  Not a weak track on this album, and the the sound of it, the feel of it, the mood, is pure magic.  A magic, unfortunately, which they've never been able to recapture and bottle up again, in my opinion.
B00005JLFC|1.0|We've all seen it before - movies about high school where the students all look in their early 30s, for example, or movies set in outer space where there are both gravity and sound.  And, in the alternative universe that is Barbraland we get this - yentl.<br /><br />  A tossup as to which is the bigger stretch - Streisand as a man or Streisand as a young student.  A close call - something to focus on when looking at the actual movie becomes painful, as it will, several times.<br /><br />  To critique Streisand's acting is pointless - she plays Streisand, as she does in all her movies (at least her later ones - I've managed to miss, so far, \\"Funny Girl\\" et al., aside from a few moments on commercial TV).  Amy Irving acts like a mannequin, while Mandy Patinkin, faced with the difficult role of having to look like he believes Streisand is a man (boy?) muddles through as best he can.<br /><br />  I have always believed \\"Showgirls\\" as the best of the good \\"bad\\" movies, but Babs gives Showgirls a run for its money here.  Plus Ms. S gets points for consistency - package \\"Yentl\\" with \\"A Star Is Born\\" and \\"The Mirror Has Two Faces\\" and you have a three pack more horrible than anything you'll see in a Halloween movie marathon.<br /><br />  The only regret I have is that one star is apparently as low as I can go...
1932100660|5.0|I love juicy steaks, delicious cheese, and big bowls of ice cream.  I love to eat out at nice restaurants.  And I really like eating without thinking about the operations and consequences of our dietary industrial complex. But I don't get to enjoy these things any more because I read the China Study.  Like Neo in the movie the Matrix, you have a choice, take the blue pill and believe what you want to believe, take the red pill and you will be exposed to the reality of the world we live in.  The China Study is the red pill.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating book on the capitalism, politics, and human behavior that drives the food industry.  It is also frighteningly insightful into the health consequences of an affluent societies' diet.  I am not a scientist so I don't know if this is good science.  But I did work ten years ago as a government attorney on the USDA dietary guidelines and was surprised by the political influence and acceptance of what the author would call scientific reductionism.  I also worked for a man who lived and worked until he was 100 years old, and he had a dietary regime very similar to that recommended by the China Study: not vegan nor vegetarian, but largely based on plants and whole foods rather than animal based foods.  So I found this book very persuasive - in fact, too persuasive.  It scared me straight so I eat healthy now and that's good for the long term...but I don't enjoy it like I used to.
1594200106|5.0|A tale of obsession, deceit, friendship and true love.  The prose is pure poetry.  It is entirely predictable but is does not matter because you get so wrapped up in the narrative that you don't want it to end.  I have given 3 copies away as gifts.  It is simply put, a magic carpet ride.
B00005JPE7|4.0|\\"Rocky Balboa\\" can be viewed in two distinct ways: it's either an unoriginal film that reuses all the best elements from the original \\"Rocky\\"; or it's a well-crafted film that respectfully pays tribute to its origins while telling a new and compelling story. For whatever it's worth, I tend to favor the latter interpretation. While it isn't perfect, I still greatly enjoyed this movie. It's a heartfelt story written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, one that manages to steer clear of becoming sappy, preachy, or melodramatic. Yes, the climactic fight scene is also entertaining, but it's nowhere near as important as what takes place early on. Just like the original 1976 film, this is not a story about boxing; it's about amounting to something amidst the realities of everyday living. Stallone created an underdog character, representing the everyman who wanted a chance at greatness.    In some ways, these underlying themes take on even greater significance than when they were presented thirty years ago. Still living in Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is now an aging restaurant owner. Consumed with remorse over the death of his beloved Adrian, he begins to wonder whether or not he still has what it takes to get through life. It's apparent on the anniversary of her death that he needs to go in a different direction; not only does he visit her grave, he and Paulie (Burt Young)--Adrian's brother--also visit all the spots where Adrian and Balboa were together. They stop by the pet store where she and Balboa looked at birds. They stand on the stoop of Balboa's home, where he envisions her as she once appeared. They even visit the vacant lot of the now demolished ice skating rink. When at this location, Paulie loses himself, feeling as if he has no right to remind himself of his sister (who he treated badly).    His last stop is a sleazy little bar, where he meets the local bartender, Marie (Geraldine Hughes). As it turns out, she's the same Marie that Balboa walked homethirty years ago, back when she was just a young girl (\\"Screw you, creepo!\\" were her final words to him). They immediately strike up a friendship, made stronger with the introduction of her son, nicknamed Steps (James Francis Kelly III). For whatever reason, they motivate Balboa into random acts of kindness, such as employing them both for his restaurant. While Marie is certainly grateful, she has a hard time understanding why he's being so generous. \\"You don't owe us nothing,\\" she says one night as Balboa replaces the bulb of her porch light. \\"Why do you have to owe something to get something?\\" is his simple yet significant reply. This scene worked especially well because so much was being said with so few words; a lot of this film works on that level (it made me think twice about criticizing Stallone's overly-colloquial writing style).    Other relationships highlight the story, such as that between Balboa and his son, Rocky, Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia), who has gone on to become a suit-wearing paper pusher in a wealthy Philadelphia high rise. When making a surprise visit, Balboa sees his son's boss acting belligerently, suggesting that his son is willing to let people step all over him. He clearly has some issues, always feeling as if he's lived in the shadow of his famous father. Now it seems as if Rocky, Jr. is unwilling to visit the family restaurant, opting instead to go out for drinks with his friends. During one such outing, the bar's television is tuned in to the sports channel, where a computer-simulated match between Balboa and current heavyweight champion Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is fought. Of course, the animated Balboa wins.    But when the real Balboa hears of this \\"victory,\\" thoughts of actually entering the ring one last time begin floating through his head. Consider the fact that at his restaurant, he goes from table to table, telling his guests stories about his past fights; is this not indicative of someone who still has something toprove? His son seems to think so, and the feelings only get stronger when Balboa decides to go through with it. Rocky, Jr. is initially unwilling to support his father, who he thinks will only succeed in embarrassing them both. The sports world doesn't hold out much hope, either; Balboa will be up against Dixon, who's younger, faster, and more athletic. But Balboa is determined to do what he feels is the right thing.    Thus begins the obligatory montage training sequence, set against Bill Conte's famous score. Just like in the first film, Balboa runs through the city in a gray sweat suit. He punches sides of beef in Paulie's slaughterhouse. There are even some brief shots of him chugging a glassful of raw eggs. (I can't say whether or not this scene was written to appease fans of the original film. I suppose it doesn't really matter; if a film's plot centers on an impending boxing match, training footage is a necessary component.)    I won't bother describing anything about the final fight scene in Las Vegas; because the entire film builds up to it, you should experience it for yourselves. I will say that, to a degree, I questioned the plausibility of it, especially in terms of Dixon's involvement. He's an undefeated champion boxer, yet he's not respected in the sports community, labeled as someone who only picks easy opponents. I also got the impression that he genuinely respects Balboa, despite offering a way for him to be defeated without embarrassment. He comes to believe that his managers are only interested in the financial success of the fight, and that made me wonder why he would actually want to be in the ring at all; such a hollowly conceived boxing match cannot be easily dismissed.    Nonetheless, the ending of \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is appropriate. It helps that the fight scene in and of itself does not represent the soul of the film; as I said before, this is not a story about boxing. At one point, Balboa says something to effect of, \\"It's not about whether ornot you get hit, but about how hard you can be hit and get back up.\\" It may be a cliche statement, but there's no denying that it rings true. Is this film better than the original \\"Rocky\\"? Of course not. Nothing ever will be better than that. But is it a worthy final chapter to the film series? Absolutely.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|I read in a UK music magazine that David Gilmour sold his rock-aristocracy-country-pile in favor of a houseboat on the Thames, which is equipped with a priceless collection of high-end analog recording equipment and miles of audiophile oxygen-free copper wire.  Perhaps that accounts for the somnolent but technically adept quality of this recording. <br /> <br />Basically this is a collection of undeveloped ideas that probably would not have been released had it not been for Gilmour's name and reputation.  The tempos are lethargic.  The chord changes, when they finally come (\\"C'mon, give us an 'A' now, Dave, you can do it!\\") are predictable.  And while I'm sure Gilmour's nth and current wife is a charming companion she is not a lyricist of any obvious talent. <br /> <br />If you're looking for some of the magic of Pink Floyd, you'll not find it here.  On the other hand, if you're having trouble getting to sleep there are worse things to have on your iPod ...
B000000W5L|5.0|Anyone who is a serious rock music fan will already own and appreciated \\"exile\\".  is it the best stones' album ever as it's lauded?  no, probably not.  i'd vote for \\"sticky fingers\\", but that's academic and beside the point.  what \\"exile\\" represents, best illustrated by the recent book of the same name, is a band whose hero and central talent ( keith )is in the throes of a heroin addiction that mere mortals without infinite amounts of the drug can only imagine.  for anyone who has faced the horrors of opiate dependency, the idea that \\"exile\\" could be written and recorded within that nightmare is what elevates it to the legendary status it is accepted in today. an oversimplification?  missing the point? glamourizing heroin use a la tarantino and \\"pulp fiction\\"?  no. <br /> <br />\\"ventilator blues\\", although mostly a mick taylor creation, shows a band in a literal basement bemoaning the irritating sound of an old, creaky home heating system.  it seaped into the basement studio where the stones were exiled to at the time.  exiled for tax purposes, but more importantly, exiled because of keith richards' and anita pallenberg's copius heroin use and the company of corsican criminals they kept at the time to keep the dope coming. <br /> <br />so the album rambles, is wonderfully lo-fi, and has mandatory tracks like \\"sweet black angel\\" and \\"happy\\".  but it never had a strong single.  or a definable song like \\"sympathy for the devil\\" or \\"street fighting man\\", as in same-era albums. <br /> <br />if you don't own it by now, i'm not sure how to recommend it to you.  we're not the same, dear amazon reader, if you don't have \\"exile\\".  we're also not the same if you have not experienced the devil that is opiates.  and maybe the final lesson is that neither is really recommended, you've either been there or you haven't.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|This film could have been another \\"Empire Strikes Back.\\" With a bleakly tragic plot line and a devastating list of casualties, it could have described the heart-wrenching tragedy that inevitably unravels at the core of the greatest sagas. <br /> <br />They had all the right pieces. A daunting, uncontrollable new power in the form of the Phoenix, with the obvious implication that the Professor's fearful meddling in young Jean's mind is at least partly responsible for her untamed alter-ego. Doubting himself--not as a telepath, but as a teacher--Xavier had locked off the parts of her power that he believed could not be educated. Thus hidden from her conscious mind, this power had the freedom to become the Phoenix, a selfish and destructive creature possessing nearly unimaginable power. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, a major pharmaceutical company develops a \\"cure\\" for the mutant condition, sharply dividing the mutant community and providing the banner around which Magneto can build his own army of angry mutants. The government, of course, has weaponized the \\"cure\\" using plastic darts that take only seconds to incapacitate their target. <br /> <br />Again, all of the right pieces for a genuine tragedy for our X-Men. Betrayal, fallen friends, hopeless odds. I loved this story. I could have enjoyed this pain... but they just would not let me. <br /> <br />On a dramatic level, the film falls flat. Director Brett Ratner comes across as amateurish and unoriginal, while choppy editing and rush-job writing whisk us through a dazzling array of scenes with virtually no dramatic impact. Meanwhile, writers and director simply refused to tug at the nagging loose threads of their own story. The most glaring example? Xavier, who may not have deserved to die, certainly made his own death-bed. Despite a weakly-drawn confrontation with Wolverine, however, not to mention punchy but thin accusations from Magneto, Xavier never admits his mistakes, never confronts his contradictions. Thus, he diesstill pleading his pathetic paternalism to a Jean Grey already destroyed by his own manipulations. He dies with impotent stubbornness, with no dignity because he cannot escape his conceit. His death, while tragic, leaves a bitter taste in my mouth because he never managed to repent. <br /> <br />If his death is sour, Xavier's memorial and the succeeding scenes are far worse. The memorial is brief and unremarkable; afterward, Hank discusses closing the school, an option that Storm all too quickly rejects. We are supposed to feel uplifted, hopeful that life goes on for the X-Men. Instead, I feel cheated, robbed of yet another chance to properly mourn the loss of an icon: we never get to absorb his death, to revel in the tragedy. Suddenly, things are simply back to normal. <br /> <br />The narrative flow is practically non-existent: the story, while interesting, fails to build tension toward a dramatic climax. It is hardly helped by a flat and uninspired musical score. <br /> <br />There was no need for the X-Men to \\"win\\" this battle. There was every reason, in fact, for them to lose. We might have left this story with Magneto and Phoenix ascendant, at the verge of true world conquest. Indeed, this would have provided the escalation necessary to make the Sentinels a reality, to launch this movie franchise wholesale into the bleak and unapologetic world of the X-Men comics. <br /> <br />Instead, we get Hank McCoy, ambassador to the UN. We get a world in which, for no convincing reason, human and mutant suddenly get along. Yes, the X-Men saved the world (again) from Magneto, and they defeated the seemingly unstoppable Phoenix... but are we really supposed to believe that human paranoia gives in that easily?  <br /> <br />The actors, for the most part, did a superb job with a lousy script. Ellen Page was especially notable for a very honest, very relatable Kitty Pryde--I wish we had seen more of her. <br /> <br />I loved this story. I love a good tragedy. Too bad they had to ruin it.

B00005JPDY|1.0|Skull and Bones, the birth of the CIA, intrigue, espionage, sex, murder, and more are all in The Good Shepherd yet the 3 hour film lags like a lady with an expired coupon at a grocery store. The film is as dry as can be. My brother and I actually stopped on the way home after the film just to get something to quench our parched mouths. Everyone save you money on this one. The theater was packed and I feel everyone was disappointed. I am not sure who edited this but it easily could have been the same bad film with only 2 hours of footage. I am amazed that such fascinating subject matter could be made so boring.  That sucky phony lame film National Treasure was better and I hate that film.
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|If you think \\"Key Largo\\" is just a place in Florida, if you think \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" seems a phrase in praise of tenacious package carriers, if you think \\"Touch of Evil\\" is a wrestling move in \\"Nacho Libre\\" . . . this film is for you. If you recognized these works as milestones in Film Noir, I strongly suggest you avoid this train wreck (you'll feel compelled to return to this page in an effort to \\"school\\" the plebs who know no better). <br /> <br />Johnson's approach seems innovative to the casual film-viewer: replace mature actors with \\"teenagers\\" but maintain the overall spirit of the film. Genius! Unfortunately, worldly people realize this as a convention employed to seduce a younger, less discerning audience. Roger Kumble's \\"Cruel Intentions\\" is a similar modification of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos' \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses.\\" The only difference is that Kumble (also a relatively young director at the time) created a fairly complex work. The lives of these young people were genuinely engaging (no matter the viewer's age). What sparks even further concern are the aforementioned \\"teenagers\\" in this work. I find it revealing that Johnson would create a work with an adolescent target-demographic, but did not cast teenagers in these roles: Levitt and Zehetner were twenty-five years old during shooting (and, they look their age, which impacts \\"suspension of disbelief.\\") Maybe Johnson should have consulted Gus Van Sant who has confidence in teenage actors: he uses them for both authenticity and to connect with his younger viewers. Still it took Johnson six years to find anyone to fund this product, so his insecurity is somewhat understandable. <br /> <br />What you can expect from the film itself: 1.) While it attempts to emulate the stylized language of the genre, the result is both awkward and embarrassing. The staccato delivery is not as much compelling as it is painfully forced and grotesque. At times it seems as though the actors do not understand their lines, and thus a robotic (not detached, but robotic) effect is evoked. 2.)The cinematography is amateurish. Given that this is Rian Johnson's freshman-project (i.e. his first feature-length film) errors are to be expected but, his simultaneously self-indulgent and sloppy vision is virtually unforgivable. It reads as a graded exercise ... and I'd give Johnson an \\"A,\\" if he were an underclassman in an introductory class. 3.) The plot is shamefully obvious (a little innovation for this homage would have been welcome). If Johnson tackled even one of these elements with grace, I would have happily granted this film leeway (I mean, he did edit it on a home computer: again, no one wanted to fund this project). But that all three are a pitiful disaster is impossible to overlook. <br /> <br />If you are searching for legitimate, contemporary Film Noir, consider: the Coens' \\"The Man Who Wasn't There,\\" Kasdan's \\"Body Heat,\\" or Black's \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\\" Leave this vulgar aberration to its inevitable demise in Wal-Mart's clearance bin. Nonetheless, let me defer to the critics . . . <br /> <br />I think the Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert (who found many redeeming qualities in the work) was sage in stating: \\"The movie has one inevitable point of vulnerability: Because we can't believe in the characters, we can't care about their fates.\\" (This is common to many films within the genre though). Nonetheless, the equally as respected Richard Roeper (also Chicago Sun-Times) says it best: \\"the gimmick wears thin.\\"

B000I2IT44|5.0|I am newbee to Porcupine Tree.  I have heard their last two albums, and decided to explore their music after Alex Lifeson gave them a nice mention in Guitar Player magazine.  After hearing their most recent discs, and reading about how they are a prog band, I thought their fan base had no idea what prog was.  The newer material is not prog at all.  But after hearing and seeing this DVD, I have been introduced to more of their music and now realize why they have been called a prog band.  They have a catalog of older material that is definately progressive.   <br /> <br />I like the surround mix as it has instruments in the surrounds, along with the crowd cheering (I helped produce several surround music DVDs that I won't mention here) but few on the market have a really enveloping mix like this one.  The fact that it was shot in a smaller, more intimate venue makes this style of mixing more realistic feeling.  If it were in a huge auditorium, the instrument in surround approach would have been cheesy.  I also like their use of DTS encoding - all music DVDs should have DTS.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Many musicians over the years have tried to sing about heartbreak. Many have succeeded, such as the Beatles, the Stones, the Who, and other musicians of that era. However, in the past ten years, there has been a vast parade of bands such as Green Day, Jimmy Eat World, Fall Out Boy, and Good Charlotte, that have sung about feelings such as isolation and heartbreak, but have done it in such a whiney and immature way that it's impossible to listen to them without being disgusted. Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" is a pleasant relief from bands such as this. The songs on this album are deep and heartfelt, with intelligent, metaphoric lyrics that explain every aspect of a broken heart perfectly. Apart from the lyrics, Beck's instrumentals are complex and evocative on this album, mixing strings, both electric and acoustic guitars, drums, synth, and piano. It's like a more mature and engaging version of \\"Mutations\\", still slow and moving, but more professional. Beck has other good albums too, such as \\"Guero\\", \\"Odelay\\", and \\"The Information\\", yet on those albums the songs are more along the lines of fun as opposed to moving, and the true gems are much fewer. Sea Change is one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through without ever feeling like you need to skip a song. It is truly Beck's greatest achievement so far.
3937406328|4.0|As a Chris Rea Fan I was excited when I ordered the 11 CD \\"Blue Guitars\\". When I listened to some of the earlier Blues era struff I couldn't believe they had gone and added fake record scratches and pops. Why oh Why ? For me, instead of lending some authenticity to the to these cuts, this engineering bit sort of cheapened them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Yes, yet another 5-star review. *LOL* <br /> <br />After watching the movie, Serenity, I decided to order the Firefly series. I just finished watching the set and I must admit this is one of the best sci-fi shows ever created! It is a terrible shame it was cancelled after such a sort time. Those television execs definitely got this one wrong. <br />
B00004RYQP|5.0|you can tell the age of the person writing a review for this movie for sure - <br />I'm 45 so I love it <br />I also love science and I like the time warp logical paradox delt with in the story <br />if you don't like just go back and get the orginals and check it all out
B00005JNTX|5.0|All I can say is that I am waiting with baited breath for the next movie!!! two thumbs Way WAY up!
B00005JLXE|1.0|The producers of this move and Marvel comics should be ashamed.They raped a perfectly good comic with this monstrosity of a movie.I think a more appropriately title comic hero movie for Ben Affleck might be the Fat Retarded Janitor.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Being a fan I was looking forward to this movie. It explained so very very much. HOWEVER, if your looking for just a good SCI-FI flick to pass the time stay away, then don't consider this movie. You won't come to love the characters, you won't understand their development. Your heart won't swell with their victories Your heart won't break with their losses.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This movie is so funny, I'm so glad to see a great comedy like this released on DVD just before Christmas!  Olive wants to make it to the pagent, and when she finally does, with her family's help, the result is hilarious.  After all the prissy perfect kids acts, just wait til you see what Olive has in store for her talent.
B00005AWMF|5.0|this is music to listen too when your are seeking to relax or to make time with your partner.
B00005JPDY|5.0|It is easy to believe that rise of the Central Intelligence Agency--and the political-personal toll which such a process consequently exerted on its founders simply might invoke 'James Bond in the swing era' for a screenplay.<br /><br />With the war in Iraq and question's about our own government's accountability (not to mention their family ties to Yale and Skull and Bones) this film definitely is atypical and thus much more somber holiday fare. It raises so many serious and ultimately disturbing questions about America's past--and by extension---current foreign policy objectives.<br /><br />This story focuses on the partially-fictionalized Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a founder of what ultimately is now known as the Central Intelligence Agency. Wilson's initial innocence and idealism is tried over the course of those pivotal years.<br /><br />Recruited to join the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, Wilson earns performance kudos at the expense of ultimately loosing what made himself 'him'; humanity. The constant state of paranoia which he is required to operate under finally eats away at both him and his family life.<br /><br />Wilson's real life counterparts James Jesus Angelton (a long-serving CIA director) and Richard Bissell (a covert operations specialist) provided inspiration for this film. Angelton also ultimately became engulfed by the very 'national security' system which he had long-term involvement with.<br /><br />The scripting and directing of this film easily maintained a 'suspense' environment without resorting to flashy special effects. Wilson and his colleagues are not 'bad' people per say, but they are living on the edges of both American and International society by virtue of having creating gray areas which cannot be disclosed to others out of 'necessity'.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|Fantastic packaging for one of the best films ever made. Worth it for the Stallone commentary alone, but it's loaded with quality extras.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Do not buy this itme. <br /> <br />I watched it and hated it. A good 20 minutes is all about Al Gore's childhood on a farm that has NO revelance whatsoever to Global Warming. <br />When he does talk about Global Warming he sites 'facts' with no sources. So who's to say he's not just making all this up? <br /> <br />There are also extremly petty attacks on Bush scattered throughout the film. His message couldn't be clearer...Al Gore for president.
B0000048CP|5.0|The bridge between \\"Hell Awaits\\" and \\"De Mysteriis dom Satanas\\" - listen to this and awaken to the dawn of black metal.
B0000797IO|4.0|The movie is far better than one might expect. Aniston and especially Gyllenhaal give super performances. Aniston is perfect as a dissatisfied wife, bright but not wise, who takes advantage of a confused teenager to get the sex and attention that is lacking in her marriage. When she finds out that he is immature (to say the least) and emotionally unstable, she decides to dump him. Given the choice between sacrificing herself for a disturbed kid who is hopelessly in love with her, and destroying him she chooses to destroy him (literally since her abandonment causes his suicide). It is hardly a comedy but rather unsettlingly dark and human and tragic. Gyllenhaal has a brilliant moment when he is in the car beside her cracking up emotionally. A bravura performance for him.
B000IZJZLM|1.0|One album was excusable folly. Making a second was definitely an almighty lapse in good taste. A third album? Oh dear, Il Divo, OH DEAR!!!<br /><br />Now most of you are going to assume that I haven't heard this album because I will tell you I don't own it. Well, I've heard it many times in my work place and I've had ample opportunity (if those are the words?) to experience (if that is the word!) this album.<br /><br />So what is it? Well, it isn't opera and it isn't \\"Classical Music\\", and it certainly isn't Pop music.... well, let's just say that it isn't good or creative \\"Pop music\\". What Il Divo seems to me to be is merely a marketing exercise - a means of making money for the producers, the managers, the production company and, last, but not least, the members of this Popera Karaoke outfit.<br /><br />What angers me the most is that Il Divo doesn't lead anyone anywhere - it does bring anyone closer to anything. This group sings pop music in a most displeasing way and they do not sing opera. Il Divo is a concept, and a not terribly well worked out concept at that. A quick answer to Amici? Probably.<br /><br />This music isn't natural and it has grown out of any natural or worthy artistic desires. That is why I hate Il Divo. No one can convince me that an opera singer, trained in and exposed to the great work of Monteverdi, Rameau, Purcell, Handel, Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven, Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, Weber, Verdi, Schubert, Wagner, Debussy, Puccini and Berg, wakes up one day and thinks that singing third rate modern pop songs would be a cool way of spending the rest of his or her career. No, the only reason a music student would choose such a course would be the lure of quick money and fame and fortune without hard work and further study.<br /><br />I don't doubt for a moment that in a couple of years people will dump Il Divo like a hot potato and be a little embarrassed that they ever paid for glop like this.<br /><br />Siempre is undoubtedly the worst Il Divo album and the singers hardly even make a token attempt to blend or sing \\"in ensemble\\". You hear four lads yelling most of the time. There is little attempt to phrase the music or sing with any elegance or grace. I don't think any one of the members of this \\"group\\" could ever have a career in serious opera.<br /><br />You've heard of Bel Canto? Well, this is Can Belto!<br /><br />yuck.end or sing \\"in ensemble\\". You hear four lads yelling most of the time. There is little attempt to phrase the music or sing with any elegance or grace.

B00004SW9R|3.0|The people who made this record were obviously under the influence of a variety of substances which, while fueling their creativity, also enfeebled their musical judgement.  Interesting in short bursts.  Far exceeded by Dr. John's Gumbo, which features virtuoso musicianship as well as excellent production values.  If, however, you like experimental music from brilliant freaked out musicians, you will like this.  Just not my cuppa.
B00005JPCA|5.0|All the other Bond films ones are campy and gimmicky. The Austin Powers movies were successful because they made fun of Bond - with the wacky evil villains and the ridiculous gadgets and world takeover plots. This movie re-invents Bond as a real killer with grit and common sense.  No wacky villains, no goofy plot. I also like that the famous chase scene in this movie is on foot. I can't imagine anyone would be disappointed with this movie. The best Bond film ever!
B000ILYYJE|5.0|It goes like this...if you like the Doors and wish to have an upgraded version of the albums that were released in 1999 as the \\"Complete Studio Recordings\\" this is the product to buy.  Not to mention that it is assembled way better than that collection.  The discs in this box are better protected in digipack cases instead of cardboard cutouts which kind of felt cheap the first time around.  Then there's the sound on these records.  I don't know what they did, but it has a warmer sound and better use of digital remastering technology. It was just the right touches without too much. This is by far a far more attractive looking item, and the looking glass is way cool.  So, yeah I had to own it again!
B000HBKCDC|4.0|It's funny. When I first found out that Sarah McLachlan had a new Christmas-themed album out, I think my first reaction was to roll my eyes. Typically, Christmas albums are tired rehashes of the same standard songs, and no matter who's doing them they come off as uninspired and commercialized.<br /><br />But this is Sarah, and I should have known better.<br /><br />First of all, the selection of music of \\"Wintersong\\" represents an excellent variety.  Leading off with a pitch-perfect rendition of John Lennon's \\"Happy Xmas (War is Over),\\" where Sarah's voice is a welcome improvement to Yoko Ono's, this song sets just the right tone for the rest of the CD. There are many of the standard religious songs, including \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" and \\"Silent Night,\\" all performed well, as well as a very original and unexpected version of \\"The First Noel\\" backed with an impressive percussion section.<br /><br />And there are some of the classics as well, such as a jazzy rendition of \\"Christmas Time is Here\\" (featuring a piano performance by Diana Krall), and soulful versions of \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\"  Though some of these songs are to be expected, Sarah's performance on each does not disappoint.<br /><br />For my money, there are a few standouts on the CD.  Her version of \\"Greensleeves\\" is stunningly beautiful, and \\"River\\" is a perfect addition, with Sarah providing a beautiful vocal for Joni Mitchell's bittersweet lyrics and melody, a heartfelt story of love lost and wistful wishes.<br /><br />And finally, the best surprise on the album is the only original song on it: Sarah's own \\"Wintersong,\\" a quietly heartbreaking piece about lovers parted at Christmas, and memories of happy moments together in years past.  It expresses the sentiment of happy memories and hopes so well, and manages to encapsulate the feeling of a lonely Christmas at the same time...it is simply one of the best Christmas songs I have ever heard, and brings tears to my eyes whenever I listen to it.<br /><br />If I initially thought Sarah McLachlan's take on a collection of Christmas music was going to be boring or disappointing or a sellout, then I could not have been more wrong. Instead, she has put together a good variety of songs old and new, and fine performances for each one.  This is Christmas music the way it should be...from the heart and with the sense of wonder and love present through and through.d, and brings tears to my eyes whenever I listen to it. <br /> <br />If I initially thought Sarah McLachlan's take on a collection of Christmas music was going to be boring or disappointing or a sellout, then I could not have been more wrong.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is an unbelievably fresh take on some great music.  This 40 year old music sounds brand new and it's like a Beatles concert might be today if they could perform one.  I wanted to listen to it like when I listened to new music as a teenager.  In the basement with the lights turned off and the headphones on.  I was so moved by this brand new trip down memory lane, this 53 year old man cried at the very end when John Lennon says \\"goodnight to you's all\\" in his spoken voice.  Can't believe somebody murdered him.  So many highlights.  \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" with acoustic guitar and a string arrangement is beautiful.  Even songs I wasn't nuts about before are fresh.  \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" stands out as does \\"I Am The Walrus\\". This mix makes you smile over and over.  Get it!
0393327655|2.0|By Sam Harris <br />The book by Sam Harris starts with a good observation that atheism is an impediment to a career in politics. Most people in the USA believe in the existence of God. For that matter, most people around the world believe in the existence of God. The Bible says,'the fool hath said in his heart that there is no God'. The book of ROmans tells us that by observing nature we know that there is a Creator of all things. And most people around the world, thus, convinced of the existence of God. True, John Locke, the father of evidentialism also believe that atheism is stupid. In fact the miracle reported in the Gospels is the perfect case of evidentialism for the authenticity of the Christian Gospel and its trustworthiness. But, unfortunately, David Hume used the same evidentialism to argue against Christianity. But we shall realize that the resurrection of Jesus is a historical fact and that lays the strongest foundation for the existence of God. Now let me deal with each of the ten myths the writer discussed.  <br /> <br />1) Atheists believe that life is meaningless. <br />I agree that atheists can find some sort of meaning to their lives. But what difference does it make to your life whether you live a meaningful or meaningless life since at the end all you got is distengration of the molecules of your body into the grave. From atheistic perspective Hitler and Mother Theresa both had their molecules disappeared into the ground and had the same fate. But the life of Mother Theresa is only meaningful if God exists because evil must be punished and good must be rewarded and that is what most people in the world wish.  <br /> <br />2) Atheism is responsible for the greatest crimes in human history. <br />You can argue that concentration camps and gulap fields are not due to atheism but due to political factors. We can use same argument to dismiss the charge against Christianity as the cause of crusades. Crusades have more to do with political factors of Europe than with the teachings of Lord Jesus who taught to love your enemies always.  <br />  The history of twentieth century alone proves that Godless atheists killed more people than the faithful. Besides, their killings are in accordance with the worldviews they espoused. Karl Marx, an avowed atheist, wrote in Das Kapital that violence is inevitable as we move from one achievement of communism to the other. Most atheists with bloody hands also believed in Darwinian doctrine of survival of the fittest. There is no God to ask us accountability. We are the strongest and we could eliminate the week for the progress of human race. Good, that is why Marx wanted to dedicate his Das Kapital to Darwin, though Darwin rejected his request.  <br />On the other hand violence done by Christians is radically contradictory to the teachings of Christ and encourages us to look to Christ, not at Christians.  <br /> <br />3) Atheism is dogmatic. <br />As the historian Stephen Henry Roberts (1901-71) once said: \\"I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.\\" GOod, but if Jesus is the only way to heaven and if that is true, having no way is as bad as having many false ways. The authenticy of Bible is proved historically, archaeologically and philosophically than any other book of ancient times.  <br /> <br />4) Atheists think everything in the universe arose by chance. <br /> <br />Atheists might add natural selection to chance. But does natural selection have some sort of intelligence to direct the evolution? More than 99 percent of mutations are harmful for the organism and you are betting on one percent to carry the evolution in the forward direction? Try reaching your goal with 99 people hitting you backwards while only one person pushing you forward. There is no scientific evidence to Darwinism. It is a myth with no scientific credibility and deserves to be removed from our public schools.  <br />It seems that Richard Dawkins became some sort of prophet to atheism. But let us not forget that great scientists of modern science how established the pillars of modern science like Isaach Newton, Tycho Brahe, Robert Boyle, Carl Linnaeus, Francis Bacon, Mendel, George Cuvier etc were not only believers in God but staunch Christians. Who cares what lilliput scientists like Dawkins believe about God?  <br /> <br />5) Atheism has no connection to science. <br /> <br />90 percent of general public believe in God while same percentage of scientists donot believe. That is the sort of impunity the atheists have towards general public. A smart scientist does not mean He has common sense to believe in God. These smart scientists who had no God were the ones who did living experiments on Jewish children during holocause on the basis of doing good to humanity. <br /> <br />6) Atheists are arrogant. <br /> <br />Arrogance has nothing to do with truth. You can be humble and wrong while your neighbor is arrogant and right.   <br /> <br />7) Atheists are closed to spiritual experience. <br />Atheist can have spiritual experience. Buddha, who did not any belief in a personal God, started his faith in a spiritual tradition. But that spiritualism is subjective and convenient. No wonder, most Hollywood celebrities left Absolutist Christian GOd to believe in Buddha who leaves you to live by your own rules. What the atheist really wants is not intellectual freedom, but moral freedom. Spirituality without a God who gave us Ten Commandments is fine with atheists.  <br /> <br />8) Atheists believe that there is nothing beyond human life and human understanding. <br /> <br />The naturalism offers no hope beyond the grave. Life according to naturalism is an accident and trivial in the long tree of evolution. Only God can give us a true meaning to this life and life beyond.  <br /> <br />9) Atheists ignore the fact that religion is extremely beneficial to society. <br />Christianity does not teach us that we should help the poor out of our desire to get rewards from God. The Bible tells us that we are created in the image of God and when we see our suffering neighbors who are created in the image of God we are obliged to help them for 'who' they are, not 'what' we get. The best philanthropic organizations like Red Cross and Salvation Army were started by Christians, not atheist. Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, the largest contributors to the philanthrophy adhere to Christianity, not to atheism.  <br /> <br />10) Atheism provides no basis for morality. <br /> <br />THe author contended that Bible condoned slavery. But, first what sort of slavery the Bible condoned. Read the Torah carefully and you will discover the rules God laid on the masters on how to treat their slaves. We should realize what sort of relationship God prescribed between masters and their slaves. We should not be confounded by simply looking at words like 'slavery'. In one sense, we are all slaves to the government, but we know what sort of relationship exists between us and our government.  <br />When the slave practice went against the teachings of Christ and Bible, the Christians started the abolition movement. Great abolitionists like Abraham Lincoln, William WIlberforce, John Brown, Frederick Douglass were Christians, not atheist. Let us not forget that Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist minister thumping his Bible, not a biology atheist professor thumping Origin of Species. <br />Conclusion: Atheism is stupid, Christianity is intelligent and reasonable.
B000EWBKKI|2.0|I was really excited to get one of my favorite movies on Blu-ray, but unfortunately, the transfer is awful. I really couldn't tell a difference between this version and the DVD version I have!
B000ASDFJU|3.0|I received this set as a Christmas gift and of course was thrilled. However, I noticed several glitches in some discs and later read other online reviews stating similar problems. To my disappointment, the entire disc 2 of season 3 will not play along with many episodes in other seasons. Although the packaging and other features are wonderful, what good is this collector's set if the episodes won't even play? <br /> <br />I think it is highly unfair to continue marketing and selling this product if there are known errors reported. I may as well have bought all the seasons separately. Now I'll end up losing money if I return it and I wouldn't even feel right re-selling it to someone else.
B0001XALT6|5.0|Copland should have been nominated for an oscar.. It is a shame that hollywood is so biased. This movie truly represents what drama is all about.. Sly does outstanding work as freddy and deserved much more credit for his performance... Great film to watch !! A shame it has so much profanity. That is the only negative comment I have about the film..
0446528056|5.0|Happy Holidays. I stayed up waiting to hear Santa and his reindeer on the rooftop last night and finished this book while anticipating Christmas and its' joy.  And it was such an awesome book: I felt at peace with the stress of the season. I felt love from my husband as he slept beside me. I just felt so wonderful after reading this story. It's one of the best ever written. <br />It's the story of true love-----boy doesn't always get girl. But he gets something even deeper----true love and he understands what unconditional love is all about. How to love someone more than you love yourself. And how to \\"give\\" from your heart. <br />It's a wonderful story of a patriotic man in the Army with an awakening about his father's dysfunction and how to love him and accept him more. That was truly a wonderful part of the entire story. And to get to that place in life, he had to love a woman and learn to accept what she had to give him in return. <br />It brings in Sept. 11th, volunteerism at its best, patriotism during the Iraq war, love of family and understanding of life and love. <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel at peace with life and love. It gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling. Enjoy.
0393035158|3.0|Accepting something on faith is based on ignorance and a learned aversion to critical thought. Harris makes this point compellingly. Other conclusions are marred by flawed reasoning. He condemns violence if the \\"bad guys\\" are guilty and justifies it if the \\"good guys\\" do it. Too many times, one reads \\"it is obvious that\\" when no such obviousness has been established. His rationale for torture is inexcusable. Overall, a worthwhile read so long as one is mindful that some of his sources are poorly chosen (they reinforce his biased beliefs about the world) and his logic comes from wrongheaded starting points (if war is ok then so is torture).
B000J103PC|4.0|Ever rent a movie simply because nothing came out that week? I decided to check this out simply because there was nothing else I haven't seen and I'm not a guy that shys around from \\"chick flicks\\", well obvious ones anyway. I remember it was just sitting on my counter as I watched other movies but then I thought I'm going to have to watch this sooner or later so I popped it in and surprisingly, while it does have some minor faults, I was actually surprised that it wasn't terrible but it was actually...good? <br /> <br />It's a cutthroat world in the fashion industry where people are essentially worried about wearing the right clothes, being skinny and caring about material things. This of course makes Andy, (nickname for Andrea so it's not a guy), a smart but inexperienced and a size-6, a fish out of water at a fashion magazine, headed by Miranda Priestley, a nasty brutally honest woman, or just plain brutal. Andy needs the job to get ahead with her career so she has to suck it up and track down everything Miranda asks including skirts she didn't specify as to what kind, an unpublished Harry Potter book and knowing how to drop off things at her house without any problems. <br /> <br />I remember working at a radio station where I was essentially tasked to do a few tasks that required a lot of time to finish them properly which of course meant by myself and not having any assistance or deadline extensions. Like Andy, I felt like way too much for just one person so I actually did started to feel sympathy but only thing was Anne Hathaway didn't really feel completely stressed out but more annoyed than anything. Whether it was bad casting or direction, I don't know. Of course the scene-stealer is Meryl Streep who plays probably the meanest thing I've seen. The other cast members are fine in their roles but in terms of characters, Andy's friends seem a bit underdeveloped. We're meant to see the job strain carry over with them but it doesn't feel as it should be. <br /> <br />Ultimately though the film's about people's obsession and with that we get a look into people obsessing on clothing and must say, despite Anne's Hathaway's slightly ok performance, she looks quite radiant in the various dresses, including some shots where she switches dresses thanks to directing and editing and it's a good use of it. I find it hard though to accept Andy's reluctance to be Miranda's assistant since it's just simply her way of going about things. Miranda isn't really a devil so much as really difficult so despite my radio station similarity, my case and Andy's were simply unfair but a case of \\"that's the way the world works\\" so it was hard for me to feel empathy on that but just a I-know-how-you-feel thing. <br /> <br />Unlike some chick flicks where it just oozes with cliche and bad comedic writing like people all of a sudden tripping or banging their heads, Prada feels more like the smart-women's comedy, it goes more for situation comedy rather than a go-for-broke approach. While the story is fairly predictable, it's at least an enjoyable romp that you might forget as easily as the latest trend. Call it the bell-bottoms of movies so to speak.
B000J3EEBY|2.0|I bought this album thinking that it would be on par with her others.  It is not.  Disappointingly not. If you are a McKennitt fan, I am guessing that you buy her music for her expressive voice and lively music.  This had very little of either to offer.  The album is predominated with overused Middle Easterm melodies and offer very little voice or are melodies with a few vocal sighs.  Some of the \\"songs\\" are almost totally this genre and some of the melodies are tired since she has used them exhaustingly before, but with livlier results.  The predominance of music and lack of her usual freshness gave me the impression that she was just filling space to make an income on this \\"new\\" issue.  Don't waste your money.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|George Martin has taken a huge risk and it pays off handsomely.  Taking portions of the Beatles vast collection of popular songs and remixing them into one 78 minute musical experience is dazzling.  Each song is remastered flawlessly and seamlessly edited into one another with a vast interspersing of original Beatles sound effects and orchestration.  While you hear one song with the band, there might be a sound byte from another songs background mixed into the complete experience.  It's a non-stop joy ride from the a capella of \\"Because\\" to the finale of \\"All You Need Is Love\\".  It's all Beatles and it's all fantastic.  The DVD expands on this brilliant idea and reproduces the sound in 5.1 digital surround.  This is not the `best' of the Beatles - it is the `genius' of the Beatles!
B000063DI8|3.0|I have all the Maiden albums except those with Di Anno,and I think this album is still rather enjoyable to listen to.Cripes,Judas Priest fans still rave about their early efforts which to my mind sound distinctly amateurish and outdated compared to this.Looking at the economics;why,if at the time of my writing,is this album selling used and new here at amazon at nigh on $11 if it's so bad.Seems to me that the silent majority secretly like it and are buying it anyway.They just keep quiet about it to avoid copping any flack.If people insist on giving every song an aural autopsy instead of just being entertained they're never going to be happy.
B00005RDRO|2.0|...is the script. I am amazed at the rave reviews below. I envy their ability to laugh at jokes that wouldn't pass muster at Mad Magazine. The direction, by a theater director who seems to understand nothing about film, is flat and awkward. It's as if everyone, including the wonderful (and wasted) cast, conspired to snuff what little comedic potential there may have been in the script. As a supposed satire of mystery novels, the film is obliged to be more clever than the average novel it parodies, yet there is nothing remotely clever about the plot (if it can be said to have a plot), and makes no sense whatsoever, on any level. It was painful enough to sit through a cable channel broadcast. It seems a crime to ask anyone to actually pay for the ordeal.
B000FS9FCQ|2.0|V for Vendetta is ostensibly an action movie with political overtones.  What it really is is a bad movie with a dangerous message, and I cannot wonder but to think that Wachowski simply didn't know what he was doing; that in an effort to make a \\"hip\\" action flick, he instead produced a terrorist-propaganda film.    The main character \\"V\\" decides that he will not go to the people with his message of revolution.  Instead, he will assassinate political leaders and bomb buildings.  Natalie Portman's character is kidnapped by him and essentailly tortured, until she \\"believes\\" in his political endeavors.  All of this is slickly presented and dressed up to be something other than what it is -reeducation, torture, murder.  It's the political method of Mao and Pol Pot given an MTV makeover.      To make matters worse, Wachowski hits us over the head with sanctimonious messages from the darkest days of political correctness and campus speech codes.  At one point, we are told a lengthy story of two lesbians who are brutally persecuted because of their sexual preference.  In another scene, William Hurt gives a little speech about how the Quran is now illegal.  The Anglican Bishop is a vicious child-molester.  Christianity is openly condemned throughout the film.  It is so over-the-top that it smacks of film-school amatuerism.    This movie has the philosophical depth of an 8th grader's book report on \\"Animal Farm.\\"  And we have to remember that it came from a comic book.    So take a comic book and turn it in to a movie using the director that gave us the tower dung-heaps called \\"Matrix II & III.\\"  Some movies are provocative and disturbing in a good way -V for Vendetta is not one of them.

6305971145|5.0|I remember when I was 8 years watching this movie with my seven brothers and sister and my mom and dad.  We all love christmas and the story of Santa  Claus.  When my parents purchased this on on vhs, I fell in love with it. <br />Now a mother of three I was looking through my mom tapes looking for the movie and it was missed placed.  I was upset so I called blockbuster to see if they had it to rent.  Unfortunately, they did not and I have been to three different stores looking for it so my children could watch this beloved christmas story.  I finally looked on amazon and found it.  I was very excited to found that I order it and can not wait to get it to show my kids the magic of christmas. <br />Anyone who has this and grew uo in the 80's knows what I mean and will be taken away by the joy of this movie.  It is one of the best chistmas story ever made.  Knoe digially enhanced many generations will come to enjoy this movie as well.
B00000255X|5.0|I've always been a fan of Dylan's long form songs--\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", \\"Desolation Row\\", \\"Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\\" and \\"Jack of Hearts\\", among others.  \\"Desire\\", released directly after \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" has three such opuses, and I've loved 'em all for 30 years.  The band that played at my wedding reception in 1991 played \\"Hurricane\\", the story of prizefighter Ruben Carter's arrest for a murder he may not have committed.  \\"Isis\\", a fantastical and allegorical tale of a treasure hunter, may not quite measure up to opus status by way of length, but the twists and turns taken by Dylan's story are always captivating--along with the great images and rhymes, my favorite being \\"the wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous/we chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn/when he died I hoped that it wasn't contagious/but I made up my mind that I had to go on.\\"  The third of the trio, \\"Joey\\", is certainly an opus--both lyrically and musically with its evocative accordion and violin accompaniment, along with Emmylou Harris's harmonies.  \\"One day they blew him down/in a clam bar in New York/he could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork/he pushed the table over to protect his family/then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.\\"  Maybe Bob is borrowing from The Godfather here, but it's still a vivid and arresting image to me.  Others in here have dismissed \\"Mozambique\\" as a lightweight song, but its catchy melody provides a good counterpoint to life on the ground in that country, which I don't think is near as idyllic as Bob describes.  The remaining songs \\"Black Diamond Bay\\", \\"Cup of Coffee\\", \\"Durango\\" and \\"Sara\\" are all good--they just don't grab me like three of my favorite Dylan story songs do.

It's perfect for a quick read and its chapters are short so you can pick it up and put it down.  There is also that quality of heart that makes this book quite touching.  I'd recommend it to anyone.

B00005JPE7|4.0|Twenty seven years after his first championship fight, Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa is just living his life as a normal guy.  His wife, Adrian, is dead and he visits her grave regularly.  He hangs out with his brother-in-law, Paulie, and goes to places that remind him of his and Adrian's courtship.  He runs a restaurant, Adrian's, and walks around during dinner reliving the glory days of his fighting years with customers who like the sentimentality of it. And he's struggling to maintain a relationship with his son, whose friends call him \\"Little Rocky\\" and who desperately wants to shake off his image as Rocky Balboa's son and make a name for himself.<br /><br />The current undisputed heavyweight champion of the world is a man named Mason Dixon.  Dixon is fast, quick, and youg, but people doubt his talent because he's never really fought anyone who would prove much of a threat.  Since his victories don't seem to be much of a challenge, everyone wonders if Dixon really is worth his salt as a boxer. Then ESPN has the bright idea of staging a computer-simulated a fight between Rocky Balboa at his prime and Mason Dixon right now. This is supposed to mirror a similar fight that was once similated between Rocky Marciano and Muhammed Ali.  In this version, Balboa wins. Angered, Dixon challenges Rocky to an exhibition fight to go 10 rounds and to prove once and for all who really is the greatest.<br /><br />I have to say that in order to like this movie you have to be a fan of the original Rocky franchise. I went with one friend who, like me, was a die hard Rocky fan and another who couldn't care less. Whether or not we liked the original films was reflected in the split decision between who liked and who didn't like Rocky Balboa.  This movie was a tad bit melodramatic, but all the Rocky movies are and if you're a fan you'd know that going into it.  Regardless of whether you like the old films or not, I'd suggest rewatching the original Rocky from 1979 before going to see this movie. It's  not really necessary to see any of the sequels, but there are a lot of flashbacks and clips from the first film and I think seeing it beforehand will help put them into perspective.  Even as a longtime fan of the Rocky series, if I hadn't watched the original within the last week I'm pretty sure there were parts of this one that would have been lost on me.<br /><br />Still, as a whole, I really enjoyed this movie. It focuses a lot on Rocky's efforts to rebuild his life in the aftermath of Adrian's death.  You can tell that since she's been gone he hasn't really known what to do with himself. Going back into the ring with Dixon is his way of exorcising the demon's that have been haunting him since her death. It also allows him to get back his relationship with his son and to finally bury the past so that he can go on with his future. Melodramatic it may be, but I love Rocky and this is a fitting end to the series.s  not really necessary to see any of the sequels, but there are a lot of flashbacks and clips from the first film and I think seeing it beforehand will help put them into perspective.

B00005V3Z4|1.0|Have you ever seen any Jimmy Stewart movies?  Well, Donnie Darko rips off two of them:  \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Harvey\\". <br /> <br />Do you remember the last 15 or 20 minutes of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", when the angel, Clarence, shows George Bailey a horror scenario about what the world would have been like had he never been born? <br /> <br />Well, Donnie Darko is exactly like \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".  Except it takes that 15 or 20 minutes of gloom and stretches it out for 2 hours.  Wow eh?  Really heartwarming stuff. <br /> <br />Also, instead of Clarence the angel as Donnie Darko's guide, enter the giant bunny rabbit from Harvey, who instead of speaking plainly, whispers to him cryptically in a creepy nightmarish sort of way. <br /> <br />And, at the end of the film...instead of discovering that life is precious, every second of every minute is a gift and that he can touch others through his life...is not alone...etc.  Instead of all of that, what does Donnie learn?  That the world would be better off if he were dead. <br /> <br />Wow eh?  So edgy and different huh? <br /> <br />Well, actually...tell you the truth...I think the premise sounds pretty dumb.  And the kicker to it all is...the movie doesn't make sense.  Nothing is revealed or disclosed.  Donnie has to die.  Why?  So that it can be gloomy and dark.  But why?  Who knows.  Oh right...he saved the world...by killing a guy for no reason, letting his girlfriend get runover by a car, burning down a house and flooding his school.  Don't worry...it will all make sense in the end...not. <br /> <br />And believe it or not...that's what people like about it.  They like that it doesn't make any sense.  Why?  They confuse poor storytelling, and an unnecessarily confusing script as being brilliant and \\"deep\\".  And then they can go around proving how smart they are that they \\"get\\" the movie, that it's a masterpiece, etc. <br /> <br />A highschool kid is given a quest to die.  The boy is depressed about this...and feels alone in the world...blahblahblah.  Insert some coming up age stuff, family problems...skip ahead, skip ahead...and he kills himself and the world is a better place. <br /> <br />Yup...really makes you think... <br /> <br />Butterfly Effect was better...even if it lost steam down the stretch and Kutcher was pathetic at times.  It's basically the comprehendable version of Donnie Darko...if you're into this new wave of depressing and gloomy teenage time travel flicks...

If any musical piece pulses with spacey wonderment better than the Tim Blake inspired 'A sprinkling of clouds' then I most definitely need to hear it. From start to finish, a fascinating experience and an amazing 50 minute journey into the mind of Daevid Allen. Listen to it alone with the lights off and candles on.... it will take you to a better place.
0062502182|1.0|I bought this to read during my Christmas Vacation. Here it is Christmas Day and I'm waiting to go to the family's for dinner. I'm wishing now I'd bought a thriller or something at least well written. Fortunately I just opened my gifts and my sister sent me a book on dogs. I'm saved. Maybe if I was 17 and just starting out in life \\"The Alchemist\\" might strike a chord. If a person is happy with their life and direction they shouldn't spend the money on this book. It is boring, boring, boring.
B00005JPGM|4.0|What was happening in Sierra Leone circa 1999 was maddeningly ignored by the world at large, as warring factions fought for control of the country's lucrative diamond mines and the worldwide diamond monopoly exploitated and manipulated the situation to keep their grip on the market secure, at the cost of the country's stability and the lives of thousands of Africans.  Just ask Danny Archer (Leonardo Dicaprio).  Even though Archer is a fictional fortune hunter dashing arcoss Sierra Leone to cash in on the chaotic diamond trade, his revelations to crusading journalist Manny bowen (Jennifer Connelly) of greed and capitolism run amok are startling and they help lend moral resonance to a film that is otherwise a thrilling two and a half hour chase through the African bush.   <br /> <br />Archer, an experienced oppurtunist, is desparate to escape Africa and he finds his shot when, imprisoned for diamond smuggling, he overhears fellow prisoner Solomon Vandy (Djimon Houson) being grilled by a wounded rebel general about the whereabouts of a large and rare pink diamond.  Archer breaks Vandy out of prison and the two (along with Connelly's Bowen) sprint around the countryside to find where Vandy stashed the diamond, a mutual argreement since Archer wants out of Africa and Vandy wants to reconnect with his vanished family.  Vandy, who is played with immense passion by Houson, is a fisherman who lost track of his family when his village was raided by rebel soldiers, including child soldiers brandishing AK-47's bought from the illicit diamond trade.  Vandy's wife and daughters escape to a refugee camp but his son is captured by rebel soldiers and indoctrinated into the army.  The brutal abuse and brainwashing of child soldiers and the violence inflicted on civilians by all warring factions is portrayed with unflinching and devastating realism by director Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai), whose vision of total war in Africa is augmented greatly by cinematographer Eduardo Serra (Girl with a Pearl Earring) and editor Steven Rosenblum, a Zwick favorite.  The images of Vandy's son killing rebel prisoners blindfolded, shooting heroin and giving in to the serpentine manipulation of his demented commander is heartbreaking, all a consequence of the continuing war that large Diamond corporations and monopolies have a stake in continuing and Archer has a stake in exploiting. <br /> <br />The film's themes and imagery haunt because of the superb acting from the trio of leads (Dicaprio, Connelly and Houson) that carry the entire film.  Dicaprio has the trickiest role of a rougish and amorous soldier of fortune willing to sell out anyone and anything to acheive his goals, and he tears into the role with a confidence and maturity that is worlds away from \\"Titanic\\" and even his early work with Martin Scorcese.  He's charismatic, cunning and lethal, and perhaps this constitutes the finest work he has ever done.  Connelly takes what would have been a throw-away part as a moralistic journalist and energizes it with undiluted moral anger and indignation, harboring no illusions to how hard exposing the story of blood diamonds and the beneficiaries will be.  Houson is pure power and passion as a father pushed to edge, who will trek through the hellish countryside of Sierra Leone to find his family.   <br /> <br />\\"Blood Diamond\\" is not an easy film to watch.  The violence is unrelenting and shattering and the amoral greed disheartening.  Even the most uplifting aspects of the film are haunted by the chance that something like Sierra Leone may very well happen again.  It is true that \\"Blood Diamond\\" is a dynamite chase film, and it is entertaining on that front, but it is the theme of global greed coldly manipulating nations and lives for profit and the imagery of savage total war and child soldiers that is impossible to shake.

032147404X|4.0|It's obvious Kelby's book was too short and he needed lots of fluff to get his minimum word count.  The jokes are absolutely terrible.  It's a classic example of someone who's not funny trying to be funny.  Hey Scott, leave the jokes to Deke ok?    This is an intermediate book.  Advanced users aren't going to get much out of it, just a basic reminder of what they already know.  Beginners are going to enjoy it, but they'll also need another book such as Understanding Exposure by Peterson.    One thing I really liked is he didn't waste too much time on basics, especially aperture etc.  This was a relief.  The second thing I really liked is it was written as if we were out shooting together and I was asking questions.  I love this casual format and the book was extremely easy to read (I read it all in one sitting).  He also turned me on to some equipment I wasn't aware of (the stop down filter, which goes from 2 to 8 stops is very cool until I almost had a heart attack when I saw the $300 price).  He really stresses the importance of a tripod and shooting at dawn & dusk.  I've heard these before but for some reason am still disappointed with my hand-held midday photos.  I think this is a big one, because most people want magazine quality photos but don't have the time for it (myself included).    The section at the end describes why some of the photos \\"work\\".  I found myself thinking I don't want to take a photo like that on several of them (he is famous for his photoshop skills, not his photography skills) but it was a good wrap-up of the basics presented throughout the book.    Finally, there were a few bits of information that I found controversial.    Such as using f11 for portraits.  That usually puts the background in focus.  Another, he recommends a shredder to shred your old photo CD/DVDs before throwing them away.  Wouldn't a pair of scissors do just as well?  But it gets more serious:  He states that \\"you\\" (the reader) will never be able to get the types of shots you see in magazines.  And why is that?  Because even if you get up at 5:30am all the good spots will have already been taken.  And I don't think this was another one of his bad jokes.  I found it very negative and discouraging.      Overall, I liked this book much better than many of the others I've seen but it did frustrate me nonetheless.  I think it's helpful for beginners and intermediate users.  Even if you know all of that (who doesn't know one should use a tripod?) it's a good reminder with plenty of examples.  I think the book could have went a little farther and gave some really useful information instead of describing all the Epson printer models.      It's a shame, because this book really had the potential to be a 5 star   book, but it falls short.  Kelby brags about having written 37 books.  I would prefer a few outstanding ones than 37 that are just good enough to get published.

Listen and listen again.<br /><br />I am a rocker and fingerstyle acoustic guitarist.  Some new-age reviewers are sickeningly pompous as if their false elitism disallows recognition of good work.  Again, listen to the music and enjoy.  Mr. Oldfield takes us on journeys to places yet visited. Textures and virtuosity, interesting layers live here.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins is a real World HERO and through  DELUSIONS,  he pulls no punches. Though much of the material in the book is drawn from his vast array of other works, his own substantial intuitiveness and other significant minds, he is first and foremost, the Thomas Paine of our time. He is thoughtful to remind us of Darwins theories and how they have stood the test of time; of Einsteins staunch disregard for orthodox religion and his contempt for those who would publish otherwise;  of the great Thomas Jefferson's disdain for religion; and most importantly, of how the billions of people in the world, and especially the United States and the Middle East,present and past, have been snookered about gods, prophets, money-making scoundrels using god as their employer, sneaky evangelicals and their fake universities, and misguided religious apologists; as well as being hoodwinked by mass media run by corporate interests for war and peace.  <br />    What a shame that in this modern world, where men and women have risen to such high ground in their quest for technolocical learning and social freedoms, that we have shunned the necessary learning of good science in the name of fear and religion and are in danger of going full circle back to to the 'Dark Ages.' The Crusades are on again, no disguising it as ethnic cleansing as Richard points out so vividly. And this book, the man behind this book, and all the other great wonders of our natural world discovered by courageous men and women, who either suffered for their learning or were free to do so, will all be for naught if the terrible, well-financed onslaught by religion on our democratic beliefs and values that are  a meager couple of hundred years old, continue to become fuel for cloned creationists seeking a rapture and so-called heavenly bliss with their super-natural, angry, spiteful god of vengeance.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|A Masterpiece !  Many of the messages and meanings I missed when watching it the first time.  Many of my friends who have seen the movie feel I am reading too much into it...and maybe so.  Two situations which are most questioned are: <br /> <br />1.  The policeman who first arrives at the bank and reports the bank status --- at the ending - when he tells Denzel - \\"You never know whos listening\\".  I feel he knew exactly what what was going on and gave Denzel the tip.  Two of my viewing friends feel it was only chit chat. <br /> <br />2.  The child playing the video game - the video game was violent and taught violence - I feel it was an exact thinking as what the swat team members felt when they were brainstorming and creating scenarios of how they would take the bank. <br /> <br />It is a well done movie - one friend thought it racial against whites - and felt the whites were being put down ?  Maybe.  I have purchased the moving and plan to see it again to see more.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I have to admit, when Supernatural aired it's first season, I thought it would be nothing more than pretty boys dealing with pseudo-scary Monsters of the Week.  <br /> <br />I was bored one night and watched an episode from Season Two; \\"Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things\\", and enjoyed it so much that I bought Season One without seeing any of the episodes. I ended up loving the entire thing. The characters are realistic and emotionally investing; they are alot more complex than merely two attractive men. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki repeatedly deliver amazing performances, and in my own opinion are two of the best young actors right now.  <br /> <br />Season One has it's hits (\\"Pilot\\", \\"Dead in the Water\\", \\"Asylum\\", \\"Faith\\", and \\"Devil's Trap\\" were a few personal favorites)and misses (\\"Wendigo\\", \\"Bugs\\", and \\"Route 666\\", I'm looking at you). The Supernatural part of the series ranges from bad (\\"Bugs\\"...there's just really no excuse) to creepy (\\"Provenance\\") to holy-crap-sleep-with-the-light-on (\\"Bloody Mary\\"). <br /> <br />But ultimately the end of \\"Devil's Trap\\" is when I realized that I was hooked. I was actually leaning forward and not breathing because I couldn't believe what was happening on my screen. I may have even shouted at my TV when the episode ended. Shut up. :-) <br /> <br />I would suggest this DVD to anybody interested in urban legends or shows that deal with fantasy elements. It has good storytelling, great characters, and well-paced plotting.
0553210246|5.0|Michael Henchard, a down-on-his-luck, unemployed hay trusser, succumbs to the siren call of alcohol at a country fair. Subconsciously feeling his wife, Susan, is holding him back from success in this world, he awakes to sobriety the next morning and realizes that, in a foolish fit of pique, he has auctioned her and his daughter, Elizabeth-Jane, off to a sailor. Despite his frantic efforts to find them, they have disappeared. Ravaged with guilt over his selfish, impulsive act, he swears he will not take another drink for twenty-one years.<br /><br />Whether his wife was indeed one of Henchard's problems is left for the reader to ponder as Henchard moves to Casterbridge, prospers wildly in business and eventually becomes the town's leading citizen and mayor. Henchard's wheel of fortune, however, begins to spin on a wobbly axle as Donald Farfrae, an enterprising young Scot travelling to seek his fortune, enters his employ as the manager of his business. At the same time, Susan and Elizabeth-Jane, re-enter Henchard's life believing that Michael Newson, the sailor who had purchased them some nineteen years earlier, has perished at sea. Henchard's life truly begins to come apart when Lucetta Templeman, a former lover, also moves to Casterbridge and, ashamed of her past romantic entanglement with Henchard, seeks to hold him to his promise of marriage!<br /><br />Hardy raises many issues but, not expressing his own opinion through an unequivocal direction in the story's plot line, seems content to leave these issues as topics for sober analysis by his readers. Hardy questions the conflict between the merits of tradition vs modernization. There is the enormous irony that Henchard's success as a business person seems clearly attributable in part to his tee-totalling vow but is founded upon the five guineas seed capital raised through the auction of his wife and daughter! Henchard seems to epitomize the constant personal conflicts we all face between decisiveness and strength of character as opposed to impulsiveness and stubborn bullheaded intransigence! One wonders whether Lucetta is flighty, coquettish, thoughtless and selfish or is she an early manifestation of modern woman sadly out of time and years ahead of the ladies around her? Is Farfrae to be admired or scorned for his meteoric rise to power in Casterbridge and his complete devastation of Henchard's place among his peers?<br /><br />Perhaps the most powerful moment of the entire novel comes with the discovery of Henchard's will and his words directing that the world leave him to rest in forgotten isolation and that no person mark or mourn his passing in any fashion. Once again, we are left to decide for ourselves whether Henchard's life should be pitied, forgiven, admired or looked upon with scorn and disgust.<br /><br />To the readers of the day, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" would have been perceived as a darkly pessimistic tragedy that might have evoked emotions akin to those raised by Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" or Sophocles' \\"Oedipus Rex\\". A classic worthy of the term, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", certainly never cheerful or uplifting, is however many, many things - compelling, moving, disturbing, thought-provoking and poignant.

0553288105|1.0|This book substantiates the unpopular reality that Mr. Asimov is bluster and hype. I have yet to encounter anything of his pen that warrants a positive adjective. Clearly, the factory has consumed the wayward crickets & dumbfounded sparrows; consequently, the gentleman's legend enters a room 10 yards previous to his apparition. The phantasm should not be mocked--the man has his legions and he is entitled to the throngs--but a scrutinous qualification of what denotes & defines interesting literature should be taken under wing. This book, like his other books, never yields a jolt and I asseverate that it was not worth the nickel that was extracted from my lint-infested pocket to pay its way into my library. BOREDOM.

Its caught me at first listen and after many listens it still moves me, amazing slow, kinda like Centerfolds but better. Another hit here!!!!    Post Blue - 9/10 the most upbeat song in the album, very fun to sing along to, not the classic Placebo stuff, this and songs like this is where they get more Pop, very cathchy (almost too cathcy) and predictable, but i like it.    Because I Want You 3/10 I cant believe this song is a single, pffff very annoying song i cant stand it.    Blind 8/10 Oh and another hit here, slow, dark and beautiful.    Pierrot The Clown 6/10 So...so... Its a lot like Follow The Cops Back Home but definitely not as good, this is one of the songs i skip all the time.    Broken Promise 4/10 Nah, bad, boring stuff, another song that i skip...    One Of A Kind 9/10 Same old Placebo as we all like. Hard to get into, but once you do, you will be amazzed how great this song is.     In The Cold Light Of Morning 5/10 Another skippable track, kinda catchy at chorus but not very good.    Song To Say Goodbye 10/10 Amazing Placebo hit, very differentfrom their old metearial but a very good song.
B00005JPE7|5.0|\\"Rocky Balboa\\" is wonderful, and a \\"must-see\\" film for those who liked any of the earlier \\"Rocky\\" movies.  Sylvester Stallone has underscored once again that he is an enormous talent.<br /><br />Burt Young as \\"Paulie\\" is terrific as always; and Talia Shire as \\"Adrian\\" is missing, but her spirit is present throughout the movie and undergirds it.  If anyone could fill the void left by her absence, it is Geraldine Hughes as \\"Marie,\\" who is a lovely Irish lass, and is the perfect counterpoint to Sly.<br /><br />The photography is excellent; it is beautifully filmed, with wonderful flashbacks; and it is much more complicated and sophisticated than the earlier \\"Rocky\\" movies.  The casting is terrific, especially in the scenes set in Philadelphia.  Stallone was right to have chosen Antonio Tarver, who does a fine job as the fighter \\"Mason Dixon.\\"  The fight scenes are very well staged--and photographed--even more so than the previous films.<br /><br />At one point, Paulie asks Rocky whether he's \\"peaked yet?\\"  Perhaps the essence of the \\"Rocky\\" films is that none of us has peaked, ever, and that each of us marches to a different drummer.  Just when they say and believe that we can't do it, we say or believe that we can, and we attempt to do what few would conceive of doing.<br /><br />We challenge norms and sacred cows and status quos, and this life has meaning because we do it.  That is what \\"Rocky\\" has been about since the first film, and Sly Stallone has mastered the art in this one, truly mastered it.  He is great--there is no other adjective to describe him.<br /><br />And yes, there is a Bill of Rights and Americans do have rights--as Rocky observes--despite the fact that hack judges (who should be removed from the bench) and mean-spirited prosecutors (who should be disbarred) and politicians routinely ignore them and trample on them and spit on them daily throughout this great country.<br /><br />In short, \\"Rocky Balboa\\" has something for everyone, and it is a story that should go on forever, even though Stallone has said that this is his last \\"Rocky\\" film.  But Sly, we're just getting to know \\"Rocky.\\"  And physically, all of us should look as good as Sly Stallone!<br /><br />Buy it or rent it when it becomes available on DVDs.  It will be worth it.and it is a story that should go on forever, even though Stallone has said that this is his last \\"Rocky\\" film.

B0000844M8|5.0|My kids are 4 and 2. They were given Lion King last summer and have become Lion freaks - LOVE 'EM! Then I remembered this movie from my own childhood and ordered it for them.  The story of a British game-keeper, George, and his wife, Joy, who adopt a Lioness cub, Elsa, and raise her in their African home.  It was made in the 60's before politically correctness became the modern facism it is, so there is some hunting (guns are pointed and fired but nothing more is shown), and one scary scene at the beginning when a rogue lion attacks an African woman at the riverside (the woman screams and the river reddens - we skip that scene). But the rest is a lot of wonderful scenes of a well-loved lioness overturning the housewares, riding on the hood of their jeep, sleeping on their cot, and generally dominating their lives in a most fantastic way, before they train her to live free again in the wild. Its a lovely story that could never be told quite this way again, and we love it.
B00000JCOV|2.0|This is a decent album for nu-metal but compared to stone sour it's a masterwork.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|This movie was definitely weird. It freaked me out. The first one was outstanding. I tried to watch this one multiple times and I still did not, do not and will not like it.  Nothing looked real in the movie. Everything was computerized. The only thing the movie was missing was robots. I am surprised the children weren't robots. The contrast of the movie was dark and silver. There was no brightness or color in the movie.
B00005JPGO|4.0|Director Edward Zwick in his perturbing portrayal of a 1999 civil war in Sierra Leone gives overdue exposure to both the problems of the recruitment of child soldiers and the procurement of conflict based diamonds.  Zwick might have toned down the numerous unsettling scenes of violence and still made his points very succinctly.  Filmed exclusively on the African continent, the environmental beauty pictured is marred by the ugliness of war and conflict.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio toting a well researched South African accent adroitly plays Rhodesian ex-mercenary and opportunist Danny Archer, who now makes his living smuggling diamonds.  While incarcerated he gets wind of the discovery of a rare massive pink hued diamond by African fisherman Solomon Vanty played superbly by Djimon Hounsou.  Honsou and his village had been obliterated by merciless, trigger happy rebel forces who captured him to slave at mining diamonds and his son as a recruit for their brainwashed army.  With his family scattered Hounsou allied with DiCaprio who obsessed for the pink diamond that Hounsou had hidden.<br /><br />The stunning raven haired Jennifer Connelly played Maddy Bowen, an American journalist stationed in Sierra Leone attempting to write a story about the diamond cartel approved policy of purchasing blood diamonds.  Connelly who was to become DiCaprio's love interest played his voice of reason as she implored him to divulge the sensitive details of the illegal diamond trade.<br /><br />DiCaprio and Hounsou go on a quest to both secure the hidden diamond and reunite Hounsou's family making their way through the dangerous mayhem of the civil war.  Although both are native Africans of vastly different backgrounds they manage to finally agree on an ethical course of action.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I've had mine for a week and I am pleased with the purchase.  It seems to work very well.  The main advantages are its small size, it doesn't drain the camera batteries, and it can be bounced vertically which reduces the harshness of the flash in some situations.  <br /> <br />It seems to recycle even faster than advertised with NiMh batteries. <br /> <br />Metering w. my recently purchased D80 is always perfect.  <br /> <br />
B000IHY9SE|5.0|I got the Re-Up for Christmas (early). I am listening to it now. My personal favorate is No Apologies. Very good song. Overall the songs on which Eminem are on are the best makes since because he is the best of the ones on the album. That being said everyone else did a great job as well. My 2nd fav song would be Jimmy Crack Corn. Its good aswell. If your a big Eminem fan like I am then this album is a great buy. I am very happy with it. I added 3 pics up top so you can see more of the actual cd. Merry Christmas everyone!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I loved the fact that I had to watch this film twice...and really three times...to fully understand it.  If you don't mind thinking while watching a movie - this is a great one for you!  David Lynch's films create such an intense atmosphere, and this is my favorite of his films...so far.
B000J10ERO|2.0|Yes, the effects are very good.  But excellent eye candy does not a good movie make.  There appear to have been good intentions, but they remained only intentions.<br /><br />This review contains only mild spoilers.  If you don't want spoilers, probably you should not worry, as much of the plot is completely predictable.  Superman Returns starts promisingly but soon degenerates into lost opportunities.<br /><br />Superman has been gone for five years because he thought Krypton might have survived.  It did not.  Why it took him five years to return to earth is never explained.  When he returns, he finds Lois has a young child and is living with someone else.  Supes never said goodbye to her--again, why is never explained.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is up to the same loony and silly tricks that were evidence in the original Chris Reeve film with Gene Hackman.  If Lex had been played for laughs, it might have worked.  But his idea is played relatively seriously, and is in the end not much of a rip-off of Hackman's Lex's idea from the first Reeve film.<br /><br />There could have been a great storyline in Superman being jealous that Lois Lane is now involved with someone else.  The plot line is raised and then dropped like a hot lump of Kryptonite.<br /><br />Taken as it is, the film is a series of missed opportunities that grows weaker and weaker.  Increasingly it makes less and less sense.  Lex plans to create a new continent, conveniently taking out much of the US in the process.  Of course, he has maybe a total of five henchmen--how he plans to run things is anyone's guess.<br /><br />The film even recycles the girlfriend of Lex who has a heart of gold, the Valerie Perinne role from the first film.  There is a potential plot line with Lois' son, but it too goes nowhere.<br /><br />The fault lies not with the actors, who do their best.  It is the weak script that is the problem.<br /><br />Of course, it does not help that Brandon Routh simply recycles Christopher Reeve, in particular Reeve's 'Clark Kent' impersonation.  Something new might have been nice.  That Lois is a complete idiot who can not figure out who Supes really is...well, enough.<br /><br />You can buy it for the special effects, but you may wanna just wait for it to come on tv for free.  Sorry, I wanted to like this one.  My son bought it for me for Christmas.y recycles Christopher Reeve, in particular Reeve's 'Clark Kent' impersonation.  Something new might have been nice.

B000HEWEEY|4.0|While the look is dated it is wonderful, fun to watch, classic old-style sci-fi...could hardly ask for better.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This film is the perfect embodiment of what a movie-musical should be. The musical numbers fit perfectly into the story without slowing it down. Many musicals tend to come to a stop when some over-blown production brings the story to a screeching halt. There is no such problem here, as the songs help tell the story, and help with the moods. Being a collection of short stories involving different members of the Smith family of St Louis, the film is divided into seasonal sections:spring, summer, fall and winter. Overall, the film tells a year-long story of a family struggling with the prospect of moving from their home to New York just before the Worlds Fair of St Louis. The cast is superb, headed by Judy Garland, in a role she really didn't want. She felt she had grown beyond teen-age roles. Thankfully Vincente Minnelli showed her what could be done with the script and she changed her mind. The rest of the cast is wonderful, and Marjorie Main continued to steal every scene she appeared in. The music is enchanting, from the great songs to the lovely score which didn't over-ride any scene in the entire film. The set work is inspired, with a turn-of-century St. Louis vivdly re-created. I think what makes the film so special for so many is that here is the family we all wished we had. The feeling of sentimentality is strong without being overdone. The color should be seen to be believed, as it just glows on the screen. The film was given a clean-up and restoration, and looks wonderful. Finally, this is considered by many to be the finest American musical of Hollywood's golden era, and I'm not about to argue that fact. Get this film for your library and enjoy it as often as you can.
B000001G1E|5.0|I purchased this upon it's release some 15 years ago and it is totally undated and sounds exciting and immortal as indeed the persona JB is..Brown was larger than life, a personality that lived as he sang and felt. Not in some Disco (the disco craze must have thrown him for a loop) but in the daily blood,sweat and tears of life and survival.<br /><br />As such Brown succeeded despite the adversaries within and without.<br /><br />All the great singles, r@b classics, later moves into longer funk jams are all here with NO filler.<br /><br />The man whose pulse was fast and one beat ahead of white rock and roll,British mod invasion, and the domestic Sly Stones and Prince's that followed in his wake so totally revolutionized music that he was genius and prophet remaining one of the top 5 so influential to the world of contemporary music.<br /><br />As great as Duke and Satchmo are in their jazz genre, this box set will not be the last word on modern music but a collection that deserves a space in any serious CD collection.<br /><br />This box set was the defining word(no \\"Living In America\\" yet) capturing the icon in all his guises in great sound, lavish informative booklet and considered one of the better box sets out there.<br /><br />Nothing more to say except with his passing the world lost a legend.<br /><br />May all his newcomers cherish the emotive sensual grooves this man laid down for all time.
B00009EJC5|4.0|When the establishment bemoans the advent of gangsta rap and takes the moral (b.s.) highground in trying to say that rebellious music of their time was not so bad, this is a CD you can shove up their noses just to remind them that the joy of music and the despair of oppression has been around since J.B., since gospel, since plantation songs...but J.B. never made it all sound sooo funky.<br /><br />I am amazed at what James Brown can pull off.  This disc has some long jams, with little more than a single riff while James screams intermittently over it, and yet...that's all a great J.B. song needs.  And this is some heavy J.B., something with a little edge to it, soul comign up like steam from the sewer, a little angry, but James isn't going to let all that bring the funk down.  Just like the spliff he's putting together on the back cover, he's going to roll his own version and make it funky.<br /><br />Obviously, a classic track on this is \\"Funky Drummer,\\" a track that has been sampled from PE to LL Cool J to (no lie) Sinead O'Connor, but you'll be grooving to \\"Give It Up Or Turn It Loose\\" and \\"Hot Pants.\\"<br /><br />But don't think you'll just be getting down mindlessly.  Well, you may, but J.B. is too smart for that.  He's just got too much soul, and it stretches way back and way forward, putting himself square in the river of music man, and this album is genius for that.

B000EHRVP6|2.0|This film is gratuitous in almost every respect--at first, it's all about young American college boys traveling abroad to score at every stop their EuroPass will bring them to.  Drinking, drugs, and naked bodies galore.  One boy can only think with his lower extremities, and the other has hang-ups that would make Jimmy Stewart call him a prude.  The boys are as annoying as college boys can get, and it seems that their demise couldn't come too soon, but when it does, the gory moments don't feel satisfying.  They are quick and brutal, yet somehow left off without satisfaction, for it's too easy to want to see those boys dead, and there is no pleasure taken in learning who is going to do the dirty deeds.  There are some nice circles mapped here of man's horror to man, and how evil actions spawn evil results, even in the hearts of the victims themselves, but if this was a sex-fest and gore-fest, they played together a little too close to a Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy line, connecting them a little too directly to see much of the fun in either.

B000000HHE|5.0|De La Soul was ill prepared for the success they would achieve on 3 Feet High and Rising. They were immediately tagged hip hop hippies due to their daisy age fascination and found themselves in a public identity crisis. In 2006, groups would love to have that type of exposure no matter what people peg them as. Anyways that's the past. 3 Feet is a classic due to it's unconventional sampling, rhymes and just straight left field approach.

0618680004|3.0|\\"Some questions simply do not deserve an answer.  What is the colour of abstraction?  What is the smell of hope?\\" [p56]<br /><br />Richard Dawkins is what I'd call a rationalist bully.  His world view appears to be that anything he can't make sense of doesn't make sense and should therefore be ridiculed or defamed without compassion.  The rationalist mote in his eye prevents him seeing or even asking why someone might hold such a belief or what benefit such a belief might afford the believer.  To my view, these questions are an essential part of the empirical data that would be required to build a scientific theory of the existence of god, which the author claims to want to do.  I would argue taking belief and believers out of the investigative loop is equivalent to taking the observer out of a twin slit experiment.  Believers and belief are fundamental to the system being examined.  He also appears to ignore the enormous volume of scholarshop in this area.  As a result, it's hard to view this book as a serious book about religion or \\"god\\", nor as a book of science.<br /><br />If Richard Dawkins proves anything with this thinly veiled mudsling, it is that \\"Is there a God?\\" is a question that \\"simply doesn't deserve\\" such an unreasonable and unreasoned answer.<br /><br />But do read it, if only to see where a lack of poetry and an absence of compassion can take you in a field where such elements are so strongly indicated.  You might giggle at the factual inaccuracies (e.g. the Jung exploding book story), amuse yourself with the thinness of the arguments and scant scholarship, marvel at Dawkin's lack of understanding of comparative religious concepts such as syncretism (e.g. as demonstrated by his discussion on polytheism), question how he justifies his self-acknowledged religious hostility because it \\"is limited to words\\" [p281] while repeatedly condemning the same actions in others, be justifiably outraged at his many well-told examples of religion's excesses and failings, and find yourself concluding that hope neither ends with religion nor begins with reason, as I did.<br /><br />PS: I suggest hope smells like the wind that brings rain... and the colour of abstraction is corduroy.ilings, and find yourself concluding that hope neither ends with religion nor begins with reason, as I did.<br /><br />PS: I suggest hope smells like the wind that brings rain... and the colour of abstraction is corduroy.
B00005JPDS|4.0|It's hard not to review this movie with my heart instead of my head.  I found the film to be inspirational, and it had me glued to the screen.  I would recommend it heartily to be seen in the theater, and not to wait for the DVD.<br /><br />It is formulaic, there is little suspense, and director Gabriele Muccino makes sure that you understand not only the happy ending, but the hardship.  The chemistry between Will Smith and his son Jaden makes the film work, and both Smith and Thandie Newton give performances that remind us of just how good they both are.<br /><br />While the film does not really visit the theme of how growing up black and male in America and especially in dysfunctional circumstances, (as Gardner's book did)can cause you to lose hope -- it does show us the despair and fear, leading to anger and regret, that comes of taking risks and finding yourself waking up poor.  With the right touch, the filmmakers emphasize that Gardner's willingness to pursue, really pursue, a better life for he and his son, made a difference.<br /><br />A fine film.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|This post is more geared towards the member that complained about price. I agree with what they said, but you need to blame Blu-Ray not Fox. The technology forces them to charge more since it cost a lot more to produce. HD DVD uses technology very similar to current DVD production so that format will cost less. That is one reason why HD DVD's are outselling Blu-Ray. The 10th best selling HD DVD is selling better than the 3rd best selling Blu-Ray movie. Fox and others undoubtedly will take notice to this.
B000FILW86|5.0|Put me down as another former fan who returned to Cheap Trick.  This album is brilliant.  If you liked \\"Next Position Please\\" (as I did/still do), then you'll appreciate \\"Rockford.\\"  Most bands run out of ideas and record crap after a certain point in their career (CT had been guilty of this, too), but this CD is incredible, fresh and sounds as though Zander, Nielsen, Carlos, and Petersson actually had some GOOD songs within them... just waiting to be recorded. <br /> <br />My favorite track is \\"Come On Come On Come On\\" which is very reminiscent of something from \\"In Color\\" or \\"Heaven Tonight\\" - simply a fun, well-written and well-played song.  Rick has been a very under-rated guitarist and this song validates his skill and prowess.  The riffs are catchy and the solo obviously inspired.  This is a terrific song, and there are 11 other songs on this CD that I could listen to over and over again. <br /> <br />\\"O Claire\\" makes it apparent that Robin still has a voice.  He doesn't crack, he hits the notes and sings with passion.  I might have to agree with Rick (\\"Music for Hangovers\\") and state Robin is also my favorite singer.  At least, my favorite contemporary singer.  It's weird using \\"contemporary\\" to describe Robin when CT's self-titled debut came out in 1977.  He could be today's Velvet Fog - the vocals are THAT good. <br /> <br />Not all of CT's CD's have been worth buying (I only own 21 of them) but this one is freakin' awesome!  From \\"Welcome to the World\\" through \\"Decaf,\\" \\"Rockford\\" hits on all cylinders.  Mr. Bun E. Carlos is solid on the drums and combines with Tom Petersson to create great rhythms (e.g., \\"One More\\").  Rick, as usual, wrote terrific lyrics.  (They are especially enjoyable after a couple glasses of wine.)  And Robin delivers on the vocals.  This is a band that knows how to create great music. <br /> <br />If you like Cheap Trick, you will REALLY like \\"Rockford.\\"  If you're music palette hasn't been developed enough to understand the significance of this band, then you probably shouldn't buy this CD.  This is not teeny bopper music, it's not hip-hop crap... it's very GOOD music.  I buy a lot of CD's and this is definitely one of the *best* I purchased in 2006.

8423671267|5.0|I found this novel enthralling enough to struggle with the Spanish. The author is a prize winning 42 year-old from Barcelona. The story opens in Paris in the 1930s. M. Sauvelle suddenly dies leaving his wife Mme Sauvelle and their two children Irene, a young teen, and Dorian, a pre-teen, with a mountain of debt. A mysterious stranger, Lazarus Jann becomes their salvation when he offers Mme Sauvelle a job running his estate on the southern coast of England. Jann is allegedly a widowed toy manufacturer. His \\"toys\\" are frightening mechanical contraptions that seem to take on a life of their own and his mansion is rife with intrigue. Irene falls in love with Ismael an orphaned teenage fisherman who lives with his relatives who also work for Jann.  <br /> <br />Ruiz has spun his plot borrowing some elements from Carl Gustave Jung's shadow, which I'm pretty sure Jung borrowed from the Kabbalah, and the yetzer hara (the evil inclination), as well as Faust. This novel is geared towards a teenage audience. The illustrations are great. <br />
B00005JPAJ|5.0|One of the two subtle yet powerful films (the other being Little Children) of 2006, Babel is a cleverly scripted, wonderfully directed and beautifully acted tale of communication (more the lack of it) across different cultures. Along the lines of Crash and Little Children where the story is interlocked by characters who are related to one another in one way or the other.<br /><br />There's the American couple (Pitt and Blanchett) who meets with an unfortunate shooting incident vacationing in Morroco due to two boys' mischief with a rifle that's from a Japanese hunter. At the same time, their nanny brings their children out of the American border to Mexico without permission. and meets with tragedy. Meanwhile the ex-Japanese hunter has a broken relationship with his deaf daughter whose emotional turmoils are furthered by her mum's suicide.<br /><br />Where the actors all have limited screen time alloted to them, each gave solid performances especially Rinko Kikuchi whose vulnerability leads to vicarious sexual abandonment. Brad Pitt reaches a level of sensibility  previously unseen of while Adriana Barraza plays the delirious nanny whose one moment of folly throws her life out of order.<br /><br />Through all these little stories lie the message of the power of communication - the lack of it in all the situations, creating misunderstandings, culminating in unnecessary tragedies. (A+)<br /><br />7x Golden Globe nominees, Oscar hopeful.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|I'll admit that probably for the first couple of months that I owned Meds, I felt almost betrayed by Brian, Stefan and Steve.  There was an element that I felt was just missing from the work, that many other Placebo fans seem to have noted as well.<br /><br />Then, thought a mix of seeing them perform the material live, and just time to sink it in, I realized that Placebo was growing up, and the sound was just doing the same with them.  For me, learning to understand this record came when I realized that the \\"Nancy Boy\\" was dead and that were dealing with people either on the verge of or who were becoming adults.  It was then that I was able to recongize the evolution that they had really made in things like songwriting and style.  Not to say they had become a sell out band of old geezers, you can still hear the musings of the confused soul still trying to make sense of the world around him, except now the coke habits been droped.  Certain tracks make this a must get for the Placebo fan regardless of their opinion of the rest of the disc, on tracks like Meds and Broken Promise Brian Molko sings with as much desperation as ever. And from songs of pure sadness to pop rock masterpieces they touch all bases on this album, keeping a strong sense of mood,idenity, and a slight trace of clastrophobia thoughout.<br /><br /> As it is wondered in the amazon review, its always a suprise that Placebo hasn't stormed the US music scene on a much larger level. Here they still retain an strong cult following, so if you're unfamilar with them, this is your invitation to join the cult.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|People are saying these are fine performances. They are probably right, but I'd never know. You can't really hear them, for all the noise and singing along from the crowd.  <br /> <br />Personally, when I go to a concert, I do not pay to hear other people shouting and singing. The same goes for buying a concert CD. I am expecting to hear the band's performance, not the audience's. Oh, the occasional sing-along is expected, and does not detract from the overall experience. But Rush in Rio is ridiculous. Whoever approved this mix is either stupid, deaf, or malicious. For Rush to release this shows either utter greed or disrespect for their fans. Geddy, Neil, Alex, shame on you.  <br /> <br />The drums are there in the mix somewhere, an indistinct thudding and crashing at the back of the stage, the bass is thundering but has no articulation, the guitar simply a roar of indistinct notes behind the constant yelling of the most distrespectful concert audience since the Beatles played Shea Stadium. You can kind of hear Geddy trying to eke out the melody behind the other mass of musical waveforms. Sometimes he bleeds through a bit, sometimes not.  <br /> <br />From what I could occasionally hear of the band on Rush in Rio, their instrumental and vocal artistry is as good as ever. I truly would have liked to hear this concert, to hear all of what they were singing and playing. But I can't. And that is so frustrating, I must strike out in anger with this negative review. In terms of sound, you could probably easily find better bootleg recordings of other Rush concerts on the internet. <br /> <br />Write your congressman. There oughta be a LAW! Doesn't the Federal Trade Commission control shoddy and defective merchandise? This album is exhibit one.
0385510438|2.0|Alright, let me set a few things straight from the get-go: I am neither a Grisham basher, nor do I like to go out, buy, and read his books just to make awful commentaries about them and post them on Amazon.com (in fact, I go to the library).  But, I have read over half-dozen Grisham novels, and something must be said about this stinker. <br /> <br />To start with, (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) the title of the novel should have been potentionally something like this: \\"The Last Juror, with 2/3 of the Novel a Waste.\\"  Or, I like this one more: \\"The Last Juror: Find out what it all meant by reading the last 20 pages.\\" <br /> <br />The plot, while seemingly okay, concerns a jury who hears a  case of a rich boy who raped a single mother--along with other horrible things that added to his guilt, and of course, the decision of the jury (and the reader).  After sentencing him to life, the rapist gets pretty mad, and threatens to kill (or wait, to 'take revenge') on all the members of the jury who put him in his place--and he does, albeit much, much later.  Pretty unique plot line, no?  Certainly it's Grisham's best yet?  NO.  It seems a bit strained, boring, and, uh oh, like I've heard it before?  Like in a distant movie?  In any case, I don't remember, and the idea of a prisoner getting out of jail and taking revenge on the jury who put him behind bars was something I couldn't resist--so I picked it up. <br /> <br />Now, bear in mind that all of this plot is displayed quite outrightly on the hardcover's inside jacket description.  So, it's pretty much old news; that is, the whole novel has just been blown by the little vindette on the cover.  Oops. <br /> <br />The first 50 pages concerns the main character, some Billy of sorts (his real name isn't important, and his development in the story is pretty lackluster, like most of the characters in the novel, except for Lucien, the crazy lawyer who represents the rapist), and his presence observing a trial of the rapist.  Billy works forthe county paper, and of course he has to be at the only Ford County's brutal murder/rape trial.  So he is, and for nearly 55 pages we are DRAGGED through the details of the murder, and the deliberations of the jury.  Since we already knew they would find him guilty, we are not surprised that Grisham wastes another 30 pages dragging that matter out. <br /> <br />And then the threat from the rapist, and following his sentencing to life in prison (which somehow, according to Mississippi Law, really only means roughly 10 years, give or take).  <br /> <br />At that point, one would think Grisham would delve right into the retribution of the rapist after he gets out of parole a few years later.  But no, this is not the case.  Grisham wastes about 150-200 pages talking about complete and utter nothiness--it's all filler.  Nothing important.  Just skip until about page 300 in the hardcover, and you will find out that the rapist starts mudering his jurors.  And Grisham doesn't even do that well. <br /> <br />He totally screwed this one up.  He wasted 2/3 a novel with pointless things, the characters lacked development, the suspense was null, and a family having 7 PhD children, while the parents are dumb as dirt, just defies genetics. <br /> <br />Grisham: I still like you, but you really struck out with this one. <br /> <br />Audience: Do not read this unless you are in masochism.  But if you are, then read it, or watch the View. <br /> <br />This is nothing like the fantastic The Runaway Jury, so don't be dupped like I was in thinking The Last Juror would be like that!
B000001G1E|5.0|With the passing of the \\"Godfather of Soul,\\" James Brown the \\"Hardest Working Man in Show Business\\" leaves a tremdous legacy of music in this four CD disc. I've owned this box set since the 90's and have yet to listen to all the music on these discs. There is so much music here that it takes awhile to go through; in my case years. Disc 1 is my favorite and has the songs that I love most including the gems of old school R&B \\"Please, Please, Please,\\"(can't you see him being brought back on stage with his cape over his shoulders?), the slow dance jam \\"Bewildered,\\" the raucous \\"I'll Go Crazy,\\" the prophetic and posturing \\"Think,\\" the orchestral \\"Prisoner of Love,\\" the catchy civil rights era  anthem with cranking sax \\"Night Train,\\" the beautiful \\"It's a Man's World\\"(don't get upset womens libbers the lyrics conclude \\"it would be nothing without a woman or a girl\\") and of course the song he may be most remembered for \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag.\\" Truth is there is a whole lotta soul here to rediscover. Some of the preachy stuff he did is not my favorite but others may find it inspirational.If you like old school funk than this is for you. Most of the songs on the other discs (2,3,4)represent work from his most funky period.The discs are organized loosly around a time period and theme, for example disc one is entitled \\" Mr. Dynamite\\" , disc two is \\"The Hardest Working Man in Show Business\\", disc three is \\"Soul Brother Number 1\\" and disc four is \\"The Godfather of Soul\\". The featured muscians are to numerous to credit here but if you like the funky sax of  Maceo Parker he is all over this box set as his his long-time backup vocalist Vicki Anderson. There are several  purely instrumental tracks and enough grunts and groans and screams to make you \\"get on up.\\" The booklet is amazing too with photographs of different time periods like a young admiring Mick Jagger and JB in 1964 on The T.AM.I. Show ,old album covers and a complete discography, VP Hubert Humphrey discussing with JB \\"Don't Be a Dropout,\\"  old posters and classic old black and white concert scenes. James Brown set a standard that continues to this day in contemporary music influening many styles and countless musicians. Get on with your bad self and rediscover James Brown, his music will live on.JB \\"Don't Be a Dropout,\\"  old posters and classic old black and white concert scenes.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|This was one of the DVDs that I really wanted to be released since I had never seen the VHS version.  I've heard that the VHS version is better and while that may be possible, this is an excellent DVD considering it is in full screen and also it was shot in 1994.  Pink Floyd's performance is flawless and they are geniuses when it comes to matching the audio and the visual elements together.  While I would have enjoyed more closeups of Gilmour playing guitar (especially at the end of \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" during certain parts of \\"Shine On,\\" and during most of \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Keep Talking\\")you still get plenty of shots of one of the best guitarists in the world playing his instrument.  There are plenty shots of Wright on keyboards and Mason on drums.  The music itself is flawless.  The only real let downs for me are \\"Take It Back (I just don't like that song)\\" and \\"High Hopes (performed well but not at all enough shots of the band playing).\\"  Highlights include \\"Shine On,\\"  <br />\\"Time,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Run Like Hell,\\" \\"Money,\\" \\"Another Brick In the Wall Part 2,\\" \\"Coming Back To Life,\\" \\"Sorrow,\\" \\"One Of These Days,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" \\"Us and Them,\\" and \\"Any Color You Like.\\"  The special features include 4 bootleg performances including excellent renditions of \\"On The Turning Away,\\" \\"Poles Apart,\\" and \\"What Do You Want From Me.\\"  The bootleg performance of \\"Marooned\\" does not contain any shots of the band playing.  There is also a special feature of Billy Corgan inducting Pink Floyd into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and then performing \\"Wish You Were Here\\" with Gilmour and Wright.  Those are the best special features included in the package.  There needs to be some Pink Floyd concert DVDs released from their 70s period with the classic lineup of Gilmour, Wright, Mason, and Waters.  I know that there is footage from that period because there are little bits included on the Classic Albums: Dark Side of the Moon.  Who knows if any of these shows will ever be released though since there is so much anger between Gilmour and Waters now.  It's a shame because while I like Gilmour better than Waters, the two of them produced better music together.  But getting back to the Pulse DVD, this is a real treat for all Pink Floyd fans and so far the best and only true concert DVD of the band.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet little comedy starring Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets), Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense), Steve Carell (40-year Old Virgin), Alan Arkin (Glengarry Glen Ross), and young actors Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin (Signs).    The movie revolves around a typical American dysfunctional family: Richard, the dad, who is a terrible motivational speaker, always lectures his family members on the 9 steps to success, even though he's a failure himself; Sheryl, the mom, is completely passive; Dwayne, the son, hates his family and chooses not to speak to them at all; Uncle Frank tried to committ suicide over a male graduate student of his; Grandpa is a heroine snorter; and Olive, the chubby daughter and only hope for some ordinary life in the house, wants to become California's Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.     After being informed that Olive has been picked as a contestant, the family hit the road to the beauty contest in a van that needs to be pushed to get going, and doesn't stop honking. In the midst of all this mess, the family has a chance to redeem itself and start acting...well, normal!    I enjoyed Little Miss Sunshine. It's a comedy that doesn't present itself as satirical or a farce. It works well with the excellent cast (I expect some Oscar nods, especially for Collette, Arkin, and young Breslin), funny dialogue, and road setting.     Recommended    B+
B000I2J79K|1.0|The first HD disk that I can't watch. I can't even get to the Image Entertainment website, today, to see what's wrong with it. This is the first product I have ever had to send back to Amazon ... a real Xmas bummer. :(
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist was so simple yet so profound.  I read it entirely by chance, as a friend of mine lent me a copy, and I've never read any book so quickly.  I was deeply inspired by Coelho's writing, and eventually followed my dream  What I love about it, is that anyone can pick it up and get something out of it!
0385512104|4.0|Having suffered what people often call \\"excessive honesty,\\" I found myself able to relate to what this autistic 15-year went through every day. As informative about autism as it was (or wasn't, depending on which reviewers you're partial to) what I liked most was the idea of a person who shoves aside societal mores and social niceties to say exactly what they think. Confronted with sarcasm or idle chatter, Christopher simply doesn't respond \\"because these are not questions.\\" He laments to his school counselor that he's not allowed to call fat people fat, stupid people stupid or old people old.  <br /> <br />The story itself is a compelling page-turner murder mystery that unfolds in an original manner, and manages to turn every day activities into monumental adventures. <br /> <br />For all the difficulties an autistic person faces, reading the book gives you a sense of some of the advantages they have and in my case made me more sensitive to the things in my environment. While on a bus I now find myself counting the number of people who get on and off and trying to remember what they're wearing or looking for the brand of every elevator I get into.  <br /> <br />It's a quick read and an entertaining one. I also found it has the added advantage of being a good book for people learning English since it's written in very simple language.
055358202X|2.0|After going through the first 3 books I was waiting anxously to the arrival of the fourth one.  <br /> <br />I read the review stating it is too slow paced with many words spent on food and clothes descriptions, but still I went ahead and bought it only to find it is too slow paced with many words spent on food and clothes descriptions. This books really feels like an effort to create another 1000 page volume with no real content. <br /> <br />I will certainly trust the reviews before buying the next one.
B00005JPCD|2.0|Obviously, this movie is rated \\"PG\\" for a reason.  They state \\"some mild peril and rude humor\\" as the reasons.   <br /> <br />From the get-go, it is inappropriate.  One of the first lines: A penguin, singing, \\"You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on.\\" <br /> <br />The movie is laced with other songs that I do not want my child to hear (such as, \\"Let's Talk About Sex\\"). Not to mention the fact that there are questionable ideas about religion and authority figures. <br /> <br />I don't mind political movies, but it was not even hinted at what-so-ever in the previews what this movie is *really about.* <br /> <br />Hollywood markets these movies towards children when they are not appropriate for them. <br /> <br /> <br />Aside from that, it wasn't even a good movie for adults.  Animation was great, but the movie was not put together well. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  If you don't want to cover ears or explain things about sex or politics, don't take the kids (or buy this!).
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Great to hear others perspective on this arousing piece of film. As I watched, I wanted the relations to be triumphant. There is plenty of melodrama and passion, but little commitment much less love.  Alice (Natalie Portman) is sexually stunning. She plays the seductress: able to capture  a man's heart with just a single look.  Interesting that despite her lack of worldly sophistication, education and financial status, Alice is the  strongest character who will not compromise on love. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Larry (Clive Owen).  Larry is manipulative and easily the most detested character. It seems that he is the only character that ends up winning. Larry's relationship is far from perfect, but he does mention that \\"love is a compromise.\\" If you are looking for a \\"feel good\\" romance tale forget \\"Closer.\\" The world is full of imperfect characters, and so is this clever film.
B000JJ4GW0|2.0|It seems U2 simply cannot put out a worthwhile compilation.  Perhaps that is why they have released so many of them over the last 5 years- they are determined to get it right eventually.  They come no closer with this collection than they have with all previous attempts.  From the shoddily assembled mishmash of live out-takes, predictable covers, A sides and B sides in \\"Rattle and Hum\\" to their previous two greatest hits collections, to the incomplete \\"Complete U2\\" collection from iTunes.  I can only hope that I am not the intended audience for these releases, and that somebody out there understands them.  To me, albums like this one only cheapen the musical legacy of this band.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|The Muppet Christmas Carol may well be the greatest film ever made. It's certainly far and away the best screen adaptation of Dickens perennial even if Michael Caine's Scrooge is more game than great (George C. Scott is probably the definitive version of Dickens Scrooge while Alastair Sim is the the most beloved, but that's another story in a much lesser movie). Aside from the real visual imagination on display, from the wonderfully stylised production design and warm photography to Jerry Juhl's genuinely witty script, it's also the only version I've seen that passes the Tiny Tim test: usually the part is played by such obnoxiously saccharine little tykes that you can't wait for that empty place by the fireside, but in this case you really do care for once. Pure greatness in every frame.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the care shown with the feature has not been mirrored with the DVD, which has never had a satisfactory release anywhere to date. The widescreen version is still missing a key musical number, 'When Love is Gone' (which features only on the fullframe version), which is particularly unfortunate since its absence leaves a gaping hole in the Christmas Past section of the movie. Also, the 22-minute making of documentary from the previous release has also been dropped. Disney may have made amends on their Blu-ray edition, but once again they've cut the song Where Love Is Gone and are only releasing the shorter US theatrical release, so it's probably worth sticking with the DVD version with both cuts of the film.
B000FA57N0|5.0|This is a great movie, though you will only fully understand it if you've watche the television series.  The television series is great, but seems to push too many boundaries of good taste and morals (not for kids)and it's understandable why the series was canceled. <br />Even with the problems the series had, it was quite enjoyable and kept you entertained from start to finish.  The movie is a great wrap-up and explains a lot that you missed from the television show.  The movie also relies on the fact that you should already know a lot of the history and understand the characters from the television series.  The two really do go hand in hand. <br />Bottom line:  Watch the television series and then wrap up with the movie.  Very entertaining. <br /> <br />*The HD-DVD version of this is very nice and clear.  I'm very pleased with the quality of of the video.
B00005Y41Y|3.0|Flash Gordon has aged surprisingly well, possibly because it seemed so disappointing when it came out. Boasting production design that makes it look like an over-decorated Christmas tree and with Brian Blessed dressed up as a Turkey (well, a Hawkman) to complete the Yuletide effect, not to mention dialog that's as camp as Christmas and an obviously dubbed Muscle Beach hero who looks more likely to appeal to confirmed bachelors than the ladies, it's an ideal Christmas panto of a movie. At the time the silliness seemed clichéd and wearing since so few sci-fi fantasies took themselves seriously, but with the scales weighted in the opposite direction these days with increasingly humourless sci-fi dominating, it's developed a charm. Lord knows what it would have been like had Nic Roeg not been fired, and aside from the appearance of playwright John Osborne as a tree priest there's little to link this to Mike Hodges' career high watermark Get Carter - it was only a short step from this to Hodges completing his fall from grace with Morons From Outer Space and those terminally dreary Clive Owen movies - but as utterly disposable over the top entertainment it passes muster.     With the US DVD release so disappointing, Momentum's Region 2 UK silver anniversary collector's edition is the best version available, boasting a fine 2.35:1 transfer and including commentaries by Hodges and Brian Blessed, an on-camera interview with Hodges, stills gallery, the excellent theatrical trailer and the first chapter of the last Flash Gordon serial, Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe.    Unfortunately the Region 1 release does compare unfavorably to the French and UK special editions, dropping the two commentaries by Hodges and Brian Blessed, on-camera interview with Hodges and the first chapter of the last Flash Gordon serial, Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (though the copy used for the UK release was poor), opting instead for a couple of interviews with screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr. and illustrator Alex Ross and the excellent original theatrical trailer.
B000I2JKEC|3.0|Superman is great in this version (they tried to get him to act just like Christopher Reeves, and did a good job), but Ms. Lane is horrible.  She is very beautiful, but lacks the personality of the Lane from the originals. <br />Everything about the story is solid and fun, except for the little love triangle between Superman, Lane, and her live-in boyfriend(?!)  Her son was obvious from the start, but it was fun. <br />Besides the lack of personality in Ms. Lane, and the lame love-triangle, the show was very good.  I recommend at least watching it to see Superman back in action.
0140187650|5.0|Originally appearing as a series of articles in The New Yorker, Arendt's account of Eichmann's trial is one of the landmark works of journalism from one of the century's finest historians and philosophers.  She writes like the native German-speaker she is (long sentences, many clauses), but her dense style suits the complexity of her subject.  Sharply critical of the Israeli government's approach to the trial, Arendt guides the reader through each step of the case while we watch her understanding of Eichmann's actions and motives grow.  Her brief history of deportations from Europe is as deeply moving as her philosophical justification for the ultimate verdict is incisive.  Surprisingly funny at times, always keenly observed, and a thrilling narrative, Eichmann in Jerusalem is one of my favorite books and one of the finest books about the Holocaust and what it reveals about human behavior.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|For fans of Blackmore/Dio, this live DVD is the Holy Grail - the only complete concert filmed while Ronnie James Dio was in the band is this show, shot in Munich on 20 October 1977 for the German television show 'Rockpalast'. Bootlegs of the concert have circulated for many years (I had an extremely poor quality VHS copy of it myself) and, unless you had access to German satellite TV and were lucky enough to catch it when it was repeated, that was the only way to see it. Until now that is, with the complete show being issued on this DVD, at long last. <br /> <br />I've seen some disparaging comments elsewhere regarding the quality of the footage used; frankly that astounds me, given that the show is almost 30 years old. The technology then is understandably much more primitive than that available today, and you do see some 'microphony' effects in the picture (lines across the image when the sound gets loud). That is something that affected almost every live video however, until the advent of modern digital technology, so basically do not expect the picture to be as sharp as, say, the Dio 'Holy Diver Live' DVD. It is still perfectly acceptable, and even if you have this concert as a good quality VHS taped from television (I have), I would still say this DVD is a cleaner picture. <br /> <br />The show itself demonstrates Blackmore's band (this is the line-up which went on to record the album 'Long Live Rock 'n' Roll' with Bob Daisley on bass, David Stone on keyboards and the late Cozy Powell on drums) in full flow, with both the Man In Black and the Man on the Silver Mountain both at the height of their powers. Many songs took on extended forms, with plenty of room for Ritchie and co. to improvise freely. If nothing else, it proves the Punk ethos was not as all-pervasive in 1977 as the NME would have you believe! <br /> <br />You even get to see the much-vaunted 'electric rainbow' which dominated the stage set; lighting up in stages during 'Catch the Rainbow', this must have been extremely impressive for those in the audience. For good measure, the show concludes with a guitar smash-up; having seen Blackmore do that in 'California Jam' and on the later Rainbow video 'Live Between The Eyes, one might be forgiven for thinking he did that at every gig, not so - he only did it on rare occasions. <br /> <br />The bonus features include promo videos for 'Long Live Rock 'n' roll', 'Gates of Babylon' and 'LA Connection'. Ritchie Blackmore was known for his hatred of making videos, so these are crude at best (you see stray cameramen and sound mikes appear), but are of interest due to the re-recorded Dio vocals. In addition, Bob Daisley (bassist for Rainbow in 1977/78) and tour manager Colin Hart give exclusive interviews, plus there is a photo gallery and slide show included. Also provided is a faithful reproduction of the 1977 tour programme (although reduced in size to fit the DVD case), even including the adverts of the time. <br /> <br />All in all then, an essential item for Blackmore or Dio fans, and those recently discovering either guitarist or singer should investigate this also. At the price offered, it is a steal. Buy it today!
0743270754|2.0|Lincoln is, as always, fascinating.  Seward, Chase, and particularly Stanton are figures well worth the study.  Unfortunately, the book reads like a summary of what a bunch of other people said about these men.  Kearns Goodwin has nothing new to say whatsoever, as far as I could make out.  Not a waste of the reader's time, especially if you just want an introduction to Lincoln and his contemporaries.  But to those looking for a good Lincoln bio, check out David Herbert Donald's Lincoln.  Much ado about nothing.  One of the most overrated books of the year.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|I like this cd, normally I listen to extreme metal, but this is really good. The songs are pretty heavy and melodic, I heard Pain on the radio and it was really cool. Good songs and music style
B00081MUY0|5.0|I note that this has been remastered and has additional songs, but the original vinyl of Donovan's 'Sunshine Superman' is one of the most enjoyable listening experiences in my collection.  Donovan was an original, and yet you hear elements of the Beatles and Harry Nilsson in his music as well.  It would be classified as psychedilic folk/rock.  Yes, the songs play like one long drug trip, but the imagery is extraordinary and allows the listener to legally and vicariously see what some of these sixties musicians saw when they were stoned out of their minds.  I really enjoy the Tolkein-esque imagery of the songs and the whimsical, child-like nature of the lyrics.  The instrumentation includes all kinds of instruments one found in the late sixties on experimental rock albums, such as sitars and oboes and strings.  The resulting sound is lush and accomplished.  This is a great album, and though I don't know how the CD versions stack up, the vinyl is awesome and clear.
0307237699|1.0|What an empty book.  I read it to see what the excitement was about.  Obama is almost juvenile in his analysis of the situation - really a bad advert for affirmative action. Let's face it he would have not attended the well known schools he did, if it was not for his color. <br /> <br />His chapter on air travel takes the biscuit. No critique of freebies for political figures; no discussion of the morality of accepting favors. My 16 year ciould do better. <br /> <br />And with such an overblown title. The book and Obama's popularity is more a reflection of liberal America's desire to see a leftish black leader (after all Condoleeza is both black and a woman - but right wing) than respect for anyone with well thought out substance - the PC loathing of white men rather than meritocracy (As an aside to these libs you should protest by giving up anything invented by white men - including the Internet.) <br /> <br />Nice try liberals, but Obama will not be president in your lifetime - a flatulent book - lots of wind so everyone notices - but lacking substance. <br />It will quickly dissipate. So with Obama - a Roman Candle of a man.
0375505091|2.0|First let me say that I have been a fan of Leibovitz since the seventies. I still have my old copies of Rolling Stone.  She's everything people say about her and more. But, wow, I asked for this book for Christmas and while it has many of her great shots famous and not, you really have to be a fan of Sontag as well or you will quickly flip through the many many (probably over a hundred) pictures of her, some good and some anyone could have taken. Some are only considered \\"great\\" because they were taken of one famous woman by another famous woman. I also noticed that criticizing Annie Leibowitz is about as popular as criticizing George Bush right after 911. The people who gave it one or two stars actually got flamed for it.  It's interesting.  She's not a God, she put out a very personal book and frankly some of it is kind of \\"so what?\\"  Ms. Leibovitz needed to weigh how interesting it might be to look at so many pictures of Susan Sontag; Susan Sontag walking, Susan Sontag sitting in a chair, Susan Sontag getting a medical exam, Susan Sontag considering the world around her, to people who did not know or love her.  Most of the Sontag pictures are just not that compelling to look at.  If there were five or ten, that would be one thing.  But she has really bogged down this book with Sontag. I think she might have overestimated how captivating these pictures might be to someone who is not in love with Susan Sontag. There are certainly not compelling images in and of themselves. They should be.  A photograph should stand on  it's own two feet regardless of the photographer or the subject. We tend to give importance to an image because it was taken by someone who is a giant in their field.  She's an extremely gifted photographer.  She's an icon herself, but please be a fan of Susan Sontag before you buy this. This is really at it's heart, a love letter to her lover who died. She said the book started out as a book for a memorial service for Sontag. That's obvious by the time you get through the whole book.  She added many of her famous shots to try to liven things up a bit, but it wasn't effective enough. She was too close to the subject matter to be objective and she's not being critical enough of her own work. What this book needed was an honest editor.
B0000027F8|5.0|After years of owning this album and never taking the time to really listen to it (due in no doubt to the stupid media problems and George's absense from the vids and the vids absense from Mtv) I rebought this on cd and after a listen straight through I came to several conclusions. A. YES, this cd needs desperately to be remastered as it sounds so sonically dead and harmonically hollow. B. This has without a doubt got to be one of the most underrated albums of the past 20 years. and C. George Michael is also one of our generation's most talented, honest and gifted singer/songwriter/producers in the history of modern pop music. Whereas we've all heard Freedom 90' and Praying for time (pure brilliance) it's the little gems on this disc that blow your socks off. \\"Heal the pain\\" is a gorgeous acoustic guitar driven song with a chorus that sticks in your head like peanut butter, \\"Soul Free\\" and \\"Mother's pride\\" are beautiful in execution and production. BUT the truest gem on this disc is the last track \\"Waiting (Reprise)\\". Two minutes and twenty seconds of pure, unguarded emotion. If this song doesn't give you goosebumps your emotionally dead. The vocals, lyrics and sparse arrangement make this tiny, short song HUGE and powerful. This little slice of musical heaven was just a precursor to the forthcoming honesty and emotional depths George was on his way to mining on all his subsequent material. Less is more, and in this case..... less was more than plenty. This song will go down in my books as one of the greatest, PUREST  songs ever committed to vinyl. No wonder he opens all his shows with it. When he sings \\"HERE I AM!\\" you can't help but think  \\"YES! And thank god for that!\\".
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This is an outstanding movie about working through dysfunctional relationships. It left me with a warm happy feeling. I was surprised that reviewers dwelled on the nudity and sexual activities. Maybe readers who did not know or recognize John Cameron Mitchell's name from Hedwig, were put off by the suggestion that this might be a pornographic movie. That's just not so. Sex is part of life, and definitely an important part of human relationships. Its presence was simply honest and real.     For me, the takeaway message was that we're all riding the Shortbus in one way or another, so be kind to ourselves and each other.
B000IY03CS|5.0|There isn't much to write about this comprehensive George Michael retrospective 3 disc set except that fans and even non fans alike will be happy and surprised at the wealth of talent on display throughout this collection. The 3 new songs are all beautiful and as usual show George to be a master singer/songwriter and PHENOMENAL producer. My only gripes are these 1. Where's \\"I want your sex\\"??? How can he have a 3 disc greatest hits without the song that started his solo career off with such a bang and knocked the censorship board, Mtv and every mom in the world outta their seats? 2. The remake of \\"Heal the pain\\" with Sir Paul McCartney just ruined the song. Sorry. This just doesn't cut it. The original is a masterpiece and one of my all time fave GM songs but Paul's voice just sounds old and shaky next to George's fine tuned instrument. No disrespect meant but there's no comparison.(Have you heard George sing \\"The long and winding road\\"? Again he shows Paul how to deliver a truly moving vocal on a magnificent song. Better than the original. Doubt me? Go watch it on Youtube and see and hear it for yourself.)3. Where's the George/Whitney Houston duet \\"If I told you that\\"? and 4. Where's the WHAM song BAD BOYS??? C'Mon!!! That was the 1st song I ever heard from them. Otherwise, this is 3 discs of pure heaven for George Michael fans and fans to be. Covering not only all his singles (except \\"sex\\") but some fantastic album cuts (Precious box, Round here, Please send me someone and My mother had a brother) that the casual listener would never hear. Everything's been remastered and sounds great, so do yourself a favor and get the 3 disc version. It's well worth the few extra bucks.
630289915X|5.0|This is the umpteeth review of the Christmas movie whose existence has been acknowledged through yearly TV airings and sitcom parodies.  In a world that grows increasingly hostile and bitter, it's good to know that the film's message of the values of love, friendship, and self-worth still sticks.    \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" follows the trials of George Bailey (played by a superb James Stewart).  He's got the brains, he's got the talent, and he's itching to leave his hometown and conquer the world.  But circumstance-or fate, rather-always gets in George's way.  While everyone else takes off and makes it big, George is stuck working at Bailey Buildings & Loan, defending his community against greedy miser Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore).  And to meet this end, George turns down all outside opportunities.  Though he marries longtime friend Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and starts a family, he still craves his friends' success.  Now on the verge of scandal and ruin, George's frustration takes its toll, and he considers taking his own life.  Eventually, guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) comes along and gives George a rare gift-a chance to see what the world would be like without him.    George's life of self-sacrifice seems to imply that good will toward men may not be the best philosophy, a theme that has earned the film its fair share of disdain.  The tone may remind viewers of Ursula LeGuin's \\"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,\\" or \\"Death of a Salesman.\\"  But director Frank Capra and his cast helped to raise the mood from dispair to happiness slowly but flawlessly, as George soon realizes his worth to the world and to his loved ones, as well as his love for both.  The emotion and drama caught in the movie makes it the one to watch on this and future holiday seasons.    This film is unrated.
B000007O9L|5.0|A decade ago, the Rolling Stones put out their \\"Stripped\\" CD.  It still stands on its own merits after the intervening years very nicely, thank you.<br /><br />What sets this apart from other of their live albums is some of the lesser heard music.  First and foremost, a Dylanesque version of \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\"  The Stones cover Bob Dylan's iconic tune--and do it well.  If done poorly, this would be a joke; but the Stones do it well and it becomes something of a tribute to one of the greatest songs in rock `n roll history.<br /><br />Other songs that the Rolling Stones have covered over time make this a most enchanting CD: Buddy Holly's \\"Not Fade Away,\\" Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain (and notice the banter here),\\" and Willie Dixon's \\"Little Baby.\\"<br /><br />Then, of course, is the Rolling Stones' own music: \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" \\"Shine a Light,\\" \\"I'm Free\\" (a golden oldie that wears well with time), and \\"Angie,\\" among others.  What is especially nice about this CD is that the spotlight is not so much on the iconic songs as on lesser played and known treasures (and that includes other tunes such as \\"The Spider and the Fly,\\" \\"Wild Horses [not one of my personal favorites],\\" and the wonderful \\"Sweet Virginia\\").  Instead of just playing the Top 10 hits from their library, they branch out and focus on a broader representation of their work.<br /><br />All in all, one of their best live albums. . . .
B00009UW0N|3.0|For a movie that has made literally tons of money for the filmmakers and distributors, you'd think the least they could do for their fawning public would be to include subtitles and/or closed captioning (SDH). Maybe they feel deaf and hearing-impaired people don't buy enough DVDs to make the extra expense worthwhile? Five stars for one of the scariest films ever made; three stars for insensitive, on-the-cheap filmmakers and distributors.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I was very excited with the initial reviews of the album...after hearing it though...I am wondering exactly what all the fuss is about.  Gone are the melancholic romantic songs from the past...usher in U2.  I did find the Kraftwork rip-off interesting though...catchy!  But not cutting edge, and only remotely interesting.  Sorry to all the die hards out there...bring back the old coldplay sound and feel and I'll return to the fray.
1416905014|5.0|The best pop-up book we've bought. This one will thrill any little princess. The illustrations are gorgeous. My little princess plays with this one for hours and wants it read to her over and over. I love this book.<br /><br />The book itself and the pages are quite sturdy but some of the pop-ups can be fragile or not fold correctly if the pages aren't turned just right so younger readers may need supervision or help but it is so beautiful that you'll want to read this one time and time again.
0618680004|5.0|What I liked most about this book is that it questioned belief in the supernatural with the same kind of scrutiny that any scientific theory must withstand. When one considers that belief in a supreme being affects your everyday life and views of morality, history, science, politics and even your fate in the \\"afterlife\\", you would hope that people would give substantial thought into such important matters. It's bizarre to realize that most people work up more mental strain with less vital concerns such as picking out the right color to paint their house than with their perspective on the nature of the cosmos. It was refreshing to read a critical analysis of such questions as opposed to the common impulsive acceptance of such ideas.<br /><br />I became very much engrossed with this book and subject. After many years of being a quiet non-believer I now feel more liberated than ever with my understanding in the natural order of things. This book has encouraged me to take a more vigorous interest in science and to marvel at the absolute magnificence of existence itself. I have come to feel an inspiration that such a perspective can bring and the thrill that Dawkins mentions in being alive at a time when humanity is pushing against the limits of understanding, possibly to the point where we will discover that there are no limits. Such thoughtful elucidation actually brings tears to my eyes.
B00005JPDJ|4.0|The Holiday is this season's romance comedy.  No doubt, the main premise of the film involves the ups and downs of being in relationships.  Kate Winslet (Iris Simpkins) and Cameron Diaz (Amanda Woods) star in the movie along with Jude Law (Graham) and Jack Black (Miles).  The film has two major storylines, but the majority of the film intermingles Iris and Amanda's personal predicaments, that emphasize the meaning of friendship and the pleasure of being in the presence of great company.<br /><br />The film runs a little over two hours with much detail.  The movie takes viewers on a transcontinental trip that crosses from the picturesque and almost Thomas Kinkade-like wintry English village scene where Iris resides to Amanda's posh Beverly Hills surroundings.  The women decide to exchange living quarters in order to heal from dysfunctional relationships.  But the comic relief comes from Amanda's character who never seems to escape from her job as a movie trailer producer because throughout her uncompromising situations, she worries too much and her worries play out like movie trailers.  The only odd part of the film involves the storyline, which involves Iris befriending retired screenwriter, Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach).  Nevertheless, the surprising and touching part of the film comes at the end with Jude Law's character.<br /><br />The Holiday is one of those films to sit back and relax to.  There are a lot of laughs as well as tugging at the heartstrings.  If you enjoyed Love Actually or Bridget Jones's Diary, and films that add a little seasonal atmosphere, you may like The Holiday.
B000002KDG|5.0|This album isn't merely essential Neil, it's really essential for any rock fan. All of the classic electric tracks would become concert staples and are among his most well-known songs, while the sublime acoustic numbers may not be as familiar but are equally powerful. The electric tracks are unlike anything Neil had done up to this point and simply burn! Many of the tracks here rank among his absolute best; an acoustic song that, though not as well-known, is one of his all-time best tracks is the incredible \\"Pocahontas.\\" As it's recorded live, there's no studio gloss or over production present on this album, it's pure and honest, the way Neil likes it.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|Clearly not vying for an Album of the Year Grammy nod like the retro/dance pop of her 2004 solo debut \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby,\\" Gwen Stefani's \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is a dizzying mess of hip-pop atrocities with few saving graces.<br /><br />The songs practically scream \\"record label deadline!\\" although a more logical assumption is that Stefani is coasting on her status as a cultural icon and has contracted a bout of creative hubris.<br /><br />With its anti-male lyrics and egotistical attitude, two versions of Top 10 single \\"Wind It Up\\" bookend the disc. The song is unfortunately a strong indicator of the dark places pop has begun to head, and its rampant sampling of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\" from \\"The Sound of Music\\" has undoubtedly turned the renowned songwriters over in their graves. If Stefani was their only ticket back to the charts, it is a safe assumption they would have preferred to stay home.<br /><br />Verbal cotton candy continues to spew like lava. Take, for instance, these lines from the headache-inducing \\"Breakin' Up,\\" which repeats several lines a multitude of times:<br /><br />\\"I finally get you on the phone and our connections all wrong/You are acting like I'm starvin' you out/And my battery is gettin' low/Get me charged up or you will regret it/I need to call you back so I can hear you better/'Bout to end the conversation all together yeah.\\"<br /><br />If that's not lyrical brilliance, there are also these lines from the autobiographical yet melody-deprived \\"Orange County Girl\\":<br /><br />\\"Don't know what I'm doin' back in the studio/Gettin' greedy cause he said he had another sick flow/So I had to hollaback, guess I didn't get enough/Still feel the Wonderland, Alice and the tick tock/If you gimme a clap, I'm gonna give an encore/Don't want it to end, I want to skank some more.\\"<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Yummy,\\" featuring Pharrell, leaves a sour taste due to more laughable lyrics (complete with ice cream, Bentleys, Ferraris, pajamas, babies, doughnuts and pastries), while \\"Now That You Got It\\" and \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" require something stronger than an aspirin.<br /><br />However, there is a tidy handful of tracks that do work. \\"Early Winter,\\" with its world-weary lyrics and heartrending vocals, evokes No Doubt at its prime. Furthermore, \\"Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Fluorescent\\" would have stood well amid the classy album tracks of her last record, complete with similarly hokey '80s synths. Those two are one-upped by \\"4 In the Morning\\" and \\"U Started It,\\" which are marked by such a rhythmic urgency and fine delivery that they would fare well on radio.<br /><br />While it isn't a complete waste, \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is nevertheless a disappointing release, especially from someone with a track record like Stefani's.<br /><br />The quality tracks shine, but they are outnumbered by an onslaught of drivel that cause the IQ to plummet on contact.raris, pajamas, babies, doughnuts and pastries), while \\"Now That You Got It\\" and \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" require something stronger than an aspirin. <br /> <br />However, there is a tidy handful of tracks that do work. \\"Early Winter,\\" with its world-weary lyrics and heartrending vocals, evokes No Doubt at its prime.

1568461828|4.0|There's not much to say about Dickens' classic that has not already been said. But what one can say is that the illustrations from Roberto Innocenti are wonderful, with an astonishing attention to detail and a keen sense of period (one of the illustrations, the one set at a corner of a busy and snowy market street, has almost 100 characters in it, and a richly detailed portrayal of common life).
B00000K0E5|5.0|Yes, yes, I know that Pierce Brosnan \\"stars\\" in this as James Bond ... but the movie is completely and utterly stolen by Sean Bean, who snarks, smirks, and sexes his way through every scene he's in.  Whether he's dressed for a fight in all black, or dressed to kill in a suit, the man's just pure sexy.  British financial system, who needs it?  I'd go away with him any day of the week; Bond, James ... who? <br /> <br />As an added bonus, this movie also has my favorite Bond Girl ever; Izabella Scorupco's Natalya Semyonova, who is considerably smarter (except for her taste in men) than Bond himself; she also saves Bond's life almost as much as she saves his -- though she's not a trained agent a la Wai Lin or Jinx, just a brave, smart, tough everywoman.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was listening to some music on a website, and when I heard music from Evanescence, I decided to buy Fallen, the album that includes the songs. I really like the music, because it is mostly rock, but it also includes classical instruments. The album has two songs with just piano and orchestral music, My Immortal and Hello. Amy Lee's singing were the best in those two songs. I also thought Everybody's Fool was meaningful, because I agree that people shouldn't get attention by pretending to be someone else. I liked every song, but I guess my favorite song was Going Under. If you like this album, I recommend you to buy Evanescence's recently released one, The Open Door. This album made me start listening to goth rock. Other goth rock bands that are good are Nightwish and Lacuna Coil.
0441009425|2.0|I like sci-fi books, it is one of my favorite themes but even it is sci-fi I expect a credible consistent story. I did not find this in revelation space, I used to ask myself a lot of time why the hell is this character doing here, what is its role in the story? Lets say character A - this is not a real character of the book - he is a tough guy, you'd better be careful of him, but hey, not even in a single time in all the book did this guy anything to make you thing of him as that, in fact all the contrary. How do you take that? Add also characters whose paper you can't really understand, their reason d'eitrê, there's none! they are involved in the story in a strong way but what is their reason to be so is so silly that it just spoils the whole book.  <br />Regarding the story, it would seem to me that it is the kind of story developed in a child-like way: (again this is just an invented example, so don't be afraid of spoilers) i am going to write a book, some adventurers are looking for a mysterious treasure, it was hidden and forgotten, why? because it was thought to come frome the evil, it brings destruction. how is it they are looking for it? they found a secret map abandoned in an archelogical museum. Let's add more mistery, two of the characters love each other, and another feels rejected, in the end he steals the treasure when they find it and... I am not sure I've made my thought clear, well, anyway, what I mean is that the story is quite plain and to me, a little bit pointless. <br />In short, I just did not like the book.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I thought that nothing could be better than Fallen. It turns out that Evanescence impressed me again. Both Fallen and The Open Door are good, but The Open Door is even better, in my opinion. Most of the songs are more classical and complex, but there are still some catchy songs such as Call Me When You're Sober and Sweet Sacrifice. The songs are less suicidal than Fallen, and ends with Good Enough, a happy song. Call Me When You're Sober is about Amy Lee getting over her boyfriend. Amy Lee's singing also improved on this album, and she sings more soprano. I haven't heard The Last Song I'm Wasting on You, but I bet it's also good. If you like Fallen, then buy this album too.
B00004YZFR|5.0|As recently as November 2006 Al Maysles stated that he had over 150 hours of footage that he shot for Gimme Shelter!<br /><br />WHERE IS IT????<br /><br />They could easily release the entire 1969 MSG show on DVD, or maybe do another special edition DVD of this great movie!!
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I eagerly awaited Xmas for my new Forbidden Planet DVD -  I needed to see the Deleted Scenes. I was disappointed. <br /> <br />While Morbius is giving the Grand Tour of the Krell Machine he states: <br /> <br />\\"For 2000 centuries it has waited patiently here tuning and lubricating itself, replacing worn parts. I have reason to believe that 16 years ago a minor alteration was performed throughout the entire 8000 cubic miles <br />of its own fabric.\\" <br /> <br />The Dialogue then continues awkwardly, never explaining the \\"Alteration.\\"  <br /> <br />35 years ago I watched this film on a Sunday Afternoon, on Broadcast TV. In that version Morbius went on to explain how he observed a Belt that was 50 miles long being replaced by the Krell Machine. <br /> <br />His explanation lasted less than ten seconds, but it enabled the dialogue to flow smoothly. These ten seconds are missing in this and every other copy of the film I've ever seen since that Sunday afternoon so long ago. <br /> <br />Has ANYONE else ever noticed this ? <br />
B00005LOUP|5.0|I totally enjoyed the remake of the \\"The Grinch stole Christmas\\". It was alot of fun and the special effects were remarkable. I am not a Jim Carrey fan, but this one is absolutely fantastic!! It is alot different than the orginal cartoon story, and if I might say, it is alot better. A must see for holiday fun!!!!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you're a Beatles fan, this is an amazing and unique aural experience. For 78 minutes, the music flows from one re-mix to another, constantly surprising you and creating such a joyous mood that you'll be toe-tapping all day. The sound is incredible, the mixing is inventive (wait until you hear \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" mixed with \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\"!), and it is pure pleasure from start to finish. Now I want to go to Vegas to see the Cirque du Soleil show!
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|I had very high hopes for this film. <br /> <br />For months my students had insisted that something was missing in my life: Brick. \\"The best movie I've ever seen,\\" claimed some. \\"Masterpiece\\" and similar adjectives peppered their descriptions. So, I caved--and how I wish I hadn't. <br /> <br />Were these young adults dazzled, perhaps, by dozens of uselessly self-indulgent \\"art\\" shots? Were they sucked (or suckered?) in to the whip-lash currents of overwrought (even for noir) dialogue? I hope not--I would like to give them more credit than that. <br /> <br />No, in the final analysis I can only assume it was an \\"age thing.\\" The film gives teenage life the drama they THINK it had all along--it shows them how they believe themselves to be. <br /> <br />Kids will love this film. In about five years, they will probably be ashamed to admit it--but I'm sure we've all returned to a film after many years and discovered that there was not much there after all. That's what growing up is REALLY all about. <br /> <br />If you're over the age of 18, don't waste your time. <br /> <br />Of course, I realize there are exceptions to every rule: there will be adults out there who love this film. You need not protest that your affection for the film has proven me wrong, since I do not mean to claim that NO adult ANYWHERE can love this film. <br /> <br />Rather, I merely want to warn mature viewers that the overwhelming hype for this film is, in my opinion, based in teenagers' narcissistic love for the imagined dramas of their own lives. In other words, do not see this film because it gets a high rating at Amazon. You will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br />On the other hand, if someone who knows you and your tastes recommends the film, what do I know? I am sure you can rely on their personal expertise.
B000IU3Y3W|3.0|The music is excellent as is most all his music.  But beware that the DVD is only included to provide better sound.  There are no videos, just higher res music (evidently CD's compress the music).  Anyway, I can't hear the difference between CD and DVD but that doesn't mean you can't.
0446672653|4.0|Though it is not a new release but I found it in a bookshop accidentally.  Finished the whole book in a 12 hours flight and really can't put it down.  It just reminded me something that everybody in this world will find his/her special one, it is just a matter of time.  The message in this book told me the love, confidence and patience, even in our toughest time.  I kept my book in my bookshelf and read it from time to time, and everytime, I can say, it gave me a strong reassurance to love.
B000I5Y8ZU|3.0|Yes, I am going to compare this to Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, and while I don't usually do that, I am going to.  Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge was a very, VERY good album.  The ammount of originality and energy it contained was probably equivalent to a super nova.  It had a vibe eminating from it that made you feel like dancing no matter where you were, and I just don't get the same feeling from The Black Parade.  I'm not going to say that it's a bad album, because it isn't.  It simply feels like, I assume, when you take a drug and get high and then you find this similar drug and it doesn't get you high at all. <br /> <br />I'll give it a few more listens and hope it grows on me, and if it does this review will change, but until then I highly reccomend the release before this one.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This movie was highly recommeded from a friend. It did not disappoint. Painfully funny at time. Well written and acted. The story is about a dysfunctional family with moments that are direct and painful but well rounded through the humor.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I thought it would be action filled but it was drawn out and very slow.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have made much better movies.   <br /> <br />I was disappointed, (but their baby is beautiful just wish he would have been divorced when they concieved her) <br /> <br />Okay movie, definantly a renter - wouldn't spend the money on it.
0307346609|5.0|Once I started reading this, I only put it down to eat. Well written and insightful, the global picture it paints is truly brilliant.<br /><br />Read this book.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Great Movie - I've watched it without my kids . . . we all probably have!
B000I2JKCO|5.0|I recently bought the XBox 360 HD DVD drive and have seen several movieson it.  This is the first movie to truly blow me away visually.  I have seen it in the theater, in IMAX, and on a progressive scan DVD play, but this was SO beautiful this time around!  My wife is traditionally NOT IMPRESSED by all my new gizmos, but she was equally thrilled to see this movie in this format, and the kids were mesmerized.  2 eight year olds who are struggling with Santa belief were totally in the \\"I believe\\" camp at the end of our viewing. <br />A must for your HD-DVD collection.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Renegade director Spike Lee and actor Denzel Washington (MO' BETTER BLUES, MALCOLM X, HE GOT GAME) team up for the fourth time in this absorbing and byzantine caper film. Denzel plays Police Detective Keith Frazier, toiling in the Hostage Negotiation Team, who, along with his partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), gets assigned to a daytime robbery at the Manhattan Trust Bank which had escalated into a hostage situation. But, with a cerebral criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who seems to have thought of every contingency and is always one step ahead of the law and, also, with the involvement of a mysterious female civilian negotiatior (Jodie Foster), things get very murky indeed.<br /><br />As usual with these types of films, there are layers of complexity woven into the plot. Nagging questions surface thru the course of the film which perplex the viewer. Why does the leader of the robber gang seem to be stalling? Why is the elderly chairman of the bank's Board of Director (Christopher Plummer) so invested in the goings-on? What exactly is Jodie Foster's character up to? Why do the robbers dig a hole in the storeroom? And, because this is a Spike Lee joint, there are several scene interjections of social and racial relevance. Let's face it, we're living in the post 9/11 era and Lee's sequence of the \\"Arab's\\" treatment by the police, in particular, underscores that plainly.<br /><br />The magnetic Denzel Washington is again superb (but, really, when does the guy ever suck?). He always brings to his role an aura of cool assuredness and a certain stylish bravura. His smile, as usual, when directed at potential perpetrators, contains a biting intensity. Clive Owen is equally very good as the self-contained and calculated villain of the story, somehow becoming sympathetic enough that you sort of root for him. His opening lines, as he breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the viewer, makes him an instantly intriguing figure. Jodie Foster doesn't do as well in her nebulous role of a smirky, high-powered transactionist but she does do enough, acting-wise, to rouse the audience's curiousity. I do feel, however, that Chiwetel Ejiofor's talent is wasted here as he isn't given enough script with which to get his hands dirty.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN isn't exactly set at a breaknecked pace. It's a contemplative feature film, a thinking man's thriller with very few action set pieces, though tension is maintained and remains palpable throughout. The movie's main selling point is the cast, who makes the most out of this twisty caper premise. This complement of actors has got to be Spike Lee's most star powered group yet. Now, the ending might leave a few audiences disgruntled for not having enough \\"punch\\" but it's perfectly in line with the cerebral tone of the movie.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN proves the versatility of Spike Lee as a director as, this time out, he tackles a suspense film and does a more than adequate job. Once again, Spike ventures into slice-of-life, character-driven interplays, even giving his lesser actors time to briefly shine in the spotlight. There is one sequence - wherein the sergeant first on the crime scene reveals his casual racial prejudices to Detective Frazier - that I thought particularly effective. One of my favorite moments in the film is the scene wherein the police, after having solved a puzzle postured by the heist ringleader, continue to humorously argue about the details of the puzzle. And, then there's the prim-looking white guy whose cell's ring tone is Kanye West's \\"Golddigger.\\" Anyway, if you don't mind sitting thru a film over two hours long - a film which, by the way, might require more than one viewing - and consulting your brain cells throughout its screening, then INSIDE MAN is for you. Plus, that Indian song, \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya,\\" is kinda slamming.s role of a smirky, high-powered transactionist but she does do enough, acting-wise, to rouse the audience's curiousity.

B000JK8OYU|2.0|I am not a Beatle's purist but I listened to this CD wanting to like it but found it wanting. <br /> <br />I felt that it failed as an artistic re-rendering of the Beatle's music and the effort sounded more like a very expensive form of doodling with the original tracks. <br /> <br />Very dissappointing effort from George Martin and his son.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|i liked John's other albums, but they reminded me too much of Dave Mathews and all the songs sort of sounded the same.  However, this album he breaks away from being so similar to Mathews, and each song is really unique.  Great album.  Should be in the running for album of the year in it's class.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|It is sad that such a poor transfer of the original film was done for this collection of STAR WARS LIMITED EDITION.  I like the redone version on disk 1, but was glad to see the original version released in this collection.  After trying to watch the first version on disk 2, I turned it off and banished it to my closet.  A terrible transfer, even the oldest widescreen movie I own works well with my dvd player and automatically sets up the correct widescreen ratio--not this disk, picture on my old vhs copies look better and they also have a better sound.  I guess mister Lukas did not really care about releasing the original movies on dvd--so sad . . .
B000AP04FG|4.0|Just not enough happens in the film. Much room for a sequel. Great extra features on the DVD. Angelina Jolie can be seen wearing garter belts and stockings through her slip if you have a good enough TV :) <br /> <br />Do NOT buy the fullscreen edition; it, like all fullscreen DVDs, literally suck.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|While Wolfmother may be about as far from original as a rock band could possibly be, it has enough charisma and energy to make it a very enjoyable listen. The Sabbath + Zeppelin + White Stripes = Wolfmother equation is pretty accurate, and it's refreshing to hear a mainstream rock band talking about something other than pain and misery. <br /> <br />The main problem with this album (besides biting Sabbath and Zeppelin) is that Wolfmother haven't seemed to figure out how to turn great riffs into great songs. A couple of the songs seem like they're just jamming on riffs instead of playing a finished song, or that they feel like long songs are by default epic songs, which is not the case. But this isn't really music to think real hard about or dissect, it's music to turn up and ROCK to. In that department, this album totally delivers. <br /> <br />It'll be interesting to see how the band develops, and I'm definately excited to see whatever they can bring next. But this debut will have to hold me over until then..
6305841861|2.0|I'm getting tired of buying all the \\"special edition\\" DVDs with Bruce Campbell in them... great movies but FFS I now own about 23 (not kidding) different DVD/VHS of the Evil Dead series and I'm not even close to a collection. Every halloween/xmas theres three more new \\"editions\\" or some gimmicky packaging. <br /> <br />Theres about 1% different material on this DVD than the non-special-edition one. <br /> <br />They must have taken the Gene Simmons School of Marketing course.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|I actually like this version of Superman II just as much as I liked Lester's version.  The main reason I bought this DVD was because of the preview I saw in Superman Returns DVD.  I thought that this version was going to be like most director's cut DVD (you know, the movie plus additional scenes added).  But, it's not.  It's an alternate version of Superman II.  It also adds more emotional weight and sort of brings more leverage to the Superman movies.  Let's face it, folks, Superman III and IV were enjoyable, to say the least, but were also cheesy.  Lester's version for Superman II was great.  Donner's version is absolutely great. <br />I, like many other reviewers, wish that the two could have collaborated more and release a version of the film that had the best of both Donner's footage and Lester's footage. <br /> <br />For plot purposes, Donner's version of this film is, indeed a sequel to his original Superman movie.  Note to all nay-sayers:  In the first Superman movie, it was Jor-El's teachings that accompany Kal-El as he made his voyage to Earth.  Also, it was Jor-El's spirit (so to speak) that reveal to an 18 year-old Clark Kent his true parentage, his identity, and where he's from originally.  All questions were answered by Jor-El.  Question to all the nay-sayers:  Why bicker about these scenes with Jor-El when, for continuity and psychology sake, it was Jor-El's voice/spirit that was there all the time (according to Superman's memory)?  When Superman was traveling to Earth, it was not his mother's voice.  When Clark Kent wanted find out who he really was, it was not his mother who answered those questions.  IT WAS JOR-EL.  So, cut Donner some slack.  Superman II was his baby, as well as Superman I.   <br /> <br />After viewing this version of Superman II and remembering Lester's version, I can honestly say that I cherish this version a little more.  No, it's not as flashy/high octane as Lester's version.  But, it is truly a gem and recommend everyone whowants to see a great movie to at least check this one out.  The scene where Superman regain his powers is quite emotional and is indeed one of those great pivotal moments in motion picture history.  If only this version of the film made it to theaters. <br /> <br />Another note:  If you're wanting to watch all of the Superman movies and understand the plot, here's what I recommend:  1.) SUPERMAN: The Movie, 2.)SUPERMAN II (Richard Lester's Version), 3.) SUPERMAN RETURNS, 4.) SUPERMAN III,  and 5.) SUPERMAN IV:  THE QUEST FOR PEACE.  Why mention Lester's version of Superman II on this list?  Because there is a direct link between Lester's Superman II and Bryan Singer's SUPERMAN RETURNS.  In Donner's version of Superman II, the Fortress of Solitude is destroyed by Superman and vanishes.  In Lester's version of Superman II, the Fortress of Solitude remains intact.  The only minor setback (as far as continuity) between Lester's film and Singer's film is that Singer brings Marlon Brando back (and that's a great thing). <br /> <br />Anyway, give Donner's cut a chance after viewing the original releases.  You won't be disappointed.
B000094A6A|5.0|I've seen it a hundred times and it is always funny. Every scene is great. Each one outdoing the the last. Look at the look on Mitch's face when he is standing in the KY Jelly Wrestling Ring. It is classic. Every actor and actress in this does such a great job to make the whole insane story believable. This is definitely one of the greatest works of comedy ever made. It is on par with Anchorman, Harold & Kumar, The Big Lebowski, Road Trip, Starsky & Hutch, Wedding Crashers, Saving Silverman, American Pie, Waiting and Oh Brother Where Art Thou?
B00006CXSS|3.0|I wasn't too please when I received the package with my movies in it.  When I opened the box the metal tin cover was bent .  I wasn't too concerned about that because I could really care less since I could easily bend it back.  When I opened my case though, half the CDs fell out tin because the center piece of the jewel cases were busted.  Because of this, my discs are laying in there when I would rather prefer that the discs were safe in their holders.  Like I said, the movies are great so I give it 5 stars, even though I couldn't watch disc three because it was so scratched it wouldn't read well so I gave up watching it.  The shipping sucks, no wonder it's free, so I didn't give it any stars.  So average 3 stars.
B000002KB8|5.0|When I first listened to Black Sabbath as a kid, I was afraid. I was afraid that some adult was going to figure it out. I could tell Ozzy Osbourne was singing about some pretty intense things. He was telling me about a world that I had never encountered. I thought that just by listening to this, I was going to Hell.<br /><br />How fun it all was! That first taste of rebellion and fear, the breaking free, the still vibrating inspiration all alive in this music. When I listen now, I can still revisit that feeling of fear that struck my heart in youth. Still, I would listen again and again. While I have long since abandoned other music from that era, Sabbath stayed with me. Somehow there was always a place for them waiting in the annals of rock music history. A branch of rock-n-roll became hard rock, and it is very clear now what was clear early on, that the hardrock genre would evolve a great deal as a result of the contributions that were coming from Black Sabbath. A genre of razor clear blues riffs, with grate and dirt, spit, and confusion, all taken into directions, angles, and awkward spaces that we had never gone before.<br /><br />Rhythm and bass that flows like a warm, rolling river, sometimes rapid, unpredictable, and choppy, sometimes heavy, thick, and melodic, but always moving forward, always driving the train toward some certainty that only Black Sabbath heard before us. These albums are laden with vocals that can haunt, entrance, inspire, or enrage, and all of it emanated from a young man with an old soul, a clear original, John \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne. Be afraid again, be in awe again. Black Sabbath is a journey worth taking.

0618680004|2.0|If it weren't for the insipid utilitarian way that Dawkins seems to explain everything, his arguments might have had some weight, but as it stands this text is useless as a tool against religious belief. His evolutionary \\"ethics\\" is puerile and simplististic. His 'common sensist' demeanor is obnoxious. <br /> <br />Any country that boils steak can't be all that deep. The British aren't even shallow. <br /> <br />Read Nietzsche.
B000000W5P|5.0|'Some Girls' was it, the last truly great Stones album. This would be the last time that the Stones would create a classic rock album and not be a travelling novelty act (although the best around). They would have other hits and some albums that came close to greatness ('Tattoo You') but 'Some Girls' was their last shot at the brass ring and it couldn't come at a better time in their history. The debacle in Toronto had been settled and Keith Richards was a free man, free from prison and free from the artistic stagnation that his legendary drug use had inflicted on him. His new running partner Ronnie Wood made his offical Rolling Stones debut here, though he had \\"guested\\" on 'Black and Blue\\" and his contributions came at a time when the Stones were in danger of being irrelevant in the days of punk and disco. Not only did they prove they were relevant but they beat many of these young pups at their own game and still kept their longtime fanbase. \\"Miss You\\" is the disco song, yet in is still a Rolling Stones song, guitar based but with a stomping beat (also their last #1 single). \\"Shattered\\", \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" and \\"Respectable\\" are strong powerful rock numbers with the punk urgency and have all become classics in the overflowing Stones cannon. Men in their mid-thirties and multi-millionaire rock stars can still be pissed off!!! When is a Motown cover a fantastic idea for a comeback album? When it is absolutely shredded like \\"Just My Imagination\\", a slow R&B ballad is transformed into a driving hard rock song....genius! \\"Some Girls\\" is my personal favorite, punk attitude but in a classic rock/blues format...\\"Stupid Girl\\" revisited and about ten times more controversial. Keith's confessional \\"Before They Make Me Run\\" is unquestionably his finest moment since \\"Happy\\" for a solo vocal. \\"Beast of Burden\\" should have been another number one and the only real ballad on the album, except for joke country \\"Far Away Eyes\\". \\"Lies\\" is the only misfire...way to obvious (Keith supposedly accosting Jagger with \\"What the F*** do we wanna sound like the Sex Pistols for?). 'Some Girls' has been their biggest seller  for a studio album and rightly so. With this record they recaptured their position as rock's conquering heroes by doing what they do best, being the definitive rock n' roll band.
B00005JOLI|3.0|The fact of the matter is that this movie was just too short.  The acting wasn't bad, the cinematography was wonderful, and it was overall well-done in terms of production.  The problem is that there just wasn't a lot to work with in terms of a script.  It needed another hour to make sense.  It skipped a lot which was in the book.  There was a two-minute discussion about 15 minutes in, then a main character gets introduced who was related to that discussion, but it was an \\"if you blinked you missed it moment\\".  The key battle at the end, altered for the screen, lacked a lot of the punch it had in the book.  And let's not even get into the lack of training... one minute we have a kid who has a \\"oh, man, I'm a WHAT?!?\\" moment, then five minutes later he's \\"super mage\\".  Uh huh.  It's hard to develop a cast of likable characters in 95 minutes and expect the film to be the start of a trilogy. <br /> <br />This film could have contributed more to the genre if the script had just been longer.  As it stands, it's nowhere near the quality it should have been.
B000ILYYJE|4.0|The packaging, liner notes, and remastering are all outstanding, the bonus tracks are very nice. Must echo sentiments on the video segments as there is not much new if you own the various live/performance DVDs that have come out over the years.     Edit:  Ok, I've had a week to digest the DVD mixes of the releases and they are really astounding. Even if you don't have the 5.1 surround sound, you are going to notice the improved mixes (additional vocal & instrumentation tracks have been added) and you will notice the improved range of sound, as there is a greater dynamic range on DVD.
B000002UB3|4.0|Its the Frickin' Beatles, buy this!  With this album you can pretty much consider the McCartney contributions as an early solo effort.  The sound of the album is kind of what Badfinger became.   George Harrison's finest hour as a Beatle, both with his guitar playing and shining contributions (Here Comes the Sun, Something).
