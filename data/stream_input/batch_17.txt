B00F5HWC7W|5|Maybe I'm biased because I love The Killers, but I was so glad when they released this because I love their songs, but this CD is awesome, even for the more casual Killers fan.
B00IYAG7DM|5|So far I have not had any problems with the game. Even though it says you can spend real money in it, I have seen no need to do so. The art work is awesome. If I do have problems with the &quot;blank screen&quot; that others have mentioned, I will add to this review. I am using a Kindle Fire HD to play on.
031606792X|5|Breaking Dawn was an AMAZING novel filled with suspense, intrigue, danger, jealousy, family issues, intimacy, and above all, love.  It was the perfect ending for the Twilight series.  It is an absolute must read after the first three books.  Stephenie Meyer leaves your heart completely filled with satisfaction.  After reading these novels, you'll want to pick up anything written by her!  A must read!

B000OVLBGC|5|Seldom nowadays can one find a film that is both poignant and powerful. This film is one of those rare treasures. It is simply a beautiful, haunting and moving film. The kind of cinema that leaves an imprint on the viewer. I highly recommend this gem.

B006ZAZ31U|5|One of the best books I have read and very accurate in its representation of a true American Hero.  This book captures his essence well, in addition to describing the culture of the teammates Adam called brothers.  Well written, Eric...and thank you.
B004AHNIGM|3|The songs are good choices for Gregg's voice, and his voice is better than it's been in a long time, but the early 1960's monaural production doesn't fit.  Gregg is a product of the 1970's and this album would be much better produced in simple clean 1970's style stereo. Performance = A+, Production = F  T-Bone Burnett ruined this effort.  Tom Dowd is rolling over in his grave.

B00HYTT7BI|5|Tom Hanks was robbed by not being nominated for this Oscar.  Thankfully the Academy did nominate the young Somalian who played the pirate.  If believability is the measure for Oscar-worthiness, he should be a shoe-in.  The directorial decision to film in (what seemed to be) the inside of that lifeboat, was brilliant.  The claustrophobia, sea-sickening tossing, and sheer terror experienced by everyone in the boat will keep you on the edge of your seat.  So well done.
B0093QHWLC|5|Having spent many a day in Boston in my late teens and early 20s I can say that it certainly felt like I was there again.  The casting, acting and filming in this movie are fantastic.  Clint Eastwood's Directing is superb and is credited with the music in the film.  This is Drama and intrigue at its best.
1573301051|5|When funding for school music classes were being cut all over the country people kind of brushed it off as a non-necessity.  Studies prooved that many kids prosper in other academic subjects when taking a music class.  Art should be available for all kids in school as well as sports.  This benefit concert brought awareness to that.  Mariah, Celine, Gloria & Shania all appeard to support the cause.  And of course Ms. Aretha Franklin.  The performnaces were great.  Carol King was brought out as a special guest of Celine Dion.  The best part of the show was when the diva's sang You've Got A Friend and Natural Woman.  This show sounds even better with the 5.1 sound.

B0000012VG|5|Alongside such works as Saint-Saens' \\"Danse Macabre\\", and Berlioz's \\"Symphonie Fantastique\\", Modest Mussorgsky's \\"A Night On Bald Mountain\\" is one of the best-known works to delve into the world of the macabre.  But what is not so well known is the fact that this \\"musical painting\\", as the composer called it, was worked at in four different permutations, both during the composer's life, and long after he had died.  Three of these are purely orchestral in nature: the arrangement made by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov that the vast majority of the music-listening public has most often heard; the arrangement by Leopold Stokowski for the final segment of Disney's 1940 animated classic FANTASIA (which segues into Franz Schubert's beloved \\"Ave Maria\\"); and the composer's own extremely primitive original orchestration.  It is this latter one that is the centerpiece of this 1994 Deutsche Grammophon recording by Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.<br /><br />Whereas most recordings of \\"Night\\" utilize the re-orchestration that Rimsky-Korsakov made, supposedly at the composer's suggestion (with its tranquil conclusion, after all that nightmarism), Abbado, on his second recording of the work, has chosen to stick with the composer's own version; and although exceptionally primitive, it can be argued that this work went a long way to laying the groundwork for Igor Stravinsky in the first fifteen years of the 20th century (\\"The Firebird\\", and, especially, \\"The Rite Of Spring\\" may owe quite a lot to this work).  It is an interesting concept that Abbado and the Berliners float here; and the recording is made even more interesting by the presence of four of the composer's works for chorus and orchestra: \\"The Destruction Of Sennacherib\\"; \\"Salammbo\\"; \\"Oedipus In Athens\\", and \\"Joshua.\\"  These are works that may owe a debt to the short works for chorus and orchestra that Brahms had done (e.g. \\"Alto Rhapsody\\", \\"Nanie\\", etc.), but which are nowhere near as well known, for the simple reason that they are in Russian.  Abbado concludes this recording with the composer's famous piano piece \\"Pictures At An Exhibition\\" in the orchestral transcription by Maurice Ravel that, in spite of many other competing versions (including Stokowski's), still remains the one the public wants to hear the most.<br /><br />Because Abbado and the Berliners went and did the choral version of \\"Night On Bald Mountain\\" for Sony two years later, and because this particular version of the work had been recorded by Abbado back in the early 1980s for RCA with the London Symphony Orchestra, one can legitimately wonder if Mussorgsky is to Abbado what Mahler was for, say, Leonard Bernstein: a personal obsession.  This is probably far-fetched, but it's then better to say that Abbado had a knack for delving into very little known aspects of Mussorgsky's compositional output to find things of value, things that, while they may be upwards of a century and a half old by this time, still feel new.  Such is the case on this recording, which is why close attention should be paid to it.mple reason that they are in Russian.

B00HWWUQWQ|5|Great movie at a great price!  Thanks, Amazon!
0684803356|5|For most readers the jury is back on Hemmingway; you love him or you hate him.  For fans of Hemmingway's prose this novel is a true masterpiece, but even those who aren't particularly fond of Hemmingway's sparse style will find lots to like in For Whom The Bell Tolls.  <br />Wrapped in a brisk plot of pre-combat suspense and the ensuing battle Hemmingway has hidden the definitive anti-war novel.  In the three days that we follow Robert Jordan's efforts for the Republic against the Fascists we watch him develop a love of incredible intensity with the girl Maria, then willingly throw everything away for a senseless fight between two equally irrational forces struggling for power in the eve of WWII.<br />The most powerful account of brutality and inhumanity is not attributed to the Fascists, but is Pilar's tale of the early days of the revolution and atrocities carried out by the Republicans - the side for which Jordan is risking his life.  Although moved by the tale and by Pilar's excellent account (indeed as most reviews comment this self-contained story of Pilar's is the strongest part of the novel) Jordan cannot veer from the path that has been set for him, both by his war hero grandfather and by his father; Jordan views his father as a coward because he died by suicide - a them which runs through the novel.  Even his unexpected discovery of Maria and true love cannot deflect him from his course of self-destruction.  <br />As an anti-war novel For Whom The Bell Tolls is elegant and subtle.  Hemmingway, in typical fashion, lionizes the warriors.  The American Jordan and the guerilla leader El Sordo are depicted as noble men of principle.  Even his treatment of the fascist lieutenant Berrendo is sympathetic.  Hemmingway's commentary is an attack on the senselessness of war (or this particular war, anyway) but those who fight that war are largely treated as tragic figures.  <br />The characters are among the most complete that I've encountered in a novel.  In that they're developed using Hemmingway's sparse style makes the feat all the more impressive.  The novel perhaps is a bit long, and there are in my opinion some extraneous elements that could have been omitted, but the conclusion is a masterpiece.  There are not many novels that have had as great an emotional effect on me.  A must read.

B001FBSMW6|5|I like almost every song on this cd! Most of the songs contain very good lyrics and its also very catchy. I would say this cd isn't as good as their previous work, however its still way better than majority of the other bands out there. 5/5  Key songs to check out:  Perfect Symmetry-- great track.. very good lyrics.. very catchy, may be the best song on the cd  Spiralling-- first single amazing.. different from their previous style but works very well.  Lovers Are Losing-- another great song which is different from their old stuff.. recommended  Love Is the End- BEAUTIFUL BALLAD-- amazing lyrics  Pretend That You're Alone-- Chaplin's lyrics/vocal style makes this song

Kelly is amazing at describing the characters feelings to the point where you KNEW them.<br /><br />The reason why I gave Waking Up Married  three stars because  of the cliché topic it focused on. Waking up married after a night in Vegas? We've heard this a thousand times. I just felt she used and already overdone topic and she didn't do well at making it unique.
B009LDD1X0|4|Husband luved came in good condition
B00065MDSQ|2|I had heard that \\"Red\\" was on par with \\"Permanent Waves\\" by Rush; in fact, the person who wrote that said that \\"Red\\" was the rightful precursor to \\"Permanent Waves\\" and that others should recognize it as such. Well I beg to differ! I bought \\"Red\\" with the idea that I was about to hear what Rush had, as was implied previously, \\"stolen\\" from King Crimson. When I heard the tracks, a meager 39 minutes total, I was thorougly unimpressed. Here's my assessment:  <br /> \\"Red\\" has five songs, one of which (\\"Providence\\") is nothing more than a sloppy eight-minute improvised monster of meanderings which does not even come CLOSE to resembling jazz or any other music form. There was nothing about this \\"song\\" which appealed to me, both as a prog music fan and as a bass player of 25+ years experience. Philip Glass is purported to be a fan of KC, and writes very long pieces of music...but at least HE keeps his listener interested throughout! Rush has written several mega-minute songs (\\"Hemispheres,\\" \\"The Camera Eye,\\" \\"Natural Science\\" etc) which were designed to tell a story, challenged the listener's imagination, kept the listener interested musically, and left them so satisfied that they wanted more (unfortunately for older Rush fans, this formula was abandoned by Rush after \\"Moving Pictures\\").  <br />   \\"Red,\\" the instrumental title track, was the only song which didn't make me cringe. It reminded me of some of Yes's early experimental work, notwithstanding Bill Bruford's work on the piece. The production work was very good, considering the time it was recorded (although this could have been enhanced by its re-production (I bought the 30th anniversary edition)). However, this was the only song I liked on the album.  <br />   In summary, as a long-time Rush fan, and former professional musician, I have to say that King Crimson's \\"Red\\" is NOT anywhere on par with Rush's \\"Permanent Waves\\" album no matter how you evaluate it. Rush's songs were more pleasing to the ear, easier torecall (obviously by the record sales and airplay of \\"Spirit of Radio\\"), more technically accurate and intricate, tight and \\"clean.\\" The first words that came to my mind when I heard \\"Red\\" were \\"disorganized\\" and \\"sloppy.\\" I know that I'm offending some fans here; I don't mean to do that intrinsically. My only goal is to refute the comparison between these two albums, and to put my two cents worth of opinion into the debate.  <br />   I will concede that King Crimson preceded Rush (ironically, \\"Red\\" came out the year that Rush offically joined together in 1974). However, I maintain that Getty Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart are far better musicans and songwriters. This is not my opinion exclusively: Rush's record sales are reported to be in the top 10 of ALL rock bands's of all time! To compare \\"Permanent Waves\\" to \\"Red\\" (or any other album for that matter!!!) is arbitrary at best. It's really a matter of taste and asthetic choice.
B002JM1VJG|5|Without a doubts this DVD compilation of Madonna,close and open a new chapter in Madonna's career. The key video clips from his former  record label Warner show us 3 decades from 80s to 2Ks.  You can find 47 music videos since Burning Up until Celebration, including clips from all soundtracks.  Obviously if you are a real fan from Madonna, there are missing classics and live perfomances but this title is good option to add in your collection.  Thanks

Even the Beastie Boys' \\"Awesome...\\"--which had many reaching for the Gravol--wasn't as bad as I had been told, given that it took the occasional breather and offered up a clear, well-composed static shot.  Rather than being indie, hip, or uncompromising, the visualization approach taken here seems merely lazy and thoughtless.  Still waiting for the video collection...

6304385668|5|Historical films are notoriously inaccurate. (&quot;Braveheart&quot;, for example, is a terrific movie but all over the place historically.) Drama, after all, is oftentimes inconsistent with the tides of history. Which was  why I was so impressed to read a magazine article some time ago touting the  film's attention to detail and accuracy. I made a special note of wanting  to see &quot;Michael Collins&quot;. Am I ever glad I did. This is a  wonderful, wonderful movie.<br />&quot;Michael Collins&quot; is the story of a  member of the Irish Republican Army who succeeded in leading Ireland to  independence, but at great cost. A participant in the famous &quot;Easter  Rising&quot; of 1916, Collins was arrested and became a leader in the Irish  independence movement. Collins was an extraordinary leader who devised  guerilla warfare tactics to fight the English army that would later be used  by the Viet Cong, and daringly rescued Eamon DeValeria, the man who would  become the leader of Ireland and whom many believe was responsible for  Collins death. Collins also negotiated the treaty which ended 700 years of  English rule in Ireland, and as Commander of the Irish Provisional Army was  forced to fight against guerillas opposed to the treaty (which left the  northern six counties a part of England and delayed full independence). The  irony was that Collins was forced to hunt down and kill the very men he  trained. Many in Ireland look on Collins as a hero, others as a traitor.  His death is, like the Kennedy assassination, a great controversy- nobody  has the faintest idea who killed him. As historical figures go, few are as  controversial or as romanticized as Collins. The film covers the 1916-1922  era of Collins life, from the Easter Rising until his death.<br />Writer &amp;  Director Neil Jordan clearly has passion for the project and it shows.  Collins is a real hero to Jordan and the director goes to great lengths to  be as accurate as possible and to show us Collinsin action. <br />Perhaps  Jordan's best move was in casting Liam Neeson in the part. Neeson is a very  talented actor who delivers a terrific performance in the title role.  Neeson's Collins is firey, angry, passionate, hates war, longs for peace.  It is hard to imagine anyone else in the part.<br />The rest of the cast is  good- Alan Rickman is impressive as Eamon DeValeria, a difficult role to  play given how much DeValeria and Collins are at odds with one another in  the end. Aidan Quinn, Julia Roberts, and Stephen Rea are all also good in  their supporting roles as Collins best friend, the woman the two men  compete for, and the English agent who provides Collins with critical  intelligence.<br />In terms of location and cinematography, it is hard to do  better than this. Jordan has painstakingly recreated Ireland &amp; Dublin  of 1916-1922, and it looks stunningly beautiful and stunningly realistic.  One actually feels like you are seeing the real Ireland of the early part  of the century instead of a recreation.<br />&quot;Michael Collins&quot; is a  wonderful film that history lovers and people fascinated with Ireland will  adore. Highly recommended.

B000FBJFSC|3|I'm not sure what to say about this book.  It is a book that stays with you - I read it over a month ago and still find myself thinking about it.  On one hand it is horribly depressing, the life these people had was just awful.  But I'm not sure if this is the talent of the author or just human nature, but much like the character you find yourself continuing to read, because something good has to happen eventually, right?  Doesn't it?  So like the character continues to plug on with his sorry existence, you plug on reading.

B003HC8I5M|1|collins admitted he wanted to \\"bring nothing new\\" to these classics. then why record them? unless perhaps you have a record contract to fulfill.  it's a jump the shark moment.  at least when clapton covered the robert johnson songs, he played songs that had rarely been heard -- at least not by a wide audience.  there are garage bands covering this material as well as collins does here.  i suppose artists such as collins will continue to pump out this drivel as long as us rubes continue to buy it.  i'd give it zero stars if i could.

0375842209|3|Movie was much better.
0786915749|5|If one tries hard enough, you can find similarities of LOTR in the works of Danielle Steele.<br />I got the series of books when I was a teenager and this was the first of the genre that I read. Now I'm in my thirties and still pick them up from time to time. These books are simply good fun. The action is fast and the characters are great. I still have not found better authors who keep the story moving while establishing plot and background. <BR>It starts off with a reunion of friends after a five year quest to find evidence of the old gods. This is a neat trick, because it establishes background and characterization by having characters observe each other, comparing what they were like and what they are like now while still moving the story along. They meet two unfortunates which is the catalyst of the plot. <BR>They chemistry and pace is something akin to the old Star Wars movies and X-men. Meaning that each person has a specific use that contributes to the team and are more or less stumble onto the forces working against them.<BR>But the best thing about this book. TALKING DRAGONS! For some reason I really enjoy fantasy books with these guys and the books run rampant with them. Yes, it's juvinile and I couldn't tell you the difference between high and low fantasy, but when talking dragons enter the picture, the book picks up in my mind. Sorry if I have spoiled anything, but the books ARE called Dragonlance so........<br />In summation: The books are good for all ages (parents, my brother started reading them when he was 8), the authors juggle ensemble better than a Guy Ricthie film and there are talking dragons. This book opens you to one of the most prolific literary &quot;worlds&quot; than has been the inspiration for 75 + books. Buy them and enjoy!

B0040I09RM|5|Sons Of Anarchy could almost be described as &#34;Vortex Viewing&#34;: it sucks you in to its web and won't let you go until you finish the whole thing. I watched all 7 seasons in the space of a few days, and I have to say that Sons Of Anarchy can stake its claim alongside shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men for being one of the best written and most compelling TV in recent memory. Take elements from Grand Theft Auto, Oz, and Shakespeare and you get a show that can't be missed.

0201485672|5|The concepts presented in this book are not revolutionary; they will not fill you with a sense of monomaniacal purpose.  Rather this book focuses on the real issues of developing software, and describes a very simple tool for getting work done effectively.  After fifteen years of developing code, I already did some of the things this book articulates; but now I do them consistently and without compromise, and my productivity has gone up while my defect rate has gone down.  Subtle and quiet, perhaps, but that's powerful stuff.

B00AZRBLHO|5|As an IT employee, I read this book as a free read from Amazon, not realizing that I would connect so well and in so many ways.<br /><br />From the beginning, the story serves as a nice piece between elements, but the hard decisions and emotions felt are the same that any IT employee has felt regardless of position. The desire to make life better and functions easier is at the core of the profession, but sometimes the core becomes the thing that makes everything the antithesis of what you are trying to achieve.<br /><br />Diving in with an objective, but open mind, I gained a new appreciation for all levels of IT. That is truly remarkable. I would highly recommend this book to anyone directly or indirectly involved with IT (aka everyone).

I saw this one twice, have the DVD as well.<br />My favorite character is Stitch by a long shot. He really makes the movie. And he has got the coolest little attitude! Haha, I'd like to BE Stitch! All the funny things he does make the movie very enjoyable, like hitting that dude in the face with a beach ball. Stitch does alot of things that are very mischievious, but fantastically funny. And while at first he appears to be very angry, he becomes soft and kind hearted, and learns to talk better by the end too. I dunno, I just can't say enough how much I love stitch. He is my fav Disney character, period, and always will be. <br />I've also been to Hawaii before and the way they drew the backgrounds is perfect. It's softer than the real colors of hawaii, but very close, and actually prettier if you ask me. Man I wish i could live in Stitch's world. that reminds me, I really would like to have a real stitch as a pet. He's perfect and I can't get enough of him!<br />See the movie, you'll really like it.
B001AH6ZWY|5|Great movie if you take it on concept, and the A-list cast delivers. If you're like X-file's Mulder, and you too &#34;want to believe&#34; then this is for you.
B00AQMQBKK|4|I own both the app AND the board game itself.  In a game based on dice rolling, the physical version is always going to get the advantage...but this virtual version of Elder Signs is still pretty darn fun!<br /><br />It still has the questions of &#34;which adventurer do I send where&#34; ... &#34;whose special ability is best for this room&#34; ... &#34;should I spend time sending this investigator here so that they can get an uncommon item before attempting an other-world adventure, or should I just try it now before midnight brings out more monsters&#34;<br /><br />all in all-- the game feels quick even though it takes about an hour....and that is the mark of a good game!  Try it...you'll like it!  But nothing beats chucking those dice for real!
B001EOQWEO|5|This movie is simply phenominal! I love it so much and it is a perfect gift to give. This set includes a DisneyFile digital copy to upload on either iTunes or Windows Media Player and can be played on you portable device. I recommend this movie to EVERYONE.
B00CWY76CC|4|I like this game it passes time and it testes your brain and memory. And it's really fun. You don't need the Internet to play.
B005FISBTO|4|Even a weak season of Dexter is better than most TV show seasons as they age.  The cast continues to do solid work, with some interesting guest turns by Olmos and Hanks in this one.
B00I2TV3NO|3|I am not sure why I gave it three stars, it is the same story as the first and there is really nothing in it that grabs your attention.
B001XUPF2O|4|Heath Ledger plays a great villain and the sound effects are awesome. But, it's not the batman I remember as a kid.
B0007Y4TVU|5|Amazing!!! As reinnovated as the album is, it is simply a fantastic sounding appetizer (which can hold it's own just as good) to the album's second half Hypnotize. Every track is great.By the the most important rock release of the first half of 2005. Radio/Video and Revenga rule!!!
B0087YYHZU|2|I didn't realize I couldn't play Blu-ray DVD's on my player.  Unfortunately I had already opened the package so it couldn't be returned.
B00DNV9V1W|5|Good quality good product. like it.
B008J34466|5|I did not get a chance to go to a Pink concert this year, so I thought that buying the CD would be a good second best. I like about 50% of the songs, which is a good percentage for me. I enjoy Pink's music, so I like it overall.
B0002V7O3S|5|This is an older movie that my daughter had searched for in video houses and stores locally. I suggested Amazon.com as I have purchased and received unique gifts for family (we have 9 grandchildren). Sure enough you had it online and the cost was very reasonable.    The movie was very entertaining. I'll admit I'm a ET for many shows and movies.
B006AZZPCM|5|I like this app because you get to choose what quality you watch or download your video in I don't really like that you have to hit the green download button but otherwise its a very good app
B007ZD17XO|5|Great game, fun for ALL ages, extremely addicting.  I would've paid more for it.  Love it,  love it,  LOVE IT!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love this game .it's not like any other either ,it has its mix of temple run and subway surfer . I love challenging games and this is the best one I've tried yet.if u have seen the movies it's best that you get the game now ...I JUST LOVE MINIONS!!!
B00GINENG0|5|I love this Kitty, I laugh alot when I play with Tom I was introduced to him by my grandkids and I am still playing after the left, I like when I make him fall and he gets up and he shakes his index finger and says &#34;no,no,no&#34; he is hilarious. I like this game alot...
B00DA6YEKS|4|Some parts seemed a bit drawn out but otherwise it was very well written
0071752854|5|As a huge fan of the author's work , and the articles on his website, I was excited last week to finally get my hands on his new effort: Pitch Anything. In this book Klaff's  basic thesis is that we pitch our deals and ideas from one part of our brain (what he calls \\"the supersmart neocortex\\") yet these are received in the other person's crocodile brain. Instant mis-match. And problems ensue. Klaff uses many examples (all are interesting and ones you haven't heard of before) to demonstrate how to solve this mis-match. He shows you these methods in action and in high-stakes situations, Such as when he was thrust into a deal worth $1 Billion. I won't reveal the outcome... it's worth the read if only to get the insider's POV on such a massive deal. This has always been Klaff's talent: taking real world deals, the big and high stakes deals, and bringing them into the public's view through great journalism and storytelling.     Klaff is also careful to examine the flipside of this phenomenon: the times when the neocortex and the crocodile brain miscommunicate, unchecked, leading him  to disastrous results. For instance, he presents examples where the mind works based on biases that don't necessarily enter the realm of conscious thought, and situations where he didn't win the deal, didn't pitch the great pitch and wasn't the most popular guy in the room. Few authors are willing to self deprecate in this way.     It's a great topic and Klaff sets it up with some fast paced and wish-i-had-been-there examples, but a word of caution. First, the book is very anecdotal. You should read the sample chapter in the Amazon Look Inside feature to see if this writing style is for you. Anyone who has ever had a 200-level psych class knows that Klaff is at the same time explaining these methods TO you, and using them ON you. Given this, I found that I read some chapters more than once, especially chapter 3. First time for the fun narrative. Second time to learn the method. Third time, to see how the method was being used on me - the reader. For instance, Klaff describes a subtle technique called Prizing. This, in essence, is a way to make the customer earn your attention (instead of you constantly trying to win his) or make an investor defend why he should be allowed to invest.  But re-read that chapter. Klaff is \\"Prizing\\" the whole way through. Well played sir.    One of Klaff's strengths is in recognizing interesting cognitive events that are recurring in the business world, and then bringing them into conscious awareness, describing them so we actually realize when these things are happening in our own business and personal dealings. I think he's partly achieved that in this book, but it doesn't come together until you fully get into chapter two, which describes frames, framing and frame control. This is important stuff, This is not a book of sales scripts, and this subject is not for dummies.          The writing is enjoyable - I read the most of it in a single plane flight. Some of the insights provide building blocks for understanding how certain professionals  are able to present themselves so much better than others. They are essentially doing  something that doesn't register at the conscious-level but they are using a real method none the less - called Hot Cognition in Klaff's lexicon. He's a good documenter of new curiosities of cognitive skills everyone needs in business (sort of like a Michael Porter is to Business Strategy) and the storytelling is good enough for a full morning's entertainment.
B005ZB91KY|1|I paid extra to rent the HD version, but the video quality was terrible  Is there someone out there to give me my dollar back?
B00M7UTFW0|1|Buffering was extensive. Image quality was pathetic. Was unable to view it from Amazon. Watched it on U-verse instead where I would give it 4 stars.
B00005NGZX|5|I really didn't know what to think when I first heard this album.  I'd already had \\"you fail me\\" for a couple of months, and I got to thoroughly enjoying that after a little while, so I figured I'd pick this one up as well.  The first track \\"concubine\\" starts the album off quickly, and it's unrelenting from there.  I honestly don't know what it is about converge that I like so much, but I love everything that I've heard from them.  I'll admit that you can't really decipher what jacob bannon is saying from his vocals (that's why they created lyric books though), but the music is so fast paced and frenetic that I really don't mind that much.  I'm not certain whether or not I like this better than \\"you fail me\\", but it's putting up a pretty good fight in the early going.  Stand out tracks (in my opinion) are concubine, homewrecker, jane doe, and distance and meaning.
B00F30S0Y0|1|Did you ever buy a CD because you heard one song before it was released and loved it, only to find that the rest of the album is terrible?  That's my experience with Reflektor.  The title track is definitely one of the best songs of the year, but the rest is muddled, tepid and weak.  Disc one is filled with half-hearted electronica/disco tracks that never get off the ground.  Disc two is more mellow, but murky and meandering throughout.  Reflektor has been overhyped to the extreme.  I'm glad so many people love it, but I sure don't.
0553573411|4|Robin Hobb, Royal Assassin (Bantam, 1996)<br />There should be a law against ending books like this, especially when they're the second part of a trilogy. Imagine what it must have been like for the poor souls who read this on the day of release, and then had to wait another year to find out what happened next.<br />Royal Assassin continues the story of Fitz, son of an abdicated prince, assassin for the king, user of magic both human and bestial. It also continues the building of the world of the Six Duchies, and adds a new component; while most of the diplomacy (outside the small world of Fitz, that is) in the world of the first novel in this trilogy took place with what amounts to a sledgehammer, the second novel brings in political intrigue on a much more delicate level. The king's two younger sons, Verity and Regal, sit ready to leap at one another's throats, as the four coastal duchies (who support Verity) and the two inland duchies (who support Regal) sit poised on the brink of conflict. It doesn't help matters much that the Mountain kingdom, which sits on the other side of the inland duchies, just married its daughter and queen-to-be off to Verity. Things look pretty bad for the inlanders, right? Well, if they were, we wouldn't have a novel.<br />Royal Assassin continues on at the same pace as did Assassin's Apprentice; it may be a huge-looking effort (my trade paperback version is 580 pages, and almost as thick as the trade paperback edition of that doorstop known as Harlot's Ghost), but believe me, now that you've gotten yourself into the story, the slowness with which it begins (as did Assassin's Apprentice) is easily forgivable, and you'll be sitting and reading long after you'd promised yourself you'd stop.<br />I warn you now: stop before you get to page five hundred, and wait until you've secured a copy of Assassin's Quest before reading the end of this novel. The twists and turns will leave you growling in frustration if you have to wait to dive into the last book in the trilogy. It's almost as memorable, and frustrating, an ending as we got from George R. R. Martin's A Storm of Swords (and two years later we're still waiting for the fourth book in THAT series, a form of slow torture that is crueler and more unusual than anything the U. S. Justice System has ever come up with).<br />And with that, I'll go back to chewing my fingernails and waiting for the library to get the third volume back in (since I can't find it in any of the bookstores near me). ****the last book in the trilogy.

B00000IQW5|5|Alot of good actors. A good romantic heartfelt story,and also very funny a times.Definitely a very good movie! Recommend it.
031603438X|5|A 10-year self-professed heroin junkie isn't supposed to remember much.  Yet Keith Richards has amazing recollection of the meaningful and silly events that have made up his \\"Life.\\"  Better still, he has a wonderful way of relaying the stories in a way that feels natural and conversational, almost putting the reader in the room as the event happens.      What I've come to admire about one of my guitar heroes-- is his consistancy.  He values loyalty and friendship above all else.  He's the guy you want in your bunker if heading into battle, because he will jump on the grenade to save a platoon.      The stories behind the music are riviting-- but he also breaks down his playing in a fairly understandable way for aspiring artists.      The gossip hounds will enjoy his brutally honest recollections of the Stones' infighting, the who-said-what and the reaction words can create-- to the point where you wonder if the group WILL follow through with a rumored album after this book.  But in the end Keith is as hard on himself as he is on Mick, Charlie, or Ronnie.     The only thing not driven home is that while Keith focused much of the book around his heroin addiction-- he doesn't make it clear (or remind the reader enough) he was smoking pot and/or boozing every day since he started the band.  That's sort of a given-unwritten in Keith's world.    If you're looking for an interesting candid bio-- look no further.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004MC8CA2|5|this is a great app. it has tons of reading plans that.even helps to.remind u to read each day. great encouragement to stay on.task and in the word!
B008BDZOZY|5|If you like anything St. Vincent or David Byrne has done, you will enjoy this CD.  It's the best of both of them melded together.
B005NPLXJ4|5|But why is it a Double Album? Why can't the last track, Junior Dad, be, say. 4 minutes shorter? Or leave it at those 20 minutes and have 2 discs, but why not at least another long track and maybe 1 or 2 demos/live in a studio tracks? And some extra video content for the CD-Rom? Other than that I love the music; noise, experimental, art-rock, original collaboration...love it, the sampler does not give you a good idea, so just buy it (they have it for cheap in the Used section ;-)
B00005MP58|5|This interpretation is very true to the book. The scriptwriters have managed to transfer the book successfully into TV. The acting is very convincing: I could not believe it at first that Jennifer Ehle, who plays Elizabeth Bennet, is an American. She does an awsome job as the quick-witted heroine of the story. Colin Firth in the role of Darcy is as arrogant as he is in Bridget Jones' Diary. The rest of the cast is very good too, especially Elizabeth's mother, who cannot see what an irresponsible mother she is.  <br />I highly recommend \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" you will enjoy every bit of it.
B001E5CH0G|5|Best. Movie. Ever.
B00005MP58|5|I've seen many adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, and like many of the other people that submitted reviews, this is by far my favorite. I can watch it over and over again. I was so pleased to find out this special edition was finally out! It's wonderful and I'm buying it as a gift for all my friends! It's a special and timeless movie to add to everyone's collection!
B00005QZ7U|1|YES.....THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER. I'M NOT SURE WERE TO START.<BR>ACTING, STORY LINE THERE IS NOTHING TO THIS MOVIE.
B000W4HJ44|4|yes, i agree, great movie BUT WHAT ARE THE FEATURES of this 2 disc DVD?  what's on the 2nd disc? does anyone know? thanks
B005LHOKFS|4|Wherever you are out wherever you're going you can use TripAdvisor to learn more about the place and get some real time, real people reviews.  I've used it in my home town as week add in Florida and Israel and Colorado! ! Always a real help
0440244412|5|I have to say that I have read a couple of Moning's romance books, and I would NOT classify this series as a romance.  This book/series is SO MUCH MORE. Others have touched on plot, characters, etc, so I won't go over that again.<br /><br />I'm gonna be honest and say I didn't really enjoy the Highlander romance books Moning wrote. They are typical romance, if you are into that, which I am not.<br /><br />But I think Moning found her stride when she made the Fever world.  Stepping out of the romance-box, she has created an entire fantasy world within reality--for adults!! I personally enjoy many of the fantasy-type books (that suggest hidden aspects in reality, such as super-natural creatures, the world of Fairy, hidden powers, etc)that are written for young adults.  Moning has managed to create such a world while avoiding being cheesy or totally unbelievable.<br /><br />I greatly enjoy the tension/relationship between MacKayla and Barrons, and her interaction with other characters. Her personal journey and growth are believable. There is just the right amount of romantic sub-plot and no cringe-worthy sex scenes found in most novels that fall into the romance genre.  I have read this series 4 times, and will probably re-read it every year. I look forward to more books set in this world.<br /><br />Overall, I think with this series, Moning's genius began to flex, and she did an amazing job creating a world that I am always sad to leave at the end of the books.
0374384592|5|just what my daughter wanted. fast shipping
B006LSZECO|4|Slow start for me...actually put it down twice. Then picked it up a third time and pushed through. You'll get to the middle and then hold onto your seat. It gets really, really good!! The kind of book where you think about reading it when you're not. The second half is a real page turner.....worth it totally, but hated the ending.
B00DXLO0D6|5|Great show I am enjoying this tremendously.
B000002UB3|5|John Lennon called this album the &quot;granny album&quot; when it was released. The other 3 thought this was a fine recording for the time limit and material they produced. George Martin as there producer held this album  with much fondness.Diffrent views and opinions for the &quot;crew&quot;  that was actually there. Abbey Road released to the United States on  October 1,1969 is truely a remarkable piece of work.George's Something is  moving.My Mom loves this song.(Mother knows best)and Here comes the sun  really &quot;shines&quot;.Great guitar riff.Ringo's Octopus'Garden works  for him for some reason. If somebody else sung it,I think people would  say,&quot;Are you kidding?&quot;But for him,he does a great way of  presenting the song,from the way he sings it,to the added sound effects on  the recording.John's opening track Come Together is sung in a  &quot;hip&quot; manner. The phrasing along with the words are strange,but  it really does work.The other,I want you(she so heavy)was supposely the  only attempt at &quot;heavy metal&quot; for the Beatles. I think Helter  Skelter or even Yer Blues sounds more like Beatle metal then she so heavy.  The song does lack inspiration but Lennon wrote this for Yoko just  repeating his feelings out to her.If this was written 3 years earlier, I  think George Martin and the other 3 would have bumped this song.Paul's Oh  darling is well crafted and a real throat ripper! Max's Silver Hammer is  ok,it's light and clever and he sings it well.You never give...money is a  nice display of a song starting in one slow key then changes in the middle  like it's 2 diffrent songs put into one. The piano part in the begining I  really like.Thus begins the collaberation of Martin &amp; Mccartney. The  looping of all the short tunes that starts with Sun King thru Her  Majesty.It's too bad that the tunes did'nt last longer then a little more  then a minute!But what it's worth, both George Martin and Paul layed down  these songs the best they could given the material that was presented.I  think they wanted it like an opera with no fades or sudden ending. I think  they just wanted it to flow.I always thought the song Because was the last  time Lennon,Mccartney and Harrison would harmonize together.The old Ed  sullivan show clip when they did the song,&quot;That Boy&quot; when they  were standing together on one mike harmonizing. I see this in  &quot;Because&quot;. Just them standing together on one mike,harmonizing.  Beautiful.This was a unique album to end the turbulent 1960's and 6 months  later it would end 4 creative minds.
B001DTPZNY|4|Well, I think it's perfectly safe to assume, no one thinks this is the best Indiana Jones film. That doesn't mean it sucks. It has good points...and really weird special effects. The parts of the movie that don't have the weird CGI are totally fun and worth it. The ending is overly flamboyant and it was clearly messed up, at some time in the production process. With all that in mind, do you really want the Collector's Edition??? No. You want the movie, with as few extras as possible, if just to prevent any more upset fan anger, directed at Ford/Spielberg/Lucas.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|Love this game but am frustrated that I'm forced to buy power-ups in order to progress to the next level because it's impossible without them and you're not given enough opportunity to earn them. I also wish I had the option to just buy the app instead of buying more lives or waiting 30 min to play again. Graphics are beautiful!
B009POCG2C|4|Clint Eastwood stars in (but not directs) \\"Trouble with the Curve,\\" a drama about a veteran Atlanta Braves baseball scout Gus Lobel and his estranged 33-year-old daughter Mickey (Amy Adams). The film is directed by Eastwood's long-time collaborator (assistant director/producer) Robert Lorenz making his feature film debut here.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, whose latest (and possibly last) assignment is to travel to North Carolina and scout a promising high school player Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill). Being unsure of his ability to see whether Bo is really worth the No.1 pick, Gus's friend and boss Pete Klein (John Goodman) asks Gus's daughter Mickey to accompany her father, whose eyesight is failing. Mickey, herself an able lawyer (who has an important presentation to deliver), reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />The film is always fun when Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams share the screen. Justin Timberlake as Johnny Flanagan, a young Boston Red Sox scout (and romantic interest for Amy Adams's character) is also very good. Except for John Goodman, however, supporting players fare less well, including the talents like Bob Gunton, Ed Lauter, Matthew Lillard and Robert Patrick, with one-dimensional characters that almost look like caricatures.<br /><br />That the film's story is predictable didn't bother me much. I could even forget the incredible turn of events at the end of the film that is too good to be true. I know this is a Hollywood film, sentimental and melodramatic, and as such it is enjoyable. But with a pair of a grizzled Clint Eastwood with understated charisma, and always reliable Amy Adams as his daughter, it is obvious that this film could have been something more.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Best game I have played. Higher levels really difficult<br />Just wish you wouldn't have to buy so many boosters<br />After 3 weeks of daily sessions and still cannot complete level
B008JFUR10|4|Lots of fun and excitement from start to finish. If you can forget how imposibly rediculas it is and not take it as<br />anything other than a fantasy action movie, it's very entertaining and loaded with effects eye candy.<br /><br />Another Hollywood movie gleefully ignores the laws of physics, with giant robots, hundreds of feet tall, and weighing<br />thousands of tons, leaping through the air with ease and able to move with great speed and agility under water.<br /><br />It borrows a few ideas from Aliens, and the plot is rather silly, but if you can turn off the rational, logical part of your<br />brain and forget about reality, you will enjoy yourself.<br />There are plenty of interesting, eccentric, querky charactors, giant monsters and robots fighting and ripping down<br />the local city realestate, tight editing, thundering sound effects, elaborate sets, and atmosphere to keep you interested<br />from start to finish, complete with the standard Hollywood formulaic ending.<br /><br />Watch it on a big 60'' or larger high rez TV with a good surround system and subwoofer for max enjoyment.
B00IJJUIMY|5|Connelly at his best!  I am in a state of shock--did not expect the ending.  When will the next book come out?
B00KMX5V8G|1|Boring
B002NXSRVG|2|It seems this is the decade for resurrecting old cartoons as movie franchises.  Starting with x-Men, then Spiderman, then Transformers, and now G.I. Joe, each one has been jazzed up sex appeal, great special effects, big budgets, and a host of movie stars young and old.  Unfortunately, all of this does not replace a good script and authentic details, both of which are lacking in this movie.      First, the general premise of the movie is nonsensical.  To begin, we have an evil scientist who builds the world's ultimate weapon, metal-eating nanobots, on NATO's dime.  This grand weapon is then delivered to NATO in the middle of a foreign country, to be transferred in a small convoy to storage.  Last time I checked, the biggest and baddest weapons were usually developed at very secure national laboratories or military bases guarded by a whole lot of soldiers.  For something so valuable to be transported across open country guarded by a handful of trucks is ridiculous.  And this is how this movie begins.  But of course we need such a ridiculous setup to allow the aforementioned evil scientist the opportunity to steal said weapon.  Why didn't this mad scientist just program his nanobots to come alive while en route and destroy the convoy that was carrying them?    Another big problem in the script are the battle scenes, specifically how open they are.  Both the good guys and the bad guys in this movie are supposed to be the world's top experts in covert action.  Yet they walk around in very eye-catching outfits, pulling the trigger in very public places.  So much for \\"covert\\" action.  Talking about the outfits, why does the Baroness walk into battle with her breasts half-exposed.  Are they supposed to distract her targets (men mainly) so she can get of the first shot?  And the long hair?  Come on, anyone who has served in the armed forces knows that long hair is a no-no; they easily get caught or tangled up.    And then we have various issues with casting.  First of, whyis the US president played by a British actor, Jonathan Price, who clearly speaks with a British accent in the movie.  Come on, this is the year of Obama; get someone like Morgan Freeman or Denzel Washington to play the president.  Or at least an American who does not speak with a European accent.  And then notice almost everyone of note in either the G.I. Joe side or Cobra's side is either American or British.  We have two characters of Middle Eastern descent, and one japanese ninja.  Last time I checked, South Africa, Russia, Israel, Argentina, Colombia and numerous other countries outside of NATO have produced their fair share of para-military and cover action operatives, many of which operate on the free market.  Why is there nobody from these places featured in this movie?      These are all big misses.  There are lots of smaller ones also, but I think you get my point.  It was overall, an OK movie thats worth the time to watch on DVD.  I'm just glad I didn't spend 10 bucks to see it on the big screen.
B000EQ47GS|5|Great music on this CD.
B00B0LPWU6|1|I was expecting something else, perhaps an epic court battle or an airline cover up.  This was about battling personal demons.  Sad and a little scary to think this might go on.  Sorry, but it wasn't my thing.
B005XR3K5M|5|Cool cards:) fast shipping!
B000002UWF|5|Fabulous album with all Louie Prima's best. The man was ahead of his time. Have listened to this album at least 2-3 times per week.
B000ANVQ0K|3|Just bought the 3-Disc edition. While watching Disc 1, in many scenes the speech was out of sync with the video. Anyone else notice it? The scene with the worst trouble was when Jack and Rose were walking on the promenade when she first irritatingly looked at his drawings. The speech was very noticeably early from the video. Yet other scenes were fine. Seems there were more problems at the beginning of the back-to-1912 scenes.  <br /> <br />I love the movie, by the way--one of my favorites. Just annoyed by the out of sync-ness.
B00004Z459|5|Oh my gosh,  this cd is awesome!  It has great variety and all the songs are great.  I probably wouldnt like it if it wasnt for the variety, cause they would be like other bands such as Bizkit and stuff.  But they have a really good mix going with 2 vocalists, 1 who raps, and 1 who sings and yells, and all that other cool stuff.  And the songs really vary between lighter music, more rap-core like, and more just rock.  Like track 2, which is now on TRL, its more rock based, and is pretty good.. different from track 9, which is more rap, and absolutely bumps.  But either way, this is just a great cd, and i'd recommend it for most people, except those into boy-bands and stuff.
B00005R2M3|1|whenever wherever is about the only song i like on this album. the rest i don't care to listen at all. and how did she become  a diva anyway? i watched her sang &quot;underneath your clothes&quot; on divas las vegas, and it was a dissappointment. she sounded like her mouth is full of words, i coudn't understand what she was singing. i was like spit it out! i believe she has a talent, and most singers i think has their own style when it comes to singing, but please don't overdue it. if you have a voice show it, and don't sound like your drunk or something. if this cd doesn't play on the computer like some viewer says it won't, then i won't buy it, even if i like the cd. i play my cd on my pc most of the time. and i think i know why some new released cd's are encrpyted. well, that won't make me help buy them.
B00C76076C|5|It's the little mermaid...  need I say more?
B00AKL1XPU|1|i wouldn't recommend this app to anyone because it took forever to load and when it did load, it was just a black screen...nothin was there... maybe if was just mine, but it doesn't work very well
B00005JLEX|4|Starting with the pilot episode and going through season 2, you get a good glimpse of how the show started off without any direction as far as the characters go and watch Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer develop their nuances that made them so funny. For me, at least, this made the set both funny and interesting.
0061950726|5|Great book, easy read and entertaining!
B00GXKVZSW|5|If your a Hannibal fan you will love it! Gory though, not for children, the polt is amazing, it's a must see!!
B009UX2YAC|3|I like it a lot but some times I get a bit board of it. But it is very good
0061438294|5|If you are looking for a complete, easy to understand guide to non-verbal communication, this is the book you want. What makes this particular book so compelling is the circumstances by which the author came to be an expert on the subject. Mr. Navarro's work in the FBI means that the stakes were high when his skills were put to the test. As a result, content in this book is superb. He is also very considered in his approach to dealing with identifying deception, which creates more context for accuracy. Simply put, this is the best resource I have found that is presented in a manner that makes the information practical and instantly applicable.
B00785P2QC|2|Pretty ok. Just another game you can play halfway because they want you to buy stuff or post everything on Facebook. I find that old but still am playing. Rada rada
B007J4T2G8|2|There is a lot of sex in this book, but it is not erotic, and the author failed if  that is what he meant to convey. This character Grey is unbelievably crazy, and unbelievably the female character bought into it.  I wonder who is the craziest.  Or have I just led a sheltered life?
0439023521|1|i hate this book why is there a chatacter named after pita bread and cat nip the lady who wrote it must be crazy poor lady
0765316897|5|Brandon Sanderson's fantasy books are great for two reasons. First, they have fun characters who are likable, but not perfect.  This is a nice thing to have in any book.  However, for me the best part about the Mistborn series is the magic system.  It is incredibly unique and well thought out, and it is extremely complicated without being confusing.  In most fantasy books, when a respected character explains the magic of the book's world, the statements can be taken as definitive truth.  In Mistborn, however, even the characters don't understand a lot of the things about their world, and the reader and the characters have to figure out how things work as the story progresses.  In fact, probably the most irritating thing about the book is how certain details about Allomancy aren't revealed even at the end, and I know Brandon isn't planning to release more Mistborn books anytime soon.  I want to know the truth about atium!    But overall, this is a very exciting series, with a satisfying if bizarre ending.  Sanderson continues to improve his writing skills to match his tremendous imagination, and if you enjoyed any of his previous books, you will definitely want to read this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is so fun also it is very productive and once u watch the movie u toast will like it
B004XQO90O|3|This is a technically well-made film featuring Jake Gyllenhaal, who is is adding to his rep as a versatile actor.  And more-than-adequate performances are turned in by all concerned.  The major difficulty is that the scientific premise underlying all the goings on is not well explained.  It seems  to be that people's memories persist for 8 minutes after death, and the federales have a computer program that gloms onto these memories and can then insert Jake into them, where he can carry out tasks not performed by the original owner of the memories.  How a remote computer collects memories from a specific dead individual and inserts someone into them is not dealt with.  Then it turns out that Jake himself is a GI returned from battle in a mostly dead state so that when his usefulness to the computer program ends, so does he.  But at the penultimate instant in his tenuous life, this turns out to be not the case at all -- Oh, happy day!  One suspects this is a second ending devised to satisfy some marketing manager's fear of alienating the audience.
B00CSGYLQI|5|My daughter loves her castle .... its durable very good quality . She plays with it daily so I definitely got my moneys worth.
B009UX2YAC|4|A fun game that's easy to learn & has just enough challenge to make it addicting. I'd recommend this to anyone.
0312263120|1|if you've read any of dan brown's other books, you probably already know the storyline of this book.  all of his books have similar characters and are written with the same formula. the details he included about cryptography were very basic, not very exciting, and extremely predictable. the mysteries the characters have to solve are simplistic and i was able to solve in 10 seconds what it took the characters 4 chapters to figure out.  i know many readers are going to think this review is a load of you know what, but then again, most reviews on amazon are.  then again, maybe it'll save someone a few bucks.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|This is way harder and better than fnaf 1! It's so difficult I can't make it past night 5! And night 4 was the devil! Love this game
B00DV2D0JC|5|Very great story and mini puzzles.  Not too hard but makes you think. Also it was great how it makes you remember all the places you have been throughout the game.  Keeps you very entertained.
B0089LOG02|5|Simply written but I loved the historical aspect of this novel.
B001NKI60W|5|Awesome movie!
B005GFPZYK|5|Great story.  Reads very easily.
B0098460O4|5|I do believe their voices really compliment each other. it's kind of sad that they are now going their separate ways.
B00H8C41XA|1|Shocking that the liberal Hollywood hypocrites would actually show Lyndon B. Johnson as a closet racist and Ronald Reagan as a generous man who was the first president to raise salaries among the black staff.<br /><br />But not a bit shocking that they made Reagan out as an anti-apartheid president when his main concern was economic sanctions hurting the people they wanted to save the most and, instead, imposed sanctions on the South American government.  This somehow got lost in the liberal bias.<br /><br />Or Johnson's &#34;we shall overcome&#34; rhetoric at the end of the movie when it was Senator Dirksen, a Republican, who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to get the CRA of 1964 passed with a majority of Republican votes.<br /><br />That, too, perpetrated the &#34;Big Lie&#34; which too many in the black community still believe today.  It was Republicans who passed every piece of civil rights legislation since the end of the Civil War.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5|I'm looking forward to the next
B00GO8HZIW|5|Brilliant book
B001FB4W0C|4|I pretty much turned off the TV for good about six years ago. Pity, because I missed the first three seasons of this series.<br /><br />I took a chance on the 4th season of Supernatural, which I found on sale at a local establishment at a giveaway price. I am utterly amazed at the quality of this TV series.<br /><br />Supernatural combines elements of good storytelling with pretty decent action. Its a fine example of what can be done with a TV series. There are times where it can be annoying, however. For example episode 14, Sam and Dean get saved from killing each other by Uncle Bobby in a classic deus ex machina. Uncle Bobby just comes from out of nowhere and saves the boys from beating each other to a pulp. Trite, boring, yuck, ew[...] Thankfully there isn't too much of that in this series.<br /><br />I enjoy the classic '67 Chevy, Dean's looks too nice if it has been driven across the country hunting ghosts and demons. You've got to keep a car like that in a garage and spend some serious time working on it for it to look like that. Uncle Bobby's is more what I would expect, except he doesn't really go anywhere and spends alot of time at home. Shouldn't he have the near perfect Impala?<br /><br />I also enjoy the angels versus demons battles. Sort of takes me back to reading Milton, where Satan was the faux-hero. Curiously these themes don't really seem out of place either for a fantasy/sci-fi TV series. The prophet episode may have been over the top, where an all-powerful angel appears to save the day. Puh-lease. Where is this angel when the apocalypse is about to happen?<br /><br />I don't enjoy Dean's diatribes to his brother or his 'anguish' about what he did downstairs. If the guy has to speak more than two sentences, it annoys me. Get back to the ghosts. Anguish should make you a better hunter, not whining to the camera.<br /><br />Overall, its a great series.
B00AKO93JK|5|Simple, clear instructions of targeted exercises anyone can do. I love that they are easy to start but get harder and the fact that there are 3 time settings to boost my workout. Perfect!
B0055PGUYU|5|Excellent book with a lot to say about life and how to better ones personal and business life.<br />I seldom if ever read a book twice; this one will be in my reference book area.<br />Thanks to Charles Duhigg
B00DUGCLY4|5|It  is really fun and a good use of time I would suggest it if you need a good use of time
B004SBS8LA|5|this is awesome i got the new version just now with 12 new levels an i is so cool the level setup wih the bonus is a little odd but it rocks
B00DR0PDNE|4|good product
B0000AQVCL|5|I hate this style of modern music. I'm not such a big fan of modern music. Its boring, has no meaning, but there are some exceptions. I think that this band is one of them. There are so many other bands that play this 1969, 70s era music, but this band shines. They rock hard when they need to, and can bring it down and write meaningful lyrics, too. Jet is not a 'White Stripes', 'The vines', or 'The Hives' knockoffs, they are themselves in a way. I really liked all the catchyness of the songs, and the piani is some of the tracks mix things up a bit. <br />All in all, this album is a good buy for all you garage-punk, 'reto' rockers out there.
1476791457|5|I know as soon as I pick up a Colleen Hoover book that I'm going to the be put through the emotional wringer. &#34;Confess&#34; definitely did that, and then some. The plot continually took me by surprise, and I devoured every word like dark chocolate - melty, sweet, a little bitter, and gone way too soon. Owen and Auburn were beautiful together and on their own; I loved every second of their relationship. HIGHLY recommended read.
B00DEG4Z1W|4|This game is cool but you have to pay for extra characters. So if you're not looking to pay money on games, you can only have two characters to style. Also, after cutting a girls hair, the snipping noise still was going. It took a lot of work to fix it. So I would be careful. It might be different on other devices though. My device is a kindle fire hd 7. If yours isn't , good luck
B00A285OOW|5|Captivating from the 1st page!  I could not put this book down.  Fantastic read- what a story and so insightful to the times and what people were going thru-amazing!
044022425X|5|I was given Outlander as a retirement gift and have read the next two books so far.  Spellbinding story-lots of passion and pretty gritty descriptions of everyday life in different places and times.  It makes you  feel somehow connected with these passionate people.
B0064MPXFA|5|I love this show!
B009YG2ND8|5|A great game once again returns to me, and better than ever! I love having a mobile type of gaming and Final Fantasy is no doubt my favorite game series! I'd love to see more of these games for the Kindle Fire (Final Fantasy IV? Perhaps throw in Interlude and After Years with a graphics makeover?). My birthday's coming up and I plan to get some Amazon giftcards. I'd without a doubt save them for Final Fantasy games for my Fire!
B002WY65VU|5|This movie rocks!! i love Woody Harrelson, hes always been one of my favorite actors so i was so glad to see him in this role.<br /><br />Jesse Engleberg (i know im spelling it wrong) was ok<br /><br />Emma Stone was HOT AS HELL, oh my god<br /><br />Abiligail Breslin, whatever, she was ok.<br /><br />I just wish they would have concentrated more on zombie killing and maybe alittle more gore, but thats ok...it wasn't meant to be a horror flick and less focus on the attraction between Jesse and Emmas characters. Oh yeah and the cameo with....maybe i shouldnt tell...oh god, it was BILL MURRAY (like everyone doesnt know already know) was okay but it kinda dragged out while they were in his house.<br /><br />All in all, it was a fun movie and i really love the \\"RULE #1\\" thing going on in the movie....AWESOME!!<br /><br />The intro scenes and the blaring of Metllica make the intro one of the coolest intros to a movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />Part 2 is suppossed to be coming out in 2011 sometime, so i really pray to god they don't mess up the original with a stupid sequel.
B00AF6MF9I|5|I love this game. Can't stop playing if. A must get<br />For anyone who loves war games. I promise you will love this freaking game.
B000ZM1FXO|1|This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Is any of it based on fact (other than the existence of Caligula)? Here's my point: I don't care. If each scene was recorded in a scroll discovered by an archeologist (or film producer)in Rome, it still comes off as a vehicle for Bob Guccione to couch soft porn in a respectable setting. I only gave it one star because I'm afraid if I don't give it any stars the review won't get in the system, and I don't know how to give negative stars.
B00005QZWJ|5|The soundtrack of the movie The Fellowship of the Ring is fantastic. \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" is a light, high-spirited piece that contains the essence of The Shire. Going on from there to \\"A Knife In The Dark\\" and \\"Many Meeings\\" we see a definite darkening of the theme. Listening to some of these pieces, one can almost see the text-and the scenes-flowing before your eyes. While Enya's \\"May It Be\\" at the end of the soundtrack doesn't really add to it, \\"The Breaking Of The Fellowship\\" is a beautiful, heartfelt piece that encompasses the sorrow at Boromir's death, the capture of Merry and Pippin-and the flight of Sam and Frodo. <BR>All in all, I definitely recommend getting this soundtrack.
B0084AXZK0|3|I read this book only because the title character was depicted in the film. League of Extraordinary Gentleman. And was the only character. I had not heard of before .<br />The book was slow. Hard to get through as the author describes in detail what is unesental and glosses over portions the story that are more ecential.,
080214473X|5|For some reason I waited 15 years to read this, long after Bill Clinton, Aideed, and Somalia were long forgotten.  I saw the movie but did not know what an important book this was. The movie was a realistic action story, along the lines of Superman meets the Skinnies, albeit with a lot more trauma than we see in the Sunday funnies.<br /><br />Mark Bowden is a fellow Philadelphian, well known for his features at the old Inquirer.  Here he writes the comprehensive story of one day in 1993 when the US Army was in a place they should not have been, doing something best left for others, directly in the line of fire of centuries old clan warfare.  The Army group sets out on a one hour mission to capture some Somalian bad guys, not the leader, but his lieutenants. It goes wrong nearly from the git-go when the first man out of the helicopter falls 70 feet to the street. Next thing we have a firefight with the US and the locals. Unfortunately we got into this thing without a backup plan, enough vehicles, water, and a decent map. As the title makes clear, Somalians had RPG's on hand which are very good at killing helicopters if you can get under one.  On this day they shot down two and did no end of damage to other helicopters and trucks.<br /><br />Where Bowden's book is unique is that he is the only one telling the story of the next 24 hours from every possible point of view. He interviewed all our people but also the Skinnies.  That took a lot of hallucinogenic drugs and a devil's pact with the local travel agent, but Bowden went back to Somalia and talked to surviving local combatants.<br /><br />Clinton was new to the Presidency in 1993 but had the political skills to know when to cut and run. He made the decision that week to get everyone out of Somalia quickly. Even the UN realized that when you are in the middle of a civil war in a country with no resources, no leadership, and no money, and they are killing the peacekeepers, it is time to find another location.<br /><br />Bowden took the time to develop unprecedented access to soldiers and their families.  We hear heart-breaking stories of army families asking why we got involved in Somalia.
B007HU7NBK|5|Thoughtful, well-written, interesting. This is a book that anyone could enjoy. Of course, it helps if you like DD's music (as I did growing up). Regardless, this is a very good rock n'roll memoir, and I've read a lot of them. Kudos to JT for being so open and dealing candidly with his problems. He comes across very well in print, and has done himself and his fans proud.<br /><br />Thank you, John Taylor. Play that funky bass, John (or should I say Nigel?)
B00L9B7IKE|5|Don't start reading this until you have nothing else to do. You won't want to put it down!
B00KA87GCW|5|Typical tap game, fun to pass the time

B00KMX5V8G|4|Ever since updated it won't load!!
B00992CF6W|5|I love this game so much it is so fun you can craft armour and craft tools there are zombies,creepers,and spiders and skeletons
B001DWNUCO|1|This is the most disgusting, immoral, gross, movie I have ever seen in my life.  I enjoy history, but this is not a history related movie - this is porn. I am really disappointed that it is non-returnable.  Had I known the contents, I never would have ordered it. It should be rated  and labled \\"xxx\\".
0061950726|4|Great book. Easy and quick read. Enjoyable and interesting.
B000005Z0G|5|This was the first 2Pac album I got together with All Eyez On Me. Even though All Eyez On Me was the album I bump the most, this always got spins in my CD-player. What I love about Strictly 4 My Niggaz is the old school hip-hop sounding beats, the lyrics, guest apperances, Pac's flow and the variety in the music. You'll find most of party anthems, but you also get songs like Keep Ya Head Up (has to be the best on the album), Souljah's Revenge and a couple of others political issues. 2 interludes aimd at the then vice-president. Production by Live Squad, Shock-G, Raw Fusion and a numerous of others. Guest apperances comes from a hot list of rappers like Ice Cube, Ice-T, Live Squad, Digital Underground, Treach of Naugthy by Nature, Strech (Pac's true homie R.I.P.) and more. <BR>No songs are weak but of course some one are better than the other. Get this if you a hip-hop or 2Pac fan. Great music.
B004R15SIW|4|Ilustrate what happen n 2008 financial desastre. It's sad disappointed  confuse good movie
B000GDH9JQ|5|My mother raved about this movie for years and years so finally I bought it from Amazon for her on DVD after catching part of it on tv one night. It is an amazing movie over all. Yes the dancing is spectacular and Mikhail move like liquid in his performance. The movie has passion and excitement. It's unique in its performance and creativity and there is nothing else like it. It is a must see movie for all!! It's not just dancing however the story line is thrilling and touches a lot of people's lives with just simple struggles we face be it the struggles Mikhail faces or our own struggles.
B00CO52NLI|1|Not an interesting game.  You can't turn down the volume either, I like fun, interesting and challenges, this is not it.
630575067X|2|This movie did NOT live up to the huge hype that was started by it.  Sure, it's Star Wars, and it sells.  But the quality of this movie doesn't deserve to be sold.  Overall, the acting was OK, with, in my opinion, the best acting being done by Ewan Mcgregor as Obi-Wan.  I'm not even going to start to criticize Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin &quot;Annie&quot; Skywalker, because everybody has already criticized it enough.  I know that all of these actors are very good ones (I just saw Episode II, Natalie Portman was awesome in that movie, and has improved vastly from Episode 1, as was the Anakin Skywalker character played by Hayden Christensen, and Ewan Mcgregor has improved even more from his great performance in Episode 1).  The comedy that was attempted NEVER even started to be funny in the minds of adults or teens, as Jar Jar Binks wasn't funny at all.  The only good parts were the Darth Maul fight, since I am a fan of Lightsaber combat, and the Yoda parts, since I am a fan of Yoda.<br />I'm sorry to criticize so much, I've never liked critics who overly criticize things, because frankly, they couldn't do ANY better.  Neither could I.  But as a Star Wars fan, I was disappointed.  I'm glad Episode II passed up my expectations.  I was not the least bit disappointed with that one.
B00622D3BS|5|very funny  both husband and I enjoyed it
B0024F08RO|5|Looove
B000OV85AW|5|a must see classic which shows amazing human spirit a tale that shows how we a people behave and react in horrible situations and what one will do should your soul push you
B004SBQGHS|5|Love this game without ads. Great price to eliminate the ads that are very irritating in the regular. free game.
B00FAPF5U0|1|I just started to play this game.  I don't enjoy being penalized for an hour for my failures. I play another game during the &#34;wait time&#34;  and often become interested in something else forgetting about Candy Crush... and NO I am not paying $.99 for another chance.  I don't see this as a game that is going to capture my interest
B00AIUUXHC|5|Awesome😀😀😀
159463176X|3|2.5 stars.<br /><br />This book really disappointed me ..<br /><br />I expected so much from it since I read the last books of the author's work. This had too many characters and too many stories, it had a good storyline but could've been much better.
B00005K3OT|4|The set and music really made the movie.  Juliette Binoche was wonderful as well as Judi Dench (who can do no wrong).  The soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated and adds to the movement of the film.
B0084B5TK8|5|Loved it.  Wanted to read the book after watching so many movie versions, and as I suspected, the book was so much better.
1451662432|5|I was skeptical when I first picked up this book, but was pleasantly surprised at how well-written it is. It shows Arnold's personality and what has made him successful (his drive and attitude). I found myself wanting to keep reading... The stories are very good, and nostalgic for me, because I grew up in the era when he was very popular for both bodybuilding and acting. I also learned more about the Kennedy/Shriver family that I didn't know before, as well as political issues that he dealt with as governor. I would definitely recommend this book if you like Arnold. I believe he was very honest in writing this book and I found it entertaining.
B00DJYJRHG|5|As ordered. Love this past T.V. show.
B005A1ER0I|5|Great epic music. I listen to a lot of epic music and this is one of the best. The slow and delicate passages are emotional and very sad (which I dig) and the bombastic moments are exciting! I highly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Great show love,the storyline
0743219619|5|It took me a while to figure out the PD isn't a guy. She's Pamela, and a great writer.
B008UCJ7KO|4|I wanted months for the Book and it was truly a good book 3 to me I don't care what any one else says all the sex made the book even better ...however I am angry and frustrated with Sylvia Day for doing another book like it's so stupid the reviews are very low due to this she need  to listen to her fans more , I do know this  that next book better be the last and in Gideon POV or I am done with DAY altogether....
1451695195|4|I'm glad proof was given to Mr. Alexander. I'm certain an experience like that would change your life. Very inspiring.

B00003CXB2|5|I PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER.  SHE JUST LOVES THE MOVIE.
B0047WJ12K|5|This movie was, in my opinion, the best movie I've seen in 2010. It was very entertaining. I loved the plot of the film, the characters, everything. One warning: if you miss one part you will get lost. You absolutely have to make sure you keep up with the movie the whole time.
B00KG2SXII|3|It's good I expected more.
B004C3DLJS|5|Renting this movie was quick and easy! I would recommend instant watch to anyone. The movie is super funny and entertaining.
B000001EAQ|3|U2 took a giant leap into the unknown void of techno-electro-pop (at this late date I can think of no better description) and came out with &quot;Pop,&quot; not one of their most successful albums but an interesting addition to the catalog, nonetheless.<br />According to many sources, &quot;Pop&quot; was either hurriedly finished or released before U2 were completely done with it. That's sort of hard to believe; the album sounds great, though it does contain a few puzzling dead-ends (&quot;Miami,&quot; &quot;Mofo,&quot; &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;). This is not the same band that audiences were used to hearing back in the 1980s, which turned off a lot of longtime listeners. But I'm convinced they had to go through this phase -- had to make a record like &quot;Pop&quot; -- if they were to survive and move on. Which is ultimately what they did.<br />Best cuts: &quot;Discotheque&quot; (overblown, but it still rocks), &quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot; (U2 erotica?), &quot;Staring at the Sun,&quot; &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot; (underrated), &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; and &quot;Please.&quot;
B007IXWL2C|5|I love this trilogy! :D I'm not sure which book I like better though! It's a very tough decision! I think the second book is the best book by far! :)
B000002GVZ|5|Carly Simon has made some wonderful music in her day.  She was the essence of the best music of her day.  Ilistened to Carley Simon since the early 1970's and wanted to add this CD to my library of music.  She and her music inspired my generation and I still feel she has been one of the best female entertainers in my life.  I recommend this CD to those who are of this era and want to aquire the sounds of our age.
B008OOYALE|5|I have this game on my iPhone, a tablet, and my kindle fire... I know I'm hooked!!! I love the graphics the dragons are beautifully created. Hats off to the creators the are a work of art. I give the game 5 stars because it works on my time I don't have to worry about things expiring. Team Lava this is a winner. I also play Castle Story, Bakery Story and Fashion Story. Good job!!
B0052RE4MQ|5|I strongly encourage this book! I am not much of a reader but a friend wanted me to read this book and once I picked it up I couldn't put it down
B0015AARJI|5|excellent......
B000XTLUW0|5|Since a few years ago, every Muse record is a must. This is no exception. A double disk featuring the \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" tour concert in Wembley. In a CD with the best songs and a DVD with an hour and a half of first rate footage.     Matthew Bellamy is a genius, in very sense of the word. He plays the piano and the guitar as a God, and sings with one of the widest ranges and higher registers in modern music.     In a fun note, the concert begins with \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" and finishes with \\"Take a bow\\", since they are respectively the last and first of their previous record.     Standouts: \\"Hysteria\\", \\"Time is running out\\", \\"Supermassive black hole\\" and the magnificent \\"Unintended\\" from early work: Showbiz.     The concert sounds great (the CD sound quality is better), and looks amazing. Only complaint: bad transfer resolution: with many pixelated objects and blurred images during the concert, specially in the fastest shots. Lets hope for a later HD Release of this concert. I'll buy it again!

B0086700CM|5|I normally do not play games on my Kindle or IPad but in this case I have been home schooling a 9 year old.  He knew about this game and I allowed him to play it on my IPad.  I now have a Kindle Fire and put not only Temple Run 1 but Temple Run II.  It's quite a diversion and fun to play.
B005LAIHUO|4|Here's a new take on an old tale. Rated PG-13 and directed by Bryan Singer (\\"X-Men\\"), this \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" is well cast, visually exciting, and lots of fun. Computer Generated Imaging has made fantasy stories more and more fantastical; this one is mind-boggling.<br /><br />We admire:<br />  * Nicholas Hoult (\\"Warm Bodies\\") is resourceful and resolute as Jack, the nice young man who drops a magic bean and... \\"Uh oh,\\" gets it WET. Later, as he clambers up that amazing beanstalk, he admits he \\"doesn't much like heights.\\"<br />  * Eleanor Tomlinson (\\"Alice in Wonderland\\") is Isabel, an adventurous princess who finds waaaay more adventure than she bargained for.<br />  * Ian McShane (\\"Deadwood\\") is the king, ready to marry off his daughter to a much older man in order to achieve peace with a neighboring kingdom. But he pitches right in when his kingdom is under attack.<br />  * Stanley Tucci (\\"The Hunger Games\\") makes the perfect bridegroom/villain: ambitious, ruthless and cruel. Once he gets the magic crown, the wedding is off!<br />  * Ewan McGregor (\\"The Impossible\\") is our stalwart guardsman Elmont: organized, decisive and brave. It looks like McGregor enjoys being in a comedy for a change.<br />  * Bill Nighy (\\"About Time\\") is the lead Giant. He has a little spare head sitting on one shoulder, which offers another point of view.<br /><br />If you take a 12-year-old boy (the perfect demographic) reassure him that there is less than a minute of \\"mush.\\" Otherwise, it's slam-bang action, with lots of spears, arrows, horses, drawbridges, armor, swords, boiling oil, burning trees and other weapons of the middle ages.<br /><br />I can't think of a thing I would change; 114 minutes flew by. The battle scenes aren't too long, the giants are appropriately icky, our hero is valiant and the heroine is plucky. We all ducked when a crown bounced into the audience, but beyond that, the story is engaging enough that there should be no need to spring for the extra 3D charge, so a DVD from Amazon will do just fine.
B001FB55L2|4|You totally feel for the brother who had to risk his life in Afghanistan -- even when he is forced to commit an unspeakable crime to save his life.  You also feel for the brother who has just got out of jail and for the wife who is left behind to take care of small children.  And most of all you really feel for the daughter who feels neglected and less loved than her sister.      I loved the fact that I thought the wife was going to have an affair with her brother-in-law, but no such thing takes place.  Threw me for a loop.    This film was actually much better than I thought it would be.  Not something I would watch again and again, but a good expose of the post traumatic stress disorder that has impacted so many returning soldiers, and their families.
B000002U9Y|4|Some major things happened in the Pink Floyd camp when their second album was being recorded. Well, just one really. Frontman Syd Barrett was getting pretty..damaged, mentally. Thus, Roger Waters to the rescue, and \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is the result. <br /> <br />Barrett only contributes one tune, \\"Jugband Blues\\", another colorful, weird psychedelic pop song like those from their debut album. Sadly, that would be his last contribution to the band.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album is much different from \\"A Piper at the Gates..\\"; the pieces are longer, more atmospheric. Still very trippy, but in a more omnious sort of way as opposed to the colorful pop tunes that Syd wrote. <br /> <br />\\"Let There Be More Light\\" is a brooding opener. Very psychedelic, a bit intense, and has a slight Middle Eastern feel. \\"Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun\\" has a similar brooding, omnious feel; tribal-like drums, eerie vibraphone, etc. <br /> <br />Rick Wright's always underrated contributions include \\"Remember a Day\\" and \\"See-Saw\\". The former is a nice, breezy little pop ballad with a hazy psychedelic sheen. The latter (which Roger gave the working title: \\"The Most Boring Song I Have Ever Heard\\") is quite lush and gorgeous. It doesn't really *go* anywhere, but I really enjoy it. <br /> <br />\\"Corporal Clegg\\" seems like Roger Waters' attempt at writing a Syd styled quirky pop song. It's deliciously strange, really. Part heavy acid rock, part kazoo-laden stomp.  <br /> <br />And then, the title track (which featured equal contribution from all four band members). It's a lengthy (12 minutes) piece divided into four parts, and purely instrumental. There's a creepy organ throughout, some awesome drumming in the middle, and a beautiful, choral finale.  <br /> <br />\\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is one of Pink Floyd's more overlooked albums, lacking both a well known song and critical word of mouth. It's really an excellent album, a bit experimental and transitional, but it settlesin after a few listens.
014241011X|5|My daughter started reading this book in school and loved it. So I bought the movie as well since I loved watching it as a kid also
B005LAIH2W|5|this movie is good and funny at times.
B004LOMB2Q|5|would recommend this to students, great for tagging websites you want to keep to help get some work done! perfect to keep my Pc synced with my phone and tablet
B00GINENG0|5|Awesomeness and awesomely fun to play but it needs a bath tub and a sink and a spanking station for when he gets in trouble at the school
0930289234|5|Being a long time comics fan this book was kind of a no-brainer required reading, however, once I began to penetrate the subtext and truly understand what Alan Moore was attempting to do with this deceptively simple story, I was hooked right through to the end- wishing there was more so that the story didn't have to end even after 12 issues!<br /><br />A true and absolute page turner in every sense of that phrase, Watchmen is a seminal work that should be required reading by all capable of doing so, and not just the comics fans who can't escape the long shadow cast by this story on the medium we cherish so much.
B005K0HDGE|5|Synopsis:<br /><br />Jake Epping is a high school English teacher who takes on the challenge of teaching students at an adult education facility. While working through a batch of essays at the end of the day, he finds himself moved by one in particular. Compelled to discover more information, he speaks with the author of the paper and strikes up a friendship. Jake takes him to celebrate a milestone in a diner where the owner, Al, has a secret. As a last chance to set things right, Al lets Jake in on the secret portal in his diner that would take him back to a time before President Kennedy was assassinated. Jake becomes convinced of the portal's reality and devises a plan to change history, both close to home and abroad. Unfortunately, he has to bear the burden of those changes as well as the knowledge that no one must ever know about his journey.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />The story starts in the present day and yet slips back and forth through time with ease. The format was not difficult to follow, keeping the flow of the story unhindered. It was action-packed and kept me guessing from the moment Jake first went through the portal. One of the early plot twists that the author put into play has consequences far beyond what I would have imagined for the characters and the world itself. I found myself wanting to turn the page to find out what was going to happen more often than I wanted to put the book down. It was a great story from start to finish and one that I would recommend to lovers of Stephen King and those who have yet to discover him.
B00009AOBI|5|The dvd was brand new as stated. My wife loves this movie. Still can't believe the super low price I paid for a brand new dvd I can't even find in the stores. Arrived much faster than expected.
B0009MAO46|1|This movie is not as good as made to be. It is boring and overrated. I bought this dvd at a local Blockbuster Video without even renting it i can't get into it. The first time i watched it after I played it I was depressed!! Of course i didn't want to hate this movie so I gave it one more chance. Even after 2 times I still can't get into it. I have Toy Story 2 on dvd and I enjoy that one more. Toy Story 2 is funnier and much better as a matter of fact, I will stick with that one along with my favorite movie Monsters, Inc. Toy Story 1 was week compared to Toy Story 2. Do yourself a favor and if your considering purchasing a Toy Story dvd, get Toy Story 2, don't waste your hard earned money on Toy Story 1.
B007HJ9LXE|4|Especially learing about the accident and the family history.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I can wait to see the movie now! I met my goal of finishing the book before the movie. I love Augustus waters do look much <3
B0001MDQ6W|5|In the blackest of sunglasses and a polka dot shirt, Dylan, and his musicians, are fabulous in this concert taped in Sony Music Studios on November of 1994, in an intimate setting with a small but enthusiastic audience.<br /><br />From the mellow country feel of \\"Shooting Star\\", the up-tempo \\"Dignity\\", or the somber \\"With God on Our Side\\", the musicianship is a marvel, and being a \\"nobody sings Dylan like Dylan\\" person, I love the way he sings his music with his gravelly voice that gets rougher as the years go by.<br /><br />The acoustic instruments are a pleasure to listen to, as well as a visual delight, especially the gleaming rich wood of the double bass.<br /><br />This disc contains 4 tracks that were not included in the MTV Unplugged broadcast (# 1, 5, 6 and 8), and total running time is 73 minutes.<br /><br />The terrific musicians are: Tony Garnier on bass, Bucky Baxter on dobro, Winston Watson on drums, John Jackson on guitar and Brendan O'Brien on organ.<br /><br />Track list with original release album dates:<br /><br />1: \\"Tombstone Blues\\" (Highway 61 Revisited '65)<br /><br />2: \\"Shooting Star\\" (Oh Mercy '89)<br /><br />3: \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" (John Wesley Harding '67)<br /><br />4: \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" (The Times They Are A-Changin' '64)<br /><br />5: \\"John Brown\\" (MTV Unplugged '94)<br /><br />6: \\"Desolation Row\\" (Highway 61 Revisited '65)<br /><br />7: Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35\\" (Blonde on Blonde '66)<br /><br />8: \\"Love Minus Zero / No Limit\\" (Bringing it All Back Home '65)<br /><br />9: \\"Dignity\\" (Greatest Hits Vol. 3 '94)<br /><br />10: \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" (Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid '73)<br /><br />11: \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" (Highway 61 Revisited '65)<br /><br />12: \\"With God on Our Side\\" (The Times They Are A-Changin' '64)
B00E8KLWB4|4|While this game has many in-app opportunities, it is also possible to play and enjoy the challenge without making any purchases.  I like the variety of &quot;pictures&quot; after you get to the more advanced levels.  Very challenging.
B0029LCJJS|5|The story was very interesting.  I looked forward to seeing each episode and how the historical events unfolded.  I found a show on Elizabeth, his daughter soon after watching this series.
B001BANK32|5|Great book! Love the story, it kept the suspense through the entire book. Couldn't put it down.
B00687Q0VC|4|Very engrossing and well made series on the issues leading up to the Declaration of the Independence and ask the key players.
B00000G3PA|5|The regular working guys get to save the world. What's better than that. Bruce Willis does one of his best tough guy with a huge heart roles.
0553108034|5|This is the second book in the series and my son was pleased with this gift! I placed the order late and was thrilled it arrived before Christmas!
B00BXZ3D6Y|3|I'm not sure if this is the right app, but will look into it more.  I need a recorder for rehearsals that last a couple of hours.  So, I'm trying to figure out if this is the app for me.
B00KA7JIII|5|A very unique and addictive game. The graphics are both artistic and calming. :-)
B0099RFVXQ|4|Lots of action. Not all the characters are truly likable but they grow on you by the end of the movie. You find yourself cheering and laughing at times. There are a few funny scenes. Overall enjoyed it.
6304711905|5|great
B00I480SI4|5|Amazed to think it's been 40 years since &#34;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&#34; was released.  This is a wonderful set - great remaster of the album, fascinating archival material - and a great live show from back when the album was released.  Elton is the king.
B0058UXHHK|3|I enjoyed reading this book, even if the lead character has spectacularly poor decision making skills.  In retrospect, it's hard to believe her problem solving skills were good enough to keep her alive to the end of the book.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The book flows nicely.  It's entertaining.  I liked the character development for the most part.  Every so often, I'd run across something about the way that the book was written that made me think, wow, that's a little hokey, but it wasn't often enough to bug me anymore than in passing.<br /><br />Cons:<br />There are a few things that didn't make sense.  As I said, Rose has very poor decision making skills.  People are breaking into her house and trying to kill her.  If she doesn't trust the police, how about, her sister, who apparently was also in danger?  Her brother-in-law? Her lawyer? The feds?  She let's men drag her off because she doesn't want to create a scene.  Who does that?<br /><br />Joe, too, can't seem to find a way to keep her out of danger?  Really?  And, he seemed OK with sending her in to get killed, except that he fell for her?  It doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed the book.  Read it to the end.  I would have liked to have given it 4-5 stars had some of it been a little more believable.
B00B89WXYS|5|Love this record!  I have been a fan of One Republic for many years and this album is just additional confirmation that they know what it takes to produce good music.
B00QW8TYWO|5|soo funny to watch the animals get squashed
B009ZQ8FQG|5|The actors were extraordinary in their parts.  Each season has drama that could fit in modern day.  We could all learn how our own decisions affects others.  I would recommend this season to anyone who likes drama.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Well written and well spoken about a journey through life and death while the two intersect at interesting moments. Couldn't put it down and it helps describe my feelings and thoughts as a person diagnosed with terminal cancer- please read it!
B0027MJU00|4|I enjoyed this book. I like the change in  lead characters telling the story, which she has used in her other books.  Stays with you after you've finished it.
B00K4APIN0|1|Lost both of my games and now I can not install the app.  I guess I'm just out of 50 bucks...
B00005JLWN|5|This movie really surprised me...and that says a lot. I'm a veteran action movie junkie-I bet I've seen thousands of action scenes,my sentimental favorites being the Hong Kong variety. As in John Woo,pre-Hollywood. You know,the stuff that makes your jaw drop,your adrenaline rush,etc. The original \\"Matrix\\" was incredible,while \\"Reloaded\\" was still pretty cool.Wanna know why it wasn't incredible,and \\"Equilibrium\\" is? Because now that the \\"Hong Kong influence\\" is part of our American film lexicon,we've sort of seen it all before. It takes some mighty doings nowadays to make our jaws drop. But \\"Equilibrium\\" isn't just about the original,unforgettable action scenes (that you will replay again & again.)It has a solid story,maybe not wholly original,but the approach to the action (and the thought behind it)was REAL original.Kung Fu? Seen it-slow motion,bone breaking,physics defying,wire flying,yadda yadda. Gunplay? Who can top the master...Woo & Yun-Fat said it & did it all in Hong Kong. Or so you thought...howzabout \\"Gun Fu\\"? With scenes so utterly cool,you may forget you love martial arts fights! Oh,and throw in some katana-style swordplay,along with Christian Bale,the most unflappable gunfighter since a certain \\"man with no name\\".Then add a solid storyline,great editing,terrific acting and a restrained directorial hand (no \\"bullet time\\" or slow-mo O.D. here),and you have probably what will be the greatest futuristic actioneer that no one has heard of (in this or any other year). BUY IT!!! You won't regret it...
0956010903|5|I'm a 16-year old Harry Potter fan and treated myself for Christmas and purchased this latest from J.K. Rowling.  First and most of all, the packaging was exciting to receive.  It's original and very \\"Potteresque\\".  I'm a passionate reader and enjoy stories that excite and ignite my imagination and this is the latest brainstorm from J.K. Rowling that I had to experience.
B00NFQT7QY|5|Easy plot, Easy story line. Love Capt. America
B004EPYZUI|1|Sucker Punch is simply one of those great little movies that I see myself enjoying for years to come. FALSE. Sucker Punch is actually one of those stupid &#34;artsy&#34; films that make one very p/i/s/s/ed off when viewed through your retinas. With the millions of dollars spent on this drivel, starving children in Idaho could eat entire chickens for days on end, but said monies are rather used for releasing this on DVD where it will be personally snubed the same way women snub me when I say &#34;Hi&#34; to them out on the streets. In other words, it's a complete waste of everyone's time and money, and should be burned in h.e. double hockey sticks for the hour and a half of my life that it has wasted. Not only did this film not make any sense what-so-ever, but it didn't even try to make any valid statements or reflections on our current society. Look at some of the greatest films of all time; Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Paul Blart: Mall Cop. All of these movies have themes about our current unstable geo-political climate and dependence on technology. I wish I could tell you that this movie offered even a single morsel of an allegory, but other than a scene featuring two women macking out that's an obvious metaphor for our declining economic freedom, there are none &#34;to do&#34; with this movie. At first I thought that this was a movie about suicide, then zombies, then ghosts, then dual identities, then robots, then split personalities, then ninjas, then parallel universes, then robot ninjas, then dragons, and then finally b/o/o/bs. In the end we never know what it was truly about and can be chalked up as a completely and utterly waste of time.  In a perfect world, Sucker Punch would have been life changing. I really did want this movie to be a/n/u/s moistening. I mean those smoking hot actresses put out their whole talents on display and this is what they get in return! A film that supposedly tackles real lifeissues, instead, has some silly story about this girl that can transmorph into different fantastic creatures like tralfamadores. Heck, they could have done a whole MATRIX angle and I still might have dug into it. All I'm saying is that it would have been much more cognitively interesting if we find out that she is in an alternate reality and has to go on some dangerous quest for various items that can help in gaining her freedom. Now that would be a great movie! Visually, there are some thought provoking transitions in this flick, like the one of a dragon chasing an airplane, then to an explosion, then to a hot chick dancing in a brothel kitchen, and then to another explosion, but all of this is for nothing because the movie simply doesn't know what to do with itself. I think the director knows how to show sexy women in interesting ways, set the mood of a scene that involves sexy women, and have interesting comments on the overall state of sexy women in mental institution, but the man either had a shasty script or was on some kind of mind augmenting dopamine that elevated him onto another state and plane of incoherent passive thoughts. I'm super p/i/s/s/ed and you would be too if you saw this film. So please, don't be bamboozled by this movies allure of deep metaphysical contemplations, because it just ain't there.
B004H4XDBI|1|If I Stay was captivating, hard to put down. Book 2 is hard to keep reading. I only continued reading because I hoped there would be something to show for the effort at the end. I was wrong
B0078N2MTE|3|It was ok, but I found the ending to be rather predictable and anti-climatic.  The story is good enough and it kept my interest, but I knew what was coming at the end and just kept watching, hoping for a surprise.  I was disappointed.  No surprise.  Exactly what I expected so just...meh.
B004MC8CA2|5|i love my bible app..I listen to it all the time.i love it very much..this makes life easier...i love it
B002LFPAUC|3|I LOVE Fawlty Towers...LOVE IT.  But I've had issue with this particular collection not working in my DVD player.  In the final episode of disc 1 \\"The Germans\\" the screen freezes as soon as the setting changes from the hospital to the hotel.
B00EW9GQR6|5|Okay, maybe it isn't extremely ground-breaking, but she's returning to her Dance roots - she is first and foremost a Dance artist who is only seen as Pop because she pushed Dance back into the Pop landscape. If you're smart enough to ignore the constant album bashing from the media, this is a great, fun, Dance album.
B0058UXHHK|5|When I first got this book I admit I didn't really expect it to be good considering it was free. As soon as I got into the first couple of chapters I couldn't put it down. I definitely recommend it!
B00EEL0LGY|5|I love this game, and I'm sure once my nephew sees me play it he's going to want this game. I never pay for a game or an app unless I feel It's worth it. this was a free app of the day and I love it but if I had to pay for it I probably would its that good!! Note: this was downloaded on a kindle fire hdx
1401234550|4|You would expect to see Sinestro back as a green lantern but the Geoff Johns did a good job with this story arc. Definitely gives you a different look at the &#34;villain&#34;  Sinestro.
0307588378|5|I couldn't put this book down!
B004UIOUHC|5|Great web browser I liked the app and it does exactly what it says it will do. No problem downloading fron Amazon appstore.
0756655307|5|I  bought this book as a xmas gift for my 11 year old son. They have not separated since. Despite its rather large size he carries it to school in his backpack to share with his friends. He now considers himself an expert on everything Marvel. The book itself is excellent quality, illustrations are wonderful and it's loaded with \\"facts\\" May have to get another after he wears this one out!
0553801481|5|Even before I began this book I had high expectations, since it is by Robin Hobb who has never written a book that disappoints, and Fool's Errand proved to be no exception. The story does begin at a slow pace, but it is still interesting as Fitz's past fifteen years are revealed, pedal by pedal. Then the action builds upon more action until I could not bear to put the book down. Much sleep has been lost reading Fool's Errand, but it was more than worth it. All the characters are real with breathtaking details, and Fitz has to be the one of the most fleshed out protagonists ever. He leaps off the page as a person so real with all his triumphs and tragedies, all of his strengths, and right down to even single one of his faults. At times Fool's Errand had me laughing out loud, and at other times I cried, literally, and for moments on end I could not look at the page without my eyes welling up and my throat clenching. Seldom do books make me do either one, and never have I read one before that has made me do both. <br />If you do not real Fool's Errand you will be missing out on something, and you will never know what until you have read it. It is a story of the highest caliber. Not only does it entertain, but it also speaks of great truths in human kind without preaching, and makes one see life in a whole new manor. I cannot offer anything but the highest praise for Fool's Errand, for it deserves nothing less.
B009YP9L7U|5|Love this book is amazing the plot is beautiful honestly I read it the entire book like in 6 hours. I love it
B0000E2FLC|1|It couldn't be more blatantly obvious that the audio was dubbed over the original recording, if it was even recorded during the actual Donington show at all.  When I watch a concert DVD, I fully expect to see and hear what I would have seen and heard if I had attended the concert.  This experience however, was more like watching a bunch of MTV videos where the audio was from CD versions of the songs, but the video was showing concert footage.  I contemplated giving it two stars instead of one because of Angus' high-energy performance, but the fact that I kept fast-forwarding to the next track during my initial viewing should tell you all you need to know.    The bottom line is that I will most likely never pull this DVD out of the cabinet to watch it again for my own personal enjoyment.  It will only ever see the light of day again if a friend still wants to see it even after the forewarning that I am sure to give.
B003YL4LYI|5|I have enjoyed reading all of the books and am looking forward to the next one.  I plan on reading others of RR Martin's books.
B00CE0ZY46|5|Good fun and laughs for all
B00280LYIC|5|I really like this book,it's probally the second best book i haved read  It was adventurous and exiting!!!!  I liked how Percy did anything to save his mother!!!!!:):)
B0052RDHTM|5|Ken and his research folks really helped me &#34;get Inside&#34; history with Book 1.It is truly wonderful the way he writes. I have been a fan since &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;.
B000BW7QWW|5|The movie picks up only months after the last chapter of the series, which helps to maintain the continuity of the story arc. Some of the crew have left; Shepherd Book is now running a commune, Inara is teaching at the \\"Companion\\" training school. But the major plot is that the Alliance wants River Tam in the worse way, and has sent an assassin to find her. He will stop at nothing to obtain his prize. I won't give away too much, but I will put it this way, River does possess some serious skills when threatened.<br /><br />To fully appreciate the last 1/3 of the movie, you should watch ALL of the series. You will understand.<br /><br />Contrary to what other reviewers have stated, this isn't the end. Joss Whedon wants to make more big-screen chapters of Firefly. He is busy right now working on Wonder Woman, but plans on returning to the good ship Serenity.
B00005OAIE|5|I like all his music
B000SO7OMA|5|As a big fan of this woman for a dozen years, I was excited to hear she put out this DVD. I had never seen her perform. She only had one previous DVD with a half-hour of music, which I felt wasn't worth the purchase , but this was a bargain considering one also gets two CDs.    Anyway, the main thing is the concert and how it looks on DVD....and I have no complaints. This is \\"first class\\" all the way.  The setting is beautiful, the muscians are talented and Loreena's voice sounds as beautiful as ever.  I enjoyed listening to her speak briefy before most of the songs.  She has a very soothing presence and this DVD concert is just the ticket if you want to spend a really mellow, enjoyable evening of outstanding music.    I've played this three times in the two weeks I''ve owned it, and it gets better every time!
0385349947|5|Quick read, incredibly well written as if the author is sitting in front of you sharing her views. Great insights into how women sabotage their own efforts and great insight into ways to feel empowered as a woman in the work place. Have recommended to a number of friends and requested my husband read it as well. Thoroughly enjoyed!
B002C949KE|5|This is an &#34;Ah-Ha&#34; book--you read it and scratch your head and say, &#34;Ah-Ha--I get it!&#34;  Very interesting to understand the psychology behind the decisions we make in everyday life,and then to be able to apply the theory to how you live your life.  My 20 year old son recommended this book and I really appreciated sharing that with him.
B000L53D4O|4|Got this second-hand from a mom friend. My 10 month old twins aren't quite ready to use it for walking, but it folds down into a toy and for easier storage. Unlike other huge, bulky, loud walkers with all kinds of electronic stuff going on, this is a simple design with interesting things for them to do now with it folded down, then pop it up in a little while for them to use as a walker. I love the simplicity and lack of extraneous gizmos.
B00K7IPGS6|3|Like the movie, but the cost of Blu-ray should be discounted not having a DVD disc included just as all the other X-Men movies. Also, why go through Fox in order to redeem a code for digital HD?
B000N6TX22|3|I can explain \\"Children Of Men\\" like this. You meet a beautiful girl and she says all the right things, you take her out to dinner and the meal is great and of course she looks very good as well. Midway through the night you go back to your place and then she falls asleep. You never can wake her up and you start to wonder where you are and why you're in this situation. Ultimately you're very unsatisfied with your date.     That is how I felt watching \\"Children Of Men\\". It had the right idea and the story was unique. Visually I liked how the movie presented itself and in High Definition it looked spectacular. They painted a bleak and hopeless existence just twenty years in the future. The beginning of the movie was setup nicely, but somewhere along the way the train went off the tracks and it just leaves you sitting there with no place to go. Well, you have an idea of where you should be going, but this film never takes you there.     Clive Owen's performance is hit and miss. For most of the film his is left with a deer-in-headlights look on his face, which is probably really realistic, considering there are bullets whizzing by his head 99% of the time. In retrospect he did what he could with his character, who is basically on the run and has no real given purpose. The highlight is when he knocks the guys off the motorcycle with his car door, that was a cool little part that I enjoyed.     The ending is a complete waste and to me it seems like a cop-out. It's as if the screenwriter and director had no idea where to go next, when they were out of the warzone, so they just leave the movie floating, literally.    Like I said, overall it's got the right idea but it gets lazy and never explains itself. What could have been extraordinary ended up being average.

B003XF1XOQ|4|Its keeps you wondering up,until the end. Very well written. many turn of events. A great tale of love, courage, and the human race. Powerful & moving.
B0000B1OE7|5|This is one of the best anime shows I've ever seen.  Definitely a classic!  Wish I had picked it up when it was in stores - but I couldn't justify the price.  Now, it's selling many times that new, so I had to settle for a used copy.<br /><br />This show is an example of the entire reason we got into anime.
B0054JZC6E|4|okay for passing the time. controls are a little iffy, but overall good. dunno why they updated, as it seems to be causing more problems than it has solved
B00003CXCQ|5|We chose this rating because after growing up with the better innocent tales which Disney created, we were so pleased to share this with our 4 year old daughter.  Think that some of Disney's newer material/films have lost their innocence of appealing to the minds and hearts of children, and yet this film stands alone with some of the better original films produced by Disney.  These appeal much more to the imagination and fantasies of childhood years and feel it's so important to let our youth have just that - their youth!<br />Since the Disney vault only releases some of the older movies from time to time, we felt fortunate to be able to obtain a copy from Micah at Eastcoasthollywood to share with our family.  She made sure that we were satisfied with the movie and that it was delivered ontime.  Thanks Micah....you helped make a little girl's dream come true!
B008JMKN4Y|4|Um...WOW!  I feel like  a tornado just blew through my mind!  This book was insanely addicting, the only thing keeping me from finishing the book in the first sitting was life (pfft who needs life anyways, right?).  I could feel the chemistry almost immediately between Abby and Travis and it kept building and building until both of the characters explode into some kind of frantic  and chaotic romance.  It was scintillating and disturbing all wrapped into one.<br /><br />Travis does have a total lack of self control, which in some parts of the books make you want to grab a sedative and inject it into his arm, because he can clearly be destructive to himself and those around him.  While it makes for a interesting read, I'd never want to meet him in person.  The books starts to slack off when Abby's past starts creeping up on her with her low life father and a one night trip to Las Vegas that ends on a crazy note.<br /><br />I would give it five stars but after rehashing some of the violence in the book and the strange ending, I have to take it down a notch.  Worth a read, but not everyone will love it!
8867322516|5|I thought it was too small at first, but it's actually a very convenient size and I don't actually have that much things to write down, just my homework/due dates/planning, plus if there are more things i can just write on the right size.<br />very useful and cute
0060599847|5|I have been involved in direct sales for several years and have been exposed to many motivational trainings and books. I have found this to be GREAT! Both educational and motivational. I have really enjoyed Jack's way of sharing his success principles and stories. He prompts you take a close look at yourself and your life, and helps you to realize that life can be MORE for YOU. This is a gift you give yourself!  The new example you will set for your friends and family, as a result, is a gift you will give to them.
0812932293|5|If you intend to be self-employed and have big ambitions about it, then this book will definitely prove to you that what one man can do another can do.  Richard Branson details how he was achieved what many people in society believe to be impossible: Improved his position on life and reached the top by working hard and by having a good instinct for what the people want based on his down-to-earth way of life.  On the other hand the story also reads, in places, like the story of a gambler who happened to get lucky, reminding me of something my father said about gambling on horses and how you only hear about the people who win.  There were a lot of incidents, in both business and in the ballooning expeditions, where he has survived by the slimmest of margins of luck.  On the other hand, parts like the postal strike almost wiping out his mail-order business and forcing him to start up the lucrative high-street retailing business show that he has an uncanny ability to turn a bad situation to his advantage. <br /> <br />On the technical side I will criticise the editing of this book.  It reads a little bit disjointed.  For example he goes into great depth about the early days of the Virgin record label for a chapter, and then in the next chapter he digresses to a record-breaking attempt.  Then in the next chapter he tells us that he was 'attempting to start a record label' as if this was the first time he had mentioned it in the book. <br /> <br />But this did not detract from the enjoyment of this incredible story of an incredible man and who's exploits get more and more audacious.  I look forward to reading the updated version when he gets around to chronicling his experiences with Virgin Rail and Virgin Galactic!
B005LAIHR2|1|When I played the DVD, the music played fine.  But when there was supposed to be dialog or solos, there was nothing. All previous DVDs on that player that day played fine.  This DVD was crap.  There is only one in the box so that must be the &#34;digital copy&#34;.  I want my money back.
B009FB3W9G|5|Exellent item.
B00AEBEQW8|5|This is a very entertaining and thought provoking book for children and adults! The letters from the crayons show a lot of character and assertive qualities that could easily be discussion points in a classroom.
B00DJYJRHG|5|A quick, easy, bullet-point review for people wondering what this set actually is:<br /><br />*29 discs (ie all 88 episodes/7 seasons) housed in a \\"double-spindle\\" set (this is the set's biggest flaw, but considering the price point it's certainly not a deal-breaker)<br />*Plastic spindles are fairly sturdy<br />*Nice, solid cardboard box that shouldn't fall apart on you<br />*Cardboard inserts kept the discs from shuffling around during transport, no scratches at all (and yes I checked them all)<br />*As far as I can tell thus far, all the extras from the previous set<br />*One of the greatest TV shows ever<br />*Amazon was selling it for less than $40 at the time I bought it (November '13)<br /><br />So there, I hope that helps anyone on the fence about this.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game it is very realistic. I am hoping to save enough gems to get the zebra. I wish it was easier to get more gems though
B0054JZC6E|1|Installed it after just a few minutes. Even for free it wasn't worth it. I wasn't expecting a great master piece but this is awful.
B000006TRV|5|Before I begin my review, I WOULD like to state this album has remained at the top of my list for \\"Greatest (rock) album of all time\\" for over 3 years now, and only now have I gotten around to expressing my thoughts in an in-depth method such as this of \\"The Wall\\" Let's jump in shall we?  First of all, the songs:  Disc 1:  Track 1: \\"In The Flesh\\"  \\"In The Flesh\\" is the bold first track off of \\"The Wall.\\" A brilliant guitar riff, loud, marching-band-esque drums, and on top of it all, Roger's excellent vocals. I find this song to be perfect for the opening of such an album as \\"The Wall\\"  Track 2: \\"The Thin Ice\\"  Let's take a break from the loud for a little, this is a very soft, mellow song composed mostly of piano and Roger's vocals, BUT around the halfway mark we delve into one of the most menacing riffs of the album to end the song.  Track 3: \\"Another Brick in The Wall (Part 1)  The song itself has no drums (which doesn't change the fact that I love the song) and is composed mainly of guitar and vocals, one of the stranger tracks of the first side of the album, but as you listen you can feel the tension creeping higher and higher. (And you know eventually you're gonna do some rocking out to Part 2.  Track 4: \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\"  Can you feel it? Can you feel the groove? I sure can, composed mainly of bass, drums, and vocals, this song is always great for pumping me up and a great prelude ABiTW Part 2.  Track 5: \\"Another Brick in The Wall (Part 2)  You can't listen to this song without doing at least one of the following: Singing along, tapping your foot, playing air guitar, and bobbing (or lightly/slowly banging) your head. Don't be afraid to let the rock out when this song comes on, I sure do. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat!?  Track 6: \\"Mother\\"  Time for a break now, a nice song mostly based on acoustic guitar and vocals (with drums and bass in the second half.) This song provides a smooth transition into the next song.  Track7: \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\"  This track combines pleasant with ominous feelings, strange harmonies, very low brass sections, and an eerie guitar riff to top it off.  Track 8: \\"Empty Spaces\\"  Empty Spaces may just be the most evil and ominous sounding song on the whole album. Mostly composed of synthesizers and pianos by the beloved Richard Wright, and eerie vocals by Roger (along with a secret backwards message) this song provides a great song transition into our next track.  Track 9: \\"Young Lust\\"  Time to boogie! One of the most rockin' songs on the album, I consider it a party anthem, but some don't agree with me. This song also has one of my favorite David Gilmour solos of all time. The song slowly decomposes easily slides straight into our next set of songs with a simple sound of a phone ringing.  Track 10: \\"One of My Turns\\"  This track is, well to bluntly put it, insane. Starting out with Pink and an \\"unknown fangirl\\" (according to the movie that is) in his trailer. The song begins fairly calm with a simple piano riff and Roger in one of his more calm voices when BAM! In your face! Roger's singing at some of the highest he'll be singing on the album. After that the song is ended by another of my favorite Gilmour solos( But who's to say they're not all my favorite?) and asking what seems to be the whole world \\"Why are you rinning away!?\\"   Track 11: \\"Don't Leave me Now\\"  This song always makes me think of Bob Geldof just laying on the ground motionless. This song has what I consider Roger's highest notes throughout the album. The song is mostly dark synth and vocals til about the last minute, when it breaks out into a wonderfully beautiful array.  Track 12: \\"Another Brick in The Wall (Part 3)\\"  Ahh yes, the conclusion of Another Brick in The Wall. There's not much I can say about this that I didn't already say about Parts 1 & 2, but it slides right into our next song.  Track 13: \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\"  A very short and simple song, but I love it. It provides a great ending to the first disc.  Disc 2:  Track 14: \\"Hey You\\"  Where to start... first, the lyrics are very inspirational (for the most part.) Starting out with only acoustic and vocals, this soon springs into a beautiful Gilmour solo and a re-visit to the Another Brick in The Wall riff. Everything about this song (and just about every other song on the album too) is a masterpiece. I couldn't think of a better song to kick off the dark side of \\"The Wall\\" See what I did there?  Track 15: \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\"  This song starts off fairly simple, a strange synth with the words \\"Is there anybody out there?\\" being sung in harmony. Afterwards,the song goes into what has got to be one of my top 3 favorite acoustic guitar solos of all time. So beautiful and melodic.  Track 16: \\"Nobody Home\\"  This song helped me get multiple roles in many different plays/musicals. This song is fairly simple, just Rick and Roger with the occasional string orchestra.  Track 17: \\"Vera\\"  Another short song, the song itself was written about Vera Lynn, an enormously famous actor (who's still around today) from the 1940's and 50's. She was born in 1917, but its an all around calm song.  Track 18: \\"Bring The Boys Back Home\\"  WOAH THERE! This goes back to the marching-band-esque style of drumming along with the entire apparatus as well, strings, brass, percussion, woodwinds, the whole nine yards, and a chorus to top it all off.  Track 19: \\"Comfortably Numb\\"  One of the biggest songs of the album, also one of the only 3 not written by Roger, the song has a very upbeat and happy vibe to it. Gilmour, being the writer, gave himself a huge, intense, melodic, beautiful solo which we all know and love.   Track 20: \\"The Show Must Go On\\"  Delightful is the first word that comes to mind when I hear this song. Starting off with brilliant harmonies, and continues throughout the same way.  Track 21: \\"In The Flesh?\\"  Didn't we do this already? Sort of, a re-visit to the first song of the album, but it's not thesame as \\"In The Flesh.\\" First of all note the \\"?\\" in the title, fancy, no? Second of all, where the first verse usually is, there's more chorus harmonies. Third of all, there are different lyrics and pauses between each line.  Roger (Pink) also calls out audience members that are smoking a joint, gay, or even have spots!  Track 22: \\"Run Like Hell\\"  Yet another party anthem. Fast tempo, loud vocals, and something about that guitar just make you wanna dance. Let's not forget the awesome synth solo by our favorite Rich Wright. Also, probably the fastest song on the album.  Track 23: \\"Waiting For The Worms\\"  More Harmonies in the beginning, this is where things start getting weird. The next are consists of Roger singing a fairly simple verse, then yelling through a bullhorn. Also, we once again receive a visit from the Another Brick in The Wall Riff, HOWEVER, this song has the riff in my favorite form, in it's deepest darkest sound. A crowd begins to chant the word \\"DOWN!\\" The song then comes to an abrupt end with the crowd and Roger screaming at eachother.  Track 24: \\"Stop!\\"  Once I finish \\"Waiting for The Worms\\" I can't stop before listening to this. So short, but so epic, Roger and a Piano.   *****SPOILER ALERT!!!  Track 25: \\"The Trial\\"  Probably the strangest track of the album, Pink's Psychotic teacher, cheating wife, overprotective mother, and the worm himself (AKA, the judge) ALL voiced by Roger. Pink is in court. I'll leave the rest to you. But after Pink receives his sentence, a crowd begins to chant \\"Tear down the wall!\\" in which the song ends with the sound of the wall being torn down and destroyed.  Track 26: \\"Outside The Wall\\"  In the end it's calm again, the same accordion tune we heard in the beginning, but with Roger singing lowly over it, a small children's choir in the background.  Very nice indeed.  Now for the album as a whole:  Replay value: 5/5  Song quality: 5/5  Engineering:  5/5  Diversity:  5/5  Artwork:  5/5  This album has a little somethingfor everyone and every occasion. Whether it be sad, happy, bored, excited, or cruising down the highway, you can always depend on \\"The Wall\\" to keep you entertained. The engineering of the album was masterful to say the least. This album also has some of my favorite Pink Floyd artwork as well, probably the strangest, but I love it all the more. You could listen to this album over and over all day every day, and not get bored of it. Truly, an album for the ages.
1484707230|5|Fast Shipping! Thanks, I can't wait to read them!
B004NOH9LC|4|Has a surprisingly great cast! Shocked this movie didn't get more media coverage when it was released. Fun, light beat, witty romantic comedy.
B00AFROVQC|2|Overall, I found this book difficult to read, despite an interesting plot and setting.<br /><br />The main characters changed rapidly from heroic and likeable to whining and horrid within paragraphs. Sometimes I felt like giving the characters a good talking to - that's how frustrated I was with the characters behaviour and internal commentary.<br /><br />I feel as though the story was too rushed. Characters didn't seem to have a chance to catch up with what was happening - Thor was in a village, then at the castle, then at the Canyon - and the events in-between the setting changes were unbelievable, like Thor being accepted into the Royal Family for using his powers during a tournament.<br /><br />I gave up on this book about 60% of the way through, disappointed with the rushed storyline and characters. I hate leaving a book unfinished but I'm just not certain I want to waste more time slogging through this book.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Ads are irritating but love it!
1609611543|5|This is T-H-E book on all you need to know about some of the bad wheat being produced today.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Loved the first one! This one is no different. Really is a great movie, and is worth watching! Happy movie night!
B009LYQE2E|3|The figure still had a chunk of plastic stuck on the chin, and there was a different splash of paint on the shirt on the back collar. That, of course, is not Amazon's fault. The box of Luffy though wasn't packed very well and was kind of loose in the shipping box. Thankfully it wasn't damaged too bad in shipment.
B00LMRKZB4|5|Nice cover for the Shield if you only need protection for the glass, or a basic stand.
B00BD99JMW|5|It was a great series and kept you engaged through every book
B007N8RULO|5|get rid of the ads and we are golden .... i like  to play anytime I have a free moment .... really good passtime game
B00IINPXLW|5|I think that this game is so cute and fun. I would highly recommend it<br />It is great for kids
B007J4T2G8|1|It bothers me so much that this is a best seller.  How is this happening?  Why are people purchasing this book?  And there's going to be movies, too??????  I can't give this a zero rating?  I have so many more questions, but if the author wasn't going to put any effort into the book, then neither am I.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is adorable and awesome, educational as well. This game is great for animal lovers like me. &lt;3 Its a must get , take it from me.: - P
B00BEK6Z7M|3|Still prefer the older stuff.  Much more suspense.
B00FMQIMZ2|5|Perfect!
B00PSID6ZK|5|It's a nice pet game...I enjoy it all the time
B004UJTG6Q|4|This was a classic which I missed somewhere along the way.  I can see why it has been been banned in some schools, because of it's racist tone, but it was true to the culture of the time.
B009UAO1ZG|4|Interesting slice of history which isn't often covered in the standard history books.  A bit long but I learned a lot about Lindbergh that I didn't previously know.
B003X73QA8|3|I'm happy this album got Album of the Year, because that demonstrates that the Grammys are paying attention to actual music again rather than image and marketability (how many years were the Black Eyed Peas \\"Best New Artist\\"?)  But beyond the symbolic significance of it, it's really not that great of a record.  In fact, just like its predecessor, it's mostly boring.  Where Funeral had energy and fun songs and gorgeous melodies, Neon Bible and now The Suburbs present dry progressions and the same, dull voice vibrato-ing like crazy in every song.  It's on my iPod, but I stopped listening to it a long time ago.
B002L4QP0M|4|A Matter of Honor is the first book I have read by this author. The beginning was slow, but once the story began to have alot of action, I could not put this book down. This is truly a great story. I will be reading more stories from this author.
B009YP9L7U|3|It's a really good book. But a little too long winded in the middle. Great beginning and great ending, way too drawn out in the center.
B002XXNSF6|3|I'm not sure how many men would like this -- it's a nice story of two people meeting on a train, getting together for one day and wandering around ...was it Budapest?  ....and talking and having experiences but not really any action.  Good for when you are in the mood for something philosophical.
B004CLYKLI|4|My book group read this book and found it interesting, sometimes disturbing, and a fasinating look into another cultural viewpoint in child rearing. Even though the author at times seemed to be overly rigid we all felt that she also had many good points in her approach and seemed to grow and even learn to be more open to her children's views. We had not expected this from the press that she had received.
B0094WK9GU|5|Great stuff from Swedish House Mafia. This was my first album purchase and I love practically every song on it. This DJ music is great and I am sad to see this will be their last tour. :-(  If you get a chance, watch the video of their song Don't You Worry Child. Great Stuff! I am getting the rest of their albums because I love this kind of music.
B000EHSVSC|5|Classic
B008Y5Q7SW|3|I had seen the movie many years ago and wanted to watch it again - seems very very dated now.
B008SAZHLQ|5|I read this book within 24 hours. That's how good it is. Rowell is hilarious and so insightful. Her words made me feel 16 again. Literally. My heart was aching and warming and skipping beats through the whole read! As if I was 16 and in love. And her main characters are deliciously perfect, aside from them belonging to a social class and a race/ethnicity not very many main characters belong to. And that is just the cherry on top an extremely enjoyable, endearingly adorable novel about young love and so much more.
B0002O7XW2|3|This is really a love story but since it's based on a book by Stephen King you aleady know that the love is dark and dangerous. In every high school there are couple of kids who are treated badly by the tribe. Arnie Cunningham is a sweet, smart kid but the local bullies are making his life hell. He has two things going for him: his imagination and his best friend, Dennis, a genuinely nice kid who is on the football team and protects him.  Arnie finds a Plymouth Fury and falls in love. The car's name is Christine and she's alive. No reason why, she just is. She talks to Arnie telepathicaly and through her radio. When she plays Johnny Ace's Pedging My Love and Arnie sighs and lays his head on her steering wheel the two are irrevocably wedded. The actor's voice changes whenver he's speaking to Christine, it becomes soft and affectionate.  Her music, when they are alone is a playlist of love songs. It's and intense relationship.    Arnie gives Christine his life, she gives devotion, protection and  one heck of a makeover. His skin improves and he no longer needs his glassses. He goes from looking like a hopeless geek to a combination of James Dean and Marlon Brando in THe Wild Ones. He attracts and takes for himselt the queen of the school, Leah. The actress playing Leah is not very good. She says her lines and that's about all I can say for her. Frankly, nobody's acting, except for Keith Gordon as Arnie, is very good. Acting is not what makes this movie.  The relationsip, the building suspense that exlodes into terror, the music both soundtrack and John Carpenter's score make the movie and does it fairly well.    Christine tolerates Leah for one hot minute but when it looks like Arnie's affection for her is getting too strong the car causes her to almost choke to death. She also settles some scores with the local punks. Anybody who crossed Arnie is getting burnt, squished, crushed and turned into roadkill. Finally Dennis and Leah try to pull Arnie from Christine's spell and end the killing. They succeed, sort of.  Other than the poor acting of the supporting cast, there are a few nitpicks. The leader of the bullies looks about 30, what the heck is he doing in highschool? The ending is too far from what was in the book and is too weak. The detective focuses on Arnie but has nothing to make his investigation legal. This isn't a great movie. It's a darkened basement TV movie and that's okay. I had fun with it.
B004UID2LC|2|Well wtf? I downloaded a video and cant actually watch the video unless I am connected to a wifi network...like cant you make an app that saves the video to my DEVICE?
B00BT70J7M|5|Heard excerpts of this recording on NPR & have found the entire album delightful - I'll be looking for other recordings soon.
B00BD99JMW|5|I loved this story. The words and actions of the characters should teach us all something about bravery, forgiveness, and endurance. Beautifully written.
0812993357|4|Outside of fashion, Grace still strikes an impressive figure. Perhaps it's her hair. Grace (2012) is the memoir of Grace Coddington, the British-born former model and current creative director of American Vogue magazine. Thrust recently into the spotlight through the documentary film The September Issue (2011) about the inside workings of the magazine, Grace is easily recognizable.<br /><br />Coddington, \\"The Cod\\", writes of her early years, her loves and lovers, her personal and professional partners, and of course fashion designers, models, celebrities, stylists, photographers, make-up artists, hairdressers, assistants, and bosses. Every aspect of the complex and complicated interconnected web of production to prop to final photograph is mentioned in an easy-to-read style, with a veritable list of who's who in the business.<br /><br />From inspiration to fully fledged photo shoot, Coddington explains how some of the most memorable Vogue features were created, and how fashion publicity has changed over time. Many of the features she describes will be instantly familiar to loyal long-time Vogue readers. As Coddington describes her favorites, from clothes to people, it will either affirm or question readers' own interests and trends, and re-ignite a passion for the retro, the past, and a much-loved piece or move readers along to the current vogue.<br /><br />Of most interest, she accompanies the text with an impressive amount of personal photographs and Vogue fashion spreads (British Vogue to American Vogue), but also with many of her own line drawings.<br /><br />Her memoir is no back-stabbing expose of everyone in the fashion business. Quite the opposite - it is a nostalgic reflection of her experiences and influences over fifty years in the business, and told with candor, humor, and extreme grace.
B008ALAHA4|2|When I ordered this from amazon it was 9.99. It's currently 9.99 on the Apple web site. Why is it listed here on 4/2/2014 for more plus shipping? That's quite odd. It's certainly a good idea to price compare. Why pay more for the same thing?
015670160X|5|&quot;Orlando&quot; is such a playful novel, full of richness of characters and commentaries. Written as a love letters of sorts to Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West, &quot;Orlando: A Biography&quot; follows Orlando from the years of Queen Elizabeth I's reign to late 1928, from the time he was a man to the time she became a woman. With this book, Woolf tried to give a fantasy life to her lover, where she could be a man and be her own person, instead of subject to society's ways. And by itself, it's such a gorgeous story! Especially with the fascinating asides where Orlando is addressing the reader.

B008ER9QLK|5|This Blu-Ray version of the Ring is stunning. Having seen it live at the Metropolitan Opera I would like make two observations: 1) in spite of all the hoopla about the staging this is a conservative production for the most part adhering faithfully to Wagner's conception, and 2) the video experience is quite different from seeing it live.<br /><br />Unlike the opera house, the video creates an amazing sense of intimacy with the singers through extreme close ups where faces sometimes fill the widescreen in dazzling, if sometimes unflattering, detail.  I often forgot I was viewing a live performance on an opera stage and felt I was with the singers in Wagner's fantasy.  These close-ups focus attention on the acting abilities of the singers, most of whom I felt were excellent, though some were less successful. The audio quality (more on that below) favors the voices and enhances this feeling of intimacy.  In general there are much more of these intimate visuals than full stage ones.  One does lose some of the sense of the overwhelming presence of Nature in these operas that I believe the much maligned staging successfully conveyed in the opera house.  All the scenery is done through light projections upon a movable platform, some giving the illusion of three dimensions, and this worked well for me when attending the performances, often so well that they distracted me from the performance itself.  Seen close-up in the video, the projections lose some of their effectiveness, especially when the spotlights that follow the singers overwhelm the background.  Also the projection details are blurrier, particularly so in Siegfried where they are extensively used, and where, because of this, some of the illusion of three dimensionality is lost.  However for me these are minor quibbles in an otherwise great video. The projections tend towards realism (often hyper-realism) rather than abstraction and for the most part I find them very effective.  But in the end it is the incredible visual intimacy which I found to be more compelling than in any other video version of the Ring I have previously viewed (Boulez, Levine, Barenboim, Mehta).<br /><br />The Blu-Ray offers DTS HD Master 5.1 and PCM sound. I have only listened to the DTS choice. BUT there is something odd about the audio quality. The balance favors the voices. They are crystal clear, beautifully so. Yet I feel the voices lack authentic stage presence. When the singers turn their heads or move about there is little if no differentiation in the sound they project, something one would expect from distantly placed microphones and normal in all other live opera videos I have. There is also little or no stage noise. Because of that I suspect the voice audio was recorded from microphones the singers were wearing specifically for the recording. This also may have been a way to virtually eliminate the recorded sound of the stage machinery which so many complained about at the live performances.  The effect is subtle and not very distracting and enhances the feeling of intimacy described above, especially in the long monologues.  Has any one else noticed this? I generally prefer that the orchestra be favored over the voices in Wagner and was disappointed at times.  An example is the Ride of the Valkyries scene where I believe the orchestra is the main actor, not the singers.  However the sound, at least to my ears, becomes more balanced in the quieter sections and the orchestral detail I hear is simply amazing.<br /><br />I rate this video version of the Ring higher than the original Levine version because of the superior sound and Hi Def picture quality.  The Mehta Ring was interesting but the weirdness of the production has worn me out.  I've always loved the sound of the Barenboim version and look forward to hearing it on the forthcoming Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />If I haven't focused on the quality of the musicianship it is because I don't feel qualified to make definite musical judgments.  I'll leave that to other reviewers. I can only say what I like and I LOVED viewing and hearing this production, both live and on the Blu-Ray video.  I highly recommend it to fans of the Wagner Ring but enjoin them to see it live if they can.
B00L436E7A|3|This is a well-made game. Nice, sharp graphics. Smooth control. Free from malware. Runs fine offline. Exit cleanly. The game itself probably deserves a five.<br /><br />Once you've had your fun mastering all the tricks, however, it becomes a little boring. The missions allow you to earn TrueCredits (the in-game currency) to customize your skateboard & unlock further missions, but the amount you can earn seems to be far short of the requirements. You get dozens of TrueCredits for completing the free missions, but the ones requiring unlock can cost thousands! Changing the colour of your wheels alone cost thousands! And did I mention your skateboard is subject to wear & tear, and that repairing it cost a thousand too?<br /><br />While they are not selling you TrueCredits, but only selling certain &#34;extra items&#34;, for me it's just a sneaky way to force you to spend. You only get ONE location for the $1.99 regular price; the rest all need to be purchased with real cash. This is just a step up from bait-and-switch. I call it hook-and-fleece. They should have either released this game for free, then make money from the IAP, or charge $2.99-$3.99 and throw in all the works.
0553277472|1|This book is NOT deep, and it appears only shallow persons think it is. <br />The earlier reviewer is correct:  He clearly states he received electroshock treatments against his will, and this tome appears to be his attempt to prove he wasn't mentally ill.   <br />He was, and the book makes no sense.
B00DR0PDNE|5|We recently ditched cable. And had computer hooked to the tv for streaming. It was a pain to keep the babies fingers off the computer lol however with this I can cast programs from say popcorn time to my tv while computer is up on the table away from little hands. Wish Amazon prime was available with chrome cast but everything else works with it. And since it can plug into your tvs USB port there is only ONE cord my tv cord :) minimalists dream :)
B00F35B8F8|4|Anyone that has seen any of the other ST movies will see the similarities with this plot. But still, the action is nonstop and it is a must see.  I would have given 5 stars but the quality over internet for an hd movie wasn't all that great.
B000002U82|5|The most important thing about this fantastic album is that it could be perfectly been made today. 30 years after been published it sounds really clear (Alan Parsons had something to do).<br />Not only would I mention the technical quality of this recording. This is a collection of ten songs or themes, but it sounds like a huge orchestral suite. In fact they were two. I don't know what would Roger Waters and his mates would do in the present using CD's and not two sided LP's (?).<br />Listening to &quot;Speak to me&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; is like an introduction of the symphony. It's the mere ouverture. The preparation of a &quot;high fidelity first class travelling set&quot;.<br />The second movement (and movement is the word) is for &quot;On the run&quot;. Fantastic emotions, impressive music.<br />The third movement is a song: &quot;Time&quot;. Time for the lyrics, time for Roger Waters and his philosophy of life and how time is always wasted. &quot;It's the English way&quot;.<br />The finale is &quot;The Great Gig of the Sky&quot;, which seems to announce death and the end of this amazing journey.<br />In the other side a new trip starts with &quot;Money&quot;. Another sarcastic lyrics but in this time it's David Gilmour's moment of glory. In &quot;Time&quot; we could listen to a collection of riffs and harmonies of this guitar guru, but in &quot;Money&quot; Gilmour is as his best: I think his technique is perfectly comparable to Jimi Hendrix's.<br />Nick Mason introduces the calm athmosphere os &quot;Us and Them&quot;. It's a incredible song which mixes perfectly quiet moods and relaxing saxophone with strong pieces of desperation.<br />Next, &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; is another prove of Gilmour and Wright talent. &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, finally is a fine poem of Waters which leads to the &quot;Eclipse&quot;. The story ends as it started. (Sorry, I haven't really told the end of the story).<br />&quot;I've always been mad. I know I've been mad, like the most of us. Very hard to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad&quot;.
B00L9B7IKE|4|I had some trouble with the author's ever changing points of view. The story is quite good though.
1878424505|2|At the risk of sounding trite and petty, I don't believe this book is worth reading.  I had high expectations due to so many great review however I failed to see the profound value in reading it.  Principles are basic and wordy.  Metaphors and references are superficial and overly simplistic.  Book was an easy read, and brought some concepts to mind but book was not worth buying.
B00701L5XS|4|I think this has all the knots that I will use.
B00007L4MJ|5|This time a German silent film, very convoluted, very difficult to watch. Hard to follow, chopped up over and over by movie director's who had no idea of what they were doing. Long film, requires concentration and a quiet room. I can see some early historical Nazi references in the film, long before Nazi's were invented. It's a tough film, very hard to follow along in many areas. The costumes are great, the actors movements at times can seem comical and silly, but this only due to the age of the film and the (I think) due to the type of film and cameras used at the time?.<br /><br />There is a lot of insight into Big Business and the workers acting like drones. Fruitlessly manning their positions only to be killed in horrible ways, slaves to uncaring management. This film has many references to our modern world, a young man whose father has built a corporate empire on the backs of his employees, the price of un-measureable success and wealth, a lost, lonely boy, the owner's son, employees who are not recognized for their efforts, long time devoted employees fired for a supposed cause. Employees, who stand by unaffected while their fellow employees are killed. This film requires more than (1) viewing, it also requires patience and a true love of silent films. I have only watched about 1/4 of the movie, it takes a lot to follow along and more to understand the message, but it is well worth watching.<br />It's a tough film to watch and absorb, but this in no way diminishes the fact that this film is a real masterpiece for its time and an intense undertaking by all the cast, costumers and its original production crew and director.
B00DR0PDNE|5|When there is nothing else on worth watching I turn to this and either youtube videos or netflix. Worth the money spent.
B00FAPF5U0|4|The wheel is my only complaint. You NEVER get the jackpot. Why tease us with something we won't ever get? Otherwise great game.
B001DM1VXE|1|I could not watch more than 10 or 15 minutes at the most of this dreadful film. Black & white format with terrible camera work was made even worse by the incomprehensible story line. I couldn't figure out what the he** was happening and, frankly, after a while I couldn't have cared less.  They could call this \\"intro to a migraine\\" and it would be more descriptive.
0446580848|5|Like many others here. I stumbled on my first Nelson DeMille book, when :\\"the Lion\\" came out, I love mystery and intrigue, and  John le Carré used to be a favorite. I Loved ! the Lion ! and from there, I went back and read every Nelson DeMille book I could get my hands on (16) and just finished The Panther. His John Corey character is one of my favorites, but all his books are well written.<br /><br />The Panther Brings the John Corey character back. I love how DeMille Develops his plot, and makes nice bite size chucks to read, and of course with John Corey and Kate (the perfect marriage), it has me laughing while I read. Lots of action, and wondering what will happen next. With this series I dont want it to end...<br /><br />His Books have all been great, I just wish we could find someone who could transfer what is in DeMilles books, to the big screen. The Generals daughter was a good effort, but nothing compares to the books.<br /><br />I am always looking forward to his next book!
B008XG1X18|4|This is my favorite app on my Kindle Fire.  I like the assortment of categories and the layout of the pins.  The only downside is it often is not responsive when I try to open it.
B000KJT8IG|5|Buy this and chill out have a laugh remember the good times.<br /><br />They don't make movies like this anymore. A must own no doubt.
B005ZUR724|5|This game is amazing the graphics, the dungeons all the way to the characters themselves I love everything about this game I really do and I  believe you would to. Thrilling pack game with all types of people to talk to. The only thing I wish to start seeing is pets you can use in battle.
B00DR0PDNE|3|The reason I bought this was to stream the internet to our tv.  This item was not bought to stream Netflix to our tv, so I did not try out this feature.  Streaming the internet was the main reason, which you have to have the Google Chrome browser, then the Chromecast app to stream.  It does work, but is very &#34;blocky&#34; and slow, but this is still the beta version for streaming &#34;all&#34; internet content.  As I stated, I did not try to stream Netflix, our dvd player does that.  My wife likes to watch internet tv, since we no longer have cable, and she now must connect a HDMI cable from her laptop to the tv in order to &#34;stream&#34; internet tv to our tv.
B001NLKWLW|5|This is probably the best book I have read in a long time. It kept me on the edge of my seat through the entire book.  This author  was awesome. I am going to read more of her books.
B000HKW7E0|5|This is absolutely, positively the best Christmas comedy of all time.  It takes a somewhat less than average family and shows you their issues, etc during the holiday season.  I've watched it every year for the last 15 years or more.  You will not be disappointed if you enjoy a good laugh.  Merry Christmas!
B00CO4GO7I|5|Liked very much
B0090EIILU|2|i kept falling asleep i thought it was gonna keep me dying laughing.... i do like sacha baron cohen as a comedic actor but this movie just didn't do it for me!!
1595827684|4|Mass Effect is a beautiful and fully realized universe, and this book of the art is fascinating to look through.  It's really amazing to see paintings of the familiar places you explore in the game, and a lot of the character design sketches are intriguing, shedding light on to characters' inspirations and intended affect.  The art on the Illusive Man, Thane, and especially Tali Zorah are all deeply interesting to examine.My one complaint is that the work doesn't have enough of these half-finished ideas that artists toyed around with.  Too often the paintings are simply of what is in the game already, and not of what could have been in the game but wasn't.<br />I like Art books because I like to see the creative process and different abandoned ideas.  And to a large extent, this offers that.  I just... wish it had given a little more.
1932907009|5|I've read dozens of screenwriting books and SAVE THE CAT is at the top of my list. Blake's Beat Sheet offers fantastic guidelines for the placement of key scenes in a script. Also, the section on loglines helps you boil down your story to an idea that just might sell.      His section on THE BOARD: helped me figure out a way to deal with hundreds of colored note cards that I can't seem to organize properly.     From his writing, Blake sounds like a \\"people person.\\" The style is very conversational and makes for an easy read. I applied Blake's lessons to my own script and discovered many \\"AHA\\" moments. I've been reading his website to learn more. I also purchased his second book: SAVE THE CAT GOES TO THE MOVIES and his software. - Just can't get enough of this stuff.      If you already know the basics of structure, and how to create a dramatic and emotionally charged scene, this book can serve as a great tool to build your story's journey. If you're just starting out, you can also make it the first book you'll ever need on screenwriting, it will certainly help you create a compelling tale.
0439023521|5|Yes, I'm late to the game. But I finally read it, to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />WOW! I loved it, and I loved the three lead characters. The story was fast-paced, suspenseful--and even romantic. Ms. Collins drops the reader immediately into another world, one so different from mine, yet believable and vivid nonetheless.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the rest, in spite of inadvertently coming across a few reviews with spoilers on the ending. ): Maybe if I wait a few months, I'll forget that part!
B004JN1CW4|4|This book was good, and a lot happened. It was definitely intense and heart stopping at moments and I can't really say anything bad about it except that the first two books were just slightly more better. It is still a very good read and chapters and pages you can't seem to stop reading, as Deshner is a fabulous writer taking you to WICKED HQ or surrounded by savage beasts who were once normal people with normal routines... I could read the maze runner and the scorch trials over and over for a hundred years, but this just wasn't as amazing as those two books BUT you must read it because it's the third book!!
B009FZFONO|5|I've always enjoyed a good horror flick now and then, but movies (ot television shows for that matter) with Zombies wasn't one of my favorites, until I heard my co-workers talking about the television series &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;. For the first two seasons, I kept hearing about it until half way through the third season, I was convinced to watch it. I watched the second episode of the third season - from that one show, I was hooked. I purchased the first, second and third season shows. For some reason, I found the story intriguing. The time, setting and locations are so realistic. I always put myself in the show's predicament and wonder how I would handle the situation in order to survive. As of this writing, I'm in Walking Dead withdrawal, and I'm anticipating the continuation of the third season!
B000E1ZBFY|5|I love this movie!!!  I have watched it several times already.  It is so inspiring and well done.  Great camera work and picture quality.
B00BEIYMTW|5|To clarify, my first Blu-Ray Disc--purchased all the equipment--Sony 5.1 Surround Sound, totally HDMI/Optical Cable support w/55 inch Sony HD 1080p<br />3D receiver and BD Player. Can also plug my iPhone into the receiver to enable its functions. So...Today was the test! Never have I seen or heard such faultless Video and Audio! Had to keep reminding myself that this is a cartoon! Based on the Cars DVD's just elevated! But equally well done! The detail is incredible and sound is superb. Invest the $ in a good AV System before purchasing a BD, but don't let that stop you from getting the DVD! Good family fun! Thanks again Amazon!
B00GI8AMI8|3|I guess I am a lousy player
B003G4W49C|5|A lot of truism woven into this story, beautifully disquized as Science Fiction. Loved the whole story,  seems I read Enders Game in a collection of short stories oh so many years ago. Now I can`t wait to see the movie, which is never as good as the book!
B00IVDXAN2|1|This is not a glitter print on the gloves, but glitter that sheds everywhere, in eyes, in mouths, on clothes and floor.<br />There is no twinkling sound, and not even a song that plays, just a few notes.  These are definitely hazardous, girls didn't like<br />wearing them, they are not worth the cost.
B00C74SHRK|2|Too many words, it goes on and on, without getting to any point.
B003O86FMW|5|Could not put this book down.  Just as you are thinking I will just read this chapter at the end of the chapter something grabs you in the last paragraph in that chapter and you have to keep going.  I have to admit I could not read this book at night because I dreamed about it all night.  Just starting the next book.

B00942G4UA|5|Very informative and interesting information from a credible journalist without a bias or an axe to grind.  We get a lot of confusing information about what is good and what is healthy. It can make the grocery store a confusing maze. I have changed how and where I buy my food.<br />  I feel empowered now and healthier already. Not bad from a movie that was also very enjoyable to watch.
B00G2BAO98|4|Good n quirky
B00DRPVE3M|5|Addictive and fun for all ages! The competition is challenging against all levels of skilled players! Tournament rounds are even more entertaining than playing the actual card game!
B000002LCB|5|This CD is a wonderful and delightful soundtrack from the original music.  The music follows the order of the movie, and when you listen to it, the movie also rolls through your head.  I was very pleased with the entire transaction including timing, shipping, and follow-up with Amazon.
B00AIQP9DE|4|So far so good....great graphics. Cool story line.
B00DAXXO98|5|My wife and I were hooked on House of Cards immediately.  The show is wonderfully written, rich in provocative characters and fascinating in its interweaving of a wide variety of story lines.  Can hardly wait to get through Season 1 so we can start in on Season 2.
B00L8OBCQS|1|It does not seem to be a movie about some past history....it is about camera angles and blood splashing.  The original was awesome and for a lot of people, this will also be great.  For me...it was just a bunch of battling, slow motion blood spatter.....and a bunch of other stuff that men and boys will LOVE.  Not so much for me.
B00EVLU2F2|2|After listening to this album, it made me seriously question if I really am a Goldfrapp fan.  Supernature is my all time favorite album from the group. To this day, I still love every single song on it! I wasn't blown away when I previewed the songs for this one, but I still downloaded it with the hope that maybe the 30 second clips where just poorly chosen... No, they were perfectly chosen, and that's a bit unfortunate.<br /><br />Every song, with the exception of Thea, sounds exactly the same. Her voice is beautiful, and the music is &#34;pretty,&#34; but unless you spend hours looking for the hidden meanings within each song, there isn't really any drama or intrigue to the album.  The songs slowly build to a hinting of electro-glam, and then end. You then start back at the bottom and start over with the next song.<br /><br />It's as if something is missing from each song.
006029129X|5|My kids all love Harold and the Purple Crayon...we've been reading these books for years! I highly recommend them, as they are simple, yet have more intricate stories woven in...I highly recommend this to anyone with children between the ages of 2-7 or so...
B00R0K7VF0|4|While this latest novel by Kazuo Ishiguro is, perhaps, less successful an effort than &#34;The Remains of the Day &#34; or &#34;Never let me go &#34;, it still arrives at a conclusion that is moving, and typically bleak.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Candy Crush is a fun and challenging game that I play with and against my children. my youngest daughter suggested I play. She is almost to level 400!!! I am way back on 37!  You'll never regret playing this wonderful game!!
B003R0LBVW|5|Nothing complicated in terms of action or plot, but the relationships were fascinating. Family relationships and how they develope and intertwine were beautifully portrayed.
B00CX7TOOG|5|i like good action movies and im glad it came on time, it was at an awesome affordable price, yes i recommend it
B003B02O14|4|The Partner is an interesting read, it keeps your attention and is unique spin for a mystery novel. This is not Grisham's best but it is still very good. I would recommend it!!!
B006N9KFPC|5|and more.  It was well worth the wait, over a year, to get this album of new and exciting music from Adam.<br />This is an album to listen to from the first song to the last.<br />Great if your exercising, walking, or running,in your car. It starts out easy, fast, builds up(love Nile Rogers and Sam Sparro on Shady) and then cools you down with his amazing vocals, and his feelings come through on every song.  This album is, sincere and written from his heart and soul, for the masses, great for radio and everything you could ever want!
B001UV4XJ2|5|I saw the rating was bad for harry potter on here then I learned it was because people hate the ultraviolet blu ray. Well, I never use my digital copies anyway because I feel they take up too much space on my Laptop so I don't even bother. I dont watch movies on my computer anyway. The Blu Ray has a great picture and sound also has wonderful amount of bonus material.

B008AWBQGW|5|This review is based on the Special Edition, which includes 4 bonus tracks & expanded packaging. It is not a review of the \\"Special Fan Pack\\" which includes 2 other bonus songs. It can be obtained through Amazon or Best Buy. As far as the music goes, this is very guitar oriented, 100% Pure American Southern Rock of totally BRAND NEW MATERIAL, from Skynyrd.<br /><br />I don't understand how any band can be more of a \\"Southern Rock Band\\" than Skynyrd. Skynyrd is the \\"Standard\\" when it comes to \\"Southern Rock\\". They were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. I've been a fan ever since they first came out in the early 1970's. I still have concert ticket stubs from the \\"original\\" Ronnie Van Zant version of Skynyrd. I've seen all the various line-ups through the years, and I've always loved every version of Skynyrd. I've heard all the pros & cons about Skynyrd sounding like \\"Country\\", & \\"Country\\" sounding like Skynyrd, but to me, Skynyrd is as Pure of an American Southern Rock Band, as you can get. Their songs are for all hard working Americans, North, South, East or West, and also for their many fans in other countries. Their songs address \\"real life\\" issues\\". Like Artimus Pyle once said, \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd is about the Real World\\", and that tradition continues in this new release.<br /><br />The 4 Bonus Tracks on this Special Edition include:<br /><br />12.Poor Man's Dream<br />13.Do It Up Right<br />14.Sad Song<br />15.Low Down Dirty<br /><br />This is the first Skynyrd Album (other than the Original Muscle Shoals Album), that does not include the late/great Billy Powell on keyboards. However, his  replacement, Peter \\"Keys\\" Pisarczyk, formerly from various versions of George Clinton's Parliment/Funkadelic Band, does a good job of playing keyboards for Skynyrd. I've seen him perform \\"live\\" with Skynyrd. He plays a Black Piano, in respect for Billy Powell, who always played a White Piano. Although there are no extended piano solos on this new album, Peter's piano playing is somewhat featured at the beginning of \\"Ready To Fly\\", & on the bonus song \\"Do It Up Right\\". Also, another change included on this album is a brand new bass guitar player, Johnny Colt, formerly from the Black Crowes. Also, you get some recording session guitar playing from \\"John 5\\", who has performed & recorded with Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, & Others.<br /><br />To me, this album is somewhat similar to the Skynyrd Album \\"The Last Rebel\\". It does not contain the \\"political messages\\" that were included in the \\"God & Guns\\" Album. Although it is Brand New Material, it does contains some references back to earlier versions of Skynyrd. For example, in the song \\"Last of a Dyin' Breed\\", it includes references to the song \\"Travelin' Man\\" from the past. Another example is \\"Mississippi Blood\\", it is similar to the song \\"Mississippi Kid\\" from the \\"Pronounced\\" Album. The song \\"Something To Live For\\" includes the words \\"No, I'll Never Change\\", which is similar to the part of \\"Freebird\\", which includes the lyrics \\"And This Bird Will Never Change\\". Overall, this is a VERY GUITAR ORIENTED album. Skynyrd still has that POWERFUL 3 GUITAR ATTACK, this time with Gary Rossington, Rickey Medlocke, & \\"Sparky\\" Matejka.<br /><br />In the liner notes, there is a statement remembering all the previous members of Skynyrd, who have passed on. They include: Ronnie, Allen, Leon, Billy, Steve, Cassie, Jo Jo, Ean, & Hughie. I was a personal friend of Jo Jo Billingsley (an original backing singer (Honkette), in the pre-plane crash version of Skynyrd. She will be greatly missed.<br /><br />I'm going to see Lynyrd Skynyrd live in concert tonight, August 24, 2012 in Bossier City, Louisiana. I'm really looking forward to it. \\"Can't Wait\\". I hope this review has been helpful. Thanks!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. Well I saw Skynyrd last night in Bossier City, Louisiana on their \\"Last of a Dyin' Breed Tour\\". I got to stand near the front of the stage. They started the show with the song \\"Last of a Dyin' Breed\\", and they also performed the song \\"Good Teacher\\" from this album. The concert was \\"awesome\\". The newer members did an outstanding job. The new bassist Johnny Colt, did a phenomenal job on the bass, he had a beard, and wore a hat with a Rebel Flag on the front. His style was a lot like the original Skynyrd bassist, the late/great Leon Wilkeson. This was one fantastic concert, one of the best I'm seen since I last saw Skynyrd with ZZ Top ,last year on thier \\"Rebels & Bandolieros/Skynyrd Nation Tour\\" of 2011.
0783225733|5|always a great movie. I remember when this even happened. I was in 5th grade and remember how the whole world was caught up in it.
B0086449YA|4|Good, not great IMO. I loved &#34;Get Lucky&#34; With some more listening time it might grow one me. Mark is still one of my favorite artists.
B00002N9ER|1|Disappointed... all three sets I bought broke after using. Too brittle with little flex. They do not last :(
B001XRLWPQ|5|great
B000FC1HBY|5|Game of Thrones is an amazing story. George R. R. Martin is a brilliant writer and storyteller. His characters seem real and believable. I just started book 3. I am absolutely hooked on this series.
B00004SCX6|5|I think this album rocked.  I cannot stop listening to it.  Lucky is my favorite song and has a great sound.  It is so so sad how much people cannot appreciate her for her music and have to trash everything else about  her.  If you liked the first album then you should definetly buy the  second.  Britney Spears is an amazing vocalist and artist.
B009MF5BXK|3|lots of action, more body count than the first one. if you like action and body count you will like this movie.
B00BR476TG|1|Show portrays that you can worship God through several religions.  It makes a mockery of our one and only God.  Would never recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|1|never worked
B007IXWKUK|5|I never thought I would be into these books like I am. I am a lover of murder mysteries and this book has me captivated by it. It is well written and I find myself unable to put it down. Can't wait to read the last one.

1476746583|5|Loved it..good book group selection
B00688628M|5|This is a moving, graphic, seemingly accurate portrayal of 101st Airborne during WWII.  Great character development.  Based on the book by Stephen Ambrose.  Made in 2001.
B0063IH60K|1|This game was boring, it had no instructions on how to use it, and once again very boring, I have already removed it from my pad.
B00009ZYC1|5|One of the best movies ever made.  Our family owns all three releases - makes for a great evening, rather than watching something not intended for children on TV.
0761119752|3|The book is fun to read when you make up your own rhythm.  But we don't approve of calling unique pajamas \\"strange\\" and having others leer at uniquely clad individuals as though they were weird.  We changed the wording and picture in the book a bit to teach our child tolerance.
B00005JL78|4|First of all, I am a \\"half-fan\\" of Speilburg.  He has a keen eye and good dramatice sense.  However, he gets into gross humor, and  that can destroy a film.<br />Anytime you deal with prohecy and deastiny, you are going up aganst Shakespear's play Macbeth.  THis film does a good job of holding up against the Bard, and I think their expelebation about predestination, determinism was the most concise I have seen: <BR>\\"Why did you catch the ball?\\"<br />\\"It was going to fall.\\"<br />\\"How did you know, since it didn't?\\"<br />I think the effects were beautiful, from the 3-d home videos and the Tron llightcycle cars to the breakfast cereal box.  Speilburg understands that the effects are not a move, but just aids to storytelling.<br />This move is really a tribute to Orson Welles obscure film \\"The TRial,\\" starring Anothny Perkins and filmed in Ygoslavia and PAris.  See the film , and you will see the similarities.<br />What bugged me were the gross jokes.  In fact, the second half of the film was devoted to gross joke after gross joke. ...P>For example, the eye jokes got old after a while.  Everyone knows that amputatum need to be freezed to be preserved.<br />And what about the mouldy sandwich joke?  This was more like something out of the Three Stooges.  It did nothing for the plot, and was an out of place gag to get cheap thrills<br />I also thought Max Von S's slip that revelaed that he was guilt was also rather predictable and hacknyed, though his actins, as always, is superb!<br />SO, I reccomed reading Macbeth and seeing Welles' \\"The Trial,\\" as better choices.
B0086700CM|5|some people say that this review is fake but this is for a person that truly truly loved this game so for the people out there I love this game
0393035158|5|I never thought I would live through times when the moderates would be part of the problem and not the solution.  I'd always suspected that the monotheists, regardless of persuasion and intensity, were breeding unhealthy mental states.  I'm now convinced.  This was a brilliant book; one that I will refer back to many times in the future.
B0051UP5NQ|1|The app works well on my Kindle Fire HDX for entering text in a document. It works well listing documents I have on Google Drive or Drop box. Every document appears on a list. Not one of them would open. Documents created on the app won't open, no matter in what format saved. I consider my cost a total loss. I will remember the provider.
B00EDUTGB2|5|Used app with my Kindle Fire HDX, works great No issues using it with the printers in our network. Very happy with the app.
B003XF1XOQ|3|This book had me hooked, expecting things to change for better every next page. That is why, for me, its missing two stars, needed more info, more pages of the nice parts.

B00IVFC6QC|5|Love it
B0031KC8OC|5|Great characters!  I think I like Season 2 more than 1 but enjoyed all 3 seasons.  Veronica Mars is your modern day Nancy Drew but with a bit more humor.  Very witty!
B00K25GL7Y|5|I'm enjoying this as much as I enjoyed 2014. I'm really glad they have this for Kindle. Feed my addiction, lol
B0064X7FVE|3|Only reason I go this for the kindle fire was because local weather app does not support android but it's ok
B000R7GKQE|5|This product was shipped quickly and in excellent condition.  Keep up the great work Amazon.
B00004TRD8|5|Great acting(even Arni), great sound and a great movie. Cameron seems to be only good 'sequal' director. The 'Almost' in the title is because of; I think the best picture quality is &quot;The perfect storm'. The sound is great, only the same day I watched this DVD, I also watched 'The Rock: The criterion edition'. And that DTS soundtrack will make your neighbours move........ But really. It is absolutely a great DVD. I rate it five stars, because 4,5 is not possible and 4 is not enough
B009TGXLZM|5|A must see before or after you visit Hilltop.
B00DUGCLY4|4|It is very fun! But it is also kind of hard, so it makes you want to try harder! Love it! &eth;
B000LB7G00|4|First off, you need an alternative driver for linux machines called SpaceNavD. It's in Debian and Ubuntu repositories, i dont know about the other distro's. This also takes some time to setup in Blender.<br /><br />This thing works great as a paperweight, nice and sturdy. It works even better as a 3d navigational tool. For some it might take a little bit of a learning curve. It definitely improves productivity in a 3d environment.<br /><br />Great product.
B000BKVQTS|4|The past few years have been tough for Terry Gilliam. Amidst several false starts, including, most famously, the aborted attempt to make The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (as documented in Lost in La Mancha), the veteran filmmaker was desperate to make a movie and took a director-for-hire gig with Miramax (akin, in some circles, to making a pact with the Devil). During the course of making The Brothers Grimm, Gilliam clashed with studio honcho Harvey Weinstein over several issues: the director's regular cinematographer was fired by the studio and during the editing process an incensed Gilliam, tired of it all, left the production and went off to make another movie (Tideland). After some time had passed and the dust settled, he returned and was allowed to supervise his cut of the movie which was released in theatres and now on DVD.<br /><br />After seven years since his last movie, Gilliam fans were just happy to see another movie by the director. The Brothers Grimm is a return to the grungy, medieval worlds depicted in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Jaberwocky.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm also continues Gilliam's fascination with protagonists who are fantasts who make things up in order to escape from reality or, in the case of Jake and Will, responsibility. Those familiar with Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow will notice the similarities in plot: a village is terrorized by supernatural evil and it is up to a foppish protagonist to succeed where others have failed and prove themselves. The Brothers Grimm certainly is not a bad film, just not one of Gilliam's best, but it is still nice to see him in action. After all, Gilliam at half-strength is better than no Gilliam at all.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Terry Gilliam who is his customarily candid self in this uncharacteristically muted track from the usually animated filmmaker. He admits that when initially given Ehren Kruger's script he didn't like it but needed work and decided to do it anyway. Even though Gilliam doesn't name names, he points out what parts or the film he met with resistance from the studio.<br /><br />There are 12 deleted scenes with optional commentary from Gilliam. It is footage that he admires but that made the movie too long. Surprisingly, the most expensive scene in the movie, involving a giant tree attacking our heroes, was cut because they felt it was too spectacular and made everything that came afterward anti-climatic.<br /><br />\\"Bringing the Fairy Tale to Life\\" is a standard making of featurette with a much more upbeat Gilliam than the one on the commentary track. Of course, none of the conflicts with the studio are discussed.<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Visual Magic of The Brothers Grimm\\" takes a look at the CGI effects used to enhance the movie. Gilliam wanted to use models but some of things, like animated trees had to be rendered digitally.ven though Gilliam doesn't name names, he points out what parts or the film he met with resistance from the studio. <br /> <br />There are 12 deleted scenes with optional commentary from Gilliam.

B00DRPVE3M|5|Love the game it's very fun and you make new friends and you can play all types of way and you get a free scratch every 30 minutes
B000003NA4|5|Warm, sultry, romantic songs mixed with jazzy entertaining songs.  Never boring, a great mix.  Diana's voice is amazing. Smooth as silk, but edgy enough for the songs that need it. It's made a jazz lover out of me.   Different from the Nat King Cole remakes, but just as entertaining, and  perfect for a romantic evening at home or anytime. One of my favorites, it  never leaves the CD Player at home, with second copies in the car for that  maddening drive home.
1400049628|5|Great book, really entertaining and is great for the 20s group
B006OCM0G0|5|once again I'm happy. I looked for this game for months becuz I have it on my ipod and finally its here.it works great on my kindle with no freezing and amazing graphics so if you like farm story you will love this game too, along with fashion story and bakery story. have fun!
B002XHN776|5|I previously wasn't a huge fan of 30 Seconds to Mars. I wavered on buying this album because I wasn't sure I liked what I heard from the samples, but..........I LOVE THIS ALBUM! The more I listen to it the more I fall in love. It is pretty dramatic and not very \\"pop\\", but that's how I like my music. I just bought tickets to the \\"Into the Wild\\" concert and I am so excited to see them live!
0486409511|5|Great Book!
B0002C4JE4|5|This is a fantastic price for a classic collection.  For those just beginning their collection of James Taylor music, these are the songs that endeared him to so many people.  For those adding to their James Taylor collection, the only thing better would be sitting in the audience of one his extremely entertaining concerts.  If anyone buys this CD for a &#34;favorite song&#34;, they will be pleasantly surprised to find out they're all good.  My recommendation is if you're hesitating, hesitate no more.  Buy this awesome CD.  Your ears, heart and mind will thank you for it.
B002MQYOFW|5|Loved this book...even though I saw the movie first...books always seem to better and more informative....I devoured this book and ready to start the second
B00CWY76CC|5|In this game you have to escape from 10 rooms. Once your finishing with a room touch the elevator and it will take you to the next room. This is an awesome game.
0887307280|5|Fantastic book! This is a book with so much insight!  I loved every single part of this book! My goal is to use the principals within this book on a daily basis!
B00ATDOVNK|4|Wonderful graphics.  Excellent mix of problem solving memory and strategy hidden object.  Wish the story line has been a little more cohesive.
0790731509|5|If you are reading this, it's time to see what good movies are all about. The acting, the story, the message. When movies tried to be more than the highest dollar of the weekend. Get going.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved it and I can't wait to see the movie. I love the way it was written it makes it very easy to follow even if you are a slow reader.
B00097DX3U|5|This album has everything a great album should. \\"Out of Exile\\" has everything from classical rock, \\"Doesn't remind Me\\", to hard, fast rock, \\"Man or Animal\\" to slow rock, \\"Heaven's Dead\\". I personally think every song on this cd kicks ass.  If you get this album, be prepared to sit for hours on end listening to it. Drums are slow but hard in \\"The Curse\\" which is defenitly the best song on the album. \\"Out of Exile\\" is ten times better than Audioslave's debue. Drums, guitar, bass, and vocals are excellent and all mix together perfectly. If you appreciate great rock with amazing lyrics, guitar and drums, buy this album.
B00000K2W1|4|what can i say? this is definatly janis at her best.the slection of tracks are great. and the remastering truly breaths new life into these classic tracks.the songs are culled from janis all to brief but brillant carrer.when you listen to me &amp;bobby mcgee youll understand why kris kristofferson would say.yeah i wrote that song. but it will always be janis.
B00881VLCE|5|Nice puzzles.  Great movement of puzzle pieces.
B007J4T2G8|1|Really? I just don't see what all the hype is about. The characters are ripped from Twilight, sans myological creatures, with slightly older characters & with adult themes. I could list them, but if you've read Twilight, you already know. If I were Stephanie Meyer, I'd be pretty pissed. But after reading a bit about this book, I suppose the joke is on me, as it was originally released as a Twilight FanFiction, and therefore it was supposed to be Twilight with adult themes.<br /><br />As for the writing itself? Rather elementary, if you ask me. The characters are not at all deeply built & the descriptions leave a lot to be desired (pun mildly intended). It is quite difficult to fully picture what it happening when there are so many missing descriptions. I still don't know exactly what anyone looks like, how tall they are, etc. About 4 chapters in, I gave up and just used Edward & Bella in my head. Worked just fine. The story itself is on the surface slightly intriguing - the young virgin meets a man who spins her - but it is quite unbelievable that she would be emotionally & physically capable of what she delves into & so very successful. I suppose that could be the mythological aspect this story owns, however I do not believe it was intended to be so.<br /><br />Ah yes... and as for the sex scenes. Of any of the scenes they are only a few short sentences in length & if it were really happening - keeping in mind descriptions take longer to write & read than they would to actually perform - the scenes would only be a few short moments. I suppose it could be written in such a way that they are to be a synopsis to leave the reader's mind to wander, however given that the rest of the story isn't, I can't imagine they are (considering the whole story, in book one, took place in matter of about three weeks & is 500+ pages).<br /><br />Overall the story left me waiting for the literary climax (not physical climax, as there so many) & unimpressed. I suppose reading Anis Nin,The Sexual Life of Catherine M, Lady Chatterlly's Lover, etc has left me bored of this story. What I can say is that it is more of a story of a broken man's re-entry into the world of the rest of us & a young woman's childlike devotion to her first real crush object - who abuses her mentally, sexually, and physically, than it is about sex.<br /><br />The BDSM stuff is suitable for Cinemax, and the controlling, over bearing, raging jealousy, abusive, psychological brewhaha is suitable for Lifetime. In thinking about the themes further, it is rather disturbing that so many woman are swooning over this story. Typically when one engages in a dom/sub relationship, it is on their own decision to do so - meaning without coercion, and trust in themselves & their partner is imperative. There is no trust or real willingness here. I think there's a nasty word with grave consequences for just that situation.<br /><br />So if you want to read it so you too can feel the burn, you may very well be highly disappointed & possibly a bit angry by the encouragement of an abusive relationship. I read it because several people I know did and said it was fantastic.  I suppose I gave into peer pressure, and got burned. Now I just want my $10 back. And it kind of makes me wonder about my friends...
0895260131|5|I read this book to get a better idea of what kind of culture/religion (basically interchangeable in Islam) my wife comes from. She and I have been married for almost 2 years now, and it has definitely been a huge struggle at certain times when dealing with family issues. Her family immigrated here more than 2 decades ago from Afghanistan. My wife became a Christian shortly after we met, and was previously one of the most devout of her nine other sisters. Her family thinks she converted for me, but she had been having extremely strong doubts of Islam, and came to her own conclusions. She was kicked out of the house and ostracized from most of her family. As for us, we have been incredibly fortunate to have a church family that has become the family that we need and has been a huge support and encouragement.<br />  One of the things I appreciate about Robert Spencer is that he lays out his argument in a clear, point-by-point analysis, and he uses mostly Islamic sources to make his points (even more-so in his other book I'm reading: The Truth About Muhammad). If you have seen him on TV or on an interview, you will notice also in his writing he leaves out the emotion that can so easily grab hold of anyone addressing the atrocities of such a religion as Islam. He writes in a very level-headed fashion and does not intend to bash anyone. If a person gets offended by what he writes, it's because (1) they're muslim, (2) they believe that Muhammad and the Koran (and Hadith for that matter) are above reproach and criticism, which is ridiculous, (3) and they haven't ever doubted what they believe, because doubt is a sin in itself in Islam.<br />  Spencer makes a great comparison between Jesus and Muhammad in each chapter, showing just how polarized each figure is in what they taught. Muslims believe Muhammad is the supreme example of how to live, and there are MANY verses saying that, or saying that if they obey Muhammad, they are obeying Allah. As Christians, we believe Jesusis God. The difference however is that Muhammad wrote his own religious book, and made himself the \\"goodest\\" of all people. So if you follow his example, you will be the most \\"good\\" person you can be, which is what Islam is all about: your \\"goodness\\" outweighing your \\"badness.\\" The most amazing thing about muslims is that they also believe Jesus lived a perfect life, and even believe He was born of a virgin! So why they would regard Muhammad as more powerful and a better example to follow is beyond me.<br />  All-in-all, Americans are fed up with the Politically Correct garbage going around the US about Islam being a \\"Peaceful Religion\\", which is exactly opposite of the truth. There have been over 9,000 separate incidents of Islamic terrorist acts since 9/11/01. Like my in-laws, muslims learn everything about how to argue how Jews and Christians have everything wrong, how the Bible is chock full of translational errors because it has been translated so many times, etc. But they neglect to learn about who Muhammad really was, what kind of life he lived, why he had so many wives, why he married a 6 year old and had sex with her 2 years later, why he personally had hundreds of people slaughtered and murdered them himself at times, and why they try to hide it when you bring that stuff up!!?? It's not a secret Muhammad was a terrible person: muslims are either living in utter denial of everything they believe, or they haven't learned of it themselves. My in-laws are the Americanized, \\"peaceful\\" muslims, and my wife and I had one final \\"discussion\\" on religion during the last week of Ramadan (supposedly the time where muslims make peace with family and do other pious deeds) and two of the sisters told us they would kill us both right now if a holy war were waged... now tell me: peaceful or not?
0451529308|5|This was one of those books that I hated to see end...but the \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" brought us to some closure.  I recommend this book to every young girl to read and soak up it's good morals, Christian wisdom and thrill of adventure in the world of the March family!
B00164GDA0|5|Classic coming of age movie with excellent acting.  Serious story well laid out, no blood and gore but would be scary, even potentially traumatic for the very young, but I will find a casual way to show this movie to my grand daughter when she hits 10 or 11.
B0086700CM|5|I am only 11 and I already have half the objectives completed, more than 30,000 coins, and 5 of the 8 characters.The game gets met jumping inside when I am halfway done with the course.T=Temple and R=Run to the appetite and buy the best, 5 ***** star rated game in the U.S.A!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5|I loved this book, finished it in two days! This is a series to be read over and over again!
1401223176|5|This one is great!! Great art and a great story! Loved how &#34;Hush&#34; manipulates all the villains (even Joker) into his game. He and Bruce have a history, this history plays very much into the plot. I never read it and own many Batman novels...this one was always in the back of my mind, I was not disappointed. My wife had never read any comics and even she thought this one was cool!! YES!! I was just a big kid/fanboy/geek and now she gets it. The Catwoman/Selena Kyle and Batman/Bruce Wayne sub plot is cool too.<br />This is a must have. Pretty sure there are other Hush collections that continue so I'll certainly look them up.<br />ENJOY!!<br />-Topper
B009MJUB7W|5|as always the Schleich animals are great!
B00AQ3K8IU|5|Wow, just wow.<br />I absolutely loved this story. I can't really put my finger on any one thing that made this book touch my heart but the whole package together? Excellent! It starts off sweetly then moves and grows over a very dark subject matter. Not many people would risk writing about this type of background but I thought the book was tastefully written.<br /><br />Colleen, you have done a wonderful, heart wrenching story about 2 people who were obviously just meant to be together. The fact that they lived near each other and didn't know was so sad but life bought them back together.<br />I think because I have kids, you constantly worry about them being \\"taken\\" and I think that is what sat in the back of my mind when reading this story. I am so glad that I read this book and it will be one that stays with me for awhile.<br />I love Holder. He is a strong boy/man who has gone through so much quilt and heartache in his lifetime and never stopped feeling that he has \\"lost\\" something.<br />Sky/Hope is also a strong girl/women who has a past that would mold and shape her to be the \\"one\\" for Holder.<br />Great read - highly recommend this story.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by Colleen Hoover and enjoyed her writing style. Looking forward to reading more from this author.
1594746036|5|couldn't put it down it is as good as the first... can't wait for the next installment of this series
0307165485|5|I still have my original paperback copy, which came free with a box of Bold laundry detergant (the sticker is still on the cover), and hold it as one of my most valued childhood treasures. I'm sure my dad can recite the entire book word for word as he read it to me so often!<br />I am now 7 months pregnant with my first child and wondered how my tattered (read that as well loved) copy would hold up for my little boy.  Imagine my delight when I found that it is still in print!  I can't wait to get a copy for the library we are working on for him! Even though my little one is still in utero, my husband and I read to him every night, and will continue to do so after he's born. I can't imagine a better book to read from than Richard Scarry!<br />This book has delightful tales and rhymes that all children will love.  My favorite part about the book though is that so many of the stories are set in different parts of the world and illustrated in a child friendly manner that will make them want to learn more about the world around them (in my opinion anyway, as it certainly did for me). As we now live in Europe, I've visited many places I was first introduced to, and intrigued by, in Richard Scarry's world.  This book is an absolute must for all children's libraries.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5|Once again, I'm kicking myself for waiting two years to read something.<br /><br />While this book explores Jesus the person, not Jesus Christ, the messiah, it isn't simply about the man's life. Aslan describes the context that Jesus' movement rose up in: thanks to the Maccabees, Israel had enjoyed about a century of independence after Hellenistic rulers before infighting and ineptitude at the top created an opening for the Romans to jump into. As vicious as some of their administrators were- even Augustus expressed a little horror at Herod's excesses- the banal corruption exhibited by the priest class wasn't much better (and, in fact, it was pretty much a requirement that the priests work hand-in-hand with the governors).<br /><br />It doesn't take much imagination to realize that after centuries of war, infighting and constant political turmoil Israel was a place of Haves and Have Nots. It was the Have Nots that Jesus and the other prophets of his generation were speaking to; in other words, Jesus' message was a predominantly political one. When he called himself The Son of Man, he was making reference to an old code for King, and when he talked about the coming of The Kingdom of Heaven, he was referring to the &#34;kingdom&#34; that would be born of an actual revolution in which, literally, the meek would inherit the earth.<br /><br />Jesus wasn't the only promised messiah of his time, and his execution at the hands of the Romans (and it was the Romans, no matter how hard Paul tried to twist it later) excluded him from the title. This is why the story of the resurrection was necessary in order to keep Jesus alive (as it were). As with Jesus miracle working, I imagined Aslan stepping back from his keyboard with his hands up. As he notes, there is no historical or factual explanation for resurrection, and can't be argued along those lines. The issue is not whether it happened, but that all of his adherents came to insist that it did. This allowed Jesus the man to begin the evolution into Jesus the deity, and without this Christianity would not have taken hold.<br /><br />The throughline for Aslan is that Jesus was first and foremost a radical, rabble-rousing Jew who had specific, worldly ambitions for his fellow Jewish brethren. He also notes that Jesus was probably illiterate, as was a staggering 95%+ of the population at that time. That might explain some liberties his gospels take with the source material, although it's not clear what kind of education he might have learned from the man who would later be known as John the Baptist. As he notes, it's a tragedy that Jesus the revolutionary isn't as well studied as Jesus the messiah.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone interested in the history of religionegin the evolution into Jesus the deity, and without this Christianity would not have taken hold.<br /><br />The throughline for Aslan is that Jesus was first and foremost a radical, rabble-rousing Jew who had specific, worldly ambitions for his fellow Jewish brethren.

B000Q6GX5Y|4|In short, this movie is a veritable visual spectacle on your 1080P television.  The content of the film itself is precisely what it aims to be and it is beautifully rendered in Blu-Ray in MOST instances.  There are certain darker scenes (such as when Dilios is addressing the assembled Spartan soldiers around the campfire) that simply did not seem to translate well.  While most of the dark scenes were rendered beautifully (i.e. not a calibration issue with the television), this and a few other dark scenes, had a noticeable amount of noise (over the entire area of the picture, not just the dark area).  By fine-tuning my LNT4671f I was able to mute the effect substantially from the out-of-box settings, but this problem is present ONLY in these scenes on THIS Blu-Ray movie (I have several).  Despite this minor quibble, the movie is spectacular, with all the glorious HD fight scenes you could ask for, and is really a stellar title for showcasing what your 1080p TV is capable of with the proper input.
B00EMXBDMA|4|Enjoyable read. A story of survival,overcoming disaster,attempted rescue, and long odds, all the while describing what it takes to mount a human mission to Mars. Lots of technology is explained. Interesting, but not spellbinding. Still I enjoyed it.
B008C20TDG|5|I am now doing my second &#34;whole 30' 'detox' inside of 12 months (my first started in May 2012), and have again referred to my copy for a refresher of the basics. I have both the hard cover and kindle versions of the book so I can have its information available at all times. I use this on a regular basis, just to remind myself of various tid-bits, and gain motivation and inspiration to keep me on track to being healthy. This book is expertly written without being pretentious, and is very accessible and presented in lay-mans terms - often funny as well as the authors both have a very good sense of humour.<br /><br />It presents all the science behind the rationale for the 'Paleo' way of eating if one wishes to learn that (and I recommend that you do), but this is not necessary to get an idea of 'what' one needs to do to have a healthier, more vibrant life. It essentially presents nuts and bolts of a 30-day food detox program that I refer to as a highly strict version of the Paleo diet - in short, eating only fresh, whole food, and including NO processed food, NO added sugar of any kind, NO dairy, and NO grains of any sort (that means no pasta, rice, bread, biscuits, cakes, etc) - though there are other elements to the detox.  I know! Impossible to even contemplate for most of us right?! But it just works !!!<br /><br />The benefits are discernible almost immediately - though results will obviously vary - with weight loss, improved sleep and energy all coming in the first week in my case - not to mention the new wardrobe after losing almost 16kgs! Admittedly, I did a 'Whole 60' as the results and benefits were so impactful and meaningful for me I just kept going! - I virtually eliminated all gout pain and significantly reduced arthritic knee pain from the weight loss - pain is a powerful motivator. I am committed to completing a 'whole 30' at least once per year and maintaining a largely (though not exclusively) Paleo diet the rest of the time...I do still enjoy bread, cakes, biccies and the occasional pasta dish ! I highly recommend this book to anyone who seeks to alter their eating habits to a healthier variant, wants to lose weight, has a gout / pain issue related to obesity or would just like a basic intro to the Paleo style of living.

B0007OY2MG|5|Nominated for 1 Emmy and 1 Golden Globe in its first five seasons, Gilmore Girls has experienced much greater success among TV viewers than among industry critics. In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past... <br /> <br />Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America... <br /> <br />The Gilmore Girls (Season 3) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the season premiere \\"Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days\\" in which everyone's relationship is a source for debate. Rory and Lorelai discuss the merits of Jess versus Dean, while Lorelai's parents debate her relationship with Christopher. Meanwhile, Sookie and Jackson argue over the proper way to decorate their house... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include \\"A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving\\" in which Lorelai and Rory eat four different Thanksgiving dinners (including a tofu turkey!), and \\"Happy Birthday, Baby\\" in which Lorelai's parents are ecstatic to learn of Rory's decision to attend Yale, but Emily is angry with Richard when Lorelai pays off their loan because she thinks it will mean the end of her relationship with Lorelai and Rory... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore Girls (Season 3) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 44 (Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days) <br />Episode 45 (Haunted Leg) <br />Episode 46 (Application Anxiety) <br />Episode 47 (One's Got Class and the Other One Dyes) <br />Episode 48 (Eight O'Clock at the Oasis) <br />Episode 49 (Take the Deviled Eggs...) <br />Episode 50 (They Shoot Gilmore's, Don't They?) <br />Episode 51 (Let the Games Begin) <br />Episode 52 (A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving) <br />Episode 53 (That'll Do, Pig) <br />Episode 54 (I Solemnly Swear) <br />Episode 55 (Lorelai Out of Water) <br />Episode 56 (Dear Emily and Richard) <br />Episode 57 (Swan Song) <br />Episode 58 (Face-Off) <br />Episode 59 (The Big One) <br />Episode 60 (A Tale of Poes and Fire) <br />Episode 61 (Happy Birthday, Baby) <br />Episode 62 (Keg! Max!) <br />Episode 63 (Say Goodnight, Gracie) <br />Episode 64 (Here Comes the Son) <br />Episode 65 (Those are Strings, Pinocchio) <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00B2V66VS|5|This game has a totally new feel from the original temple run. I love the cart the explorer has to jump into (pretty challenging for me) it is so much fun. I do think some of the graphics make it a little difficult to think but the more I play, the better it gets.
B00DPM7TIG|5|The<br />Enjoyed it very much!!!
0446577391|5|Without reading any reviews, I picked up STONE COLD, and was definitely not disappointed.  This was Mr. Baldacci's best yet.  When I first started reading the Camel Club series, there were doubts on how four older men were going to provide mystery, intrigue, and adventure, but now I'm hooked.  The only down side of this book was losing a main character.  The author's other books are equally entertaining, but it is difficult to patiently wait for his new releases.  Thank you, Mr. Baldacci.
B00005QJDG|5|Dream Theater has done it again with another incredible live offering, featuring the last live performance of the entire &quot;Scenes From a Memory&quot; album, a touch of Liquid Tension Experiment, classic songs like &quot;Metropolis Part One&quot; and &quot;Learning to Live&quot;, and the first official release of live versions of &quot;A Mind Beside Itself&quot; and &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;, both in full form. The third disc doubles as an enhanced CD featuring bonus footage of &quot;Another Day&quot; and Jordan Rudess' Keyboard Solo, plus a link to the trailer for the Metropolis 2000: Scenes From New York video. This album is definately a must-buy for any Dream Theater or progressive rock fan.
B0054JZC6E|4|I love this game thank to the people who told me not to update it u guys should tell.people that before u say update it bit I really like this game bit it can get boring
B007HOD2WA|3|I compare this movie to Texas chainsaw massacre. Was gory and in some parts unreal and unbelievable. Would I recommend this movie or watch it again? probably not.
B005544TRQ|5|This show offers something different from the garden variety shows that are being offered. It isn't always predictable, and has great witty humor with a great dynamic between the lead characters.
B0054XOMX4|5|The beyblades phantom orion BD can change the modes and sping for a long time when we launch it. My Sons is loving it and playing with it.
B008Y212PI|5|Challenging, mind sharpening activity.  There are three levels of difficulty and a generous number of puzzles in each.  Great way to relax before going to sleep.  It took me over a month to complete all of the puzzles.
B00AAQRNQ8|5|My son's review: This Mouse is amazing I loved it. it is great when playing both sandbox and shooter game the weights on them are good for slowing down the mouse when you have high DPI. the mouse also slides smoothly on hard surfaces I recommend this mouse for people who don't have a lot of money for better quality.
B009UVWBMA|5|One of her beat CD's if not the best
B00002E23E|5|This dvd is the shiznit, if u havent seen it, i suggest you roll up a fat spliff, sit back with a couple friends, and watch this movie!!  All zeppelin fans will definitly appreciate this and so will any fan of good rock and roll
B004SUWR2C|1|The game wasn't as much fun as I hoped it would be. The card play takes some getting used to. Uno is more fun with real people.
B00KNWYDU8|5|I just love it
0060989157|5|Now I remember, I was there in the 1980's. I remember I had a Crue t-shirt that I totally ragged out. I remember watching M TV and Girls, Girls Girls would come on. I really enjoyed reading this book and reliving much of what was fun about the 80's. There was booze, there was drugs, and there was sex. Some of the stories seem a bit far fetched, but that is why they are so good. Just sit back, pour a glass of the good stuff (we don't drink out of the botle any more do we?), and enjoy this read.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|my 9 year old loves this game
B003VR5PPY|5|This game exceeded every expectation I had. The characters were realistic, the atmosphere was increadible tense, and the multiple endings had me puzzling a long time after I'd finished. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed the tough descisions of The Walking Dead.
034580404X|3|While I enjoyed the story, after the first book less time could have been devoted to the erotic aspect of the main characters' lives.  I found myself skipping pages!
B00I2OSPQM|5|Love all the books
B0001VTPWM|5|It's been a while since I've seen Robocop, so I picked up this DVD set. <BR>Robocop 1 is such a great movie! Watching it now is a lot better than it was when I watched it as a teenager. It was great back then, but there was so much that I didn't pick up. Watching it now from a man's prospective is a totally different experience. <br />The version of Robocop 1 in this set is the &quot;un-rated&quot; version. I would definitely keep it away from children. Some of the scenes are a lot more gory and grusome than they were in the &quot;R&quot; rated version (A LOT MORE!) and on it's own, this version is hard to find.  Robocop 3, on the other hand, is more family oriented and only rated PG-13. The violence from the previous movies has been toned down quite a bit and there is no use of the &quot;F&quot; bomb. It's a nice movie, but it does not have the same feel of the other two(or actor. Peter Weller chose not to return.)<br />These movies have aged well because they were ahead of there time when they came out. A great DVD set and a purchase that I don't regret!
B00HZ3C4N6|5|I enjoyed the movie and saw it 3 times.
B007MNV5WU|5|Love it,get ready to spend some time.  You won't want to stop playing. The best is the pig in a two wheeled cart that blows bubbles with carrots and rocks, the music is really fun. Enjoy!
B002BWP49M|4|This is the first half of the two movies that follow the last book in the series.  I thought the screen writers handled the break well.
B0086700CM|5|This game seems really fun...although I can't get very far. My skills are very limited. I got it for my grandkids. They will love it and they have much better skills.
076790592X|5|This is a book I read in summer school.  It was a very thoughtful story.  A college professor who had cancer used the last days of his life to teach his formal student the most valuable lessons, the lessons of life and death. The student in the story wrote this book himself, everything in this was very honest and it really worth people to read it.
B005XOPEOU|5|Coldplay is my favorite band and I've liked just about everything they've written. With the first single from this album, I knew it was going to be amazing. Definitely worth a listen!
B0024FADDI|5|Whether an animation like &#34;Meatballs&#34; or action/comedy like &#34;Army of Darkness&#34; or Kevin Sorbo's &#34;Hercules&#34;......Bruce Campbell is a sure satisfaction for pleasurable entertainment.
B00280LYHS|5|Great book.  I highly recommend it!  My son had me read it and it was worth it! Read them all!
B007V2UGPE|1|I played. it then my boys have and thay like it a lot.we like it because of the Samara n zombies
B003L77G8I|5|My brother loves the series.  He did'nt have the 6th season he was very happy with the DVD. Thanks for the quick turnaround time.
B000LTAY1U|2|Update:  This watch does not keep correct time, as others have commented.  I have to reset it every couple of days in order it to be at all usefull.  If it wasn't for just buying it and liking its looks I would have already abondoned it.<br /><br />I've been searching for a cool looking utilitarian military watch, that I wouldn't be afraid of scratching.  I'm a female, and there aren't many military watches that fit my wrist or don't look ridiculously over-sized. I have a few ladies Swiss military watches, but they tend to be too dainty looking or bordering on kiddie.<br /><br />I first saw this watch in black while shopping for something else in the mall. It has a good weight, doesn't look junky or cheap, and is much more attractive than pictured.  As other have mentioned, the size of the wrist band seems a bit disproportionate to the face size, however it is made of good material and the color is a perfect deep army green. The pewter finish and hardware are also very nice.  I have to cinch it up to the tightest setting to fit my almost 6 1/2\\" wrist. Overall I'm very pleased I got this watch.<br /><br />I have also debated on getting the JCrew Timex, but it seems that this watch is a bit nicer and not as overpriced as their $20 Timex's they are selling for over triple the price.
1932100660|4|all good
B003NDC07M|5|Its a differnt mix of popand if different is what you like this is what you need. Her vocal variation is like that of Florence but with a darker tone. The in your face beats will have you bouncing as you listen . i loved evryone with an exception of the second one ,but with the delux version you have a variety of songs that you can relate to if you still have that \\"who am i \\" thought. \\"Obsession and \\" oh no ARE MY PRIDE AND JOY:3
B0055SWM08|5|I started with Quell Reflect. Quell is easier but it's helping me see more clearly how to solve the puzzles before even starting. Great game-Relaxing music-great challenge!
B00OIK4C5C|5|Love it!
B008476HBM|3|I enjoyed the story. Very interesting as how women where suppose to behave. I'm glad we've as women have evolved.
B00F52YOPA|4|Fun simple works well on my Android.
0671867369|3|I must admit, I had no clue about most or the events, so after reading it I educated myself a little. It is easy to read and not too tragic, without failing to give a clear picture of the reality of the matter
B00DWZHTOU|2|This movie started off promising, as an intriguing story involving magicians and a bank heist unfolded and the director managed to make 3 generally unlikeable actors-- Woody Harrelson, Borat's wife, and the ugly Jewish kid who played the Facebook guy-- kind of interesting and charismatic. The second half of the movie just collapsed into laughable implausibility and cheap plot tricks.
B006MW3V6U|5|Well-written British &#34;soap opera&#34; that doesn't feel like a soap opera! It's very refreshing to watch a show sans foul language and gratuitous sex. Trust me, you don't need to hear people cussing up a storm nor see them disrobed in order to appreciate the intelligent story line and excellent character development. I highly recommend this drama TV series.
B00KFVE4B0|5|thought it portrayed the era very well steve buscemi played a great role, good storyline that was easy to follow, I liked it and would highly recommend it
B007J4T2G8|1|I decided to read this to find out what are the excitement was about. Well, I found out and I am sorry I bothered. It was well written and even had some suspense built, but I felt it was a waste of my time to read it.
B00IIUATDM|2|Pretty disappointed, considering all the top level stars involved and the director. It was not a good movie, I turned it off with about thirty minutes remaining. I kept hoping it would get better but never did.
1400032717|5|Christopher is a highly intelligent autistic boy. He is also a budding mathematician. He gets through life by counting cars every day (four red cars in a row make it a good day, whilst four yellow cars in a row make it a `black day').<br /><br />When the neighbourhood dog, Wellington, is murdered with a pitchfork, he sets out to solve the mystery in Sherlock Holmes style. But as he asks questions, others start to unravel and so too does the security and stability of his life...<br /><br />Written in a clear, concise style, this novel is full of the lists, graphs and puzzles which characterise the narrator's world.<br /><br />Both deeply moving and funny, The Curious Incident manages to entertain whilst also shedding light on an often little understood condition.<br /><br />Highly recommended for adults and young adults alike.
B000QCSA54|5|AMAZING little book! It contained information that I already knew, but it gave me the reassurance I needed to move forward with what my heart believes is the correct thing to do! Seth Godin, you're a god!
0374105235|5|Ishmael Beah's story is most moving. I couldn't put the book down. Even though it is a most tragic story, the bravery and excellent portrayal of all he endured truly opens the heart and mind to events we should care about.<br /><br />I would want to hear more from this young writer. I feel he is destined to continue making a significant contribution to helping in his area of concern--for it concerns us all. We are all part of this human family. And praise to the women who took him in and the rippling effects of this kindness.<br /><br />Sharon G.

B0054JZC6E|5|this game is really great and when I play it I am always entertained.  I am always playing this game!
B00DBOF5Q6|2|I didn't like the style of writing much, and I couldn't get into the book at all. When it won the Booker, I had another determined go, but still no joy.
B0092EE5HY|4|Very interesting story.  I was slightly disappointed with the end.
B00B0LPWU6|5|Kept you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. DW is an amazing actor! Great movie!
0345544927|5|I loved this book.  It is the best of Jodi's recent books and very well done.  The characters are real and believable and the suspense is good, too.  It is a three-in-one book:  A novel, a mystery and a nature book.  It reads a little slower than usual, because it is crammed with facts about elephants. But that makes it more interesting and compelling.  I loved the ending.  This book is thoroughly enjoyable.

B008FPOIT6|1|What was the point of this book?  I wanted to put it down and stop reading. It reminded me of a bad movie, you keep watching hoping it will get better . Just like a bad movie this book was terrible.
6303191347|5|I thought that I had already left positive feedback. No problem with the product at all. No problem with the shipper. I will by the same product again. I will attempt to use the same seller!!
B004J4WLB4|3|I initially read this book because it had gotten a pretty high rating. I enjoyed it and was able to get through it quickly. The main character has a lot that has been thrown her way so it was interesting to see how she chose to deal with these problems. I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a quick and easy read who enjoys twists and turns in stories.
B000HT3PPG|5|This is the &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34; I remember from childhood. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and none of the remakes compare.<br /><br />The set includes both the black and white and colorized versions. The colorized version is the one shown on television, not something new and improved. The opening scene was grainy and the color was distorted, as if to remind us this is an old movie. The black and white version is crisp, as it was meant to be shown. Both versions offer the option to view the movie with the Maureen O'Hara commentary, which she does throughout the movie.<br /><br />I found O'Hara's commentary interesting. Sometimes, she just described what was happening in the scene, which we could see for ourselves. Other times, she would describe what it was like to work with an actor or what was happening behind that scene or on the set. That was a special treat and I sat glued to the set to watch the movie a second time just to hear her talk.<br /><br />&#34;AMC Backstory&#34; gave a history of the movie and some of the problems behind the set. I found it fascinating, but I did not like that it was cut into clips and run like on television with all the pauses put in for commercials, except we didn't see any commercials. Certainly those pauses could have been edited out.<br /><br />Also included are the Thanksgiving day parade footage, promotional shorts and the poster gallery.<br /><br />I was looking forward to the little booklets often inserted into DVD sets, but this set lacks one. Still, it is a wonderful set.
B00006RU5B|5|I am a huge Rage Against the Machine fan, and was extremely disappointed that Zack de la Rocha left.  I was then happy to find out that they were continuing with Audioslave.  Honestly, I didn't care how Chris Cornell sang because I was in it for Tom Morello.  I have to say the guy is the most talented guitarist in the business.  He can do friggin anything with his guitar.  As always there is the assurance that all sounds were made with drums, bass, guitar, and vocals.  So I was also hoping he didn't go all soft.  Well, he didn't and his style is still there and doing great!  Plus, I got the added bonus that Cornell is good also!  So take it from an RATM fan that has never listened to Soundgarden - this album is great and there is nothing to be apprehensive of.  Every track is good with its own unique style, but still blends in with the rest of the tracks.  So just buy this cd.
B00EIL7IKW|5|Great season! So sad to see this season come to an end.

B0051ANPZQ|4|Really liked it.  Except Justin's section. I though it was silly how Auggie, Summer. Jack, Via, Miranda, and Julian's chapters are all grammatically correct... and then Justin's has no capitalization or quotation marks.<br /><br />Other than that, great story.  Highly recommended.  4/5 platypires
B00IKZX1ZI|5|This app is great I love the new levels and how much fun it is. Not only is it fun but it also kinda requires you to use your brain which is good for school. Overall I just love the game so a big whoop to the creators of this game!😁😉💙
B003A4IFDW|5|Bettye LaVette has a tremendous voice! Her renditions are true to form and very enjoyable. Check her selection out, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B000QRIGLC|5|First half starts out a little slow and heavy on Texas but once it picks up it is hard to put down.
B005IEF27O|5|This album absolutely did not disappoint. You always know what you're going to get with a primus album. I was so happy to find out they put out another record.
B007Z9QS5K|4|It was a nice movie, not quite as good as it's running mate Valentines day but it was quite enjoyable. Good amount of drama, romance, and the human condition.
B00IXF8PLU|5|Outstanding in every way, it tells the &#34;other side&#34; of Hitler's persecution of the Jews and others from the perspective of a young orphaned German girl. Acting is superb. One of the best I've seen this season
B000YHE4AG|5|Love this movie.
B00AQL8VU4|4|So far, works fine.
B0008KLVG4|5|I love Jaws !!!!!!  Now I have all four movies and I have a Jaws Fest every once in a while !!!!
0399157565|4|Since I gave a not-so-positive review of Red Mist, I had to write a review on The Bone Bed.  I actually enjoyed this book...finally.  I was a die hard fan of Cornwell until her characters became so tediously angry and obnoxious.  She must have listened to all her one-time fans and decided to let the anger go.  Or, perhaps, she is a happier person now than she has been in the past.  Whatever the reason, I was very pleasantly surprised with this book.  I guess going ahead and trying to read her books hoping for the best paid off this time.  Thank you, Patricia Cornwell, it's nice to have you back.  Still her characters have some anger issues but not so much this time.
B008BM9L72|5|Couldn't put it down.  Read the entire first book in 24hrs! The second book the following day.  And the third book over 2 days.  Wish there was more. Enough said.
B005ZMUXDC|5|My granddaughter loves this movie & watches it all the time!!
B000FA57N0|5|There are thousands of reviews about Serenity as a movie, so we'll keep this about the HD edition. <br /> <br />Extraordinary movie to watch on hd DVD. <br />Since it is one of our all time favorites Serenity was the first HD movie we watched on our new HD player. The sound was the first thing we noticed about this HD version of Serenity. Wow! It really made use of our sound system. <br /> The picture was awesome, there was so much detail to take in, breath taking. Really as good as watching it in the theater, and as enjoyable. <br /> <br /> We own the regular DVD of serenity and were very happy with it but after watching it on HD there is no question that we prefer the HD.  <br />We played the regular DVD of Serenity right after watching this one and the up processing of the player made the regular dvd looks better than ever  but the HD edition was still has much more detail and superior sound. <br /> <br />Some great extras, I think the regular DVD has all of the same features, but I could be wrong.  <br /> <br />We do wish they would have added a cast commentary for the movie. They all did a great job with commentaries for the DVD release of the Firefly <br />
B00VRYCGLO|4|Love this game! I don't like that it doesn't refresh your lives when the game is not running. Other games each day you start with restored lives this one it only recharges them while my kindle is on and game is open.
B007ZGO7EM|5|I love the large numbers. they make it so easy on the eyes and it has some great features. I would recommend this to every one.
B009HEJXFS|5|I have watched all three movies and each time it's better. I love alien movies.
0345423496|1|This book was very disappointing given Clarke's other works.  There was little explanation as for how Poole survived, and the book spent most of the time catching him up on the last 1000 years.  I was expecting a big finale, and what I got was a few pages involving using a computer virus to trick the monolith system into giving humanity another 1000 years.  When I got to the last page I thought, \\"that's it?\\"
B00006RIO7|5|I lived in NYC and I've seen hundreds of Broadway shows and musicals.  Chicago is the only movie version I have ever seen that musically and visually ever made me think I was veiwing this live on the Big White Way!  Catherine Zeta-Jones is very good--sings and dances to a trice--did she deserve the Best Supporting actress award, no.  Renee Zellwegger,as Roxie, may not sing or dance QUITE as well as Jones was PERFECT as Roxie; in my opinion was underestimated for the Best Actress award.  Queen Latifah was &quot;it&quot; as Momma and certainly deserved her nomination.  John C. Reilly, while holding a smaller part sang &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot; as no one in my memory could. He sang with just the right amount of pride and pathos.  If only his acting were as good.  Richard Gere--who knew he could sing--at all. His dancing isn't he Gene Kelly  or Fred Astaire but  was not bad.  All-in-all, he was surprizingly good at both and good in the part.  I certainly would never have cast him without an audition.  All in all this sound track is magnificent and deserves a place in anyone's collection of show tunes. If you like musicals and haven't seen it DO!  You'll run to get the sound track (and maybe the movie--when released nationally).

0385512104|5|This book was forced on me by my mother.  Everyone of a literary bent who I've spoken to including many of my friends all know about it.  We seem to regard this book as a pretty brilliant read. <br /> <br />Living in England the outstanding quality of the work is the way it captures something of this country, particularly in London like patterns on the seats of an underground train or the details of shops - familiar to some of us - in a way that makes them stand out.  We no more take them for granted.  This is about our everyday world that is so often not mentioned in specific.  In this context this book is very much a British work that relates to an English setting from the time it was written in terms of environments, names, dialogues, educational institutes/systems and everyday lives and problems. <br /> <br />The protagonist is incapable of feeling the emotions of others and the book is very much an exploration of feeling.  I've heard that the book is a very accurate portrait of autistic thinking and it seems to be based on a great deal of research and experience. <br /> <br />This book is audacious in its style but the story itself is no tangle.  There were so many scientific and mathematical details in the book that the character relates that really taught me something I had no grasp of. <br /> <br />I cannot truly confess to understanding the feelings of others but this book leads me to understand those who feel them and their own feelings differently - perhaps less.  The protagonist is not devoid of feeling but they are not registered so consciously except perhaps for the key emotions like sadness or fear. <br /> <br />When his mother cries with grief all he observes is that she wails like an animal in a TV documentary.  He cannot feel her pain.  But his emotions are registered by him reacting violently at a physical level even though he can't explain them.  Such contents evoke a certain humour but also a deep pain which is never expressed explicitly.  But the teenager does have a firm notion of right and wrong which we cannot disagree with and a good sense of direction - even if he can't explain why being so daunted by the complexity of the future.  Thus he has an inimitable form of wisdom that guides him and helps him cope. <br /> <br />The protagonist comes across generously in sharing his autistic world with us which is not a cold one and often highly mathematical and logical.  Optimistic at the end, this is a profoundly effective style of simple narrative designed to convey something of the universe, England and human emotion.   <br /> <br />Graphics, maps and diagrams uniquely keep the work afloat and animated.  We literally see how the boy thinks at a visual level. <br /> <br />I think the book emphasises the importance of feelings in our world and how we relate to them and manipulate them.  It challenges our sense of values in the context of feelings and hopefully encourages us to develop our sensitivity to our feelings and those of others.  <br /> <br />
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is a well made product.IT is fun exciting and new upgrades and characters come very often<br />I have enjoyed the game the last 3 yeArs that I have played  it but it's still FUN. I recommend you get this game.
B000EULJLU|4|As expected
B00005JMEW|5|What a great film, don't know what took so long for me to review it! Tarantino brings everything that Asian cinema has to offer in this film. The classics such as gallons of blood and just flat out martial arts action. You get the best of it all in this film. Nothing like a revenge story to really get the story going. What was so interesting about this film was the many ways the story is told. One minute being live-action and at one point being Anime.<br /><br />The actors and actresses for this film were the perfect choices for who they played. I'm a David Caradine fan from the Kung Fu days and he is still a very impressive actor. To Sonny Chiba in this film was also the right decision to make. In my opinion, probably the best martial-arts movie star besides Bruce Lee, a true legend in my eyes.<br /><br />The storyline is fun, although unrealistic in this day and age. You know she would be in jail for killing all of those people, not to mention she leaves good evidence that she is the one who did all the killings. But who cares? That's what the story is all about, she is wanting everyone to know who is responible. It's her revenge! If you love martial arts movies, especially those classics from the 70's, you have found heaven in this movie!
B00D2MC8WG|3|Nietzsche's Also Sprach Zarathurstra is less a philosophical treatise and more like dynamite. Its impact is seismic. It's akin (in the very least) to Martin Luther nailing his 95 theses to the door of the Castle-Church in Wittenberg. Witness the following:<br /><br />\\"I teach you the Superman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the Superman: a laughing-stock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape. . . . Behold, I teach you the Superman! The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the Superman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!\\"<br /><br />This is the re-evaluation of all values, top to bottom. Surely it warrants tension in the act of delivery, even if the message be transmitted through Richard Strauss?<br /><br />For all the incidental beauties of the Berlin Philharmonic, that's what I find missing here in the Dude's performance: tension - namely, a deep-set awareness that this manifesto is dangerous and for better or worse, it's going to change the world forever.<br /><br />Karajan '73 delivers it in spades. For instance, listen to the closing chords of the first movement in the leading up to the fortissimo: the Berlin Phil of yesteryear bets the house; its latter-day namesake plays very stylishly and that's about it.<br /><br />It makes me wonder to what extent the Dude is conversant with Nietzsche (to say nothing of the current members of the orchestra). That being said, I hear a similar lack of tension in Rattle's Ein Heldenleben. Its reoccurrence makes me wonder if absolution should be granted to Sir Simon; perhaps the flaw lies within the DNA of the current Berlin Philharmonic. Stylish obbligato contributions from this principal or that are no substitute for the Furor Teutonicus of yesteryear.<br /><br />If the duel between Karajan and Dudamel were occurring in the same weight-division - the prize-fight in Don Juan and Til Eulenspeigel would be more even than what they are.  As things stand, the Dude offers well-manicured, lightweight readings which do not bespeak longevity. It's a KO to Herbie.<br /><br />As such, I am aligned with Stewart on this one.<br /><br />Time will tell.onder to what extent the Dude is conversant with Nietzsche (to say nothing of the current members of the orchestra).

B0052RDHTM|3|This is a very ambitious novel, not exactly War and Peace, but with a broad view of the world and events surrounding WW1.  I am not enough of a historian to evaluate the accuracy of the history of the period.  The personal stories of the characters from various nations involved in the war are compelling.  The punitive reparations forced on Germany, clearly set the stage for the next world war.  It did seem that Mr. Follett went out of his way to get the reader involved in the sex life of each of his characters.  In some cases this was to the detriment of the book, and this seemed be done just to promote sales of the book.
B00CJGP116|5|VIVIR MI VIDA!!!  the anthem to my every day!  I expected a few more songs on the album...maybe because I never want it to end...but each song is great.
B001N1DPDE|5|best fixed blade I have ever owned!!<br />Paired with the tek-lok its a GREAT combination solid blade for any and ALL outdoor uses
B0089EHWQE|3|It was good. The characters were well developed. You really came to like the characters or at least understand where they were coming from and it was a good book club discussion book.
B000XUBFE2|4|Fantastic book.  Extremely well written.  Laughed and cried all the way through.  You won't be disappointed.<br />I recommend<br /><br />Nd this book to anyone who wants to know what it felt like to be a child during that horrific time.
B004WR125O|4|Easy way to stream Pandora through the Onkyo receiver.  I would recommend to anyone that enjoys streaming musice.  Works as advertised.
0517548232|3|It's a good book. Very informative. Good for my Econ 101 class
B00ZZ07L0W|4|Not as great as other seasons but still a fan!!  Can't wait to see how the final season wraps up this wonderful journey.
B0071XO8RA|5|I'm sure other reviews are more eloquent than this one, but I had to write after finishing Wool.  Absolutely amazing story, amazing writing, gripping all the way through.  A must read.  I'm so glad I gave this a go, and look forward to whatever comes next from Hugh Howey.  Can't recommend this book enough.  If you like Sci-Fi at all, you won't be disappointed.  Rarely do I come across a story this well told.
B003MAQM6Q|5|It is a great movie with some real plot twists
B00QROH0QK|1|I had high hopes for this movie. But it came out very disappointing. The humor was terrible, trying too hard and just not funny. The movie made no sense so there was nothing to latch onto.
B006FTC6ZC|5|I am a leaf on the wind see how I laugh my A$$ of watching this movie. It was not what I expected and I couldn't be more pleased.
0552998486|5|One of my all time favorites. A book for the senses.
B000002UAX|2|With four out of the last six reviewers giving the White Album a 1-star rating, I have to step up and defend it.  There are 10 good songs out of 30 on here, which is proportionally worth two stars.  I will agree that &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; is one of the worst songs ever recorded, but don't penalize the whole album for it.

0805079831|5|The Shock Doctrine is the nonfiction book of the decade.    Klein's thesis is that fundamentalist, no-holds-barred capitalists--followers of Milton Friedman--and large corporations, starting in the 70s, began either creating or taking advantage of disasters to enrich themselves and make the already poor even poorer.    They fomented coups and torture from Chile to Argentina to Brazil to Thatcherite England to Reaganite America to Poland to Yeltsin's Russia to post-Apartheid South Africa to Sri Lanka to China to post-Katrina New Orleans to Afghanistan to Iraq.    All of this was done, of course, under the dictum that \\"free markets equal free people,\\" when precisely the reverse held true.    \\"Free markets\\" has been a code phrase for Rule by CEOs, and has resulted in the re-sweatshoppery of the world, and the ridiculous re-enrichment of the already rich.    According to Klein, the war on Iraq was not just Dumbassery Run Amok, but INTENTIONAL Dumbassery Run Amok.  Many individuals and corporations are making millions out of this fiasco, and you and I (and of course the poor Iraqis) are paying for it.    Interestingly, she says, the place where all this Vulture Capitalism started, South and Central America, is also the place where it is now being most decisively rejected: Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay, Nicaragua, Costa Rica.    Perhaps the only good result of the war on Iraq is  that it has so preoccupied George W. Bush that he has not been able to send U.S. troops to Central and South America to destroy democracy in order to save it.    The book is infinitely detailed, and infinitely shocking.      In every place where Vulture Capitalism has taken hold, the living standard of the vast majority has gone down, way down.    Hence the need for torture, violence, and scapegoating to keep the victims, the vast majority, from rebelling against corporate pillage.
B004ZRV3AU|4|I just received this on Saturday and promptly read the directions (which is totally uncharacteristic), assembled the contraption and practiced.  Three times.  (I had to have a large glass of wine to empty a third practice bottle) The fourth bottle was perfect and so was the fifth!  My advice is read the directions thoroughly and do what they say.  Odd, I know.  The YouTube video helped me too.  Make sure the cutter is exactly perpendicular to bottle (not slightly at an angle) and hold the bottle's score under boiling water instead of moving it through the water.  That seemed to help my later efforts.  My only complaint was I paid $33 for it last week and now it's $25 everywhere on Amazon, which is why I gave it 4 stars not 5.
1582701709|1|This is random collection of thoughts and ideas by a variety of people.  It was very hard to follow.  I think the the DVD might have been easier to understand.  I'm not good with names so when John Doe(1st specialist) spoke, I couldn't relate it to when he spoke before. <br /> <br />I also wouldn't recommend this as bible based as I originally thought.
B00005JL0I|5|Time tested one of the best spoof movies of all time.
B003ZHQVJO|4|kid's last cd rock'n'roll jesus rocked more than this new cd does. it has it's moments(god bless saturday night) (flyin' high)but not enough as the last cd. this is more country sounding than any of his other cds. no stand out dirty/funny song like (lowlife) from the last cd on this one. i guess hanging out in nashville a lot changed his direction a little. good cd but not as great+rockin as the last one
B00BUCXVPI|5|Great movie, must pay attention there are a few gotyas in there.
B00DH7P6WU|5|Daughter loved dolls - way better price than local stores.
B001VLXNLU|3|This book was too much like the &#34;Ugly&#34; series. they undergo a change. It is hard to go thru. To much alike!
B0064MPXFA|4|Just getting used to the Prime and how it works.  On a first season didn't want to buy each episode...not sure if i did?
0452289963|5|This is by far the best book I have read on managing your mind and therefore your life.  I read it twice to make sure I didn't miss anything, and I never read a book all the way through a second time.  I bought copies for my college age daughters and they are now reading it. I know this is a very strong statement, but I believe it is the most important book published since the bible.
B008WCP2PG|5|This movie is so much fun.  The music and the dancing is fun and energetic and who doesn't have a good time watching hot, half naked me dance around?
B00DUGCLY4|4|The game really teases my brain
006202406X|1|I loved Divergent, and Insurgent really kept my interest.  When I started Allegiant, it also kept my interest at first, and it had such potential for a good ending to a good series.  What a disappointment!  Do not read this book if you do not want to ruin the enjoyment you received from the first two!  It makes me regret wasting my time reading any of the three, and I have no plans to ever visit anything written by this author again!<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*!!!<br /><br />The entire plot toward the ending of the book was ludicrous!  Wiping the memory of members of one bureau controlled by the government would be useless!  The government goal would be the same, and they would just send more undamaged bureau members to take their place.  It would change almost nothing!<br /><br />The ending, killing Tris for no reason whatsoever, was unforgivable!  She is so strong and so special, and she even survives the death serum only to be shot by a man in a wheelchair.  She could have easily defended herself and survived.  The book is narrated back and forth by Tobias and Tris, just because Tris is going to be killed off.  Else, who would be left to tell the story?  It is difficult to even tell who is speaking throughout the book because the perspectives of Tris and Tobias are so similar!<br /><br />Killing off the person who narrates through the entire series is a betrayal to the reader!  It leaves you feeling betrayed by the author and angry!  I could not believe what I was reading.  And yes, authors do need to consider their audience.  Else, why are they even writing a book for others to read.  And this is targeted to teens and young adults!<br /><br />I do not go for the &#34;art imitating life&#34; as an excuse to kill off way too many characters in this story or any other story.  That wasn't Pagan Pessimistic enough for this author.  After all that Tris and Tobias went through, one would have said, &#34;Finally they get to be together without the world coming to an end!&#34;  But no, Tris, the character speaking to us is just killed off uselessly, and the other main character is absolutely devastated.  I did not even finish the last few pages!  It was that bad!<br /><br />If I want to read about useless tragedy, I will just pick up the newspaper in my city and read it any day of the week or watch the nightly news!  A book should uplift and inspire you and give you hope, not needlessly disappoint and devastate you!  This book failed on all counts!
B004MC8CA2|5|This bible is by far the best I have seen so far. It has my language version of yoruba. Thank you Jesus.
B0036EH3X4|1|Quite possibly the most disappointing ending possible for what appeared, up until the end of the fifth season, to be a very deep and interesting show.  The finale never answered basic question at the heart of the show--what is the island--which is a major strike against any series that is essentially a mystery.<br /><br />Instead, the writers do not bother to explain anything about the island, and essentially allow \\"Magic\\" to explain the whole series.  It is no surprise, therefore, that so many people have latched on to the whole island is some sort of purgatory as an explanation--at least that makes sense of the past six seasons of the show.<br /><br />I can say without hesitation, that while up until this season Lost was a fascinating journey of discovery, this season does nothing but establish that the whole journey was pointless.  Is the message that \\"the most important people in your life are those who happen to be around you when you die\\"?  Or that \\"some mystical glowwy cave is responsible for everything, but we wont tell you what it is.\\"  No matter how you slice it, this entire season was nothing but sappy for no reason.  No matter the interpretation the entire sideways universe is nothing but a big \\"what if,\\" because it is clearly established that whatever happened there wasn't real and/or didn't matter, resulting in over half of this season wasted from the get go.  I highly recommend that anyone interested in this series, or a fascinating mystery either look elsewhere, or pretend that this show was canceled at the end of season 5.
B009POCG2C|5|Loved this movie.  Great casting, great acting..  Great baseball movie - they just don't get any better than Clint Eastwood!
B0086700CM|5|awesome game!!!! temple run is the best! its addictive but thats okay i still enjoy it very much well haha boy
B005K17RU0|4|very easy to use, very accurate.  radar works great and graphics are very easy to understand.  I recommend. this app.
B00IS87HYI|5|Thank you for adding this game to KINDLE fire users! Now you have to add farm heros, papal pear saga!
B000NI8F5G|4|Great dancing. Boring plot
B00IDI8KLC|4|The construction and the use of Legos was amazing - I've heard over a million pieces used? Aimed at young ones, adults will like the humor too. And I quote: 'Everything was awesome!&#34;, which song will now be stuck in your head.
0739337297|5|GREAT BOOK
B00JH49OTS|1|Ure kidding right.  Say no more
B00003CXBK|5|Whether you get caught up in the complex, yet entirely coherent story, or simply swept away by the gorgeous vistas or painstaking animation, this movie shows off the great potential of animated films.  It transports you to a surreal alternate universe the beauty of which surpasses both live action film and computer animation.  It is a perfectly realized universe of amazing creatures, strange spells, and mysterious characters.
B007VUA7VO|4|I really like this app.  Really gets the job done. Very informative.  I will definitely recommend to my friends and family
B00F8MIIKO|5|I'm a big dork and have always loved cartoons and ESPECIALLY Pixar/Dreamworks/etc.  it's great for kids (animation, slap-stick type comedy) but also has the double entendre for the adults watching too. It was a witty take on the original.
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Great CD.
0744015472|5|I would consider buying this by linking to Epic Name Bro's youtube page,  He's a lore fanatic and actually had a hand in the creation of this absolutely fantastic.  Pretty much everything you could possibly need from maps, a finely crafted index, and even explanations to some parts of the game lore not directly explained through the play through.  A must have for those wishing to die a little less in a great game.  Link to ENB is here:[...]
B004SBX112|4|I was really excited to finally get ad-free versions of these games! Definitely worth a buck, or free if you got it on the right day. Unfortunately, there are ads in the pause menu. The ads that covered the game screen are gone, but still. Not technically ad-free.
B007ZXK08C|3|found myself racing through this book with excitement .... only to find a flat and lacklustre ending. did the author run out of time on deadline or simply get bored?!
B00VRYCGLO|5|Fun and challenging hours of entertainment.
B00634GHJA|5|This app works great and is simple to use. Very intuitive and well written. Other software developers should take note on how this was written. WELL DONE!
0316017922|5|I found The Outliers  by Malcolm Galdwell to provide the impetus to look at who I am and how I came to be that person.   Especially insightful for those of us whose background includes an ethnic aliance.  Grand experience to have read it.
0879309210|4|I doubt there's a better manual on guitar repair, but this one could be even better.  Sometimes the organization is a bit poor and definitely feels like it's been pulled from Dan's columns over the years.  The included DVD is pretty useless and feels like a bit of an upsell to Dan's repair DVD series, which is quite expensive.  Despite these issues, there's a lifetime's worth of great information in here and it makes for good reading.  Coupled with some digging on youtube for videos of people making some of these repairs and a few quality tools, I've been able to get good results on a few projects.
B00992CF6W|5|I think this is a great app but it does need some improvements. The game takes too long for updates this game is great I play it on playstation three too.<br />I think this game is awesome and deserves five stars and mojang should keep working on it.
B0036TGSJ4|4|This is a funny movie!  We had read that this was a funny movie, but it was a lot funnier than anything we'd read.  Hilarious flick!
B005PK56TA|5|Gee it I dont know how I missed this until now. I like this the filming is great they did a good job. The acting is some of the best I have seen in a long time. The actors are great. Great writing and I love the adult themes. This gets a AAA in my book. Also so for prime members free what a deal...
B0063GORYU|5|Great game and the settings are easy to understand and manipulate. All in all a very very very good buy
B000TGJ8A8|2|Yet another bad movie from Nicholas Cage. And Julianne Moore sucked too. Only redeeming part of the movie was Jessica Biel, who is a babe and did a pretty good job playing the requisite damsel-in-distress.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is the best game out there in my opinion. It's a very good way to kill some time. I do wish they would come up with a different sequence of how the trains appear.
B00A11AN6O|4|Works great for my requirements.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Some good twists and turns.  Liane knows how to weave a good story and hold your interest throughout the journey.
B00JNQKR46|4|The story describes the human emotion a judge can carry when making difficult decisions based on law. It is not cut and dried.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5|I feel much smarter after viewing this film! I could have easily bought the iTunes version of the the movie and soundtrack buuuuut I feel like Dave Grohl would be disappointed with me! Haha
B002GSXKN8|5|This was an excellent purchase.  I have a couple of the Batman movies separately, but I like having them all together in one package.  Also, couldn't beat the price!
B001EN71CW|5|First, regarding the format, the blu-ray quality is excellent.  It's definitely a big step up from the DVD version.  I have yet to watch the special features or watch episodes with the included commentary.    As to the show itself, it's hard to describe it fully.  There's a reason this show has developed a cult following after its untimely demise.  Like so many great shows, it was a victim of poor timing and bad handling by the network.  I know I was only vaguely aware of it when it was on, and only came to know (and love it) long after it had been canceled.     The show has a great balance of action, drama and humor.  The character development is top-notch.  I'm not sure I can think of any other show in which I was so actively engaged in so many characters' stories.  Each episode gives you more of a look into these interesting and unusual character's histories and lives, though generally small enough that it keeps you wanting to know more.  Sadly, the show ended before it was able to explain many of the questions that it introduced.    The dialog is snappy and well written, and the plots of each episode are always fun and exciting.  The show does an excellent job of weaving in series-level elements (plot points which span the entire season) with individual episodic stories.  Some shows do little to tie episodes together, and some spend so much on making everything on a season level that each episode has little value in itself.  Firefly is definitely not one of those shows.    All in all, this is a great show.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi (or maybe even westerns, with its unique western-sci-fi combination, which works surprisingly well).  This blu-ray is a great way to enjoy the show, and it often goes on sale for around $35.
B00005JLR2|4|The artwork is good, but its not the best. A lot of computer animation is used, instead of acutal hand drawn work. Which is another sign of how the Disney artists are getting more lazy.<br />There is only one song played during the movie. Fortunaltly, that song is very good, it is not irritating.
B004SBULWE|5|This app is very helpful for android phones. It lets you close programs, instead of restarting you phone, and withoud going through a long menu process for &#34;force stop&#34; apps. It also lets you shuts down programs to save bettery life. Very useful!
B0069CQ7BE|5|I am using this in a Silverstone GD04 HTPC case with an ASUS M4A88T-M LE motherboard.  It just barely fits, because the thing is huge.  There's no replacement for displacement, right?  It does an excellent job cooling... all while being essentially silent at normal room noise levels.  A+
B004DLPXAO|5|I had a Kindle given to me - one of the older ones with a keyboard on it and came home to fine the screen broke.  I was in the middle of reading an awesome book so I downloaded Kindle for Iphone but wanted a bigger area to read so I bought the Trio Stealth... It took me a while to figure out what I needed to do but finally got Kindle loaded and all my books - AWESOME  still figuring it out but I love it so far.

B00IG2DOKM|5|LOVE IT!!!! If you're looking for a great game by it!!
B00DA6YEKS|5|I set out on a journey. I travel West, farther than I had ever ventured. After weeks of rough travel, I arrive at my destination. Timidly, I ask the Nightwatcher. &#34;Please, send me a kickass fantasy series to read.&#34; Thus, I found A Way of Kings and Words of Radiance. No obvious curse had manifested itself while reading these books, and I thought myself saved from the Nightwacher's mischievous nature. It wasn't until I was about to finish Way of Kings that the curse materialized itself in front of me, very real at last. Three words, that's all it took.<br /><br />Ten<br />Book<br />Saga<br /><br />Joking aside, the second book in The Stormlight Archive is every bit as remarkable as I had expected. I am simply consumed by this saga, and despite my aforementioned indisposition towards waiting, I can't sufficiently express how HAPPY I am that Mr Sanderson has graced us with such a wonderful series to read. I can't speak much without spoiling even more, but I have to say this series is setting a new standard to which ALL other fantasy books, whether they want to or not, will have to attain.<br /><br />I won't spend too much time on this review, however, as my time is short and there is much reading to be done. I won't surprise myself if I read everything else this man has ever written before the third book is out. Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.

I have found some really fascinating tidbits of information and I would definitely recommend to any of my friends or family.

It was like it was written and then the kid grabbed the thesaurus and change some small words for big words and loooked up different types of sex and insert it in periodically.  I only finished it because I like to finish every book I begin.
B000FC2L1Y|5|Well written and so captivating that I ordered the next book in the series.

B009FZHYKU|5|Can't believe I am hooked on a &#34;zombie&#34; show, but I am.  The drama of the survival aspect of the show is the real attraction.  I never watched a show that was so willing to kill off beloved characters so easily.  That keeps you tuned in too...rooting for your favorites to stay alive.

B00NJT3A5Q|3|As always the harmonies are fantastic, the arrangements fresh and the vocals impressive.  I was less enthusiastic about the song choices though.  Only three of the 11 were religious songs which for a religious holiday seems under represented.  I'm sure this makes it more broadly appealing.  Easily the best song is &#34;Mary Did You Know&#34; with the title track being my 2nd favorite.  Overall worth a listen but not as strong as their 1st Christmas release.

B009CPES4I|4|Enjoyable!  Now ready to see number two at the movies.
B006PAZMMK|5|There is a reason why this guy was nominated for a grammy: Skrillex is a master at sound manipulation and doing it in a way that is musical (if that makes any sense).  If you don't think this guy has talent, listen to the last track on this album: it is a classical rendition of the tracks on this album and his previous one.  Well done.
1594744769|4|To be honest, when I first started reading \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" I expected a haunting thriller, full of horror and danger.  That is not what this book is.  Instead, this book is fantasy/adventure combined with a very unique style of photography, which made the book better than I ever thought it would be.<br /><br />Story - Jacob Portman desires an adventurous life, much like the life his grandfather describes to him in various stories.  However, when Jacob realizes that he can never have an adventurous life, he just tries to be normal and fit in.  He's not popular or extremely smart, and there doesn't seem to be anything unusual about him at all; but when his grandfather dies and leaves Jacob a cryptic message, Jacob is sent on a hunt to find his grandfather's past and ends up traveling all the way to Wales.  Once there, Jacob discovers much more than he ever could have imagined about his grandfather and is thrown into the midst of a very peculiar situation.<br /><br />Writing Style - If I had to compare Ransom Riggs to any other author, I would have to compare him to Lemony Snicket.  In fact, this entire book reminded me very much of Mr. Snicket's \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" books.  Don't get me wrong, Riggs did not steal Lemony Snicket's writing style at all, but Riggs just simply reminded me of him, which is a positive since I pretty much love anything that Snicket touches.<br />Something else that I feel Riggs did superbly was explain the detail of everything in the story.  Even without the occasional photographs of people and things in the story, I was able to visualize the locations and details because of the fantastic descriptions.<br />Now, as for the photographs, they added a whole new dimension to the story.  They didn't turn the novel into a picture book or something else that we normally associate with children; rather, they added a new level of immersion to the story, with the reader being almost able to see exactly what Jacob is seeing as he looks at the many photographs scattered throughout.<br />The book is truly addicting, but it isn't perfect; there are a few kinks that I feel needed to be worked out.  The major kink being the fact that the attitude of some of the characters just doesn't seem to match the story!  The abundance of cursing and crude humor just doesn't make sense with some of the characters or the plot of the story.  Also, there were a few things that weren't developed as much as possible and could have been explained more and built upon.<br /><br />Warnings - Language, Mild Violence, Mild Peril<br /><br />Overall - In all fairness, my last complaint was very nitpicky and small, and I don't want to give anyone the impression that this is not a good book.  For a first novel, it is fantastic!  There are a few things to improve on, but I think Mr. Riggs is off to an amazing start!  I immensely look forward to his second novel, which I assume is in the works based on the cliffhanger at this end of the story.  I would say that, most likely, teens will enjoy the book more than adults, but it really does have a very interesting plot that many will love.
B007REV4YI|5|I was so disappointed in the previous Bond film because Casino Royale was such an exciting reboot of Bond that I was let down.  However Syfall takes Bond to new heights.  The movie was intense, fun, full of action and good acting.  The big bad in the film works because he's slightly insane and he Bardem makes him believable.  If you love Bond you'll love this film.  If you're not a Bond fan but do love action/espionage films you will love this film anyway.

030759565X|5|The \\"frugal\\" side of me thinks, 'I can just Google for a good recipe online or check the Smitten Kitchen blog.  Do I really need yet another book to add to my cramped one-bedroom apartment, and will I really find new recipes in it that appeal?  Should I just wait to borrow it from the library?'<br /><br />I'm glad that I didn't hit that cancel button because I got it and WOW.  I have been waiting for a recipe book from Ms. Perelman and now I remember why.  Her photos are stunning, the recipes I flipped through I haven't seen before, and her quick wit and humor translate beautifully in print.  The blog, plus so much more in tangible form.<br /><br />Some might be quick to comment that this is just her blog in print format.  I would like to state that yes, there is some overlap, but not much from what I have seen.  Plus, if you're a blogger and are producing a print copy, there is some expectation that there *will* be overlap and the more popular or highly clicked recipe posts will make it into the book.  If you didn't, you'd hear it from your audience.  You really can't please everyone, but I for one haven't been this excited about a cookbook in a long time.  There are many recipes I haven't seen on her blog, (and I have been following her for at least 6 years now) AND I love that she includes Jacob in her stories and annotations of the recipes.  I find the inspiration to cook simple, healthy, and tasty meals for my little man.  I suspect that Jacob is her source of inspiration... AND if your son was as cute as that little future heart breaker, you'd be sure to put him in your cookbook.  ** I'd like to also add that this is not a family album.  What it is: A fantastic cookbook.
B004X75RK4|5|We have purchased more than one copy of this comedy, and will continue to replace the lost or borrowed-never-to-be-returned copies we have had. So much of the comedy is unexpected, but now we start laughing even before the funny scenes start. I highly recommend!

B0002OERI0|1|Oh my god what have they done? Is it just me or is it that ever scince the release of this new album Green day has become another one of MTV's little drones? The fact that they would spend as much money as they did on a music video is actually quite anti-punk and offends me greatly. If you have no depth and don't care about whether or not a band is a big money seeker with no other goal then you might like this, if not search elsewhere. If you must have your Green day fix please listen to their older albums and only if you absolutley need to because those arn't that great either. If you say \\"Ooh good charolette isn't punk (which they arnt) they just wear all that makeup to look cool.\\" Well guess what people Green day is just as guilty so dont complain and dont buy this album.

0743289412|5|I really liked this book - very much.  It was obvious to me that King is married to a not-as-well-known, nor popular, writer, Tabitha.  The insights Kings wrote regarding what a Mrs. Stephen King (or Mrs. other popular celebrity) would feel were quite understandable, respectful and moving.  King writes from his own personal history, I am sure.  While I would classify this as an unusual love story, it is still classic Stephen King, with memorable characters, absorbing believable dialog, and some freaky nightmarish aspects thrown into the mix.  I would now like to read more of Lisey's Story - Lisey Lives On, as it were.  Great storytelling.  Excellent work, Stephen!
B005K0HDGE|5|I have been a Stephen King for a long-time and The Stand has been my favorite SK book but after reading this book, I think 11/23/68 is right up there with The Stand.

B008Y7IUBM|4|A Classic!
B00003A9QI|5|Rachel Portman is better known for composing lighter, more whimsical pieces and is not normally associated with rich, melodic scores such as that which she composed for \\"The Cider House Rules\\".  This CD  proves that she's every bit the equal of the acknowledged masters in this  field such as John Barry (Dance With Wolves; Out of Africa), James Horner  (Field of Dreams), and Randy Newman (Pleasantville; The Natural; Edward  Scissorhands).    Portman's score is, to put it simply, one of the most  beautiful and moving pieces I've ever heard.  Particularly noteworthy are  the Main Theme, \\"Homer Leaves the Orphanage\\", \\"Burying  Fuzzy\\", \\"Goodnight, You Princes of Maine\\", and the End  Credits. Overall, the pieces work do an excellent job of conveying the feel  of the picture without being overdone and schmaltzy.  There has been some  criticism of Portman employing the main theme, with minor variations, to  underscore other moments in the movie.  I personally think the criticism is  unwarranted.  Obviously she had a sense of what it would take to make this  score work well, and I take no issue with it.  When the music is as  beautiful as this, I see no problem in doing variations.  I only wish Randy  Newman had done this with his excellent \\"Pleasantville\\" score  (it's probably no coincidence that both of my favorite soundtracks are for  movies starring Tobey Maguire).     If this CD is any indication of what  Rachel Portman is capable of doing with a musical score, I for one wish  her a long and successful career.  I look forward to hearing more of her  work and highly recommend the original motion picture score of \\"The  Cider House Rules\\" as one of the best I've ever heard.
B004I7GR6C|1|It's impossible to get immersed in this movie. It doesn't make you squirm, cringe or care about what's going to happen, it just constantly reminds you that you're watching a movie made for no other reason than making the audience ooh and ahh.<br />Any suspense that was intended was squashed by the ridiculous 3d special effects extravaganza and the coloring that looks more like a daytime soap opera than a horror movie.<br /><br />If you loved the other movies so much that you can't resist watching it, find a three dollar copy and make sure you rid yourself of any expectations before you press play.<br />Or just read the synopsis and use your imagination. I think this was Jigsaw's test for the viewers actually. See if you could resist the temptation to waste money...
B005HEDI3K|5|I grew up watching the original series as a kid.  My father (a big sci-fi fan) and i would watch the original series as the where first shown on the air.

0743270754|3|After rereading Gore Vidal's Lincoln, surely one of the great books of all time, I decided it was time I read Goodwin's book to see how it compared.  I wondered how well Vidal's judgement of all the crucial characters would hold up.  My conclusion is that Vidal and Goodwin picture just about every character in a very similar manner.  Goodwin's book provides more detail and is written in a very readable style, but it does not entirely avoid the problem of many such massive tomes - getting excessively bogged down in detail.  While I can't help but praise her effort and knowledge, it takes more than twice as much time to read her book as Vidal's.  I would recommend that anyone wishing to understand Lincoln begin by reading Vidal's book; and then, if they want to delve more deeply, take on Goodwin's book.
B007S3S8HO|2|Not a fan of this. I would not recommend it. It definitely is fun to fling angry birds out of your catapult. But this almost $30 set includes a very pitiful array of knex blocks, the connections are filmsy and break if you handle it a little too rough. We spent all the time building it and then it was still very very hard to get the pigs to stay on the flat surfaces. Save your money.

B00GCE3TCE|2|The Book Thief is a wildly popular novel by Markus Zusak about a young girl’s coming of age in Nazi Germany. It topped the New York Times bestseller list, has recently been released as a feature film and is nearly universally praised by everyone I know.<br /><br />Liesel Meminger is the main character – a young girl who reluctantly goes to live in a new town with foster parents. Hers is a life of sadness, but this retelling (from the point of view of Death/The Grim Reaper) is meant to be a redemption from this sadness, a victory of good/pure heartedness over evil.<br /><br />It may come as a surprise that I gave The Book Thief only two stars, and I felt very generous about giving it that rating. I am confident that I would enjoy a film version of this moving story, and I plan to see the film once it is released outside theaters. I enjoy reading historical fiction, immensely, and am interested in stories set during World War II, especially ones that provide a European perspective. What I did not enjoy was Zusak’s choice of narrator, the narrative voice and the writing style of this novel.<br /><br />Early in the reading, I posted a tweet and Facebook status asking if I should stick with it:<br /><br />I’m 5% into The Book Thief, and I’m not sure I can endure the florid prose. Does it get better?<br />“Florid” is the most diplomatic word I can use for the writing style in this book. I am all for painting a picture with words and immersing a reader in your fictional world. However, this just took it way too far for me. Every exhaustive description of the sky or nonsensical descriptor or simile took me right out of the (good) story. The writing was a constant distraction to me; it was so overblown and contrived. Many of the descriptions are heartbreaking and beautiful on their own. However, when every other sentence is dense with this sort of rich writing, it is just crippling to the flow of the story. Here are just a couple of the passages I highlighted:<br /><br />Oh, how the clouds stumbled in and assembled stupidly in the sky. Great obese clouds. Dark and plump. Bumping into each other. Apologizing. Moving on and finding room. Children were there, quick as, well, quick as kids gravitating toward a fight. (Lydia’s note: all of that florid writing and then he can’t form a proper simile for how quickly the children rushed to see the fight?)<br /><br />At that moment, you will be lying there (I rarely find people standing up). You will be caked in your own body. There might be a discovery; a scream will dribble down the air. The only sound I’ll hear after that will be my own breathing, and the sound of the smell, of my footsteps.<br />I was assured by my family and friends that The Book Thief did, indeed, get better. I was encouraged to stick with it. “The end result is worth it,” they told me. I am the type that has a very hard time discarding a book once I’ve started it. I hate to just abandon a story without finishing it. So, I endeavored to persevere.<br /><br />It did get better. Marginally. The further and further away from the first-person Death narration I got, the more I enjoyed and appreciated the novel. It’s a good premise – a girl learns the power of words, finds solace in them, and finds ways to cope in a bad situation. The characters Zusak creates are compelling, if a little flat. The friendship between Liesel and the boy next door, Rudy, is sweet and poignant. I wanted to learn more about some of the more peripheral characters, especially about the Mayor’s wife, Ilsa Herrmann.<br /><br />I understand the appeal of this novel, and can see why so many people rate it and speak of it so highly. It was just not my style, and I admit to sharing Mr. Darcy’s character defect in Pride and Prejudice - my good opinion once lost is lost forever. I had such a difficult time overcoming my initial distaste for the writing style that it clouded my opinion of the entire book.<br /><br />As I said, Iwill see the film. I think I will enjoy it more than I did the reading of the novel. At the same time that I disliked it, though, so many people can’t be wrong about it, and I’d recommend that you read it to form your own judgment.

B0034G4P94|5|As a fan of mixed martial arts, I ordered this movie on demand expecting to get a little mindless action. What I got was a well-acted movie with real, believable characters and a plot that satisfies but doesn't cheapen the ending by giving in to sentimentality. Some characters reconcile, some don't- that's real life and that's how they ended this movie. The MMA action was surprisingly well-done, though flawed. Striking and submissions were reasonably good but some of the throws were cartoonish. If the director had resisted the urge to include a few over-the-top moments this movie would have been just about perfect.

B002Q1YDLI|3|This was a quick and enjoyable read. Sometimes I got distracted because I knew this would never happen in real life, but the author had a way of rooting for the characters even the self-absorbed Darcy. I'm happy that Darcy grew into herself and gaining a lot of substance as the story continued. The literature was a little wanting, but great for a summer read.

B009R659L8|5|As usual, the author gives a brilliantly written book with twists and turns around every corner. I have always been a fan of Mary Higgins Clark and will continue to read anything she writes.
1452138052|5|Excellent book!
B0000CDLA7|5|I hear people complaining about how bad this album is, that \\"they've turned to crappy metal\\" or \\"they're not prog!\\" Seriously, if you think THIS album sucks, go buy a little album I like to call \\"St. Anus\\". True TOT isn't their best, but at least Mike Portnoy doesn't sound like he's banging his drum sticks on trash cans, and that John Petrucci can still solo. Seriously, I cannot believe how many negative reviews this album got! The poor liddle kiddies (or should I say kiddY) who are still POed at Kevin Moore for leaving the band must be working over-time. Seriously, don't you have lives besides writing negative TOT reviews all day? I bet 70% of the negative reviews came from the same person! Now that I got the rant off my chest, I will now review the album. Train of Thought, Dream Theater's 2003 studio album, is their heaviest yet. James LaBrie's vocals are as great as ever, John Petrucci still has those breath-taking guitar solos, John Myung's bass-lines are still HEARABLE, Mike Portnoy's drums are still amazing, and Jordan Rudess has those keyboard solos that sound like messed up guitar solos. Read on to see my review for the tracks<br /><br />1. As I Am - The first single. Sounds ver Metallica-influenced. I like the lyrics \\"I wish I weren't so ****ed\\". A favorite 5/5<br /><br />2. This Dying Soul - Very good song. Has a great double-bass pedal from Mike at the beginning. John's guitar solo rules. Also, at around 3:40, there's this CRUSHING riff. 5/5<br /><br />3. Endless Sacrifice - My second favorite song. It's very balladic, with a heavy chorus. The lyrics are very great. 5/5<br /><br />4. Honor Thy Father - The lyrics are a little lacking, and James' vocals can be better. but it still rules. Possibly the most chaotic song on the album. 5/5<br /><br />5. Vacant - The shortest and softest (also the only song without heavy riffs) on the album. It's not bad, but not my favorite. 4.5/5<br /><br />6. Stream of Consciousness [Instrumental] - It's an instrumental, and an amazing one at that! If \\"As I AM\\" is DT's \\"Enter Sandman\\", and \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" is their \\"Fade to Black\\", then this is their \\"Orion\\"! 5/5<br /><br />7. In the Name of God - The BEST song on the album! About how Chrisitans use God to justify violence and inhumanity. The piano at the end sends a chill down my spine. 555555555555555555555555/5<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />Is \\"Train of Thought\\" a horrible sell-out album, an underrated masterpiece, or just a misunderstood album? Truly a misunderstood, underrated masterpiece, one of 2003's best. You might be disappointed if you're acustomed to DT's old sound, but if you are a true DT fan or just have great taste in music, feel free to purchase this.instrumental, and an amazing one at that!

B006LSZECO|2|Ending was horrid. Disappointing.
B0087OSP0S|5|I enjoyed this story it was amazing!!!!. The characters and glorious mythology demands your attention and you can't let go. You get lost in the beauty of vivid detailed imagination of this author. This is a masterful writing of Ms. Morris, Can't wait to read more from this outstanding author.
B008VBYN80|5|I will rate this game under 5 categories.<br />1) Controls; In my opinion, controls are a big part of mobile games. Luckily, Kingdoms and Lords bring great controls to your device. Easy to use and simple, you can understand them right off the bat.<br />2) Combat; Personally, the combat system should be based off beating other peoples kingdoms. But since it dosent, I'll grade it off what it did. Turn-Based, Small fights, but strategic. 5/5<br />3) Multiplayer; Great! Works well.<br />4) Money System: Lots of money from taxes, and has an energy cap. Love it!<br />5) Overall Rank from 1 to 100; 94%, combat took of 6%, other than that great game.
0062238868|5|Along with Marcus Luttrell's Service this book is amazing. I can't stop putting down this book after I read it once.
B0058YPL66|5|My daughter and I enjoyed watching this together. The story lines are intriguing. Not your run of the mill Princess story! Fairy Tales with a twist!
B0020BUWX2|4|I really enjoyed this book and I have the next one on hold.
B001CD3PLU|1|First of all, let me say that I love The Goonies movie. This review is not about the movie.    The copy of the movie that is being offered here is not a Region 1 (USA) copy. It is a Region 2 (Europe) copy. It is not a 1080p version of the movie either, which is easy enough to see when you view it. There weren't any previews, copyright protection notices, chapters or any menus on the disc either. Once the movie starts to play it can only be paused, stopped, fast forwarded or rewound, no skipping to the next chapter (it wasn't encoded with chapters). This disc doesn't have any extras, menus, commentaries or anything.    I have lived all over the world and have movies from all over the world in my collection. However, this copy looks and feels like an illegal copy that you can pick up for a couple of dollars at any Southeast Asia Electronics market. If this is an illegal copy, it would be the first Blu-ray copy that I have seen; maybe the bootleg market has caught up to Blu-ray already, but I hope not. The \\"shrink wrap\\" on this movie was not a factory shrink wrap either, again, it was the type of wrapping you find on illegal bootleg copies; it looks like its sealed by a peel and stick type of wrapper.     As a comparison, I watched my DVD version, up-converted by my BD Player. The DVD version was of a higher quality and I had all of the menus and chapters.     In short, don't be scammed by this bad bootleg copy.

B00004WIDQ|1|Buy the widescreen edition instead (unless your tv is really small, of course you should just buy the widescreen edition and get a larger tv in that case).
B00I2TV3NO|4|Liked it of course. But it is getting to a point where the excitement is dying down at least for adults like me. May be more suited for teenagers.
B00FCQQ1IW|5|Love this series!  Archer gives his characters life, and I feel as if I've met each of them in person.  This is #4 in the Clifton Chronicles series, but each book can stand alone.  However, it is so easy to get hooked on Archer's writing that you'll want to read all of them.  Wish #5 would come out sooner!
B009UX2YAC|5|Sub way surfers is one of the best game nut would be better with more power ups. But other than that it is awesome
B002QRWJA4|5|Loved the movie. Gave a great plot, great story. The music was awesome. You are torn between liking and hating him. Ending was so sad,but ended well. I have little to no complaints about it.
B004XQO90O|5|A bit of an overreach but it will  keep you on the edge of your seat.

B00L9B7IKE|4|A good read written by Hawkins. I've not read many of her books prior to  this, but, intend to now.
B00L436E7A|5|If u like the skateboard toy. U will like this game. This game will make u want to play and play. So get this app and try for ur self. It's like goin back.  Like I had this skateboarding toy when it's was cool. But now it's better I have it on my kindle fire HD and it's great. U can't not like this game.
0446310786|5|I had never read this book before, but have been wanting to see the movie. So I decided to read the book first. Loved it! Now I can't wait to see the movie!
630280082X|5|This is a movie that I first rented because it had an awesome guitar duel at the end in. I wasn't expecting much of a story, but I got one. From the first scene where Robert Johnson records his record to the last with Joe  Seneca and Ralph Macchio walk down the old highway, it is a great ride. The  plot is excellent, the music is great, and the guitar duel between Eugene  (Ralph) and Jack Butler (Steve Vai) is jaw dropping. Of course, Ralph isn't  actually playing the parts;someone named Ry Cooper(?) is. It's awesome.
B00005O3VC|5|This film is still hilarious and the extras are fun.<br />I never knew that the colors were as bright as they are on this DVD.  My previous two  video versions are very grainy and washed out, this is far superior.
B00FKF0F3C|5|Thought the book was great but it brought back some sad memories living in Savannah at the time of the Cuban crisis. My school<br />school children were taken to the railroad tracks and shown how they would be put on these trains for survival and told if we got<br />attacked we might not get to see their parents for sometime, of course time was good to us and all.<br />Enjoyed the way it was written.

B000YI68EA|5|I bought this watch for my 17 year old stepdaughter.  She loves it and wears it everywhere.  I remember when I was 17 (I am now 38) and everyone was wearing a Swatch watch, it was the \\"IT\\" watch.  It makes me feel good to know that my stepdaughter likes the same thing I did when I was her age.

B001B0G5WA|5|Love the album and it is 180 grams which is not written in the description
B00004YW6I|4|I have three or four PJ Harvey CDs, and my favorite one is Is This Desire?, which is widely hailed as her worst.  The others I frankly just didn't get.<br />This one, though, I do.  Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea is haunting, engaging, and passionate.  The songs make you feel her pain, her lust, her love.  They transport you to the city, then take you back to the sea.  It's wonderful music, plain and simple - just what I expect in a good rock album.<br />Harvey rocks.  There's a reason why this CD was on all the 'unsung heroes' lists of 2000 - it's great.  Pick it up - you won't regret it!
B00ADQPB50|1|What a disappointing follow-up to the first wonderful season!  In the second season, it seems as if they've taken every overworked, tired horror trope and thrown it in:  The uptight, sexually repressed sadistic nun, the mad doctor who thrives on human experimentation, the asylum itself, the newspaper reporter who wants that big scoop and goes inside to get it, etc., etc., etc.!  Season two shows almost no creativity, no interesting new ideas.  Plus, they've used two of the characters from Season One, which tends to throw you off balance, because they are totally different characters in this season--much like the mistake that was made in the movie &#34;Fierce Creatures&#34; after the success of  &#34;A Fish Called Wanda.&#34;  What a shame.  Well, let's hope they can pull this mess out of the water with a brilliant third season.  Until then, I'll just re-watch season one rather than waste my eyesight on this season.
B000OQF6N6|5|Before I listened to this cd I read the reviews, which go from one extreme to the other.  As a Smashing Pumpkins fan, I really like this body of work.  Actually, I think it's Corgans finest work since Siamese Dream.  It's totally and completely what rock and roll should be.  There are no slow Sad Mellon Collie songs on the disk, which is a good thing (I absolutely HATE slow songs).      The music is just damn good.  Chamberlin is one of the greatest rock drummers of all time.  He's the power of Keith Moon, and the technique Neil Peart combined.  There are no spaces in his drumming.  Billy's guitar work is terrific, and what I hoped to here in this compilation.  After I read that he did all of the guitar work, I thought perhaps James Aha would be missed, but evidently Billy redid not only D'Arcy's bass parts, but James as well in the past.  Anyway, who needs them?  Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin ARE the Smashing Pumpkins, and I think Billy realized that after he kicked James out of the band the first time.    The DVD is awesome.  I was a little pissed that there were no liner notes or reading material inside the cd (I have the black and white cover one), but you don't need reading material when you have a package as thorough as the one Billy put together.  Finally, someone understands what a CD/DVD package should be.  I'm a huge fan of David Bowie.  I have his Reality disk.  Love the music, but the DVD totally sucks.  I'm also a big Beatles fan.  Bought the Love cd but the dvd is totally worthless.  Any band that puts together a cd/dvd package should first preview the dvd that comes with Zeitgeist so that they can have an idea how it should be done.  After listening to the cd three times thus far, I'm ready to view the dvd again.  I only paid like $11.99 for the package, and it's the best $11.99 plus tax I ever paid for anything, especially something this good.    I started to rate this one 4 stars because the mix is somewhat muffled.  I hope the next piece the SPput out has a clearer, cleaner sound, but the lyrics are great, the music is sonic, and the dvd is a fantastic extra, so I think it merits 5 stars.    If you are a Smashing Pumpkins fan, I mean a REAL fan, you should buy this cd because it is the Smashing Pumpkins at their best.
B00KG2NGPS|4|I was somewhat disappointed in this film. This is apparently one of those where they show the best scenes in the trailers. It was a good picture, had a lot of genuine talent in it, but there was no spark there. Something I can't put my finger on is missing. The character development was definitely lacking, was that it? Maybe. The art works were not well explained or &#34;showcased&#34;. That could have been it. I just don't know. All I can say is, it's not near as good as the hype. I gave it 4 stars only because of all the good actors (somebody wasted) here.
B00IUBM8PQ|5|Great movie!! The story line was almost exact to the book. There were many details that were captured. Loved it!
B000E6FSPW|5|very good album
B003Y5H556|4|This movie is a low budget horror/thriller twist on the Red Riding Hood story.  Don't expect oscar worthy acting but it's a good movie and the HD transfer is great!
B000RPTQ1C|5|Coldplay seem to just keep getting better. This is a different approach, especially the title track with strings (which I love) but that's just the tip of the iceberg. This is a really good album and I'm happy to hear how they've continued breaking new ground as a band. Great lyrics, playing and as always well engineered with very big sound to it. Jonny Buckland has some catchy riffs on this and his hooks direct the songs in subtle but strong ways. It would be interesting to hear him really take center stage but what he does is cool. Overall I'd have to say this is my favorite album of theirs yet and a consistent pleasure to listen to!
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Enjoyed this game. The graphics are truly outstanding This game had me so hooked that I could not put it down until I completed it  I am looking forward to more games from this company
B00006JL1Z|4|Save Me, Tango in the Night, That's Alright are not part of this album. Instead we get No Questions  Asked, Skies the Limit and Paper Doll-Yuck! Save Me was their only hit from Behind the Mask and it's not here. I hate when  artists do this. If they're gonna say the &quot;Very Best of&quot; it better be. It must be a royalty thing, or a marketing strategy. Hell, Stevie put Whole Lotta Trouble, Desert Angel and  Loves a Hard  Game to Play on her Greatest Hits and they weren't even hits. She managed to leave off Nightbird and After the Glitter Fades. I was upset. Seven Wonders wasn't on  the Macs first greatest hits.<br />However, this still  manages to be a great album only because their worst  songs  are a level higher than most artists best.
B00992CF6W|5|Love it!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5|It really makes you think what goes where and how it all connects together to make it to the next floor. I can`t wait to try the second one.

B0009R1T7M|4|Beautiful melodies, the zoom out/zoom in from the historical to the personal and the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink production make this one of the years best records. This is a celebration of the Land Of Lincoln with stops in Chicago, Rockport, and Highland to name a few and populated by such disparate characters as Blackhawk, Carl Sandberg and John Wayne Gacy. It is an ambitious project that suceeeds most of the time, my favorites being 'Casimir Pulaski Day' and 'The Predatory Wasp Of The Pallisades Is Out To Get Us!'. Sometimes Steven's reach exceeds his grasp,like on the John Wayne Gacy song which strikes me as sophomoric, but if you like lush production and pop melodies, you owe it to yourself to give this a listen.
B00IFOKUB2|4|Finally feels like the series has an ending and still leaves you wishing for more. I loved Veronica mars series and all the characters. Recommend to my friends
B000LE1GVW|4|In an era where many artists feel the need to be political outspoken - Paolo Nutini puts the fun back into music. From the peppy riffs and beats to the feel good lyrics, you just can't help but love the bubble gum happy music of These Streets!
B001C08RHA|5|I'm usualy pretty pick when it comes to movies but I was unexpectedly impressed with this movie. It's an action packed movied with a good story line.
B00K35I5ZO|5|The record plays perfectly all the way through.
B000MRA5EM|5|IMAX is the standard film that all others are judged by.<br /><br />This is a stunningly well made film. The narration by Johnny Depp & Kate Winslet explore the values & virtues of a dieing Planet.<br /><br />I bought a used DVD for very little & am fully satisfied with my choice.<br /><br />I buy lots of Nature films...especially IMAX.
B007R11DKQ|1|fantasy movie with a confusing plot. Could not follow and it did not keep my attention. De niros role is minor and shows up only at the end. Waste of time.
B00EI2Y4MQ|5|The ease of use  the app was free the calculator does what it says very easy to use give it a try
B0021L8UPS|3|Yep, the father in this film really has the blinders on.  He does not want to see what is right in front of him.  He takes the orphan's side over that of his wife and kids.  Also, there is a weird scene with him and Esther on the couch when he's been drinking wine but seems to be drugged.  And I find it hard to believe that the little sister would have the physical strength to help lug a body around, or even to knock Esther down.  Also, why didn't the orphanage know more info about where Esther came from in the first place? Big plot hole.<br /><br />However, there is a real, creepy factor at work in the film. Esther is just too advanced, too good to be true, highly manipulative, and well played by the young actor.  Nice locations too, and CCH Pounder is always good in just about any role she takes on.<br /><br />It's worth a rental, if not a purchase.
B00E1LT41K|4|For those who enjoy historical fiction or stories taking place during this time period, you should enjoy The White Queen which is based on the books by Philipa Gregory.  The costumes and scenery look and feel authentic to the time period for the most part, and I found the acting enjoyable.  The series starts off pretty fast-paced through the first few episodes but after that seems to lag a bit, I wish they had spent a little more time on some of the issues that arise throughout the series.  For those who are history buffs or sticklers for detail you will likely have a hard time with this.  When it comes to turning history into a tv series I think it's rather expected that they will forego many and sometimes important details just to make the story more interesting or make the series last longer.  Overall it was a fun series, I'm curious to see if they'll extend it and film another season based on some of the other characters.

B000ZN8036|5|Actually this review is about the movie. The dvd worked perfectly. The movie is simply a must for all who wish to see things, both past and present, from a unique and different perspective. The story of Chris McCandless makes you think about what's really important for you, in your life as a human being, and how hard can be to strive to achieve your ends.

B005CGI3ZG|5|A nice and compact collection of one of the defining series of 90s American TV culture.<br /><br />The series is not only a manifestation of teen culture but its a representation of an Era in its finest glory.<br /><br />I d recommend everyone to purchase this if you are fan of dawsons creek and more importantly, a fan of good tv
0060763280|5|I once read that 10% of the people control 90% of the wealth and 90% of the people control 10% of the wealth. Like the ninety percenters the ten percenters come in all shape, size and colors. The diffrence of the two groups is the way they think. This book gets to the heart of the matter. Get your taughts right. Wealth starts in the head. Be the master of your taughts!!! You get this right and you will become a ten percenter.    Thank you Harv.
1476753164|5|Yet again CoHo and her words have completely blown me away. I loved this book and am so glad for the entire experience including the incredible sound track by Griffin Peterson﻿. I loved it before I read the book but I have a brand new appreciation for it after reading the story.<br /><br />Buy Maybe Someday and the sound track, you will not regret it. &#60;3<br /><br />&#34;There are only twenty-six letters in the English alphabet. You would think there would only be so much you could do with twenty-six letters. You would think there were only so many ways those letters could make you feel when mixed up and shoved together to make words.<br />However, there are infinite ways those twenty-six letters can make a person feel, and this song is living proof. I'll never understand how a few simple words strung together can change a person, but this song, these words are completely changing me.&#34; Sydney - Maybe Someday﻿
B00B7Y0206|4|This is a REALLY good app (the videos rarely buffer) but the app itself is kind of jittery and slow, when the video is minimised if you move the screen up and down to look at the comments the video pauses which is kind of annoying and after the video has stopped it exits and goes to the home screen. I recommend an update with these things plus allowing the video to start of minimized first then choose if you want full screen. This is just me being picky but this does not mean that this is not an excellent app, i actually use this more than the sideloaded youtube app, great app just a few adjustments needed, it is definitely reccomended
B00005QG9J|5|I first got into Incubus when they released SCIENCE and I thought it was awesome but not perfect.  Now their sound has really changed but it is for the better.  They've ditched the funky guitars and speedy vocals for impressive singing.  If you really liked Make Yourself, then this is the perfect cd for you.  It's got some fast songs like Nice to Know You and Circles which are similar to Privelige.  It also has slow soft songs too like Mexico and Echo which sound like the sequels to Drive and Stellar.  Are You In? is a really cool song that should be played at parties and barbecues cuz it has a really chill vibe to it.  Aqueous Transmission also shows more experimentation with a groovy Japanese theme.  Get this album if you need music to relax to.

B005LJETYI|5|I loved the movie Edge of Tomorrow, so when I found out that it was based on a book I wanted to check the book out as well to see if it gave any more insight on the sometimes confusing time travel mechanics of the movie. While I still love the movie, All You Need is Kill is definitely another example of the &#34;the book is better&#34; trope. The sci-fi mechanics are more defined, which is nice, but you also learn a lot more about the characters as well. Highly recommend it.

B000V86OKG|5|that 'dexter' is an excellent series with the exceptional performance of michael c. hall. a very fine actor, who was also outstanding as the gay  funeral director in 'six feet under.'  based on the vast wasteland tv has become, i'd like to congratulate showtime on presenting ,imho, the two finest dramas presently still in production; those being 'dexter' and 'brotherhood.'  since 'the wire' is no longer, hbo, still has two wonderful shows; 'curb your enthusiasm' and 'big love.' but not much else.  and two big thumbs up for the best of all cable staions, fx. 'rescue me', 'the shield',  and 'damages' are all awesome. i find it extremely hard to believe that 'fx' is in any way related to the very lame 'fox' network.  as for the major networks, it's a swamp of terrible shows; the only series on the major networks i can watch without being embarrassed is 'the office.'it appears that 'abc', 'nbc', cbs, and 'fox' think the majority of the american populace is stupid; based on the longevity of the garbage these networks put out, perhaps they're right.
031623480X|5|David Perlmutter is an unique neurologist who, for years, has used a natural metabolic approach to neurological disorders in his clinical practice as well as expounded on these in his excellent books and international lecutreships.  In this book he describes how our western inflammatory diet &#34;sets the brain on fire&#34; resulting in progressive neurodegeneration.  More importantly, he describes how understanding and then altering our carbohydrate, fat and protein intake can have dramatic effects on brain function.  I particularly appreciated his description of intermittent fasting, how it increases BDNF to stimulate new brain cells and also activates genes to enhance health and longevity.  This ketogenic diet may also play a major role in the treatment of malignant brain tumors as well other cancers through a metabolic approach perhaps combined with standard practices or radiation and chemotherapy.<br />This easily readable factual and well referenced book is a must read for all concerned with brain health.
B00023B1LC|5|The widescreen effect is almost full screen and since I have a DVD player that enhances older videos to look close to HD quality I was thrilled to find this one.  It is a classic and a keeper.
B000AYEL6U|2|This movie is great!  However, after watching it only 2 or 3 times, the disc is skipping already.  I am disappointed that the product would start malfunctioning so early.
B000FC13E0|4|This is not the most mentally stimulating read ever - I was not very attached to the characters and it didn't blow my mind. However, it is an excellent way to pass time on an airplane or the beach. I'd much rather read this than watch tv. I didn't regret the purchase.
B006LSZECO|5|Always keeps you guessing. Lots of twists and turns you aren't expecting. Great book.
B00FWPWNKS|5|Match 3 - 4 - 5 fruits, played like bejeweled and chuzzle styled games, but with obstacles/tasks to achieve too.<br />There's 3 difficulty levels(easy, med, hard)<br />With 60 levels to beat, it will keep your attention for awhile.<br />For $0.99 it's a good time killer while you're waiting around. I would buy it if it wasn't the FAOTD the day I got it. I hope Bullbitz makes another sequel to Fruit Drops Part II, I will definitely purchase it...<br />I played this on a Galaxy Note 3, Note 2 and a Tab2 10.1 all running 4.3
B000006NPY|4|This is the Pumpkins departure from guitar driven rock into the world of electronica.  It's dark, brooding and filled with Corrigan's haunting lyrics.  The album's primary problem is it's length, some of the better songs near the end become obscured by the many similar tempo songs.<br /><br />At its release this alienated a lot of Smashing Pumpkin fans.  It's well worth a second look now.  It's a change from their previous albums, but it's more of a step forward than a complete break with the past.
B009XIXVU6|5|While it is sometimes difficult to follow due to the intertwining both with characters and time, this is a very well written book written by an incredible story teller.  I always learn something from Hosseini's books.
B005OT2YVA|1|It was painful to watch. I was tempted to give it two stars - I love his parents in this movie - until Sam and his girlfriend hopped into the company car after finding out her boss worked for the deceptions. It was just bad.
B000AJIAOO|5|I had gotten a CD from amazon and was so pleased with it i decided to buy another which was this CD. It is unavailable in stores where im located and amazon was the solution to my dilema. I received this CD two days after a ordered it as promised and im very pleased i again decided to buy another. I love the CD and would honestly buy it again from amazon over and over again
B00FB13Y74|5|I love angry birds so I am happy it's a race game
B000W74EQC|5|I love this movie, and so happy for this product! When HP and the SS first came out on DVD, I spent way too much money on the cardboard, fold-out case with bonus discs and plastic inserts that came unglued and made the discs pop out. When my children finally, definitively destroyed both the case and the disc, it was time for a replacement. How happy it made me to find this very inexpensive, simplified presentation of this movie. It's a plastic case, when you open it, there is one simple disc that contains the movie. That's it! That's all I need! I may have to replace my Chamber of Secrets DVD as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I like the ending the best it was so cute but the rest of the book was so awesome and so sad
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I love this app
0143038419|5|I will not try to explain why you must read this, because I don't want to influence your experience. But for myself, and many of my friends and family ... this book has been a life altering read and a completely positive experience. I am CERTAIN you will enjoy it.
B00CD36FF6|3|it is an interesting book describing some experiments related to human behaviour related to lies. I was expecting more of an essay with real inside and proper conclusions, but instead it is more or less just citing experiments one after the other.
B007B5EDEG|5|Fantastic TV Series, but the books are better! Once you start reading, it is hard to put down, you can so easily visualise what the author is describing, it is as if you are right there, watching, listening, almost able to touch, the scenes and people around.
B00110K62U|5|I have wanted this DVD of Les Miserable, for some time and was glad to find it for $25.00. The DVD did stick at one point and that scared me.
B00NFQSW1U|5|LOVE IT!
B00NMXY2MO|1|I bought this product in order to use a headset on my computer that was lacking the appropriate inputs.  The package arrived today and I plugged the Adapter into an open USB slot and the headset didn't work.  I pulled the adapter out of the usb and the adapter fell apart.  The casing around the chip on the inside fell off and the usb male end just fell off.  This review isn't fair because maybe the product does work however I will never know.

The first four \\"Batman\\" films are represented here with 2 discs covering each film in widescreen with Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS, with director's commentary.<br /><br />\\"Batman\\"<br /> - Disc 1: feature film & one (!) theatrical trailer (\\"Warner\\" advertised the sh*t out of this film in 1989 & all they put is one release trailer!)<br /><br />Disc 2: On the set with Bob Kane -the creator of \\"Batman\\" takes a small tour thru the set of the first film. It lasts about 2 minutes & really isn't worth losing sleep over, if you miss it.<br /><br />\\"Shadows Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight\\" Parts 1-3: this is definitely worth checking out. Everything you pretty much need to know about the progression of Batman from the comic pages of D.C. to the big screen release of the first film is here. If there is a reason to get this box set this is it. Big thumbs up.<br /><br />\\"Legends OF The Dark Knight: The History Of Batman\\"<br />Need another reason to own this box set? here it is. Doc covers the complete history of Batman, from an idea of Bob Kane's, to comic hero, to T.V. star of the 60's, to big screen Dark Knight hero of the 80's & 90's. Another big thumbs up.<br /><br />\\"Batman\\" Documentary Gallery - O.K. look behind the scenes at making the film. From the gadgets & sets, to the costumes & the score. Cool enough to look at, but, something you would expect from a box set like this.<br /><br />Hero & Villians Profiles - basically, a bit of a rehash look at the main characters from the first film.<br /><br />Robin storyboard sequence - an idea that was dropped & might have actually pissed off a lot \\"Batman\\" fans. Basically, it's a chase sequence with Batman chasing The Joker through the streets of Gotham City. The chase eventually leads to a circus, The Flying Graysons, & the origin of Robin. I, personally, thought this sequence was overkill & makes you question did the filmakers need to have the Joker be responsible for both the origins of Batman & Robin?<br /><br />Prince's music videos - yup. Oversexed & silly even for it's time. I couldn't even sit through watching \\"Batdance\\". Prince is O.K., but, can you really take a man seriously when he's dressed as half-bat, half-clown? I call it half-as*ed.<br /><br />\\"Batman Returns\\"<br />- Disc 1: Feature film & theatrical trailer (yeah, just one)<br />- Disc 2: \\"The Bat, The Cat, & The Penguin\\" - original CBS special shown with a repeat showing of \\"Batman\\" in June of 1992, a couple of weeks before the release of \\"Batman Returns\\". Robert Urich hosts & its pretty cheesy in some areas.<br /><br />\\"Shadow Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight\\" Part 4 - decent chronicle of the history of \\"Batman Returns\\". There is a big problem, however, with the interviews. All of the Michael Keaton, & some of the Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito interviews are rehashed from the CBS special, & its like watching pete & repeat. Nothing has been changed. My advice watch this first then go to the CBS special.

B00FG5FRG6|4|This movie is gorgeously filmed and engagingly acted. It's use of special effects is at once innovative, sometimes moving, and always restrained.  The story jumps around. A lot. If you dislike nonlinear narratives, then this movie might not be for you.  I spent a sleepless night trying to figure out the internal logic of the movie, which I suppose is a measure of its quality, that I would even bother thinking about it. Here is what I came up. I don't think this gives away anything. And it's just one person's opinion.  The movie brings together two pop science ideas: parallel universes and chaos theory. The idea of parallel universes is that every moment spawns infinitely many, nearly identical universes. The idea of chaos theory is that two systems with imperceptible initial differences can nevertheless have radically different futures. So, here's my take on the central character of the movie. If there are infinitely many, wildly divergent universes spawned at each moment, then in one of them, there must eventually be a version of you who is not only the last mortal on the planet, but who also knows what has happened in all the infinitude of other alternate universes. Why not, right? If there are infinities upon infinities of universes out there, then anything that can conceivably happen WILL in fact happen in one of them. I don't know if this interpretation is right, wrong, or sideways. But check the movie out, and spend a sleepless night trying to make your own sense of it :)
B003O86FMW|1|I know these books are written for teens and possibly young adults, but I really wonder at the competence of the writer. This delivers a rise and repeat theme from the first book with zero creativity. The characters are annoying as jar jar binks. It's as if this book was written from the perspective of some lustful teen with pseudo sexual tension and angst. I kept asking myself why I was reading such lame material. One star for attempting to write a book, I must recognize determination at least.
B000006O7C|5|This album compares and contrasts with his previous album &quot;Grace.&quot; It compares with it by invoking the same sort of romantic nerve of everyone's deep down soul.  It contrasts by doing it in a  totally new and fresh way. Eliot Smith's album, XO, comes to mind when i  listen to this album, but they both stand alone on their own platforms.  Listen to &quot;Haven't You Heard&quot; for the most amazing song to ever  be recorded. So, if you liked &quot;Grace&quot; expect the same quality,  just a in a different way.
B004XDYJRU|1|The paid version of this app is surprisingly not nearly as stable as the free version.  My Galaxy Nexus would repeatedly lose and crash the audio component on the device as result  of running this app.  It also buffered consistently which was annoying.  The content of the app is terrific.  Unfortunately,  I deleted it and returned to the free version offered on Google Play.  It's an odd occurrence when the supposed \\"upgrade is actually a downgrade.\\"

B0006L16N8|5|I love X & Y. this is my favorite Coldplay album by far because from the opening track of \\"Square One\\" to the very end, it doesn't have any filler tracks. Every song is great and could be a potential single.

B004EPYZZ8|5|This is a sweet story of faith and perserverance. My 11 year old has watched it several times already but my older kids also have enjoyed it as well.
0374105235|4|This book has an impact that will leave you reeling -- mostly because it's true, and because there are so few books like it anywhere.  It lets you explore from the inside what it's like to be caught as a child in a senseless, apparently never-ending civil war -- then to become a child soldier in that war, and to claw your way back.  I couldn't put the book down; it was amazing. <br /> <br />That said, I gave it four stars rather than five because -- seen as a novel, not just as a harrowing true story -- I was left feeling frustrated and unsatisfied in parts.  The subject matter and pacing is riveting, but it's all told at an odd emotional distance.  For instance, we don't really see much of his transition from scared little boy into merciless child soldier -- one day he's a normal child, and literally the next day he's an inhuman killing machine.  We are told about (but don't experience) his nightmares or his headaches or the fears and difficulties he felt as he tried to return to society.  Much of the book, in fact, is telling rather than showing; the book is good because the \\"showing\\" parts are utterly amazing, and because of the power of even just the telling. Nevertheless, we as readers see what he does but don't feel what he feels: so it just feels a bit emotionally distant, especially given the impact the events could have had.  <br /> <br />That all said, it's still an incredibly good book.  And I'm aware that the author probably wouldn't want to go into that level of emotional detail in a book made for the world to read -- plus he may, either as a result of his experiences or as a mechanism for dealing with them, actually feel some emotional distance himself. And while my enjoyment of it as a piece of literature is at the four stars level, my enjoyment of it as a human being, and as citizen in today's world, is at five stars.  Go read it.
B0001NBMBC|4|Iowa is there best work done. This album is still amazing Vermilion is a good song and i recommend this cd
B002ZG99QS|3|If nothing else, 'Tron Legacy' is Sci-Fi eye-candy.  Of course 'Tron Legacy' has some visual appeal that immediately hooks in the audience.  There are discuses which are thrown as weapons in stadium duels between man and machine, artificial crowd cheering, and vehicles that ride in Matrix-like slow-motion arcs that splash wild neon colors in high-tech chase scenes.    There's a trade off that takes place between the original Tron and the sequel, 'Tron Legacy'.  And judging both entities is really a matter of separating the story from the special effects.  (Although taking a movie apart in not an entirely fair way to judge a movie.)    Call me old-fashioned.  Call me clueless, but, while I love how the new visuals' striking appeal, and I really enjoyed how they linked time together by having Flynn's son visit his father's old arcade after he mysteriously disappeared from his Fortune 500 company (as well as rebooting the sequel by having Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner on the screen) the pregnant pauses for narrative and a too-often pensive story-line take away the excitement and urgency found in the primitive original.     Further that with more stagnant and less compelling chase sequences in between, and I thought much of the magic was lost.  The fights in the inner space bar seem lame and familiar--especially if you consider the original 'Star Wars' as the standard.  Chris Pine or Channing Tatum could just have easily taken the part of Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund).  This young protagonist, along with a few others were far from a stellar cast, except for Bridges who could play his character with the vitality and looks easily reminiscent of his younger performance--alongside with his aging counterpart, a Zen recluse (a captive to his own technology) and his nemesis/alter ego (Clu).  Olivia Wilde as the heroine, Quorra, doesn't do much for the proceedings either.  Bruce Boxleitner is merely a token memory of the original.    I truly remember the original 'Tron' backin the early eighties.  It transported me to a place I had never been before.  In college video games had invigorated our recreation time with \\"Donkey Kong,\\" \\"Pac-Man,\\" and \\"Centipede,\\" which gave us study breaks and a hefty escape from the pressures of college.  Tron delivered us into that same world in a sustaining way by combining a convincing mix of arcade life and real life.  The visuals and the world created there were both unique and mesmerizing.  By the time the protagonist was brought back to life outside the game, I felt I had been gone a long time.    'Tron Legacy' remains worthy as a minor arcade, a nice milestone party, and a bit of memory filing experience--not unlike a thirty year high school reunion, but, in the end, the film is a forgettable ride that might be worth taking only once.

B00EAZTONU|5|I loved the original movie and the extended edition is more of what we expect from a movie like this. I have to admit that some of the extras don't exactly paint the dwarves in a positive light but I think it goes back to why the elves and dwarves don't always spend time together.<br /><br />The figurine came in and looked just like the picture so it was exactly what I expected.<br /><br />The packaging was adequate and it arrived on the day promised.

0143113100|4|Neuroplasticity.    The idea that our brains are fixed, hard-wired machines was (and in many cases still is) so deeply entrenched in the scientific establishment that evidence to the contrary was not only suppressed, but often not even seen because the minds of even respectable scientists could not absorb what they were certain was impossible.  Having been familiar since the 1960s with the work of Glenn Doman and the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, the idea that the human brain is continually changing itself and can recover from injury in astonishing ways did not surprise me. In fact, the only shock was that in a 400 page book on neuroplasticity and the persecution of its early pioneers I found not one mention of Doman's name. But the stories are none the less astonishing for that.    In Chapter 1 we meet woman whose vestibular system was destroyed by antibiotic side-effects.  She is freed by a sensor held on her tongue and a computerized helmet from the severely disabling feeling that she is falling all the time, even when lying flat.  That's the stuff of science fiction, but what's most astounding is that the effect lingers for a few minutes after she removes the apparatus the first time, and after several sessions she no longer needs the device.    Chapter 3, \\"Redesigning the Brain,\\" on the work of Robert Merzenich, including the ground-breaking Fast ForWord learning program, is worth the cost of the book all by itself.    Sensitive readers may want to steer clear of Chapter 4, \\"Acquiring Tastes and Loves,\\" or risk being left with unwanted, disturbing mental images.  But it is a must read for anyone who wants to believe that pornography is harmless, or that our personal, private mental fantasies do not adversely affect the very structure of our brains.    The book is less impressive when it gets away from hard science and into psychotherapy, as the ideas become more speculative, but the stories are still impressive.    Phantom pain, learning disabilities, autism, stroke recovery, obsessions and compulsions, age-related mental decline, and much more:  the discovery of neuroplasticity shatters misconceptions and offers hope.  The Brain that Changes Itself is an appetizer plate; bring on the main course!
B0027MJU00|5|chilling to the end...I couldn't put it down....read it in two days...looking forward to more books from Gillian Flynn, hurry please¡
B0081HLMD8|5|It must be something in the Scandanavian water that makes their movie industry zing with crime thrillers. If you love THE KILLING (FORBYSSEN) and THE BRIDGE not to mention the political drama of BORGEN, this crime romp is bloody, thrilling and bent.
B000NU2CY4|2|I rented the early released copies of Gladiator and Braveheart on Blu-ray from my local video store and while Braveheart received top notch treatment in its transfer to Blu-ray, Gladiator did not. It looks like the studio applied a bit too much processing to the film. The film looks a tad bit to bright at times. Also, I immediately noticed very visible halos around the heads of the actors and edges of buildings in the film, indicating that the studio used a bit too much digital sharpening, i.e. edge enhancement, to make the picture look sharper than it probably was in the first place. I further noticed flashes of unnatural color here and there in the film. If there is an upside to the HD transfer of Gladiator it is the HD audio which is very good. Gladiator is a film deserving of a dynamic visual presentation in High Definition. It is a shame the studio did not produce a beautiful transfer, like they did for Braveheart, being that Gladiator is such a great film. It deserves better than this release. I would seriously recommend you rent this version of Gladiator before you decide to buy it.

B000002OX7|5|From the majestic opening of &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; to the even more majestic closing of &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again,&quot; it is difficult to imagine how any album could be on a grander scale.  This is one powerful  album that never sounds dated. I love Keith Moon's drumming- I have never  heard anyone play like him, always seemingly on the verge of going out of  control, yet what he does is really the perfect complement for the mood of  each song.  They certainly made great use of their talents on this one!
B00M5MBSPM|4|The movie was okay for an older movie.  The plot was superficial, but the violence was very intense.  I enjoyed it.

B0058OUJA4|5|I love tower defense games and this one adds to my enjoyment. Levels are challenging and fun. Definitely more difficult than any other tower defense game out there. Almost too hard at some times!! Got this one for free through Amazon, but would have no problem recommending this as a buy to my friends. My opinion is two thumbs up. And to add: HTC Thunderbolt works great. Thank you.
B00688628M|5|It is good.
B007R4WENS|3|This app is fun to play with--it has TONS of chords and scales, each with a name.  While this is fun for a short while, I'm not exactly sure what anyone who is not writing music is going to do with it other than play with it for a few minutes and say, &#34;wow, that's a lot of chords&#34;.  Great as FAOTD or perhaps for a musician.
0792833236|5|'Raging Bull' is unlike most sports films.  It deals with the aftermath of glory, the days after the lights, women, and success are all over.  Although most of 'Raging Bull' is about Jake La Motta's successful boxing carrer, the point of the movie it the battle to survive.  Scorsese uncompromisingly explores the dark years when Jake becomes a nobody and everthing is lost.  The latter section is not the most exciting part, but it is the most meaningful.<br />In this life there is success and failure, and it seems like most people are never very successful.  Most people will never make the front page news nor ever do anything extraordinary.  The most touching point, I think, the film makes is that success and failure are not really that important.  What is important is survival.  Surviving and then moving on.

B00GMV8M2Y|1|hate it boring put me to sleep and this movie really sucked..
B002Q1YDLI|1|After seeing the movie Something Borrowed, I thought I would pick up with the 2nd book. The first bit of this book was a recap of what happened in the first book (or movie), so it seems doable. However, I ended up hating this book and wasn't able to get past 51% (Kindle) of the book. Perhaps I missed something in the fist book, but Darcy the main character is so unbelievably annoying that I just couldn't read any further. I tried to push through in hopes of Darcy having a redeeming quality to keep it interesting. If she has one I never saw it or made it to the point where it is showed. I do realize I may have missed something from the first book, but if you're like me and saw the movie and want to see what happens it's probably not worth your time.

B00HUQC3U2|5|I gave this a 5 star rating because I just Love live music. The dukes are all favorites of mine so when they are featured as a band I flipped and danced a jig. Michael McDonald and Donald Fagan's music are in every music program that I listen to. Boz Scaggs  music is pure blues and soul. I need to get his music on my list.<br /><br />I'm going to buy another copy for my sister.<br /><br />Just hearing them together made my heart glad.

B000GFLE1S|5|Everyone knows his face.Everyone has seen him since he premiered in HBO's [[ASIN:6304233787 Deadly Voyage]]  and followed a year later in [[ASIN:0783231202 Amistad]].In 2007 he was in [[ASIN:B000VNMMVQ Talk to Me (Widescreen Edition)]] opposite Don Cheadle, and opposite Denzel and Crowe in [[ASIN:B0011HOEYY American Gangster (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)]].Last year he was in [[ASIN:B000N6TX1I Children of Men (Widescreen Edition)]] with Clive Owen! Well back up to 2006-7 to see him in his Golden Globe nominated breakout hilarious UK romp KINKY BOOTS ...'cause THAT is where CHIWETEL EJIOFOR struts his stuff. This amazingly talented, good looking 30 something British born African actor is always lurking in the shadows of the \\"leading men\\" of our day.BUT, as a sassy,no-nonsense transvestite London \\"Drag Queen\\" is where Ejiofor found his balance and voice, dressed in cabaret clothes and singing and dancing to \\"beat the band\\"!<br /><br />KINKY BOOTS tells the true story of how two young men trying to find their niche in life,both cast in disparaging lights by their father's expectations, who unlikely team up together to find their voice in this world and turn an almost defunct \\"sensible\\" shoe factory in Northampton,England into an industrious viable manufacturer of footwear strong enough to support the weight of the female impersonator.Ejiofor plays Simon,aka \\"Lola\\" who since earliest boyhood has romped his way through life as a man who can only be a man when he becomes a woman.Joel Edgerton is Clarley Price who is now the fifth and hopeful generation to carry on the craftsmanship of the sensible making \\"oxford shoe factory\\" Price Shoes. Upon his father's demise, Charley discovers that the factory is \\"going under\\" and that he must lay off many of the workers.One night,after work ends, Charley sees a \\"woman in distress\\" who is being taunted by thugs.The woman is more than capable on her own to fend off \\"her\\" attackers.Charley gets knocked out trying to help.When he comes to, there is \\"Lola\\", a gorgeous and fully endowed lady who comforts Charley.Alas, the heel on her thigh high red boot is snapped off!!!<br />This is truly where the fun starts in this film...and IT IS FUN! Charley and \\"Lola\\" become unexpectedly in need of what the other has in order to find happiness in this life.Charley finds his \\"niche market\\" for his ailing shoe factory when he sees \\"Lola\\" perform her \\"drag show\\".Grown men are performing exotic dance numbers in thigh-high boots made for women! These heels cannot support the men's bulk! AHHA...the idea....make \\"kinky boots\\" for the transvestite dancer\\",and have \\"Lola\\" design them! This film is an absolute stitch (oh...a pun!) and it is filled with tremendously complex and interesting characters, a great storyline and infectious soundtrack that puts me in mind of the \\"feel good films\\" [[ASIN:6305428352 Mr. Holland's Opus]],[[ASIN:6302363098 The Competition]],[[ASIN:B000NOK1KC Freedom Writers (Widescreen Edition)]],[[ASIN:6305622914 The Full Monty]], [[ASIN:B00003CXPD Billy Elliot]],[[ASIN:B000ETRCMQ Transamerica (Widescreen Edition)]],[[ASIN:6305781095 Flawless]] and [[ASIN:B00000IQC5 Brassed Off!]].<br /><br />Yes. we have all seen Chiwetel Ejiofor....but never like this.I laughed in the theatres when I saw it, and it is even better at home on DVD! A truly highly recommended film!
B00IU0M85C|4|This has an interesting premiss, I'm looking forward to seeing how the story unfolds.
1250048672|5|Great book for pet lovers and great story of the beautiful relationship between two souls.
B00RL9UZGW|5|Very good, pleasantly surprised
B008TMA1LY|3|sooo I thought this game was very cute and fun but frustrating thatch cant pass a level without staff and that u need actual money to buy the staff when I'm young and don't have a credit card.
B000OYC7A8|5|A great lesson on endurance in that career as musician. Every body in this world have to see this video to learn what is to be really good at what you´re doing with your own lives: take that one hit wonders!
0345529057|5|The only problem with getting all (first) four books at once is disciplining yourself to put the damn things down and go to bed!  The characters are fantastic, the story line(s) have you either loving or hating characters and then swapping your attitude as the story unfolds.  I can't wait for book five (and six) to come out in paperback to almost round out the series.
B002G1YPH0|3|I read the reviews before purchasing this heat sink.  It does have thermal compound included.  The directions consist of diagrams with no words.  After studying them long enuff, you can figure out how to install the fan.  Mounting is questionable, but solid.  This is very heavy.  It is also big.  120mm is over kill.  It takes up a big portion of my case.  Make sure you measure.  I have a mid tower and had less than an inch before touching the side panel.  I have a see through panel, and can't show much off with the room this takes up.  The price is good, but the features are not.  I recommend you look elsewhere.
B002RI90WM|5|Loved the story line and it was a lovely read. Recommend to everyone to read and makes you wonder if animals think like that
B00A8ECU24|5|IF you have a child that loves MLP then this is something you must have. Keeps my daughter entertained and she gets excited with each new thing she accomplishes. She tells me it is her most favorite game app ever. She has 26 other game apps.
B00B2V66VS|5|fun to play and helps to pass the time when bored. I'm happy I downloaded this game it's better than the first one to me
1559408855|3|My main gripe with this picture is not with the coprophagy scenes or the rape or torture, it is with the entertainment level. There are some memorable moments(ok, loads of them) but they kind of repeat themselves, but i suppose that is what the film is about, the incessant torture of it all. The 4 evil guys are played with gusto, these guys are the most perverted guys on film i've ever seen, even more perverted than divine or raymond and connie marble from 'pink flamingos'. My favourite parts are the start when they round up the victims and guards, the anticipation of what's to come. I thought the victims should have at least tried to resist more or come up with an escape plan or something. It's a violent film which i do not recommend to children or women
B00BUAEYVK|4|Was given as a birthday gift and havenot had a chance to see this myself but will do so with a DVD for our famiy. Timely delivery.
B00HYTLY64|3|It was ok, A solo yachtsman with one disaster  after another - ending was a bit abrupt
B007SGM084|5|I totally enjoyed this erotic fiction!!  I will miss all the characters in these books-  After reading all<br />three a person just wants to know what happens next.  It was a very nice change from all the other types<br />of books that are out their for our reading enjoyment.  I hope this author continues to write such wonderful<br />and enjoyable books as these three were!  A very refreshing read I must say
B00GH75V1S|2|Watched this last night, and slept on it. Woke up and felt just like I got out of congressional debate about health care reform. I NEVER review movies, but this is the one! Rich get everything, including magical healing machines, poor our in slums of mainly spanish speaking decent, and earth is destroyed because of pollution!? Then to top everything off, they throw in some Jason Bourne moves to bring down the evil rich empire. Such a sad sad sad attempt to build up a government that is in shambles.<br /><br /> Before all you \\"haters\\" start voting, you might want to watch the movie again, think of where our health care debacle is at right now, then be objective. Think of where \\"most\\" of us live, and what kinda of  cars the rich drive (check out the Bugatti that gets shot down by Jason Bourne, I mean Damon), and the magical Elysium shaped like a Mercedes Benz logo.<br /><br />Now you can cast your vote.
B000VNMMQG|3|I enjoyed the movie. The historical sets were great. The acting was very good. The dialogs had a ring of truth. The love story, although it was a minor part of the movie, was done well. The story needed to be told and the movie told it well. One of the bad points was the movie jumped around in Wilberforce's life quite a bit. Following the time shifts was confusing at times. As the movie went along, the plot was easier to follow.<br /><br />I read a short biography of Wilberforce and I heard a talk on Newton. I can't claim any expertise on these men, but what little I know of them made me question the movie's historical accuracy. Newton had a congregation. He was not a hermit mopping up a church. He was a popular Anglican preacher. Finney did a great job in the part, but I don't think it represented Newton very well. Wouldn't a better charactorization have been a more historic portrayal of Newton who was a slave trader that became a slave of Christ by serving and preaching to all? Rather than a guilt-ridden old man?<br /><br />I also wished the movie spent more time on Wilberforce's conversion and beliefs. Wilberforce was a thoughtful Christian who wrote books on what he believed. Wilberforce's stamina according to Wilberforce was his reformed faith. The movie just had him studying nature in a worshipful manner in his garden.<br /><br />In summary, I liked the movie and I enjoyed it. The message needed to be told and it was told well. How England avoided a bloody civil war because of this issue and resolved the issues through a peaceful process was instructive. However, Wilberforce and Newton deserved to have a more accurate portrayal of their lives.
B00HTYTQ5A|5|You just never know what Sherlock is going to do with all the twists and turns of each episode.  This show definitely keeps my attention and I always keep wanting more episodes.  Once you get hooked on this show, you can't help but wanting more of it.
B00L9B7IKE|5|A great read, exciting and heart pounding. Good luck getting your everyday duties completed at least until the novel is finished.
B00BBI9WD6|5|After having read this serios over in part many years ago and in whole 5 or 6 years ago finally finding that this series was on the kindle was a big deal for me<br /><br />Like always this series does not disapoint it is a clasic technical focused space drama. A combination of fantastic plot development and a whole host of memorable charicters the pace, detail and drama are such that I litterally could not set this book down<br /><br />This book like the rest of the series is a must read
B008BRC6NS|5|Love this! It's a trip down memory lane with all of my favorite JLo songs. Definitely a great buy for any JLo fan.
B00B2V66VS|5|This is a great game in you liked temple run one then you will love this games It`s a lot harder then temple run one but not too hard at the same time so I rate this 5 stars

B0002Z9HT8|5|Perhaps I'm being too generous by giving the LIVE AID dvd set 5-stars. As another reviewer pointed out, many performances are left off of this set. However, some of the biggest acts of the 80s are shown performing their monster hits with the exception of TINA TURNER, WHAM, and THE THOMPSON TWINS. Although these performers do appear with other singers/musicians, the footage of them performing their hits was either destroyed or lost. I'm sure there might be other examples of groups/singers who appear on the LIVE AID dvds and they're not performing their big hits, but, as far as I can tell, most of them are.<br /><br />The fact that there's even a dvd set available is a miracle in itself.<br /><br />A booklet that comes with the dvd set explains the idea behind LIVE AID and how BOB GELDOF (singer of THE BOOMTOWN RATS) saw a BBC News report on television in 1984 (the news footage is included at the start of dvd #1) about the famine going on in Africa/Ethiopia. He wanted to do something about it and formed BAND AID in the UK. This in turn formed U.S.A FOR AFRICA in the US, which ultimately led to the LIVE AID concert which happened on July 13, 1985. The concert was filmed by MTV, ABC and the BBC, and aired on its respective channel with an estimated 1.5 billion viewers around the world.<br /><br />According to the dvd's producer, Jill Sinclair, Geldof wanted the concert to be shown only once and not recorded. ABC took Geldof at his word and destroyed the footage so it could never be re-broadcast again. The BBC ignored him but lost some of the footage, while the videos that weren't lost, sat collecting dust. MTV found over 100 tapes of b-roll of the concert and so Sinclair, and the rest of the LIVE AID dvd team, combined MTV's footage of the LIVE AID concert, with the remaining BBC footage and that's how we get this remarkable 4-dvd set! So bravo to Jill Sinclair and the dvd team.<br /><br />The concert took place at Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia. The dvds go back and forth from Wembley to JFK, but transitions smoothly, so there aren't any jarring cuts in between the musical acts. Considering that this concert was recorded using analog equipment and was meant for a one-time only showing, the footage itself has been restored as best as it could be and it looks pretty good (sharp, vibrant color, etc.). There are some instances where wavy-horizontal lines appear on close-up shots on some of the performances, and Sinclair explains in the booklet that this is a phenomenon called \\"microphany,\\" which happens when the \\"camera lens is affected by great volume.\\" The lines aren't that distracting since they aren't colored, and they don't distort the picture, but they're just noticeable. It only happens once in a while and according to the booklet, only on some UK performances.<br /><br />Along with the performances, the LIVE AID dvd set also includes extras:<br /><br />DVD #1<br /><br />**BBC TV NEWS REPORT<br /><br />**BAND AID - DO THEY KNOW IT'S CHRISTMAS - music video<br /><br />**U.S.A FOR AFRICA - WE ARE THE WORLD - \\"...\\"<br /><br />DVD #4-(includes performances recorded at different locations/times and either broadcast that day or never televised)<br /><br />**INXS - What You Need; Don't Change<br /><br />**B.B. KING - Why I Sing The Blues; Don't Answer The Door; Rock Me Baby<br /><br />**ASHFORD & SIMPSON with TEDDY PENDERGRASS - Reach Out And Touch(Somebody's Hand)<br /><br />**RUN DMC - King Of Rock<br /><br />**CLIFF RICHARD - A World Of Difference<br /><br />**DAVID BOWIE & MICK JAGGER - Dancing In The Streets (this is actually the music video; according to wikipedia Bowie and Jagger were supposed to do a live duet on the song, with Bowie in London and Jagger in Philadelphia, but because of technical difficulties it couldn't be done)<br /><br />**DOCUMENTARY - Food And Trucks And Rock 'n' Roll<br /><br />Instead of a scene selection menu, the dvds have \\"search by artist\\" that lets you go right to the start of that performer's set (which will then play the rest of the concert from that point on, rather than going back to the menu). You also have the option to just play the Wembley performances or the Philadelphia perfomances.<br /><br />If you're too young to remember this concert, you might miss the significance of it. But it's still worth watching. Like Woodstock was to a generation before it, LIVE AID showed the world that young people could come together, through music, and collectively believe in something that could change the world. If you do remember this moment in time, watching this concert will bring back many memories.<br /><br />Some of the stand out performances on these dvds, IMO:<br /><br />FREDDIE MERCURY/QUEEN - The rapport between the audience and Mercury is incredible. He launches into an impromptu \\"scat\\" singing certain vowels to the audience and they sing it back to him, verbatim<br /><br />ELTON JOHN & GEORGE MICHAEL - John playing the piano, while Michael belts out John's \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\"<br /><br />PATTI LABELLE - The soul diva belting out her version of Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" and then going into \\"Forever Young.\\" Towards the end of the latter song, she puts down the microphone, walking up to the front of the stage and continues singing...and you can still hear her voice, barely audible, but powerful enough to be heard over the cheering crowd and the back-up singers<br /><br />TINA TURNER & MICK JAGGER - duet on \\"State Of Shock\\" Turner matches Jagger move for move and lip for lip<br /><br />So even though this set is not complete, it still deserves 5-stars.(which will then play the rest of the concert from that point on, rather than going back to the menu).

B007SGM084|5|Great book with drama, sex, suspense, romance. They were hard to put down. The third book was a little predictable but still good.
B003M6EAXM|5|24 was a show that grips you and holds on.  I am glad I was able to see the season back to back, as waiting until next week was always a drag.
B00005JLCI|5|i saw parts of this film in high school english and wanted to see all of it so i found it on here and got it, it was a good one!
B00B7XGFO4|1|I was very disappointed because I love this book and was really looking forward to watching the film adaptation of it. However, the video quality was very bad, but more importantly, the sound quality was horrible. I had to stop watching it.
B0063IH60K|5|Tradition is what I like most and this game has it! I love how it works where you just touch the card you want to move and it puts it in place for you. Traditional desktop games you have to drag it there but this one does the work for you!  Much fun to play!
B000031XCR|4|This album is a compilation of Ms. Dion's biggest hits, along with a few new songs thrown in, which actually make the enitre album have a &quot;new&quot; feel. The first time I heard &quot;That's The Way It  Is&quot;, I hated it. I thought it was lame and pointless. But I realized  that my backlash was only because I hadn't heard anything upbeat from  Celine in so long (I was still drowning in my post &quot;My Heart Will Go  On&quot; depression), and wasn't sure what to think. Now I know, it's a  good song, with powerful vocals, which can be expected from Celine, and I  personally welcome it with open arms. My personal favorite on the album has  to be &quot;The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face.&quot; All I can say is:  WOW! What an emotional and beautiful song! I watched the &quot;Celine Dion  Spical&quot; a week or two ago and was practically moved to tears when she  sung this song, it blew me away. Another highlight is &quot;All The  Way&quot;, a wondeful duet with the legendary Frank Sinatra. I think it was  a great choice to put on the album. &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot; and  &quot;Then You Look At Me&quot; are also both very good songs. Of course  all of the older songs are wonderful. The only thing this CD is missing is  Dion's duet with Andrea Bocelli, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, which can be found  on her Christmas CD, but I think it would have been a good idea put it on  this CD, because it's basically a greatest hits album, and &quot;The  Prayer&quot; is one of her greatest songs ever. Besides that, this is a  wonderful album, worth the $16 I payed for it, and I'm glad I have it to  add to my collection.
B003TSEEDY|5|It was a really good books and I liked that it felt very real. It was a little slow at times, but it was still amazing. I love Charlie.
B007G5H2HQ|3|It is a retelling of the Jack and the Beanstalk story.  Jack and Jill were pretty funny as were some other characters, but Puss was much funnier in Shrek.  A bit disappointing.
B0051ANPZQ|5|I read a lot of fiction and non fiction. When my 10 yr old grandson called me and told me it was the best book he had EVER read, and asked me to read it, I agreed with a smile, thinking I would indulge him. So far this year it is the best book I myself have read! It is a poignant, at times sad, story of a fifth grade who was born with a cranial facial disfigurement caused by a mutation of genes. He is homeschooled until fifth grade when his parents decide that it would be the best thing for him to learn to face the real world. They are very supportive of him as is the principal of the school he is attending. However, In spite of that, he is subjected to a lot of bullying which he faces courageously. The author has an incredible ability to get into the minds of these fifth graders with dialogues between them so that  the reader feels as if you are an invisible bystander listening to what is really going on in the school. With bullying being a major issue on our schools, this will resonate with any person who has been at the receiving end of a bully. The author goes back and forth in dialogue between &#34;Auggie&#34; , the main character and other fifth graders, from each kid's perspective. Yes, it is sad at times, but unfortunately bullying is a reality, not just in the schools but also in the adult world. Yet, in spite of what happened to Auggie, the story is also full of courage and hope. What happens at the end is heartwarming and inspiring. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, elementary, middle school and up or adult.If I could,I would give this 10 stars. I am looking forward to the author's sequel, which is coming out May 13th, tomorrow on my calendar! In fact,I have pre-ordered it!
B000W6EJEK|4|Well worth the money spent. I purchased this for my spouse as a gift and she adores it.
B002SJIO5E|5|Don't be put off by the documentary format with which the movie opens; give it some time, and District 9 will reward you with great character writing and solid action sequences virtually mirroring war footage on CNN.<br /><br />When H.G. Wells wrote \\"The Time Machine\\" it was as much entertainment as it was a social commentary on the segregation of the aristocracy and the working class. This is what Science Fiction was born to do. And this is what District 9 does. So, on top of the great effects and action, it's been envisioned with a lot of political savvy, too.<br /><br />There's a bit of propaganda featured in the movie which bordered on the ridiculous - but it's forgivable against all else the film offers. Thanks, Peter Jackson for giving Blomkamp the cash!!
B0054JELS4|5|I would highly recommend this seller.  The articles arrived promptly an included a nice surprise, the ninth season was included. Since this is a Christmas gift, the items have not been viewed but the condition of the outside case is in excellent condition.
068987474X|5|Even though I'm happily married, I had to read this book.  I made so many of the stupid excuses they point out in the book during my single years.  What a waste!  The wisdom here would have saved me years of agitation.  I just might have met the man that was into me sooner.
B00G5G7K7O|5|Watched this movie almost as soon as I got it. I waited too long. Perfectly clear picture, perfectly fun music, and of course...<br /><br />LET IT GO!
B003XYERRM|5|Loved it.  Learned a lot in an enjoyable way.  I look forward to reading more from Sharon Kay Penman.
B004XJRQUQ|5|Love this trilogy and the movies!
B006Z7NTCI|5|With a really soulful and energetic feel.<br />It is new-agey, while avoiding the &#34;insipid electronica&#34; that a lot of new age music has become.
B000K7VHQE|4|Who are these people?  Could they be related to you?  The antics are a bit unbelievable at times, but the message is one just about anyone can relate to.  I mean, a motivational speaker who can't keep his own family motivated...a boy who doesn't speak, based on principle, but isn't smart enough to realize the obvious...an entire family that can't see that their \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" won't be casting any rays of light on anyone outside of the family circle...an uncle with unspoken life style issues?  Sound vaguely familiar? <br /> <br />Think about it.  Every family has the hair stylist, with the worst hair imaginable, the mechanic whose car is never quite right or the family member in the health care field (always giving advice) that could stand to lose a few l b's themselves.   <br /> <br />Although I have to agree with the review that said they don't understand the rave (by the critics) over this one, I did find it entertaining. <br /> <br />I recommend this to others. <br />
B00IG2DOKM|5|I love it I've been playing it for a really long time and its nice it's you. It's you controlling your own world. One of the best games for Kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5|I'm looking for a new game since a minecraft incident happened it crashed and this was the game it is sasssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooo awesome and I replay it over and over and over and over again I love it
B00O8NPCA8|5|I liked it. Would watch it again.
B003UM8T3U|5|This isn't the place for a full review of this essential and influential movie.  The quality of the blu-ray is great and the accompanying booklet is well worth owning.  Wanna save money, get it used.  If you have even a passing interest in movies or movie-making, you should own this.
B002GLSX8C|5|The more I listen to Zeppelin, the more I see the brilliance of each performer.  However, if one has to shine the brightest, unfortunately he also fell the soonest.  There have been many great drummers - Pert from Rush, Grohl from Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Them Crooked Vultures (with John Paul Jones) to name just two- but in the history of rock and roll and even other genres, there has been few that can play the drums not only as a rhythm instrument, but as an instrument in its own right.  Bonham added so much to this group that it is completely appropriate to that they broke up after his death.  Nothing against Page, Jones or Plant - they are all incredible musicians in their own right - but Bonham is the clear star of this group.  Not just in shear talent but in musicality.  He was able to add to any piece not just with technical brilliance.  He knew exactly what each piece needed to make it perfect.
B008Y2FRFO|4|It is a great game but at first it is a little hard to enjoy because you don't have much coins
043599445X|5|My Biology teacher didn't require the book for my DP bio class, but I found it extremely helpful. It arrived in good condition and on time!
B009329ZF2|5|Good movie for family movie night for 3 generations.  SPOILER ALERT:  LOVED the honoring of the WWII Veterans to help fight in the movie.  If you like stuff blowing up, the good guys winning, & the boy getting the girl...all with minimal 4 letter words...then you'll enjoy this movie.

B006BGZJJ4|5|Love the length of this cord. My original cord for my Kindle Fire had started to wear out due to winding it around my hand to take to work.  This cord works with all my power adaptors and electronics.
B002VPE1WK|3|This is a good LITTLE bag for a small collection of equipment.<br />I carry a Nikon 5100 with lens, an extra lens, a yongnuo flash, and a twelve pack of AA batteries. I still have an entire side with three compartments. There is room for another 10 vertical inches of lens or flash. The dividers are padded Velcro so the size can be adjusted. This is all in the main body. There are still several Velcro and zipper pouches for lens clothes, rocket blowers, sd cards, and other nick nacks to carry.<br />The problem is the backpack is small. It does not fit on my back. Across my back it is very small. Like wearing a child's backpack. I wear it with one shoulder stap only. If I am walk a distance I will connect the waist strap. I wear a 46 inch jacket and if I get both shoulder straps on I can not put my shoulders forward. The chest strap is a joke, 3 inches short. The waist strip is at the bottom of my rib cage. This is really only wearable if your assistant is eight.<br />I would buy a full size bag and carry it around mostly empty.
B00B5HQKNI|3|Though the action was tiresome, the villain was charming and double-faceted. He seemed to love and hate M, and was willing to kill her and himself together.
B003JTHXOK|5|It was very good reading and he is a good writer. I have read many of his books and they are always great.
B004MKM8L8|4|I love all the Harry Potter Movies and this one is no exception.<br />Recommend this highly to all HP fans!
B00F522C7C|5|A video recommended by a parent for a 4 yr. old as a Christmas gift.  Has provided hours of viewing fun.
B0022Q8CSC|5|One of the first books I've ever read which was later made into a movie that remained true to the book.<br />I love the movies and now I also love the book.
B004I744AS|4|English is very usefull and gives BE and AE pronunciations. Italian not really reliable. I have not tried other languages
B00BD99JMW|5|While I would have liked a happy ending to this saga I was really pleased with what I got.  People coming to except who they are is not an easy thing.  I was not going to read this book because of the reviews, but decided to anyway.  Happy I did.  So will others.
B009OYSFDM|5|Outstanding story development, Great acting, Great Screenplay, Great directing and it is more than what anyone could ask for in a televised show about a hero. The first season had me hooked. I recommend this show for people who like supernatural adventures even though this show isn't quite supernatural, but more on a crime scene type of show. It has some originality.
B00910Y1OQ|5|This is a fun game.  It can be relatively mindless clicking of groups, or it can be quite strategic - depending on your mood :)
B007IXWKUK|5|I absolutely loved this book.  It picked up well from the first one and had a great amount of suspense and plot twists.  I definitely recommend.
B00000DQR4|5|This box set tells a full story of The Smashing Pumpkins in a very small, and amazingly designed, box.<br /><br />Alternative versions of great songs and \\"smashing\\" covers of other artists' great songs, all done with that certain spin that only The Pumpkins can add.<br /><br />This set was purchased to replace a dear friend's set that he sold a few years ago, to get through some financial hardships.  This did EXACTLY what it was supposed to do.  His jaw dropped open and tears of joy swelled in his eyes.  It is the reaction one wants when giving a present and it is that feeling inside, when you give that kind of a gift, that makes something like this so incredible.<br /><br />If you do not like The Smashing Pumpkins, then don't buy this.  If you, or a loved one or friend, are a fan, then you cannot pass on this set.  SP are an important factor in the history of modern music.
B00000JPH6|4|I originally saw this in the theater when it first came out.  Jim Henson was a MASTER puppeteer and character creator.<br /><br />All around, I really enjoy this movie and I think it stands the test of time.

B004J4WLB4|5|An excellent story
0061992860|5|fantastic tiny little book - well designed and well organized! - be ready for the end of the world and learn outdoor skills
B0042VJ1PI|3|Just another crime book. Quite fun because its a female cop, but predictable. Not as good as the previous one.
B00VFTAXUC|2|Structurally it reminded me a lot of Cameron's The Abyss and Kubrick's 2001 but it drags in places and glosses over material quickly in other places. But where I would, for the most part, recommend The Abyss and certainly recommend 2001, I would not recommend Interstellar.
B009JZSC9S|5|The Good Wife always have hidden surprises along the way.  I Highly recommed it if someone need something to watch on a wintery day.
0380018179|3|This is my kind of book: an epic family saga with a strong sense of place. I hate to give it only three stars, but I've had to conclude that while it has its strengths, it doesn't live up to what it could have been.<br /><br />The Thorn Birds starts off excellently, detailing the day-to-day life of a family struggling to get by in early twentieth century New Zealand. It's well-written, it feels very realistic, and there's a strong sense of place. There's believable conflict among the family members without any of them being unsympathetic. There's an interesting and unflinching look at the effects of strict gender roles on average women's lives: something we don't see in most historical fiction, which tends to feature the elite rather than regular folks. (I'll read about the regular folks any day, and McCullough does it well.) When the family picks up and moves to Australia, I was still enthralled. I loved the descriptions of life in the Outback and was drawn into the family's story.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way though, things went wrong. The characters' personalities and relationships began to lose credibility with me; several times I just couldn't swallow that people in these situations would relate to each other the way they do. Meggie's relationships with both her mother and her daughter are especially bizarre, full of contrived antagonism far beyond what one would expect. (In the daughter's case, evidently she dislikes Meggie from birth. Ooookay.) Some of the more colorful personalities, such as Frank and Luke, disappear partway through, while Meggie's tribe of brothers lose what personality they once had and slowly merge into one person, as if McCullough changed her mind about how many brothers the story required but couldn't be bothered to get rid of the extras. As for the romance between Meggie and Ralph, while at first it raised some interesting questions, it never captured my emotions and becomes increasingly repetitive.<br /><br />Which is not to say that this is an awful book, because it isn't. It's well-written and the thematics are strong. The strong descriptions and the sense of place persist throughout, and it's fascinating to see how the coming of new technology affects the Outback. The main characters are decently well-developed, and while the book is long, the plot remains interesting. I finished it in a few days. Still, if you have not yet read the classic historical epics, like Isabel Allende's House of the Spirits or Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind, I'd recommend going with those first.that this is an awful book, because it isn't.

B00DMCV7K0|4|I enjoyed this book and the dual perspective. You can feel the longing and drive of the characters. Recommended for women of any age perhaps.
B007FG9LIE|4|Great book with the beginning having a lot of potential. The ending was a twist. Worth reading. The beginning was a little bit slow, but it's a great book when you get a ways into it.  Despite a cliché start, the book takes many twists, even in the beggining.<br />I listened to this as an audiobook from audible, free with kindle unlimited. It made it easy to get through the beggining I would have otherwise skipped.
082300659X|5|This is an incredible book filled with beautiful studies to copy and inspire.  The lessons on technique are easy to follow and get down to the basics.<br />The accompanying DVD is delightfully direct with a warm personal approach.<br />I highly recommend this book to all artists.
B008BU75IQ|2|Don't waste your time even though the first two books were good reading.<br />This one, however,  is a big disappointment.
B002SHD9E2|5|Phantom is my all time favorite thing ever. Nothing will ever top my list! I non-stop sing the songs, even on those occasional cemetery visits.
B00006CXXU|4|Christina Aguilera has come a long ways since her, \\"Genie in a bottle\\" days.  Her most recent album, Stripped, hit stores on October 29, 2002.  This album was a defining moment for her career.  It allowed us to see how she has matured since her first CD.  She wrote all of her own songs.  Christina takes her personal life experiences and puts them into catchy lyrics in, \\"Dirty\\" and \\"Fighter.\\"  Her songs on this album go against how society thinks women should live their lives.  That is why it is easy for women to relate to her songs.  My favorite song is \\"Beautiful,\\" when you listen to it, you can't help but feel good about yourself. So i encourage anyone, especially if you are a female, to go out and buy this album.  You won't be dissatisfied with the songs she sings.
B004TI5N38|5|Excellent.
0525952926|5|Having read the first installment of the Century Trilogy I was very excited to read his second part. The story picks up almost right where it left off (not to the point where you couldn't skip the first) and has the same entertaining and twisted flow. Only downside is the story is awfully predictable but, I believe this trilogy is too entertaining to take a star off for that small purpose. Loved every page of it and you will too!
B0097S0TM0|5|This is such a good album.  Definitely more upbeat than her last one (understandable).  She is a fantastic artist and her album reflects that.
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Ditto my other recent review.  They make terrific music.
B0034DGPEU|5|one of the best books I have ever read!
B005K17RU0|4|A really good tool for checking the forecast.  It helps with work to determine if and when bad weather is arriving.

B00EOARZ4G|5|Tom Clancy has been a favorite author for many years, but had not read anything by him recently. I felt like I was catching up with an old friend. Clancy' s style continues to amaze me.
B00005QXDD|5|Ever since I saw High Fidelity (one of the greatest and most underrated movies ever) I have been a huge Jack Black fan.  Picking up this CD was a good decision.  It's got such a great sound on all the songs.  Sometimes it sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd (&quot;The Road&quot;) sometimes AC/DC (&quot;Dio&quot;) and sometimes like Crosby, Stills and Nash (&quot;Tribute&quot;)  It's all these great classic rock band sounds but with all this humor.  The funniest track by far is &quot;Inward Singing.&quot;  I heard this in the car and started laughing so hard I almost cried.  This CD seems immature at times, and often foolish, but you know what?  Back off.  Jack Black is rampant in all of us.  Let this CD bring the JB out in you.  It's funny, the songs are actually pretty darn good, and it's like nothing you've heard since the days of Hendrix, Zeppelin and Skynyrd.  Pop it in, you won't be sorry.
B00E8KLWB4|4|2 thumbs up
B003HV0TN2|5|The Name of the Wind was a great reading experience. I would strongly recommend this to all out there who likes fantasy.
1451695195|1|95% of this book is about Dr. Alexander's illness and his proof that his consciousness did exist outside of his body when his brain stopped working.  Although he said that he had complete knowledge of all sorts of things Dr. Alexander does not share any of this with the reader.  Absolutely no new insights.
B00HHC33YY|5|When I got this album, it came with a sticker proclaiming this album to be &#34;Classic Dolly.&#34; Let me just say that, yes, I listened to the album via Dolly's Vevo channel on YouTube before finally going out and buying the CD. I so loved what I heard in the album that I almost couldn't resist going out and getting it.<br />The music sounds just as fresh and strong as when Mrs. Parton was recording in the '60's. Her voice has literally not changed at all from then to now (although the quality of recording materials has, very much) and her music is just as beautiful and spiritual as it was when she started.<br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes Dolly, or who just likes plain, wholesome country music.
B0047DVHV2|4|Very enjoyable.  A shocking, revealing laugh at Keith's life that makes the reader want to kick up his heals more than he currently does
B00F1BFNFA|5|There is nothing bad that can be said of Downton Abbey. However, I did not want the Blu-ray version. Unfortunately, Amazon wouldn't allow me to exchange it for a DVD version. I could only replace it with another Blu-ray. Frustrating. I gave this one to my daughter. As for the program itself, it continues with compelling story lines and excellent acting. The language is beautiful, and the faithfulness to the history of the period is excellent. Love it.
0307346609|5|I've been a fan of the zombie film since Night of the Living Dead. The premise, to me, has always been one of the most intriguing and terrifying of any set forth in the horror/sci-fi canon. Sure, 1984 and others painted a chilling picture of a world gone horribly wrong, but the idea of an epidemic- an incurable, rapidly spreading apocalypse- has always struck me as particularly scary.<br /><br />This is not a satire- there is no tongue and cheek present, despite what one may gather from the title and it's subheading (World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War). Sure, there are references to present conflicts and heads of state, as well as familiar terminology from the present. But it's not a parody- it is an honest and bracing attempt to hypothesize how the current world at large- with machinations such as globalization, the internet, and communist-cum-capitalist superpowers, for example- would deal with a crisis on such a massive scale. The short answer is \\"not well\\". The long answer, involving everything from America's advanced (and now useless) weapon systems to China's secrecy to Apartheid South Africa's ruthless and purposeful efficiency- is much more complicated, and much more thought provoking.<br /><br />The basic premise of the work, betraying nowhere its label of \\"fiction\\", down to the pull quotes and jacket, is this: In the first half of the 21st century, amidst all the well-known perpetual conflicts and cultures of the day, disaster strikes. It starts with an incident that will be familiar to anyone who's read \\"The Hot Zone\\" or \\"Demon in the Freezer\\". A single patient- Patient Zero- who is a resident of a rural Chinese province. From there, it escalates and spreads across the globe, taking an agonizingly long time to be identified for what it is. In China, it's a \\"contained health issue\\". In Capetown, it's \\"African Rabies\\" (in a nod to the attibution of a disease such as AIDS to a certain culture or population). In America, it's a virus treatable bya miracle drug called \\"Phalanx\\", rushed through the FDA as a placebo and eagerly snatched up by the population. In Israel, one of the few places to recognize the nature of the epidemic and secure itself, it is another Holocaust, one that can be prevented by sealing its borders and fortifying itself.<br /><br />After the initial outbreaks comes the incident referred to in the book as \\"The Great Panic\\", when the nature of what is happening is clear to every man, woman and child on the planet, with predictable results.<br /><br />All of these incidents- and many, many more- are laid out in the form of interviews with the people involved. From military personnel to diplomats to refugees to chiefs of staff to doctors, multiple viewpoints are portrayed. And realistically. As an example, I'll go with the military aspect. The military interviewees, especially American soldiers, refer to their enemy as \\"Zack\\", or \\"Gs\\" (\\"ghouls\\"). They routinely chastise their superiors for employing outdated methods to combat the threat- after all, what good is stealth weaponry to an enemy with no radar? What's the point of infrared when \\"Zack\\" doesn't give off any heat? Why is emphasis placed on \\"cover\\" when the threat can't fire a weapon? There is no condescending portrayal of the military here- only of the bureaucracy that pulls the strings.<br /><br />At the risk of spoiling the whole experience for the reader, I'll stop here. There are many suprises and heatbreaking stories in this work (one of the greatest being the Plan developed to save human race, with terrifying consequences).<br /><br />If you're a genre fan, pick it up. If you have an interest in hypothetical history, pick it up. It's a great read, and suprisingly thought provoking.
B0013527I4|5|The third season of the Muppet Show is the funniest of all three. Also got to say that it have more knowing celebrities than the first season. In the first season it can be seen that most of the celebrities were theater actors and in the second movie actors and in the third one there are famous singers.
B00P42WROG|5|A must read for any bibliophile. Loved the parallel time points in the story. Makes me want to read the Jimmy Gold cycle!
B000MQC9H4|2|I had wanted to see this movie when it came out. I liked all the actors in it and the plot sounded like fun--not. The Kate Winslet/Jack Black and Eli Wallach sub-plot, saved the movie, that's who the 2 stars are for.    Cameron Diaz, who I normally like was terrible as was Jude Law. This is not romance. Dragging a drunken stranger to use for sex, that is not romantic and yet people think this is good. The whole relationship with these 2 ruined the movie. Sorry I don't root for loose women and her over-acting was terrible to boot. I felt no chemistry between them whatsoever.    The Kate Winslet story was sweet. She was a much better person, as was Jack Black. I heard people knocking Jack down for his straight bit, they should have been knocking Jude and Cameron for their performance and this miserable script for them.    Eli Wallach was superb. He added much to the movie. It was so sweet.    I'm with the reviewer who called it \\"Tainted Love\\". If they had built up a relationship with those two, maybe it could have amounted to something, but loose sex with a strange drunk is NOT charming and either was Cameron's arm's flapping.    And this was a Holiday movie? Isn't that special?
B00DR0PDNE|3|The Google Chromecast is a great idea but it's got a lot of execution problems. It's laggy and often times doesn't work. It uses a metric shittonne of bandwidth which will slow down the internet for everyone else in your house. My roommate owns an apple airplay which has most of the same functionality except it reliably works. I wouldn't recommend this product. Maybe some day Google will update it and fix the bugs but for nor this feels like a product that's still in beta testing.
0316077054|2|I really enjoyed the first book, but I honestly could not finish this one.  I found it boring and depressing and couldn't take it any more.  I will not be reading the 3rd installment...they lost me halfway through this one!
B000053VJI|1|After I ordered this product I received the correct case but the CD inside is AYA CON DIOS NIGHT OWLS! I am very disappointed and have been trying to contact Toll House for this but no one has responded to me let alone send me the correct cd!!!!!!!

B00KA7JIII|5|very gd n fun game, nice graphic too. thx u
B001DJLCRC|5|I had heard several people talking about this show.  I wasn't to sure at first, it dealt with drugs, violence all the things that really don't draw me to a show. Now after watching Season 1 all I can say is wow! I really liked the show, the actors are all great and fit their parts to a tee. The direction given to the actors is great. I love that this is available to watch on cable without subscribing to some movie channel, I will be picking up Season 2 shortly to get all caught up.<br /><br />On the downside one of the shows in Season 1 did drag a little, I think it was episode 4 somewhere in the middle, but it was necessary to tell the story. Don't be afraid of the drug theme of this show, it doesn't all have to do with that, so much more is involved.
B004DI7HZ6|5|I was surprised and couldn't put the book down  A Discovery of Witches is the first in the Trilogy and you can bet I will read the other two
B00A81MV3U|5|I saw this movie in the theaters and wanted to have it in my collection because it was interesting - acting was good - good writing and the movie was well done.
B00DC7N9NS|3|OK
B0063IH60K|5|I love this app that a have but its a challenge you should get this app its the best ever
B0076DCT2G|2|A bit premature perhaps but I've read almost half of this book and it has yet to capture me. Seems as though the set up, if in fact that's what it is, goes on and on. And, quite frankly, Joe Corey's smart comments quickly becomes over done.  Maybe the second half will pick speed.
B000Q3648S|5|The fifth album (more or less) by The Best Rock Band of the Last 25 Years should need no introduction, and indeed if you're interested in buying the deluxe edition of Sonic Youth's \\"Daydream Nation,\\" I can presume you're probably already a fan.  You already know how the album summed up and then changed the course of the underground rock movement of the 80s, how the ample attention of critics, then music fans, then record labels set the stage for the alternative rock revolution of the 90s--oh well whatever [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]] and yada yada yada.  If, however, you haven't already drank the Kool-Aid (and you should!), some brief notes about the \\"basic\\" edition...<br /><br />\\"Daydream Nation\\" is still hailed as Sonic Youth's grand masterpiece, and yeah, it still holds up as such (confession: it's my second favorite SY album after [[ASIN:B000003TAJ Sister]]), even if it doesn't seem as radical today as it did when it came out.  Sure, there are swirling whirlwinds of oddly-(de)tuned guitars and feedback fading in, out and sometimes interrupting the songs, but make no mistake, there are definitely songs to be found here.  The openening \\"Teenage Riot\\" is, for its galloping drums and lyrical cheekiness (imagining Dinosaur Jr's J. Mascis as president, or so Thurston Moore has said) basically a melodic and even hummable pop song.  Even a more \\"experimental\\" song like \\"The Sprawl\\" has a certain immediacy, with bassist/vocalist Kim Gordon saying straigt out \\"does f**k you sound simple enough?\\"  Heck, the closing \\"trilogy\\" of the album has all the power and intensity familiar to any classic rock fans, only with a live-wire buzzing and skree that comes from playing in one of Glenn Branca's guitar-army ensembles.  Really, it's not so radical after all (for a taste of something far weirder, check out [[ASIN:B0000019PB Twin Infinitives]], which was released around the same time as DN by Royal Trux, a New York band friendly with Sonic Youth).<br /><br />For us fan(atic)s, the real treat here is the second disc of this set, which features live versions of all the album's tracks, culled from the band's original tour supporting the album, albeit in a different order (SY has recently announced it will play \\"Daydream Nation\\" as part of a special show, presumably in the album's running order).  These tracks, mostly of excellent sound quality, are shorter but sharper than the album versions.  \\"Total Trash\\" is done as an instrumental (I could be wrong, but they seem to be quoting the early Pink Floyd's instrumental \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" in one spot), preceded by another instrumental, \\"Totally Trashed,\\" which toys around with electronics a bit.  Mostly these are no-holds-barred performances that clearly draw on the band's love of hardcore punk and NYC No Wave (DNA, Teenage Jesus & the Jerks).  I don't know how a non-fan would react, but for yours truly it's pure Sonic bliss.<br /><br />Another great bonus on disc two is the inclusion of four cover songs, three of which were taken from now hard-to-find tribute albums (this was before that concept got beaten to death): \\"Within You Without You\\" (The Beatles), \\"Computer Age\\" (Neil Young) and \\"Electricity\\" (Captain Beefheart).  There's also a version of Mudhoney's \\"Touch Me I'm Sick,\\" with demented vocals from Kim, taken from a split 7\\" (as in vinyl, kids) that had the other band doing SY's \\"Halloween\\" on the reverse (alas, that version isn't included here).  The Beatles cover in particular shows how the band could translate their sound into completely different realms--the original, of course, was played mostly with sitars.<br /><br />Add all that to a package that includes ultra-Kool, and rare, pictures and an extensive essay by longtime SY friend Byron Coley, and you have a true Sonic feast.  Like they did with the [[ASIN:B000BR2P82 Goo Deluxe Edition]] and the [[ASIN:B000083LQB Dirty (Deluxe Edition)]], Sonic Youth rewards fans and newcomers alike almost to the bursting point.  Now let's hopethey burn down the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame before too long...Hall of Fame before too long...
B002VECM4A|4|This is yet another movie of sadness and negativity. You will either find this movie hard to watch or informative. It captures a part of life which underprivileged women (mainly from minority groups) experience. I didn't find it as hard to watch as Colored Women but yes it reveals complications in the lives of women on many levels.
B00JJOG3B8|5|This is absolutely one of the best albums ever. It was especially awesome seeing them perform live at Jazz Aspen up at Snowmass CO last Labor Day weekend!
1612680011|5|This book will make you think about your future.
B0063IH60K|5|I love playing solotaire and this game is perfect for that. I can play alone or against someone else. This game is great.
B0093OGBL6|5|Dr. Karen Moriarty writes from the heart..she creates for us a compelling image of Michael Jackson that is both compassionate and revealing in capturing the extremes of this great man's life...The book is powerful in leading the reader to conclude that MJ deserves to go down in history as one of the gentlest, most talented and complex individuals in this century.  I highly recommend this book - it was an insightful...emotional read!
B002VRNR1Y|4|Must watch for all horror movie fans. Background music is well set and makes it even more scary. Some scenes (like restroom scene with John Grady) has only two people in whole shot, but instils a different kind of fear, knowing that the whole setup can't be true only to later realize it was true!!
B00HUCF6KK|5|I consider this more of a 8 hour movie then a series. Because they went into this show knowing that there would only be 8 episodes and the stars would not return if the series did, it gave them a lot of freedom. It let them tell the story in such a way it could unfold slowly (but in no way boring). They didn't have to write themselves into anything they couldn't get out of or have to wrap up quickly. To see the story from 3 sides, the two main characters and the truth, is handled in such a fantastic way I couldn't wait until the next week to see what would happen next. Incredible acting by Woody Harrelson and especially Matthew McConaughey along with great directing and editing bring this well written story to a new level.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything but I will say the ending that some are upset with, sticks with the rest of the story. It is set in the real world and in the real world, monsters and demons are just people. Evil, sick, and twisted...but just people. There are so many memorable moments and I can't wait to get the Blu-ray so I can watch it all again straight though. I would pay full price just for the series so any bonus material is just that, a bonus.<br /><br />The story is slow to build, but in a good way. Kind of like the movie Drive. There is so much going on you will want to watch it as soon as you are finished. 5 stars all the way!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|So glad to have been able to catch up on Downton Abbey on Amazon. I missed the first three seasons on TV so itwas a delight when I found it on Amazon. Has made the cost of Prime worth every cent.
B004ZZS4CC|3|Don't get me wrong, wht she went through was hell. And I wasn't after detailed descriptions of her abuse, however, it felt like it was being written by an 11 year old, and I know that is some respects it was. Cats and pages of journals. I realise the significance of the cats to her, and how important that was to her existance but as a book it just wasn't flowing. It really needed something else, I am not sure what but what was 18 years in captivity is not covered well in the book.

B007HACDLK|5|Great book. Great characters. I couldn't put it down. I am looking forward to the next book. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action novels.

1469984202|5|That's an aerial shot of 25 stars, ok? And that book, you think it's just another sci fi book? Ha! It's easily better than any of the books on the 2012 Arthur C. Clarke shortlist. Howey writes the technical stuff and the Great Concept stuff and the plot twists like it's nothing and unforgettable characters drive the stories. The buzz I get from reading Howey is like the buzz I got discovering Heinlein, who also did those things. But no, Howey's pacing is faster, his emotional range is wider and deeper, his ear for dialogue is Cohen-Brothers-worthy, and his plot twists are stunners. If you think it's impossible to imbue post-apocalyptic fiction with a sensawunda, I dare you to read this book.

B005HEVBGG|4|When Voyager first hit the airways I was not impressed.  TO be honest, Janeway was the reason why.  She was extremely stiff and inflexible in the first season; even more than Picard in TNG.  But I was so head-in-clouds over Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5 that I acknowledged not really giving the show a fair chance.  So I decided to watch it from the beginning.  And I will write high level reviews for each season, not each episode.<br /><br />Season 1's focus is the crew getting adjusted to life in the Delta Quadrant as well as the merging of Maquis and Starfleet members into a cohesive crew.  This struggle makes for some good writing early on as you would definitely expect some conflicts, but there were some missed opportunities for sabotage.  Episodes like \\"State of Flux\\" which sets the foundation for one of the most interesting backstories in Voyager (Seska) and \\"Learning Curve\\" where they showcase some stragglers that just didn't make the full transition to Starfleet life.  The most obvious negative is that they never fully explored the latter; after a while, people just start flowing along happily, which given the story of the Maquis told in Deep Space Nine, should really been more challenging.<br /><br />There were some head scratcher episodes, such as \\"Time and Again\\" where it causes a headache thinking about what's going on (which is the reason it's generally not a good idea to tell a time travel-related story), and you can't help but think back to TNG's \\"Time's Arrow\\" where Data experiences generally the same idea; that you can encounter an event today that both hasn't and has happened.  Trust me when I say that the episode does make sense, but it will give you some migraines trying to sort through the chronology of everything.  Even worse is the idea that Janeway can affect the flow of time by realizing the paradox, thus preventing the event that caused them to be in the situation in the first place (thus creating another paradox).<br /><br />Other episodes,like \\"Emanations\\" are filler and do little to further the series.  Annoyances that are better left out of the canon, but we're stuck with nonetheless.  \\"Prime Factors\\" is actually a well-told story marred by poor character interactions and illogical behavior (Tuvok).<br /><br />It's clear from the episode progression that the writers were trying to use this opportunity to work with characters and storylines that they could not have in the other Star Trek versions.  Being in the Delta Quadrant meant they could make up characters at a whim, and throwing the Maquis in there gave them \\"bad guys\\" without much effort.  The problem is that the approach is so haphazard that it will be difficult to really be interested in seeing more seasons, but the first season is necessary to really enjoy some of what comes later.
B005ZOBNOI|4|I love this book. It's full of humor. I chose a four star rating because the language. There should be a child filter version
B0024F08RO|1|...why seasons 1 to 3 have spanish subtitles and season 4 doesn't; there is a big market in latin america, we are a lot of fans with the spanish language, we have bought the previous seasons...and now we can't enjoy the last season because Fox didn't add the spanish subtitles...
B00BPDR3F6|4|Henry Whitaker was probably one of the first pharmaceutical companies.  He found a treatment for malaria and made tons of money selling this bark derivative to the masses.  Alma is his only biological child.  What a bright and beautiful mind she has--constantly questioning, striving to learn and understand.  She also possesses the ability to observe all things in nature.  However Alma is not packaged in a petite attractive feminine body.  Does this packaging negate her dreams of actual physical love preclude her from achieving these as part of her reality?<br /><br />Although observant, Alma is unable to read people clearly.  This results in misunderstandings and tragic lives.  What does Alma gain by the end of her life that is worth the pain of a life lived?  Will her love of botany and science be able to understand, process and balance the spiritual and mystic?<br /><br />Honestly after posting about my vehement hatred of Elizabeth's Gilbert's &#34;Eat, Pray, Love&#34; I felt like I needed to give one of her novels a chance.  I am glad I did.<br /><br />This is a captivating novel, although the botanical discussions can be a bit tedious, with insights into life of this realm and life of the realms we do not know about...
B00E8KLWB4|4|This game remains challenging even after playing for a long time. Occassionally it doesn't start and I must reboot my Kindle.

0345533666|5|Within just a few pages of reading Defending Jacob, I was hooked.  Author William Landy hits a perfectly mystifying tone.<br /><br />Lead assistant district attorney Andrew Barber's adolescent son, Jacob, is accussed of murdering a classmate.  In the beginning hours of the murder investigation, Mr. Barber is in charge of handling the DA's case.  When it becomes apparent that his son is the main suspect, another assistant attorney, Neal Logiudice takes over.<br /><br />This novel is peppered with transcripts of grand jury testimony where tense comments are traded between Mr. Logiudice and the 'witness', Andrew Barber.  This adds to building questions and suspense that surround Defending Jacob.<br /><br />Andy holds on tight to the belief that his son did not comitt murder.  Despite strange revelations about his son and the strain on his wife, he still holds on to the belief that his son is innocent.  It is inconceivable to him that a father could think otherwise.<br /><br />As a former district attorney, author, William Landy brings a realistic inside look into the criminal system.  I had read that this novel had a surprising conclusion.  I was trying to guess what it might be while reading.  In the end, I was surprised.<br /><br />First Paragraph<br /><br />1   In the Grand Jury<br /><br />Mr. Logiudice: State your name, please.<br /><br />Witness: Andrew Barber.<br /><br />Mr. Logiudice: What do you do for work, Mr. Barber?<br /><br />Witness: I was an assistant district attorney in this county for 22 years.<br /><br />Mr. Logiudice: &#34;Was.&#34; What do you do for work now?<br /><br />Witness: I suppose you'd say I'm unemployed.<br /><br />In April 2008, Neal Logiudice finally subpoenaed me to appear before the grand jury.  By then it was too late.  Too late for his case, certainly, but also too late for Logiudice.  His reputation was already damaged beyond repair, and his career along with it.  A prosecutor can limp along with a damaged reputation for awhile, but his colleagues will watch him like wolves and eventually he will be forced out, for the good of the pack.  I have seen it many times: an ADA is irreplaceable one day, forgotten the next.&#34;<br /><br />About The Author (from the inside jacket cover)<br /><br />&#34;WILLIAM LANDAY is the author of The Strangler, a Los Angeles Times Favorite Crime Book of the Year, and Mission Flats, winner of the Creasey Memorial Dagger Award for Best First Crime Novel and a Barry Award nominee.
