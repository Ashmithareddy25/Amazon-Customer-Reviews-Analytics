B001T3WXMA|5|They fit my 2002 PT Cruiser perfectly.  They look good and are much improved over the cloudy factory ones.
B00G5OGCDY|5|The threads underneath the screw on cap above the needle jet at the throttle cable was slightly damaged when it arrived but it did not effect my application.  Otherwise product worked great.

B000CQPW78|1|Wrong part for the car. Thanks
B002N3RAJ6|4|A little noisey from the air passing through it otherwise OK.
B000FQ7X90|2|STUDS DO NOT FIT INTO 1956 CJ5
B0070I9D1C|5|good part
B00RD4D9AO|5|It fit great and I successfully installed it myself.  It hasn't fallen off yet, so I'd say it went without a hitch.
B000CKN6Z4|5|Spicer quality
B00I9JJ1WM|5|It was placed on a back window of a car. Easy to do and it looks great
B00LC8X1DM|5|great product, great service
B00XYXPWZ8|5|Great quality, and looks good
B00L35NEUY|5|Lights were easy to install, just pop the old ones out and plug these in.  Installation took less than 5 minutes.  I have had the lights in for about a week and they work great.  The light is crisp and the logo is defined.  Recommend purchase.
B000BKIGFA|4|Works well. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because somehow I missed in the product specs that you shouldn't use it on automotive sheet metal body panels. (Maybe it's not there? It does say on the bottle.) Otherwise, five stars.
B00CS335VS|5|Very nice. Delivered quickly. I'm happy with purchase.
B004DRXY9A|5|These lights are great. Easy to install, just a little adjusting but that was very simple and they look so much better than the old ones.
B000C2S6AM|2|i received the part quite a while ago the box was beat up i didnt think anything of it i go to install it yesterday and i get stopped by the fact the part did not come with the gasket no one in town has the gasket and to get one i have to buy a water pump locally or wait a week to ship it
B0062IJOJ2|5|Easy install. Works great
B00DUM2M0Q|5|Love it. Gives my Dart a bit of oem pizzaz
B003IS3HV0|5|Excellent product!!
B000GBGNLI|1|Was advertised to fit my 328i but it did not fit and I had to pay return shipping
B00HN11YKO|4|The Camry window kit was delivered later than expected. It worked in the reverse order when it was fitted to the door of the car  ... the window glass goes up when you prompt it to go down, and goes down when you prompt it to go up. Otherwise, it works well.
B0012RJY98|5|This is idiot proof. Follow the clearly written instructions. If it doesn't work, the problem is with the trailer or the vehicle, not the wiring in this kit. I was worried about installing it incorrectly, but I am not sure that is even possible. Order this with confidence.
B006H6XHZ6|5|Perfect fit for V Star 1100 custom!
B0095TC604|1|Fell off the mirrors driving on the freeway, should have just thrown my $100 in the fire.
B008DREON6|5|It fit my large visor perfectly in my 2015 Nissan Rogue. I do wish it had a back side that would allow more storage but still is good
B002YR1G32|5|I received a compliment as soon as I put the emblem on my car from another christian. It really looks good on my SUV and it is big enough to be seen with no problem.
B007S392P6|5|Perfect works like a charm, fit finish and installation great thanks. Jef
B001QVPHBO|5|This is a fine product. I bought it because I had to replace my Wi-Fi card in my laptop and needed a T5 torque screwdriver to remove the laptop cover. It works fine and is comfortable to use. I also LOVE the magnetic pull of the heads - absolutely essential when dealing with small screws!
B00C7FO78C|5|Adds a little color and style to my Honda element plus softens the shoulder.
B00B5ZMQDI|5|Arrived in time. Good little kit.
B006WQSN46|5|Worked fine on my 2001 chevy blazer extreme
B000CB42GU|5|These shocks made my truck ride so much better! Highly recommended for trucks! 4x4 or 4x2
B00S8JNBTM|1|DID NOT WORK FOR 2014 Acura RDX - sorry
B004QHEHIY|4|Casing doesn't seem as tight to the edges as I would think, but it's been out in the pouring rain several times and shows no signs of internal water.
B00IXB8QSQ|5|Love it
B0007RDVH0|5|worked good arrived on time
B00HXC42FW|1|Don't recommend the heated grips. The factory  solder broke in the wiring after I pulled the wires through the bars internally. Made a mess.
B00CDR4QT4|5|Good fit great price fast shipping
B00LORVOXA|1|They don't have the Led model.  Waste of time
B00NWF8A4S|5|This item worked perfect with my Escalade.  It did not come with any instructions, however, if you ordered from Amazon.com then of course you have access to a computer and it's simple to look it up.  I went with the refurbished one and saved $20.  It looks brand new and works perfect.  I do  have to say that it didn't work at first and I thought I would have to return it.  I had a cr2032 battery I just bought for a scale, that didn't work by the way, sitting around and gave it a try and boom it worked.  So other than coming with a dead battery it was in perfect shape.  I'm not deducting a star for the battery because they die all the time.  The remote has a beautiful Cadillac emblem on it that is raised and jeweled, it is not a sticker so it will not peel off.  I highly recommend this product to anyway looking for a second or third remote.
B004G0HO22|5|They worked awesome!! Thanks.
B00P2UZX5A|5|Nice, seems like a quality product.
B000NVW1LM|5|good
B00RXXLJGG|1|too thick to be used in my 2013 CRV.
B004RCP0ZC|4|It works as expected. For the price it does a good basic job. There is no load terminals. The battery cables come with ring connectors and the solar terminals come as bare wire.
B00IL2XIM6|5|I bought this for my lawn tractor and it made maneuvering around objects a lot easier...
B00ZRJCYQ2|5|Excellent set to use when removing car door, dash etc.. parts.
B00C0SQPOA|5|Good
B0053ZAIYU|2|Only one of the lights work, witch is the front white one... Can't do anything to get the red light to work. It was delivered broken.

B000BYB25C|5|Item was just as I needed.<br />Thanks mallory
B00B7HBIOW|5|This is a good product. It works great to replace the original part.
B0013HYAV4|5|Other then needing about 30 seconds to kind of warm up, looks great!
B001EA0LI6|5|Good price for the product.
B00AC6Y9S6|4|Nice, well made bag. I got the jumbo that can expand up to 38 liters. If packed carefully, this will be enough for a few days out. The only thing I didn't like were the hooks that clip into place. They are kind of hard to pull when the bag is full, at least on my bike (Suzuki Gladius). I drove under light rain and the content of the bag remained dry.
B003ANM688|5|perfect
B010AI8VMA|5|Looking around Amazon, there aren't many good wireless wiring harnesses. This surprised me cause I figured being able to remotely turn on your fog lights is pretty useful. Not to mention not having to drill through your firewall and having to install a button. In the end, I settled for the mictuning wireless wiring harness, and I am more than happy with the product. It was exceptionally easy to hook up with only positive, negative, and  ground wires (one of each). There was plenty of wiring incase you wanted to use the included switch,  but I disconnected it to really on the remote. It's been two months now, and I am still ecstatic at how well the harness works, it's great being able to turn it on from outside the car. When I go on excursions, I park my truck facing camp, so that I can remotely turn on the fog lights and instantly have plenty of light at night. This harness is well worth the money.
B001Y1V02Q|5|I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FIANCE'S CAR AS HIS OTHER ONE WAS A GONER.THIS CAR COVER HOLDS ON TIGHT EVEN WITH THE STRONG WINDS WE HAVE HERE IN WISCONSIN...IT HAS A THICK AND STURDY FEEL TO IT AND WITH THE WINTERS WE WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE MY HONEY'S OTHER BABY PROTECTED FROM ALL THE SNOW...HE LOVES THE COVER AND HIS CAR...HA!HA!THANKS A BUNCH!!

B004GCZ4FY|5|Fits and looks just like the original.
B00C2NEYSC|5|Everything was ok
B000BKIGPA|5|After a couple of recent bicycle-motor vehicle accidents locally wherein visibility was a factor I looked into options for my rig.  I bought the emblem, spade mount, and mounting socket all together. It was a plus that all three were made in the USA (United States of America). I stopped at a hardware store and customized the mounting socket attachment for another $3.32.  It turned out great.  Jim
B0002F9YHS|5|I detail cars for extra $$$ and it's one one the best leather conditioners out there.
B00663US7U|4|nice jersey
B001429I5Q|5|I'm always skeptical buying site unseen but this cover met my expectations. I have a 12 call of duty rubicon and it fit flawlessly. Also tried the cover on my 08 trailblazer ss and it fit as well. Just ordered my second cover. Very good buy.
B00W8LRKYS|2|Did not stick very well. Had to buy different tape to install them with. The two front ones did not curve to the contour of my car.
B00HVHMFF8|4|Works fine, easy to apply to existing key fob. My first lasted about a year and for the price it was worth replacing with the same one
B0010GK3SM|5|Perfect fit. OEM part
B004MEBENM|5|Works great!
B00TITQWFQ|5|Product arrived quickly. After watching a few YouTube videos I was able to use this repair kit to fix my speedometer and gas gauge. Everything I needed, minus the soldering tools, was included.
B000GV9Z04|5|excellent

B00D9C2CDO|5|Did a great job.  Five hour trip each way.  It rained and nothing was wet.
B000COS4KC|3|Filtration is crap. I didn't realize it was a screen filter, won't really help unless you've got rocks in your pan. Maybe I can find a paper filter insert, otherwise useless.
B00CJUW3HW|5|Looks AWESOME! I have it with the Dalek decal now...... both together are great!!
B007Q0KOM6|2|Item did not come with a master link!
B001FSN6NO|5|Perfect size for in car use.  Great that the interior is liquid proof.  Easy to clean and empty.
B0024E6V9E|5|Keeps filter upright and off yhe ground, good quality
B006H5M89S|2|It worked but after a few weeks it would not charge.!
B0091YV1F4|5|I liked these Lights the illuminate all the inside of my car and I also placed them in the back on the reverse lights so I have blue reverse lights and on my license plate lol they look pretty cool especially at night.
B00KSL6TQA|5|Awesome mats, give my 2014 jetta a sporty look.  Love these mats and I am
B004QN2O6U|5|Seems to be the right product and delivered ahead of schedule
B000C93C9K|5|I replaced the muffler and tailpipes a few years ago on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 pickup with extended cab (141.5” wheelbase) and this was a perfect fit. If you’re using a Walker 22719 muffler and have pipes that turn out behind the rear wheel this is the pipe you need. I’d suggest using the Walker site to get the correct part number and then shop around for the best price. I had to replace my engine because it was burning oil so I also replaced the crossover pipe, converter and had to add an extension pipe because the new converter was shorter than the one it replaced. All were Walker pipes (or Dynomax which is also Walker) and all fit perfectly. I now have to replace the muffler again because it’s filled with soot from the oil but I used a compression clamp and it bent the intermediate pipe in the muffler inlet so much I had to cut it off at the muffler and add a short extension so don’t use compression clamps if you think you’ll ever need to get it apart later… I went with the stainless lap preformed clamps the go over the pipes… like the SmartParts 300300 & 320300… and I’ll probably do the same with the 2-1/4” tailpipes.
B00AN5KBRE|5|Have had this winch on my JKU for over a year now and used it several times. First time pulled two full sized trucks up a slick muddy hill with cable fully extended on both pulls. Pulled steady with no hickups. When finished the winch wasn't even warm. I did have to contact Comeup regarding an issue with the connection for the control cable not fitting tight causing the winch to cut out during a pull. Their US CS guy express mailed me a new internal wiring harness with connector. Opened the box and found he'd included a free tow rope and tree saver for my trouble. Tore down the winch and installed the new wiring harness with no issues since. Used it to pull up bushes and small trees doing landscape work and felling trees. Makes the job sooo much easier. I did replace the steel cable with synthetic rope to lighten up my front end. After tearing the winch down to replace the wiring harness, I can tell you this is one stout, well made winch. I picked it up for just under $500 about a year ago so it was a super deal compared to the Warn winches. If you search you'll find some reviews from Australian 4x4 mags that run the Comeup,  Warn, Superwinch and others through pretty grueling tests and they rate the Comeup at the top.  Great bang for your buck.
B00OJOYKEK|5|good product
B004UPZXQM|5|This stuff is great for a quick detailing leaves the car real slick.
B00D4TWPAC|2|Really do you need a wrench keychain to remove tire valve caps.
B00PNKHW4E|5|I bought the Type 1 from the amazon prime seller. Why wait for shipping from the China sellers and have to wait a month or more. Also, you may have to pay return shipping if the product is defective. The type 1 came exactly as pictured from the amazon seller.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the bulb. This is an awesome light and deal at $28. I mounted it on my DRZ400S. It is slightly brighter but is much more noticeable to other drivers, vs the poor halogen that came with the bike. The power usage was the main reason I got it. The DRZ400s doesn't have a great charging system and the halogen bulb uses too much power.<br /><br />I have only had it for a week but it survived 5 hours of trail riding which means it will hold up. If it doesn't stop working I will update my review.
B00HAV0IHC|3|We bought these seat covers for a 2011 Mini Cooper Clubman. There were no instructions with this item. We had no idea which loop attached to which. The fit is OK not great. The product would be better if it were made of a more stretchy material since it is a generic one-size-fits-most kind of deal.  By the way get your facts straight about the comic book characters. Like others have stated, Batman is a DC Comics character.
B00OUM8GLY|5|Fits my Nissan Versa nicely. I like the small amount of extra cloth to keep Sunday off the dashboard. Material seems high quality. Easy to put onto dashboard.
B00WJOG4BO|5|Not much to say other than great product. Fits perfect and has stayed in place for several months now. Couldn't be happier.
B00KJGPN2K|5|Works perfect great quality easy to set up
B002QG43UO|5|Perfect.
B0053YV264|5|I've been using this keychain for a few months now and it is still in excellent shape! I'm very surprised since I don't think it is leather. My daughter loves to play with it too.
B00407V4I6|5|Good product.
B00CP6MAN2|5|Great
B003V57NUQ|1|This thing is a piece of crap, do not buy it! Also it costs just as much to send it back if you need to return. Now they just sit in the box in my garage because they do not fit together properly and they were rusted when I got them. Seller required us to pay return shipping which cost barely less than buying them. ALSO they SUCK to get on the roof rack if you can mange to get them together.
B00KQCMCQW|1|the color comes off especially when wearing bug spray
B004DHINUK|5|High quality sticker that goes on with ease!
B00065JM8U|5|Installed it in my semi truck and it works great nice solid fan so happy with my purchase.
B008WOUNAI|5|My truck has never ridden better
B00DJ5KL6Q|5|Haven't used them yet because I was given another pair! but will hold onto them as replacements!!
B005R6R6DG|4|Nice and Easy to use
B00G0KRHK0|3|This works when I turn on the AC (at least that's when I notice it). At other times I guess my nose gets used to the smell and doesn't register it to my brain.
B00N3AMAIE|5|good fit
B008WGOF3M|1|Absolutely garbage. It is NOT poly urethane or even close to it. It feels like card board and you can see inside of it the pieces glued/molded together. Arrived very bent I feel like it will crack the second I puta screw through it. I am doing everything i can to get a refund.
B004SJ2GFG|5|Excelente producto
B009DJOWG2|5|Bumper fit perfectly and looks great.
B0012PP0WK|5|Excelente producto
B00UW4DNEO|4|Who would have thought Lithium Ion battery technology could be so useful? I was looking for a replacement for my 40 pound jumper box when I came across this.<br /><br />At just a pound or two, this product has the same punch as my old one; at least, that's the claim.  I haven't put it to the test yet, but I can describe what I received.<br /><br />The product came attractively boxed and well packaged.  It was fully charged and ready to go.  I like that it has two USB ports to charge just about everything using the various adapters that come with it.  Nothing looks cheap or substandard here.<br /><br />The jumper cables are part of a special plug assembly that lets you know via lights and sound  whether you've improperly hooked up the battery,  but it gives you a basic indication of the battery's condition: either weak or damaged internally. The process is foolproof,  but do read the directions.<br /><br />The directions are clear, but here's the downside of this product: The printing is very small and it could be hinderance in an emergency situation.  A way around this is to either memorize the procedures, carry a magnifying glass or copy the instructions and enlarge them.  A laminated card with jumping procedures would be very handy here.<br /><br />Other than that, I think this is a very good product.  The jumper itself can be charged via AC current or 12V battery current.  The built-in flashlight is very bright and useful and you get to pick what color you want the jumper in.  This would be perfect to use when the power is out or when you're somewhere there's no place to charge electronics.<br /><br />Everything comes neatly organized and packaged in a vinyl case that zips around the edges and the case itself is a little smaller than a standard-sized notebook.<br /><br />While I haven't put this product to use yet, i've been impressed enough with its quality and design to be confident regarding its use and that it will work as advertised.
B006EHLML4|4|It's fits my 2005 Camry.
B00XJYO97O|5|Installs easy works better
B00A8VYAES|5|It works awesome and it cost very little thanks guys
B00029WSWM|4|good
B00F7H0KNS|2|These stickers are not silk screened. They are laser printed and you can clearly see the the lines of the print matrix on the item in the green field.
B00JRE38EA|5|Product as advertised + quick shipping.
B000BRMYN8|3|It is good, but should eliminate first smaller bump, it confuses and sometimes end up in parking outside of mat just touching it. Also, Mat should be little wider as based on car size sometimes tires do not rest on the mat.
B000CO7BQK|5|Great, works like a dream.
B007PP26RI|5|Great product!!!
B0085XFIKG|1|It looks good at first and easy to install. However, the white quickly turns to a dull cream / yellow color.
B002U6ELS4|5|great
B000RD5X34|5|Seems to be well made, if need be, will purchase again in another 10 years.
B007IUBMBG|5|Love it!!!!
B00UFERZKO|4|THE BESTEK® 400W Power Inverter POWERS MY BI-PAP MACHINE FOR ONE NIGHT WITH THE Clore Automotive Jump-N-Carry JNC660 1700 Peak Amp 12-Volt PORTABLE TRUCK JUMP STARTER; ABOUT 2 HOURS ONLY WITH A PORTABLE. CAR JUMP STARTER I GOT AT SAM'S CLUB. BOTH JUMP STATER BATTERIES WERE COMPLETELY EMPTIED AND TOOK 18-24 HOURS TO FULLY RECHARGE. USING THESE BATTERIES FOR A WEEK OR SO MIGHT BURN THEM OUT, BUT FOR AN EMERGENCY THE TRUCK BATTERY IS THE WAY TO GO. I HAVE NOT TRIED THE USB PORTS, BUT THE AC POWER SOCKETS WORK FOR LIGHTS, POWER ADAPTER/CHARGERS, AND, PRESUMABLY, OTHER SMALL POWER CONSUMING APPLIANCES AND GADGETS. IT MAKES SOME NOISE WHEN THE FAN RUNS, BUT I DO NOT HEAR IT OVER MY BI-PAP MACHINE.
B000AD30I6|5|Fits perfect in my 06 duramax, i can now throw some stuff behind the seat and no body knows its there.
B00VNBDWPK|5|I have been a big fan of aftermarket HID headlight kits and have installed a couple dozen over the last ten years.  I have also watched HID kits go from high-quality metallic ballasts to cheap parts that will literally fall apart in your hands if you try to remove and reinstall them.  More and more, I run into kits with basic issues like flickering, polarity, overheating and failure.<br /><br />I was quite skeptical of LED-based kits when they hit the market a couple of years ago.  I decided to take a chance with these OPT7 lights as the reviews were favorable and the parts seemed of high-quality.<br /><br />And wow, was I impressed.  The product was very easy to install, the ballast is 1/3 of the size of even a slimline HID ballast, and the output is probably 30-50% brighter than the HID equivalent.  I decided to run these in my foglights as I wasn't sure how well they would hold up to the Arizona heat, but now that they've been in for a couple of weeks, I'll be ordering another set to replace the low beam HID lamps which see much more use.  At this point, I'm sure that they will outlast the HID's that are coming out of the car.
B001L9ZBZS|3|The typical decal.  But VERY tiny.  Had no idea it would be that small.  If the measurement was listed, I didn't see it.
B000E4SQ0I|5|Added on a '94 Honda Civic, was the same deal.<br /><br />Worked great!
B003YMVOUG|5|Perfect fit and function.
B005N53AM2|5|About two years later and it's still intact! When you first install, it makes your car smell like a tire because the inside is basically like a bike tire. But it goes away! The feel is good, however, the fabric gets dirty pretty quick. But I love mine!
B00KHLH2GC|3|Good  on the size for  conveniences but  needs more  suction.
B010HDYV22|5|Just received these in the mail today. Easy install and super bright.
B00MOR4CME|5|These are very bright and have a perfect color white.
B003BZD03K|5|Very satisfied exactly what I was looking for.
B00RW7WYNU|5|Inexpensive and works very well.
B003E3K9AQ|5|snapped on and adds style to the front grill
B0031BTFO2|5|If you follow the directions it works great. In addition to wearing around your neck you can use it in many different ways. I like to wear it under a dark colored cap, sets up air current and keeps my head cool even when there is no breeze. Feels cleaner against your skin than most evaporative cooling clothing, just slightly damp, very pleasant.
B00BQKHMZO|2|terrible smell!
B00JOQX8VO|5|Great Stuff !!!
B0002SRCZQ|5|Works as described

B00HFHDDVO|5|Well-made, great features, nice styling. I'll be using this for international trips as a carry-on, and with the 4 D-Rings, I can also wear it backpack-style if I need to carry a spare helmet to pick up a friend. Recommended.

B005CW9P2K|5|work good
B00KBAQHII|5|Genuine Nissan part for much less than the dealer price. Fixed my problem in 10 minutes, no more check engine light.
B004ZF4MW8|2|check if this is appropriate for your car. I have a caddy SRX. and it flickers. sometimes it works , sometimes it does not. I need other wires to get it to work correctly. had them professionally installed. this can become a lot more expensive if you are not prepared and in my case you don't know until its installed.  may be better to go with a more expensive kit.
B00QEC0ANA|4|Arrived on time and was easy to install
B001T8J4YK|1|Not anuff black smoke
B012IJ6AW2|4|Awesome variety, although one sticker came off the next day. All the others have stayed on my cooler and it's been two weeks. I'd buy again

B000F0QWKC|5|Fits perfectly fine in my 2006 acura rsx
B004GNJD0A|5|Used it to run USB on my motorcycle to shield it from the engine heat. So far so good.
B001EP0H7Q|5|Just what I wanted. It worked great to fix a trailer I had
B008I2OZK8|4|It looked great, but the blemishes showed up with just driving it. I guess the wind washed it out.
B0087U3520|4|Was not exactly what I was looking for, but I was able to modify and use it for my 1993 Mazda MX-3.
B00XZ9OZXG|5|Works great not hard to program
B004GCOS60|4|Very tight fit but once u got it on little by little, it's perfect for the price! I almost thought I had to return it but no more :)
B002R0R3D8|5|Arrived on time and as described
B0056RP9RQ|1|Used it one time one day. Went to use the next day and it was locked up. I will send it back, just haven't  had the time. The pump it replaced lasted years and was the exact same model and Manufacture. Really disappointed.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Awesome!  Lots of great comments every time I step out of the car after placing this in the windshield.  Definitely a great buy with a classic movie screen shot!  nice quality.  Just bought an Avengers one for my wife's van
B005R287A6|5|Excellent quality easy to install<br />I am happy with my choice

B000WO7D72|1|A must have.
B000UIY5TO|1|A waste of time.<br /><br />Description says that it fits a 2002 Buck Lesabre. This is false, as the assembly fits in the slot but the screw holes do not line up, and the rubber gasket gets in the way so that the screws become too short. This poor product was a blessing in disguise though.<br /><br />A word of device if you are going to replace your blower motor, open the top of the assembly on the old one. For me, dirt came pouring out. After emptying the dirt and soot I put it back in and it now works like a charm. Try this before spending money on the new part.
B000MAJQOE|1|First of all I ordered a front and rear set for my girlfriends Honda Ridgeline and the front set fit perfect and we love them.  The back set however fit like garbage, and this material is impossibly to get tight for a good clean look.  We got them with the intention of the dogs riding in the back seat and wanted something that would stand up to their claws without being easily torn, and for that this material would be fine.  Coverking uses these plastic pieces sewn to the material in the back of the seat that you are supposed to simply press between the seatback and the cab of the truck to retain the cover in place, well they don't stay in place very good and they have ridiculously sharp edges that will start to work their way up that can/will cut you very easily.  I was dealing with coverking customer service on the phone and via emails sending them pictures of the unacceptable condition and fit of the covers, and big surprise there was absolutely no resolution from them.
B005JU5W54|5|After years of dealing with terrible windshield wipers that always leaves streaks behind or made a lot of noise, I'm glad to finally find one that's actually perfect in every way. Purchasing this wiper was so easy...I had forgotten what size my windshield wiper was at first, but since I was able to enter my car model on the Amazon website, it made finding the right size extremely easy. You should note that the driver and passenger side windshield wipers are sold separately. A stands for driver side, B stands for passenger side. I think what surprised me the most was how EASY it was to install wiper. Other windshield wipers I have purchased usually comes with 5 attachments. This one, however, came pre-installed. All I did was open up the hatch, hook it onto my windshield, and I was done!
B00SUNH7GY|3|Nice lights. I Put them on my 2011 HD Fatboy Lo but had trouble with switch after a week. I had an extended back and forth with customer care before they shipped replacement switch. Replacement took longer to get than the whole kit took when purchased. A little frustrating. New switch came with inline fuse that original did not have. Seems to be working well now.
B00ATQ0ML2|1|Sent it back OD size was wrong. Never heard from the company.
B00826OVWW|1|Junky
B003SYXQTW|5|Works
B009DJYTQU|4|Not quite as good as OEM, but for the price you can't beat it.
B005MZXB0Y|5|Perfect
B00P8DEXFC|5|these fit my 2015 Crew-cab Canyon perfectly, couldn't ask for a better fit.  They are a little thinner that I thought they would be, but that actually works better than I thought it would.  They cup upwards around the perimeter which holds them perfectly in place and the two &#34;pegs&#34; on the driver's side (I was worried about this) fit like a glove.  Great product, I am certain they will outlast the truck.  Thanks for a quality product!
B000DN7Q3S|5|Product delivered as promised and described.  5 minute installation!
B00CP6MB5Y|5|Great
B00D8BFJP4|4|cool sticker
B00JR33NMS|5|Great handle.  I use it to get in and out of my hot tub.
B009B9ND00|5|Folds and unfolds easily, fits the windshield perfectly, and keeps the car cool. The only downside is that when folded, it's a bit larger than the cheaper sunshades. Overall though, it was well worth the money.
B00Z5SCQ90|5|As advertised, very bright, delivered early.
B00OCEGTZA|5|works on dot 3 and dot 4. so do not be fooled by the bs. i trust this tool and like it because the strips you have to figure out what it shows and this powerbuilt just lights up and tells you the truth
B00290YD2U|5|Looks sweet and even came with a mustang keychain for free.
B00GYTEE9O|5|although I haven't installed the filter yet I have no doubt it will fit and do exactly what it's suppose to do
B00XN63X2K|4|my order came quickly and the item i ordered was very simple too install in about an hour, would recommend this it to others
B00768A3TW|5|Five stars for the great value. There might be better child headsets available but my main need was a metal headband. I've seen too many broken plastic headsets and in a child's hands, it's almost guaranteed.
B000C9FP3G|5|Love it just as described
B00ENCQ7YO|4|Just as diatribes worked wells
B00JMCCE6U|5|Arrived like expected.
B006ZQ2Q46|3|regulator works great, had to drill hole to use supplied handle. Could not use old handle.
B00AXRRF26|3|my order was broken when arrived..!!!
B0014FGVVW|4|Works great! The product was too short for the job. I extended the length using a deep rachet socket (glued on tool shaft) and putting notches on thumb screw to operate mandrel. This tool saved my life....That's why I gave it a 4 star rating.
B00G7N5AD6|5|Just what I wanted!!
B007SZCUIA|5|THE LIGHT IS FANTASTIC HAVE INSTALLED IT IN OUR TENT TRAILER, LIGHT IS MUCH MORE THAN ORIGIONAL & NO HEAT, WE SHALL SEE HOW IT HOLD UP IN THE UP COMING TRIP...
B00VU8YRGO|5|Used in a '86 Ford Ranger with a 2.9l V6. My truck came with a .75&#34; radiator originally from the factory.  The truck is lifted 6&#34; with a 4.10 posi, automatic transmission, air conditioning , and big tires. I live in Arizona where we have over 100 days a year with temperatures great than 100 degrees F.  Some days the temp exceeds 115 degrees F.  With that said, I was looking to keep the running temp below 220 degrees. The hotter the engine would run, the hotter the transmission would get. The AC effectiveness would drop too.  I added this radiator, two small electric pusher fans. Moved the transmission cooler to below the radiator. Changed the radiator hoses to the blue silicon , required to compensate for the upper port of the radiator being angled instead of straight. Took a little trimming of the hose.  Dropped my running temp to 190 degrees F with an ambient temperature of 110 degrees.  Prior to installing the radiator, I flushed the cooling system with Royal Purple Cooling System cleaner.  My cooling system has always been  well maintained.  My transmission is also performing better.  Possible due to running much cooler in the brutal Arizona heat.  The capacity of this radiator is more than twice that of my factory unit.  Most engine failures are cooling system related.  My 30 year old truck is running strong. Photos of it were recently posted on the USA's number one Ford Dealers website. I hope to keep my truck running for years to come.  I will post any updated related to this product.  The quality is very impressive.  The price is far less than a dealership replacement  From a thermodynamics view, increasing capacity, along with the ability of the 100percent aluminum construction increased heat transfer coefficient, this radiator is the way to go. Remember, lower hose connection is direct replacement.  For my '86 ranger 2.9 l V6 I had to trim a little off a 4.0 ranger V6 upper hose.  I purchased the Ford Ranger 4.0 blue silicone hoses here on Amazon.
B000G76OKW|3|The gun seems well made. That's the good part. The grease tube that came with it was only half full. Putting in the grease tube and closing the spring loaded cap was a real job. It seems the rubber plunger is larger than the grease tube so you really have to work it to get in right and straight. Once in and primed up it worked well until I tried to pull the head of the grease fitting. Finally tried backing off the head by turning it and got it off. Might try loading it up with bulk grease the next time.
B000EVYGZA|5|Worked as expected. Came on time.
B00BZSE5CK|5|For $5 and change, you can't go wrong. This is OEM and it just finishes off the back end of the jeep nicely. Additionally, it protects your hitch receiver from rust, bumps, scrapes etc...
B003AOM17I|5|Fits a 1980 Dodge truck.
B004KEJXGE|1|Bought this to remove my electronic fan clutch on 06 Ford Explorer  the wrench that fits the fan clutch kept expanding out I had to beet it back several times to make it fit still wouldn't work so I went and rented on from autozone finally got the fan clutch off I would recommend this at all
B003VGL1DU|5|These were perfect - and the price was a very good deal. Instead of getting one light I got two for the same price!
B000O868JA|4|Worked well enough to find two leaks in the vehicle A/C line!
B000VVSPX2|5|Excellent cover, fits my Ultra perfectly.  I did install shrink tube on the metal hooks, I didn't like them touching my chrome and paint when covering the bike.
B00XBUK19Q|5|Really good quality stickers that won't peel off really good product for your cost.
B004XEKJUK|1|best buy it from the flea markets
B000KL38U8|5|Best addition at to my truck ever,live in mountains,lots of snow and mud
B00T8M800S|5|Easy install looks good on the truck
B0024E6TX2|5|Works well,delivered early quality product
B0014BEWBM|5|This filter head is a GREAT replacement for a Jeep Liberty CRD! If you own a CRD, you know about the fuel filter head issues. Minor brass fitting  plumbing and hose barbs, and your rolling again! This filter has no primer pump, so i would recommend an inline lift pump such as the Carter P4070 fuel pump.
B003YIBTJG|4|Item is perfect but I took one star off for the price. It's awfully expensive for a small piece of plastic but I guess that's what you get when you buy a German luxury car with no practical purpose.
B002JOVUO0|5|Fixed our Honda. There is rubber tread material on top of the rear bumper and it had come loose after 11 years. This stuff reattached it and it's as good as new.
B008720YYA|5|If your FICM reads less than 45 VDC during cranking then this is your fix. I installed it and cycled the fuel pump a few times and then went for start. It started right up. Works perfectly on my 05 f250 6.0L crank and no start issue. FICM's cost $750.00 at the dealership and around $500.00 from the Diesel Shops online, THIS IS AFFORDABLE EVEN IF YOU DO GET IT WRONG!!
B005YP4LPG|5|Fits without a problem! I bought a key from another vendor and that one sticks a little bit. I prefer this one.
B00ACEMIKY|1|Never ever buy this the plug broke off in the socket
B00FZALDH4|5|This came with the tungsten tip & extender was not expecting to get 2 parts EPIC WIN!
B000WK4CS4|5|I replaced the battery in my 2006 SV650 with this. Although pouring acid into the battery seems rather intimidating, the instructions and YouTube videos are very clear. After installing this battery the bike sat for a month. When the weather finally broke, started the bike, and it fired right up. I have since sold the bike, but I am sure this battery will last the new owner for years to come.
B003IOITIK|5|Great price, awesome tool
B002YCAGAG|1|Initially, i ordered the Dorman belt tension for my 98 Saturn sl2 from rockauto.com to fix the clanking coming from the old belt tensioner. The first week it worked fine, but after that the noise came back just as badly as the one I replaced. After a few months, I went to amazon to see what everybody else had to say about the Dorman, and all the reviews were horrible. I looked at all the belt tensioners until I came to this ACDelco, and saw that all the reviews were positive. After replacing the Dorman with the ACDelco, putting the serpentine belt on the ACDelco was a huge pain compared to the Dorman because it was much stronger, but it's been a month and there's no noise at all! The Dorman is noticeably cheaper, but it is not worth it, spend the extra amount! I NEVER write reviews for products, but I felt this was serious enough to write one for it.
B004IYZMUW|5|Works
B00OK7SDVM|1|Great replacements for the OEM parts! Cant complain.  Update: Aug 2016 product has completely failed. Had to pay a mechanic to replace them because one had broken off at the bolt an could not be removed.
B00GRHSU5C|5|First, a bit about which shade is which---the descriptions here can be confusing and the pictures don't always match up with the product you're ordering.  For 2007-2015 Wranglers, 2 or 4 door, all the product numbers begin with 13579., followed by two digits which designate which body style and how much of that style the shade will cover.  Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />.06  07-15 JK 2 door only.  Covers from the windshield over the sound bar to the rear of the roll bars where they begin to turn down.<br />.04  07-15 JK or JKU (2 door OR 4 door.). Covers the front seat area only from the windshield to the sound bar.  Shorter than the .06 version.<br />.05  07-15 JKU (4 door only.)  Covers from the windshield all the way back to the rear cross bar, the one with the interior light attached to it.  This is  the one I purchased.<br /><br />I installed this on a 2013 Sahara Unlimited with soft top.  I can't say how it will work with a hard top that has the removable panels.  The instructions include specific directions for those with that configuration.<br /><br />Installation was easy.  Took about 20 minutes.  The bungee cords will work around any attachments you might have hanging off the roll bars.  One suggestion:  the instructions have you first attach the velcro tabs to the front &#34;footmen&#34; which are the brackets the soft top clamps onto.  There's three  footmen and there's 4 velcro tabs  The footman at the center of the windshield gets 2 velcro tabs, the  footmen where the top clamps go get one tab each.  The instruction photos don't show the middle footman.  Nor do they show the two bungee cords sewn into the front hem, each with a small plastic hook on the end.  These hooks go into the footmen and add some rigidity to the front attachment of the shade.  I suggest you make the front velcro tabs as tight as possible so that when you un-velcro them when re-latching the soft top  (you have to do this in order to allow the top clamps to work) it makes them easier to redo the next time you put the top up.<br /><br />I would guess the shade blocks about 40-50% of the light, just enough to cut a blazing sun.  On the road at highway speeds there is no noticeable flapping noise.  In fact, my wife said it actually cuts the buffeting.  I can't say how the bungees and the mesh will hold up long term to the effects of sunlight.  Only time will tell, but the shade does come with a 5 year warranty.  I like the fact you can keep the screen installed year-round even with the soft top in the &#34;winter&#34; position (down an latched.)  Also, the shade will prevent sagging and water pooling if you cover the jeep in rainy weather.  I find this a big plus.<br /><br />If you drive your Wrangler in the &#34;open air&#34; mode this shade looks to be just the ticket.  Tight fit, economical and adds to the enjoyment of your open air motoring.  A definite 5 star product!<br /><br />ETA 9-5-15<br />Some factual errors in the original review (my bad,  I missed one complete step):<br />1.  The instructions do indeed include reference to the center footman and how to attach the TWO velcro tabs, one of which may be cut off should you desire.<br />2.  Additionally the instructions do include reference to the bungee cords with hooks for attachment to the footmen.<br /><br />We just returned from 5 days in the Outer Banks which included a 2 1/2 hour trip to get there (and the same to return.)  I am revising my star rating to SIX (6) Stars!!top up.  I would guess the shade blocks about 40-50% of the light, just enough to cut a blazing sun.

B009IKXXSO|5|love these Jerseys great for hot weather lots of air flow but in spring and fall in Canada they may be a bit too light.
B00PG0QX2S|4|nice product
B007DMZCWE|5|This is a great product. Installation was pretty straight forward, but I am a bit of a perfectionist, so I added some cable clamps and a bunch of wire ties to dress things up and keep any of the wires from being snagged (we have some really big tumbleweeds in this area). The directions were good and the kit is mostly adequate for a simple installation.
B0054LD2ZA|5|Love this product!  Looks great on my car.  Easily installed.  Prompt delivery!
B00DTHIQA2|5|Perfect fit, Perfect price!
B001B79TJ4|5|Great product! Exact fit. Great price and speedy delivery.
B0016KG77S|5|Not much to say, these are exactly what I wanted. As a belt & suspenders kind of guy, I peeled the adhesive backing, stuck them to the trailer and also screwed them down with stainless screws.<br /><br />Note: you don't get screws with them, Home Depot, Lowes or wherever will have them and you might as well get the stainless.
B00SXKWPF2|5|Looks Great!
B00NPIUFMM|5|These bulbs are roughly three times brighter than halogen bulbs and would recommend them to anyone
B004MCBO8O|4|Worked great as a prank for my wife! Every time we pass another vehicle with these on their car she would scowl and make a comment about how much she hates them! With the birth of our first little girl I joked that I would someday put them on her car. Sure enough for her birthday last week they magically appeared on her car!!<br /><br />Joke went off great and all her friends who knew of her disdain for these stickers loved it! (Of course the picture of her new car artwork was on facebook within minutes). While they are still there I am waiting for her to peel them off any day!<br /><br />I only gave 4 stars because for those seriously buying and leaving these stickers up, there is not much variety. I bought two complete sets because we have three dogs. Of course all four dogs between the two sets were identical. So it looks a little plain and boring. I figure if your going to give two of anything at least make them a little different... But other than that they applied well and looked nice.

The previous cap, the center spring loaded electrode fell off when I removed it, so I can't say this is really better than the previous one but it looks more robust. I also used the accel rotor.

B0075OWK4I|5|They work!
B001BB8L7G|3|I bought two of them. One is red as advertised while the other one is light shaded red which is really off when you put both of the seat covers on. The other lightly shaded red is also shorter then the red one. Would have been nice if they were both the same but I guess that's what I get for buying made in China stuff.

B00PT3EKY0|5|OEM is the way to go particularly with the wiring harness that comes with needed relay, fuses and computer box.  This all allows the factory trailer wiring to function properly on its own circuit.
B005CCC2P2|1|THIS IS THE WORST ALARM EVER. DO NOT BUY!!<br />The alarm kept going off even when it is not armed (locked). It is way too sensitive... goes off if you breathe on it. Very aggravating.

B004J0RBA4|1|The Depo 315-55026-400 Blade is not a fit for my 2002 Nissan Pathfinder as Amazon indicates. The original fan had cracking on the plastic hub and looked questionable as far as its holding together.  After an hour's work to get the old fan out, it was clear that the metal ring part with the four bolt holes was the incorrect size to fit over my thermal clutch.  The dealer was closed for the weekend and no one else in town had an OEM style fan I could use.  I picked up an OEM one from the dealer at $103.88 on Monday AM to finish the job.  If you look at my picture closely, you’ll notice the inner metal ring is cut from a different template.  So, either I somehow got a manufacturer mix-up, or this in not for my series Nissan Pathfinder SE with the 3.5L V6.  The quality looked decent enough for whatever car it really fits on though.  The dealer part No. 21060-6P00A that did fit lists for $169.73 but I talked them down to $98.00 plus tax by mentioning internet dealers.  And now here goes my first Amazon return ever!
B002UC2UB8|5|I love it. great product so far. Learned my lesson from not having one.
B007CLNIZY|5|Mirror fit perfectly. Works great! Very satisfied customer!

B005ASY23I|5|This product is very nice and the service too.
B00B301V36|4|Small enough to fit on motorcycle mirrors.  Pretty light in weight and good adhesive.
B004X5QPSO|2|My review is due to the compatibility of the radiator to the model listed. I bought one from this dealer because it was listed as fitting the 2002 Ford Ranger, 3.0L V-6, 5spd, automatic XLT 4 Door. The fitting size of the automatic transmission cooler was much smaller than what I have on my hose ends. (It was for 3/8&#34; I believe, where as mine is 5/8&#34;.) I contacted the dealer and was told this the only radiator they show for my model. I returned the radiator for a full credit and bought one from Shepherd Auto Parts that fit just right.<br /><br />Check your transmission to radiator fitting size before ordering this radiator.
B004W5TJMO|5|Perfect fit. Look exactly oem. Loved them. Come with the little sponge cushion spacer and all.
B00E1ETJNU|5|Simple, Matte, love it.
B00SBZAG5U|5|Customer service is superior. Great follow-up.
B000P0ZK1O|4|Great tool, wish it came with replacement o-ring.
B000K0080W|1|Not original ACDelco GM Equipment.
B003G9G4X4|5|I have a Suburban 10 gallon tank, a SW10DE.  I wanted to change out the element this year as it has been 12 years since I bought my fifth wheel.  I still have hot water but just wanted to check.  The unit is longer than the one that came with the fifth wheel. But it fit.  IF you have never changed an element, I would suggest that you go to Youtube and search &#34;Replace Suburban water heater element&#34;.  There is a 9 minute video that explains all you need to know.  I move slowly and deliberately and so this took about 20 minutes.  So here is what I did.<br /><br />Tools needed: straight head and cross head screw drivers, 7/16&#34; wrench, 11mm wrench (7/16&#34; should have worked but whatever), Camco 9953 Professional Water Heater Element Socket, 1/2&#34; socket driver and that is all.  Watch the video.<br /><br />Took out the old element and then installed the new one.<br /><br />Turned on the fifth wheel power and bingo, hot water.<br /><br />My unit came from an RV dealer and parts supplier in IN.  Said that it would take up to 10 days to receive it.  It took 3 days to be delivered and I live in Wyoming.<br /><br />It was a perfect match for my application.  The unit is 1440W.<br /><br />Don't fear installing yourself.  It is really easy.  A well versed person could do the job in 10 minutes.  I take my time so it took 20 minutes.<br /><br />Also, I recommend that if you take out your element, also remove your anode.  then use the Camco 11691 Water Heater Tank Rinser to clean out your tank to a spotlessly clean tank.  This may add another 5 minutes to your job.<br /><br />You'll save a bunch of $$ compared to taking it to the RV service center.  It really is easy to do.
B0024GYCYI|3|This helmet is very heavy for a half-helmet, but it seems like its well constructed.
B00EEDWMT6|5|I put this on my all black Audi A7. It looks amazing and makes the car stand out even more. It arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you.
B00192QB9M|4|Works fine.  Very easy to install.  Took only about ten minutes with no surprises.  I recommend the product -- there's little doubt that it makes no sense to buy the very same item elsewhere when the price is several hundred percent higher.
B004GD2NAM|4|It fit perfectly. I would order again.
B007P9YXEI|4|I just received them, and the mediums fit perfectly over my men's 10 Harley boots. They are very easy to put on, and they seem very snug. I wore them in a hard for about thirty minutes, and my boots were perfectly dry.
B001N1E9Y8|3|these things suck to clean.  taking apart the head is a total pain.
B00VNBDWPK|5|After reading about everything that can go wrong with converting from halogen to LED headlamps (mostly flickering, blinking, &#34;bulb out&#34; errors, &#34;check engine&#34; lights) I was worried I might be getting myself into trouble.<br /><br />I have a 2010 Nissan Altima (a car widely known for having difficult-to-replace headlamps--the manual actually states to bring it into the dealer every time a bulb burns out) and the only trouble I had with these bulbs were because of the car model, not the bulbs themselves.<br /><br />Once I was able to get to the bulb housing, installation was a snap, and the bulb fit perfectly.  The first one installed in 30 minutes (28 of which were taking apart the wheelwell) and the second one I got done in 6 minutes---amazing how much faster things go when you've done it before.<br /><br />The bulbs included a &#34;flux capacitor&#34;, which as near as I can tell is a clever trade name for what would otherwise be called a rectifier circuit.  Its intent is to remedy flickering.  They also included a polarity-switching cable.  Of the two, I only needed the polarity cable.  My wiring harness wouldn't fit the bulb (the metal prongs were too far apart on the bulb for the housing) but it fit and worked perfectly once the polarity cable was installed.<br /><br />The bulbs themselves---wow!  Brilliant white light (it's definitely not &#34;blue&#34; or &#34;bluish&#34;---just pure white which is what I wanted).  I measured the old bulbs at 18,500lux at 3 feet, color temperature was 2750K.  These were 22,500lux at 3 feet, 5600K which is over 20% brighter and much whiter.  That translates to somewhere around 20-30 feet farther sight distance at night.  Very nice.<br /><br />No warnings or errors; these bulbs just work.  Time will tell how reliable they are but based upon the stated 50K hours I'd expect they'll last longer than the car itself.
B006WQRHHU|5|Priced 1/2 of what auto parts stores wanted.
B00U8NMZ34|5|Great product.. Worth the money.. Great customer service if you ever have any questions..
B00917FBNY|5|Easy to self-install, make sure to keep the joint tucked under the seat or it will poke up on to your cargo.
B004GYSFXK|5|Great great love them very nice to do bis with u tks
B00W619XY0|5|This thing is fun! I love scaring the bejesus out of my coworkers when they pull into work at the wee hours of the morning. The installation was as straight forward as can be. Wire the power wires to the battery, then run the mic wires to the cab and plug in the mic. Its really that simple. The sound quality when speaking into the mic could be better, but the volume of the sirens and horns is great. I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my review.
B0006JLW84|5|Fits great
B00X4PHIEY|5|great sticker very cool and great quality
B000FQ1VKM|3|FIRST ON LASTED ONE DAY.
B00VLER9BM|5|I have been wanting to make my car more girly and started to buy accessories. I purchased seat covers recently and when I came across this  License Plate Frame, I was so excited because it matched the color of my car and my new seat covers. It came within the timeframe promised and packaged in a cute box. It looks so good on my car.  Pro’s Puts bling on your car Reliable, durable and rust-proof stainless steel Made with waterproof glue Handmade Great for yourself or giving a gift to someone.  You will get the following all in this one kit 1- license plate frame 2- matching screws 3-matching caps  I received this product at a discounted rate for my option
B003SOJV3C|5|Worked Perfectly!!
B00JAIWK42|1|Lasted couple month. Got replacement which lasted couple month as well. Bulb is dead.
B001GJ7HCI|5|This sponge worked great with little warm soapy water.  Got all the road bugs off with the sponge and then went to the car wash.  My SUVs front end looks like new!
B011EQCM72|5|Purchased a new vehicle with a light beige interior and searched covers to help protect my leather from wet clothes and sweaty clothes. Ordered one of these covers for drivers side and once I used it one day I ordered 3 more for passenger side and back seat. Simple, comfortable easy on and off best I found for the $$.
B00L1RMRSY|5|love it!
B00T8HPF24|5|Very bright, perfect fit.. 2012 VW Tiguan
B00JDPT3BK|5|Everything was in the kit. Arrived very timely!  Thanks!
B0043OV0IA|4|This thing is very heavy duty and solidly constructed. Everything you would expect from Warn. It will do anything a manual cable puller can do only much better and with almost no effort. The PullzAll has two limitations that make it inconvenient for some jobs. The cable will not free spool out. The cable is power in and power out and the usable cable is only 18' long but if you can live with that, this is a great tool.
B00BITLVC8|4|Just installed this door handle. I choose it over the Dorman just because some said the Dorman was a shade off. I can say that the PT Auto probably also is a shade off but not noticeable unless you put the 2 side by side (see my pics). The only other thing I would have to say about this is that the plastic clip that hooks to the end of the door wire seemed very cheaply made. You can see it in one of my pictures as a clear piece of plastic. I easily remedied this by using the OEM clip which easily came out of the OEM door handle and easily slipped into the new handle. Good quality/fit product otherwise.
B0044B30TO|5|Great!!
B00JK327VS|5|Well it's not like you use battery cables everyday but when you do they better work well. These do just that. Cables are pretty long so you have lots of room to work with and just incase you aren't sure which one goes where just look at the colors red is positive and negative is black. They make these easy to know which is which just incase. Comes in its own nice travel bag with a handle. I use these for both my regular vehicle and my semi truck when needed. I got another one for my wife's car as well.
B00RAS2YN6|5|Nice and bright. Kind of hurt your eyes to look at from a few feet away when its really dark they are so bright. I put them on my semi flatbed to replace the incandescent housing mounted 2&#34; chicken lights. So much nicer to be able to run straps through all the rub rails.<br /><br />They've been on for a month and holding up perfectly. Also, they don't fail if you reverse polarity but they don't light either. Some LEDS are toast if you hook up wrong, not these.
B003YNWBH0|5|Shipped fast, fit my 2011 Nissan Frontier perfectly.No more funky smell when I turn on the AC
B0013AM81A|3|not as sturdy as I expected. Rust shows on each tube after first rain shower because the ends are not all covered.
B00171UG4G|5|Fuel pump worked great
B00JRHI1LM|5|Great bed.  Directions said to open it right away but we waited a couple of weeks. The box it cam in was small and I thought it would never fit. But it grew and was just amazing and we are so thankful for the new bed!
B00ETHGCDY|5|Looks like picture and sends an extra in case you mess up
B003YMVOM4|4|Great rotors! Easy to install. They feel great and were a pretty darn good price. Withe the AC Delco pads I purchased with these everything feels great and should last a while.
B000FQ0H4I|1|Great product. Too bad its NOT for a jeep wrangler. They sent me a Jeep grand Cherokee condenser. Anybody want to buy it? Get ahold of me.
B002UC16QI|5|Great and easy product to install only downside is the valve doesn't open very much so the water stream isn't to strong or forceful coming out which makes it take longer to fill up a garden tub
B008I7R4JM|5|great
B00RF9J8DY|5|Ordered this for my grandson at college.  It is the perfect size and we used it the day of move in quite a bit.  My husband likes it so much he wants one to keep at his office.
B00P2D3VZG|5|parking lights in a 2010 PRIUS. Sweet
B00K007R6U|5|These are great for a garage and I also use them in a metal garage where I store a dozen motorcycles. I was a little skeptical due to the size but I'm very pleased. And the odor is NOT overpowering. That's a good thing.
B001RLU1RS|5|These fit my 01 CBR 600F4I and They dont have these plugs at the dealership. IDK wtf is up with that.
B004X2B9LA|4|Great item for the price. I looked at several other websites and this was the least expensive. The instructions are a bit misleading. I followed them and still had trouble with windows closing after I installed Ventvisor. Ended up having my husband pull them out and put them back in. Overall I'm happy with the item. They look good and are well made.
B00BTSG006|4|Works well, but has a cheap feel to it like it won't last very long.
B00J2CYC7E|5|They fit perfectly, great for the price.
B0026CE6QO|5|Very easy to install
B002WHABJ4|5|Good
B00GSAUHB8|5|Thank-you! I finally have a sunshade that works for my T&C Van and one that hopefully through time won't peel away at the edges leaving an ash like substance. Very satisfied right now! Diane
B004NICFX0|4|Sounds great !!! Its perfect !! Drones out around 63-65 mph !!! I gave it a four cuz one rubber that hold the exhaust didnt fit so i had to bend it so it would fit
B00IUNALOY|5|Just received it by ups three days early! Opened box an i put it straight into my 07 cbr 600 rr  (perfect fit) connected the battery leads (+,-) and put the seat on. Started up better than ive ever herd it start! Very strong!! Hope it lasts a long time!
B002X6VXL4|5|My husband's Father's Day gift. Works so well we wonder why we didn't purchase earlier.
B00546C8UA|4|What do they want you to latch the top to? Who knows! Poor design flaw when trying to fit it on my 2014 Rav4. But it is a net, we made it work and it holds our items. So yeah, it works.
B000AMBNPY|5|Excellent product. Very well made and also very useful. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an item like this to buy. This is also a good company that shops very quickly to you...
B0066SZNYS|5|Good
B00HE6CI58|5|Great product and hella bright
B005JU5TUM|1|I bought these for my 2012 Infiniti G37X Sedan and they are absolutely terrible. They leave streaks of water everywhere, and a huge gap of water at the bottom of the window. I will be throwing these out and looking for other reliable options. I could probably get OEM wipers for $10 more, Bosch needs to step their game up and make better quality products.
B0002NIL38|5|Perfect
B000IZ03DQ|4|correct parts for the car i have .hope it will last long .
B00D8IKH04|5|Great replacement part
B00191X8DU|5|My daughters' bathroom is navy and coral and we wanted to spray paint some items to hang on the wall and this color ended up being a perfect match. I couldn't find coral spray paint anywhere, but leave it to amazon to find what I need :)
B003UT3S6Q|5|The time it saves you makes up for the cost.  LOVE this stuff!
B0009IQZPW|5|Works very well. Will buy again
B00801ROG4|4|So far so good, fit n working good on my car.
B00G2TV7OG|1|These light bulbs had half the led chips stop working on a Chevy Silverado that is not driven much.  They lasted less then four months.  Poor investment for your money.
B00004RANW|5|Really heavy duty
B000BOYCN6|4|Been using Max ATF in my Lexus for both Trans and power steering for a couple of years. Works as a great and safe alternative to the highly recommended Toyota Type. 217k and both are still going strong. Cheaper to buy at walmart! Literally 1/2 of what is being charged here after shipping.
B001Q4XIHG|5|Was easy to install and holds 2 rifles very tightly with no damage to stocks.
B00GT2FUB2|2|Got this about a year ago. I should've tested all of it's functionality. The flashlight and USB charger work fine but the jump starter does not. I have a 2010 Harley Ultra Limited.  Thought this would be a great insurance policy against a dead battery. Well, I needed it for the first time last week and there is no juice at the battery clamps.  The clamps are fully inserted but no juice. Giving it two stars because the flashlight and USB charger work fine. See lots of positive ratings so I'm assuming I just got a bad unit. If you buy this just make sure you test it.
B00BAYUI3E|5|We live in the country, where keeping the interior of the car clean is a challenge, especially after hauling of trash, debris, etc. The cargo tray helps tremendously.
B00BF8N6Q6|5|These are expensive but they are holding up very well on my VW Passat.
B009NQ8JLE|5|Fine part for the vehicle intended
B00QC28M4G|4|the installation of these didn't fit exactly on two of the bulbs but after some modifications were able to get them in.  The quality of the lights are nice an bright.
B003SOKEXI|4|Product worked perfectly.  Only reason I'm rating 4 stars is because page said the product would not fit my 2002 Ford Expedition. I was hesitant to order for months until I realized, it's got to be the one. Please fix this to make more accurate Amazon!
B005ETCIO8|1|Half the light bulbs will not work or they just don't last
B00W8IMDQG|5|I feel better knowing the FD folks will know I have pets inside and how many.  This sticker is large and colorful but not unattractive.
B00ZR4324K|5|Not factory, but solid product and get the job done
B00230QCIY|5|Yes great do you sell carb kits
B0024E6ZRW|4|Great addition to the step. Stops that spongy feeling when you first step on the step.
B00IABG9YC|1|Wrong item, when unboxed couldn't get correct box to return.  Much confusion!
B004IARK1K|2|Not designed to work with and of the lense covers that fit the factory lights also resistors to prevent hyper flash were too small so I had to buy new ones.
B00JF5LRN0|5|Very strong
B003WOIT04|5|I used this kit to replace the broken nylon shaft on my VacuFlush model with a &#34;metal&#34; pedal.  I believe this was the original nylon shaft so it lasted 15yrs!  All the required parts were included and the instructions on the package were clear.  The best part is that the new shaft is solid brass.  Hopefully I will never have to replace it again.
B0038KVOZE|5|Thanks for the ultra quick delivery, fine product and great price.
B00XZ9NNGQ|5|Worked great
B0060YPVX6|5|Fast delivery..securely shipped..Came undamaged and with everything as advertised..No surprises..great job
B00W63X0LA|5|Perfect.
B00HWSTB58|2|Not what I expected.
B00G9W9ANG|4|Makes my sleeping bag fit my pack. So far so good after 1 trip.
B00B9EVSZ2|5|Looks great on his truck!
B00UNTU3VO|5|This is a great product. Used it to dust off a newly purchased, black painted car with perfect results. Thank you...
B001FANQLE|1|I've had this latch on my jeep for not even a full week and it's already split half way through the rubber.
B007Y87Y2I|5|Great
B00KL3ALGO|5|They worked great and were shipped quicker than expected!
B006CR89NU|5|Fit perfect and looks great
B00BZBWA5G|5|Beautiful and colorful Native Design. Just wish it was offered in a much larger size.
B004L5E8NA|3|Does not fit great. It's the right shape but a little too small and doesn't fit right.
B00EQBOXHA|2|ike what I see thus far from the product , but until I get to actually use it for what it was designed for , then I will write a review. I can't cause battery to discharge.
B001QXRPUI|5|Very good
B00JPW2XUY|4|I was excited to finally be able to get one of these lights for my truck. It works great and lights up the &#34;roads&#34; I drive to get to tower sites.<br /><br />My two gripes with the unit are: 1) the instruction manual is pretty basic and the pictures are a bit too small to see much. 2) the rivits that ship with the specific truck mounts were too small for the hole size the instructions say to drill. I had to run to the store for large diameter rivits... After I had the truck apart and the holes drilled.
B002UJVNFA|5|These are fantastic fit well and look great
B00GURK4LW|5|Need to specify that two come per order other than that great
B008J59CY8|5|I saw the good and bad of Betty Boop and had to buy even though I don't drive. I put them on a file cabinet. Love it.
B000AMBNPY|5|these are great fit good
B0016IJ0XS|5|good
B007H2PRUW|5|Better then expected. Very satisfied 😊
B000HBM3HA|5|Very strong glue that did a great job securing plastic to glass. Highly recommended for a perfect bond.
B0059BZE8I|5|A bit flimsy but does the job.  I like it
B01078GH6A|4|This product works very well. it is a little on the smallish side so you have to empty the bag alot but it is well built
B0076D5NCO|1|Fuel pump died after first time using it I got 3 hours of use out of it and then had to buy a $400 replacement that is currently In Use with no issues
B00AMEPXMO|5|Great design and built well, glad I have this!
B00WS6Q78I|4|Clamps are way too big
B002ESEMXC|1|Well, they have been on for three days. I stepped on the clutch and off it came. By the way, I was very careful to make sure it was on fully.
B00BC190XY|5|Awesome decal. Customer service was excellent and supportive.
B00A2TCBW4|5|great
B002UC4TRG|4|Does not fit the original holes, but good replacement.
B004P23VQO|4|Exactly as advertised.
B00HWZMC6Q|4|Great panoramic view. No need for side mirrors.
B00US7RI2I|4|Easy to install ,takes about a hour for both side. Super fast shipping. Definitely order more replacement parts from them.
B007P05IH8|4|Just what you expect.<br />Flimsy plastic, stiff lock, not even close to weather tight.<br />Do just what they need to - hold crap you do not have room for up front.<br />Install hardware is good and they do the job.
B00029X4MU|5|Installed these on Goldwing with some mods. They are bright with a slight yellow tint.
B0085KGOH0|4|so far so good
B007BJBOKS|5|It's Great decal. I put in on a magnetic backing sheet. Now I have Great magnetic decal for my car.
B00TAE6OX4|4|Good fit and a lot less money than the O.E.M part. Packaging was terrible, box was falling apart
B00407NK6A|5|Nice clear coat, doesn't yellow over time.
B0009IQZH0|4|Okay waxing towels.
B00JR3XSDW|3|I would have given these 5 stars, because they are very pretty and look like they'll hold up well, but didn't for 2 reasons. 1) They sent me 2 sets and charged me for 2 sets, when I only needed 1. I think it was unclear how many you actually get, compared to the picture, which was misleading.  AND, it's too much trouble and expense to send them back - so now I feel like I paid DOUBLE to get what I needed.  And 2) minor thing - some of them didn't screw on tightly, like they were slightly stripped. But, I got them on and they are staying on so far.  I really love the look.
B0016I7ZIU|4|Was not protected for shipping, arrived with a few scratches...
B004RNR9QY|5|So far so good. This hose has stood up to quite a beating so far and is working nicely.
B00GUBZYUY|5|Fit perfectly in the 2007 Trailblazer.
B0006O7LWK|5|Excellent product. The pump almost guarantees quick starts knowing there is fuel at the carb,especially when using braided steel fuel lines as I do. The integrated fuel filter is a added bonus. Anyone who has had dirt into the fuel system knows that a small speck of dirt can turn your engine into a grenade at high revs!
B01191TYXM|5|Outstanding
B00HYIJP8E|5|This is a really nice faucet.  It looks nice, operates properly and was everything I thought it would be.
B00BFYGZXG|5|i'm very satisfied with the red white and blue
B005NYDTNS|5|adds a little class to turn signals
B00DI1X5S2|3|Functional but small.
B002UC16OU|4|Does not fit original holes. But good replacement.
B007I6REZI|5|Perfect fit and much less than local dealer wanted.
B000LDIJ72|5|It was a fair price for the battery.
B0043RX8DC|4|Looks great on my vette.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Great product, great price! I also got the USB charger too. It helped me determine my battery was bad, and my charging system was fine.
B0009IQZH0|4|They work very good, and yes I will recommend this product to my friends.
B0024NM3S8|5|Head lights installed works great and makes the front of car much better. Original lenses were all scratchy and distorted.
B000GUWORQ|5|They work great on my 2005 FLHTCUI one up.
B00VKX71C6|5|Fits my car as advertised .
B000TTIM16|4|They are the best timing belt
B00NT9IN12|5|Great item and performs just as described.
B000C8R9S6|4|Made for a deep pan C6, wouldn't work for my factory pan.
B00UL654FE|5|Looks great!
B00RAS7RLK|5|quality usa, not like the import crap
B009LH4NK6|5|These fuses are extremely difficult to find, so by a lot.
B001GC2LVM|5|Love the way these work.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|This is my 4th child and I find I have bought a lot of sun shades in my day. These are the first that will actually stay on the window and my son can see through. I have a minivan and 2 on the door fits great! The price is awesome as my Eddie Bauer clings cost at least that much, didn't stick worth a dang and were extremely difficult to see through. Great product.
B003UXFNTW|5|This thing works great. I use it to apply foam and gel tire dressings. The foam piece is actually somewhat durable compared to other products I have used and the grip holds nicely in your hand (I have average hands for what its worth). I will definitely re-purchase once mine wears out. I use it once a week and have been using it for about 2 months now.
B00J2CA30Y|3|Install is easy enough, instructions are good, the light is great very happy with it, the license plate bracket is cheap and completely useless
B000FGCYT4|5|Great product. Simple bolt on.
B00LALD9T2|1|They didn't fit!
B00U1J1MCK|1|Do not under any circumstance do business with these people I have bought this exact thing and after 3 months of fighting it still does not function at all now I need to go buy another o2 another harness I will go buy the innovate before I buy anything from these people they are a joke
B00JC85MRW|2|It was a little dried out
B00GSIXOOM|5|This will steering bushing will stop your handlebars from feeling loose and having play in them. This was about a 10 minute fix and the handlebars are as tight as they were knew. Just a little helpful note, I would apply some grease to the inside of the bushing. This will not only make the installation process easier but will extend the life of the bushing as well.
B000BOHKEO|3|Haven't used it yet, but think it's too stiff for what I need.
B00YRZVPYE|2|So ordered these pegs for my bike, put all my bike info in and of course it says this part will fit on my year and model....not even close.
B001AHI1U8|5|Use it on the front of our RV. Drive with on after removing the flags!
B00LNVAB68|5|Perfect fit for the i3.  Very glad I got this.
B00BSGLBQW|2|Purchased these bulbs to replace original bulbs. Had purchased two previously and they had a bright white to them. These are a very dull yellow made me think I still had old bulbs installed. I checked and they were they same part number and description.n They are not what I thought I was getting. Will try to get this resolved.
B00DQ9YI6Y|4|Not long enough, but my mechanic welded an extra length of pipe onto my exhaust to secure the fit.
B000TE46SY|5|Hubby was happy and was shipped exactly like ti was suppose to. Thanks
B00RCBERJK|5|look awesome pure white and amber I also have white led super bright xb-d cree lights from Aarons look good together
B005M186YY|5|Lund brand mount broke.  Bought this as replacement.  Have only used it a couple of times, but appears to be somewhat stronger than the original.  Think it will last for years.
B00QYPY92K|4|Didn't work at first. Did some troubleshooting, turns out that this one has the positive and negative terminals opposite from my stock one. BUT, my bike is a F4i and not an RR. You can tell which terminal should be from the battery because it has the metal insert going to the fuse.  The ground doesn't have the extra silver insert(in the pic, the insert is on the right side terminal. My stock one was on the left side) after figuring this out, I swapped them and it worked perfectly.
B00523AMBC|2|To heavy , plumbing connection not for interior hook up...
B008SCVUW4|5|Just what I needed to see in the blind spots on my vehicle.
B005E41ZY2|4|Proud to have it!!
B00K8SLRY2|3|pretty good for the price
B00GMNL8LO|5|Looks good. It has a thick layer of black rough paint so it won't rust that easy. It doesn't make your vehicle louder it's mostly made to cover the plane stock exhaust.
B005JPH5PE|4|They are not chip, but work well as 3M quality. The best is that they are double sided.
B0082JKVLE|1|i received mine in working condition. however, i purchased a 5k color temperature and what i received was in the near 8k. i already have 6k (hint of blue) and i wanted something &#34;whiter&#34; so 5k seemed the way to go.<br />When i installed these, i only did one side to do a comparison, they immediately started up dark blue. as they finished warming up, they weren't as blue as they started off on but still darker than my 6k that i had on the other side.
B0032LV2QA|4|ok product
B004Q3OEV8|4|Update: about a month after installing this seat cover, it ripped along a seam. Otherwise,  the rest of the seams seem to be holding up fine, and it hasn't faded at all.<br /><br />Very nice! I was worried they'd look cheesy, but they're beautiful and add just enough color to give my car some personality. They fit snugly to the seats and don't slide around- been installed for a week with no need for adjustment. Very nice!
B00379ABX2|5|Will send the message..
B0031I2SNK|4|I just installed this rotor on my Alero, the front brakes are so much better now. I used the ACDelco ceramic pads and bedded the pads in with a few miles of light braking. I'm really happy with the fit and finish of the rotors.  Update after a few months: This rotor has surface rusted fairly quickly, a bit more than I had hoped. The actual braking surface is clean, but the non-swept areas are quite rusty.
B000CRAUO2|5|Love my New Seats
B002J858HQ|4|I love this stuff.  Great smell.  Works awesome in my Toyota Sequoia.  I just spray it full strength on the carpet in the back and under the mats, 1 squirt each and let it sit overnight.  It smells like a new car with leather seats.
B000EVYH36|5|Purchased this to use with the matching Ford code reader.  Worked great and very helpful to allow you to sit in the vehicle seat while checking for codes.
B003U4RVW8|4|give the best scent ever
B00GTJAAVU|5|My car is a 98 Saturn sl2. I have had my car for almost 6 years, and it has rattled so badly since the beginning. After all that time, I said, &#34;enough was enough!&#34; and decided to change the engine mount. I started buying auto parts from Amazon because the reviews are very helpful in selecting the best product, and then I stumbled across this part and saw all the good reviews for it. After I switch the old engine mount with the new one successfully, I started the car, but I thought it died on me because it was running so smoothly! I have never felt my car run this great since I got it, this part is definitely worth the extra amount compared to the other ones! I would recommend the Genuine GM 21012951 transmission mount also, might as well do the transmission mount if you're gonna do the engine mount!
B003UWQFKY|5|Car is looking good with a coat of this wax on.
B007B856YY|4|good price and product.
B00AVA3BBE|5|Outstanding fuel storage containers.
B005H49RJ4|5|Love my Cooper S!!
B0095UH3O2|5|Works great in my 2015 CX-5. Only the handsfree call buttons on the steering wheel don't seem to work. But anything to get rid of the OEM head unit.
B002V0NG0I|5|Awesome product.  I am very short and we added these to my Honda Pilot and it has made the world of difference at least in my world.  I also believe the product is high quality and very durable.
B008AZRVO0|2|I wanted to like this product quite badly... I own a 2012 Camaro 2SS and I bought this to delete the AFM/DOD function on my car. It is stated that this does indeed delete this function on the description and on SCT's website. This is NOT the case! I had to wait over two months to have a custom tune file built and emailed to me from SCT to actually delete this function...
B00RSOLXFM|5|Correspondence with company owner was excellent. Haven't used the product very much yet although it seems to be working fine.
B009995MTC|5|totoaly love gay omg
B00ACDP6YU|5|Purchased to track my wife's scooter maintenance, it works and only takes minutes to install. The first one ordered only worked for about two hours. The vender replaced it and shipped it out super fast. Things happen and products sometimes fail, it's the customer service that matters the most. A+++ seller in my book!
B00O3QB67S|5|A must have product. Covers the blind spots perfectly. Dont be apprehensive about the tint, it doesn't compromise the viewing rather makes it look classy. Fits easy .Highly recommended!
B0027YWZY6|5|good product good price, controls to lock, change direction a bit stiff
B005LAIOZW|5|Great Xmas gift
B000BZXQP0|1|Rotor does not fit my 2012 Honda civic LX with front disc brakes and rear drums brakes.
B00HZSHFJY|5|Love it
B000BZI4JS|5|worked as expected, 4 months later
B00ONDM07G|3|Serves its purpose but getting beat up in a jeep all day the thumb screws that lock things in place back off all the time.  I'm constantly tightening them to keep the phone upright in the holder.
B000CO95SC|5|I've been using it for months and it works great. I recommend it.
B009DJZ70M|5|excellent product and service
B000E28MWM|5|Fits
B0012TZ21K|4|A little snug and not entirely waterproof. I added a layer of scotch guard
B007RVQZUY|5|It's been a month and so far so good.
B0083POY10|5|Great Product. Looks great on my car
B00O337WB0|5|Perfect, no problems.
B00V0AG0MG|5|Nice grille for the money, made well, perfect fit!
B00MGJ38XE|4|Nice and cheap
B000AL2RI2|5|Works great, good size for having around. It would take me 46 years to use one of the big tubes, but this is good for those small jobs. I last used it on the car battery terminals.
B0055B0E5K|5|Fit perfectly. 100% satisfied!
B00M78820I|5|I had a hard time finding a one-piece sunshade locally to replace one I had for 10 years. This was exactly what I was looking for. The product is constructed well and should last a long time. It can be tricky to fold, but my old one folded the same way so no problem there. When folded, it fits perfectly in the storage compartment in my passenger door of my 2015 Honda Accord. Great purchase.
B000CB42EM|3|Why did I receive a white one? I wanted metallic.. Also it seems to have same pressure as original with 145k miles. Will see if it stops the death wobble. Seems better, but only slightly. Did i just waste $56?
B00UE4CQR2|5|Happy with
B00B9DEBJI|4|Handy dispenser.
B00TEH6VWQ|5|Great vinyl
B008G35Z9Y|5|THEY LOOK AWESOME ON MY CAR !
B00FDW57VC|5|Fit perfectly color was on point so far no problems
B00SZK1PA6|4|Great lights they are built way better then most I have seen and having the cree lights is a plus !!<br />The lights came packaged very well and install was a breeze !!<br />I do wish they were Brighter.
B00KSDSYCK|5|Nice seat covers.  Just what I was looking for
B00L1EKGBM|3|Instructions are terrible. Had to return.
B00MQGFQRS|1|What a gorgeous picture this cover has in amazon.com ....well the reality is that this spare tire cover for a Honda CRV is pretty bad. Fit very loose and the CRV letters aren't center at all. Don't waste time trying it.
B003NICPWC|5|Great Product. Easy to install.
B003IA9PNM|5|Perfect.
B003U4RS1M|3|Have used it on Audi S4, BMW 540i and a Mercedes 400E<br /><br />Best improvement in engine smoothness and pick up was observed on 400E probably because it was the oldest car that I ran it on. Certainly, had an improvement on the other 2 but not as significant
B003MXEGDE|5|Worked out great!
B00AMR7FX6|5|Like it a lot
B00H1I639Q|5|Great so far!
B000PL06GC|5|excellent product.
B00L45Z9Z6|5|Delivers on its promise!!
B0048FNEBU|4|It helped the glare alot, however, we had to trip the back because it was and inch to wide,after that it fit perfect, if you get one expect to be trimming it.
B000CISFGQ|5|Perfect fit. Easily installed. Great product. Well packaged. Arrived on time in perfect condition. Great experience.
B004GE6ZMS|5|GREAT
B000JYD6NU|5|Perfect. timely shipping, easy to install.
B00UJOH0S2|5|Arrived sooner than promised.  Exact replacement.  Worked perfectly.  Back on the water--- yayyyy!!!
B000A6THZI|5|Works perfect
B00S1UIIJ6|5|Love these.
B00083VV9S|5|it fit
B0141QK0WG|4|Good rags that dont leave that fuzz behind.  I sued these for cleaning windows and cleaning that bathroom and kitchen as well as dusting they did a great job and they were soft and washed easy going back to their original shape.  I liked using them they are great for house chores.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a reduced price to facilitate this review but was not compensated in any other way.
B00XRBU29S|4|They were a little bigger then my window, but still look good.
B010SPPV1E|4|Just what I wanted but it is a little loose in the opening
B00AU7YB1C|4|huge diffrence from the stock ones, wish it was a little more brighter.
B0060UGHMY|4|Came as agreed,  it is a bit loose but it works.
B00OV8OZW6|1|Wasn't able to lift and reapply like you can with higher quality wraps. Went on very wrinkled and when I try to use a great gun on low heat the wrap just bubbled and caused holes. Wouldn't suggest using this stuff to wrap larger items.
B000CM3H7O|5|extremely easy to install
B00UL32DPQ|5|Fast shipping. This was exactly what I needed. It was in perfect brand new condition. Thank you so much.
B003871448|5|Fit my front sway bar on my 2008 Toyota 4Runner 4x4.
B001445IZ8|5|I use it to change the oil in my smaller units
B00FTAYNOA|5|Perfect just as described. Well made and holding color perfect.
B00B057Y7G|5|excellent product.
B00V50GVZ2|5|Looks as good as an OEM part.
B0018EUNW2|5|Excellent easy to install
B006U6N7NU|4|More yellow than my previous lights, but plenty bright enough to not notice too much. Perfect replacement lights without spending a fortune.
B000BUQOAE|5|Love this! Really helps to make sure flushing is complete.
B0021IRGZQ|5|Fast, accurate, and great fit!
B000MW91RE|5|Good product
B0085ME6R8|5|This is a real OEM part - no surprises.
B00Z2CXY4A|5|Easy to install-work great.
B00QVQ4HMO|5|they work
B001GG09GW|4|Its sick i love it ☺
B004SNLXZQ|5|Worked perfectly
B00DELNHJI|5|Very nice woks as it should
B000CSC5MG|5|This is the set you want to end your intake water leaks. Came with more than enough silicone to apply to the necessary areas and after I put these in, the leaks were gone.
B000WOA6T4|4|These are appropriately spec'd supports but the application to holding up the 150lb hood of a Corvette is poorly thought out. The use of such small gas supports with so little leverage is a bad design.  The only thing I cannot rate is their longevity.  Genuine GM(ACDelco) supports started to lose strength after a 16 months so they weren't very good.
B005PHOXW4|5|Fairly straightforward installation. Works great! Provides easy access to the bed when the tailgate is down. I have used it repeatedly since it was installed. I would recommend some sort of tailgate assist device since it adds weight to the tailgate. (I have one of those tension bars designed to make lifting the gate doable with one finger.) Overall, built well, very durable, and accomplishes its goal.
B00HE6CI58|3|It serves it's purpose
B00R7HJ2Y4|5|Excellent for the GMC Acadia
B001ULS0PA|5|We have used them in the past, so there was no surprise.  They work great.
B004MUI7OA|5|This fuel pump kit works as promised. My only complaint is that it arrived with no installation instructions. But it was easy to figure out how to install the kit. Have no problems as of now.
B0041U90D8|5|Fits just right, matched OE perfectly.
B00D3SU1LO|4|The product was delivered promptly. There were adequate instructions for installation. The material was not quite as substantial as I had hoped, but for the price it was decent. It took about an hour and a half to install. It is a two man job. All in all, I am satisfied with the purchase.
B00132CH46|5|Great
B00TPV9OYS|2|This thing leaked from day one!<br />But is still better then using a ladder and a hand brush.
B00IZZDRR0|5|Great step and I can use it as a little table while camping as well.It is sturdy and easy to use.It packs well under my platform bed in my van.It adds some height for my compromised knees as I step up into my camera van. Thanks!
B00IPS3G96|5|Exactly what I ordered I run this in my 2004 f250 super duty 308000 miles still rolling.
B00I59XBEK|2|Does not specify that it does not fit the 13inch MacBookPro
B0013HW9IK|5|Works well on my wife's wheelchair.
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Works perfectly
B00BE5IKUM|5|The locking handles fit perfectly and were very easy to install.  Great to be able to purchase a matching set like this so that only one key is needed.  The price was also very good.  I went to a local camper shell shop and they would have to special order them at a significant higher cost.
B00E0FRPX6|5|Very comfortable and warm.
B001TCHQQE|5|quality is spot on! Just be sure to check application for year of truck!
B00NNXWLVW|5|Easy to set up.
B00T6J8XH8|5|Much more comfortable than stock, definitely happy with the purchase.  All shorter rides so far, but long trip coming at the end of the month and I'm psyched to see how it performs.
B003S6F86E|5|This part fit my 2000 SI without any issues, and it works better than my old factory part.  The part from honda is no better quality, but cost 6x more.  I'm have zero regrets in buying this part.
B000CIO9KM|5|Great product , perfect fit and great service.<br />Thanks<br />Comp Cams
B0039YWT80|5|These are great buy them!
B00AWXJQYG|4|Very cheap and easy to install and looks great
B007JMTSTQ|3|Faded to light gray and had gaping holes in it after 1 year.  No UV resistance.  For the price, however, it is ok. Just plan on replacing it every year.
B0002SRCMO|4|worked as advertised
B002HIB3GI|5|used this in grand daughters car,it got her a year of use then sold an is still going !!!
B007KA7PP6|5|Super seller,the starter arrived sooner than i expected. The starter bolted to my Craftsman yard tractor with ease. The 14 tooth gear meshed,into the fly wheel perfectly. The tractor started right up.no issues noted.
B00BXPYYVM|2|Within a week of unwrapping and enjoying this little beauty I had an unfortunate experience. The spring loaded pull action clasp unfortunately became unscrewed, simply through normal inquisitive play while in my pocket. That sounds dirty, but it isn't. The knob on the pull just is easy for your thumb to twist. I didn't realize however that it was a screwed assembly. This happened to be discovered just as it sprung apart while pulling my keys out of a messenger bag pocket. Causing keys and the assembly to spill out onto the parking spot I was in. I found everything but the spring. So I suppose I learned that I fidget to much with my keys and that I need a new key chain.<br /><br />Also... the finish is beautiful but scratches easily.
B001O1O9YW|5|love my new mats. the charcoal color matches exactly to my 2013 Honda fit. I went with exact fit mats, because the unusual layout of the 2013 Honda fit floor mats do not accommodate any generic mats.
B001TK7CYM|5|I love these goggles, they were cheap, and they fit great. They do have a tendency to fog in winter, but for those who do not ride should not be an issue. I also have not found a product or way to reduce this. I wear glasses (not huge ones) and these slip over the ones I have and make it easy. I think they are well worth the money. My clear ones hit the ground and got scratched up pretty good, so try to be careful. But for the price, it really was not a big deal. Definitely will buy again considering I got them in 2011.
B00RN4TUMA|4|Love it.
B00238EVAM|1|I bought these to wear in the freezer where I work and they fogged up instantly. Save your Pennys and don't bother.
B000CB1PM4|5|Perfect fit.
B0002MAIIU|3|Using these on my 2015 Fiat 500 Sport. Looks nice and white when the daytime running lights are the only lights on, but once you turn the headlights on and the power draw is lower, the bulbs look almost as bad and faded as the stock bulbs. I expected nice and white all the time, so I'm let down. Will be returning these and just going all amber for the DRL/Turning signal.
B00EP3PW4M|5|Purchased these for my husband's 2015 Ram 1500 Quad Cab approximately 1 month ago. Reasonably priced, easy to mount, looks good. Very happy with this purchase so far.
B00DDV2NL2|5|good
B008QSLT0I|1|did not work.......
B007CJ6JY8|4|Does not come with mounting screws, but worked great once we got the screws and got it installed.
B009X5GP8E|1|Deceptive description and picture. Does not clearly state that Part 1 is also required. I wish I had read the reviews first but I thought I was buying the same product I have purchased previously which does not need a primer.<br /><br />The primer is now up to $50 for a quart, I wonder how much of that price is because people were fooled into buying part 2 first?<br /><br />Since I purchased this several months ago and put it in my stock bin for future work, I can't even return them - 2ea at $35.
B0049C9LOQ|3|Item is not greasable as stated in description, I'm gonna return it as did not fit description
B008YFU3F0|5|Great lights unfortunately one ballast has burned out and its been about 2.5 months.
B00G620ZVU|5|I bought these lights to mount on the case guards of the '00 Suzuki Bandit I use for my daily commute in Atlanta traffic. I was tired of being cut off all the time due to drivers not seeing the bike's pitiful factory headlight, and these lights are the perfect solution. They've compact, extremely bright, inexpensive, easy to mount, and look right at home on the bike. I've only had them mounted for about a week, but I'm already seeing more folks checking their mirrors to see where the bright lights are coming from, and even pedestrians are taking note. Worth every penny.<br /><br />My order was fulfilled by &#34;Senlips Light Bar&#34;, and I just have to take a minute to let everyone know how great their customer service is. I originally received a set of lights that were different than the ones shown above, and not only did they (Senlips Light Bar) respond very quickly to my email, they shipped out the correct lights right away and told me to keep the incorrect lights as well. Service just doesn't ge... Read more
B001PLYWAM|4|Only four stars because I've only had it installed for an hour or less. I installed it on a Kicker Hideaway in my 2015 Colorado Crew Cab because I couldn't find a fuse that wasn't a constant hot with the truck off, and I didn't want to go through the trouble of pulling the head unit to tap into the remote wire there. I used a 7/8&#34; paddle bit to make the hole in the plastic under the rear seat, then waddled it out the rest of the way with a Dremel tool. The switch fits tight and snapped into place very nicely. I tapped into the power wire from the battery to the amp for the number 1 post, adding a secondary 15 amp fuse between the power wire and the switch. I ran the remote wire from the amp to the number 2 post on the switch, and then tapped into the existing ground for the number 3 post. Works like it should, and you can't even see the switch with the rear seats down. After I've had it in awhile I'll re-evaluate and consider giving five stars. Gotta make sure this thing can stand the test of time. Until then, I'd recommend it, for now.
B0077YWSAW|3|not the same quality as OEM but work great!
B007OW6I12|2|I'm sure this is a great product, but as some have noted below, Toyota changed the gas cap for the 2009 Prius mid-way through the year from a tabbed to a threaded version. If you have a threaded gas cap on your 2009 Prius, then you are looking for part number 77300-75010: [[ASIN:B00KGKWGBK Toyota Genuine Parts 77300-75010 Fuel Cap]]. Unfortunately, Amazon Automotive does not recognize this nuance, so if you mistakenly order this gas cap, then you will have to return it at your own shipping cost plus a 20% &#34;restocking fee.&#34;
B01257LSOC|5|Received my order today and place it on my FORD CROWN VICTORIA POLICE INTERCEPTOR.(aka) PANTHER. Surprise to see how my PANTHER is one of it kind on the streets. Easy application.
B000SL4AA2|5|Great product
B003978QIE|5|Great brand\product and a lot less expensive than the local auto parts store.  I wish the kit included the longer block instead of the soap.  Highly recommend the purchase!
B000CAINEI|5|It is a great reflector, even if it is a little bigger than it really needs to be, but I like it so much. The temperature in the car is at least 20 degrees cooler than without it. I can sit in the car in the shade with the AC running and be comfortable while I am waiting for my husband to come out of a store. I like it being too big because it provides more shade.
B00480J4J6|1|Didn't last long
B0002JMEQW|2|Can had fine aluminum flakes inside it. It looked clean but when I rinsed it out and dumped it in a dark pan it looked like silver paint.Be sure you rinse out can before using or you will blow aluminum through out the system. I had to flush system twice because of this.
B0033WDGH6|2|Works good
B003BRB3FK|4|Good for the price.
B00J06MCE2|5|If you have a trailer this is a must have!!<br />I did not have a spare tire and when I needed one road service wanna charge me $500-$600 for coming out with a tire replacement!!
B00OGU3NSG|5|matches great!
B00M8F2QHU|5|I am so happy I bought this car tag! It is just like the picture. It's so cute and the shipping was fast! I will definitely buy another when I get married next year!
B000IYNWG2|5|One of my fans developed a crack in the outer ring and made a horrible racket. I purchased this fan to replace it. I wish I would have don't it earlier. Thus fan has the same or more airflow but, it is probably 30% quieter then the stock fan ever was.
B00KVL4QOE|1|Terrible - very flimsy and won't stay in window. Don't buy this!
B00332GOES|1|Fits like crap, doesn't fit in the window track right so every time you roll the window up you can hear the plastic and glass creaking and groaning.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Fit well and seems to be a durable material.
B00OP51HUS|5|shipped as promised
B00FEZEVQK|5|Work flawlessly, would buy again.
B005MR6W0I|5|great fit
B0063WGB5W|5|love this decal.  I have three on my car.  They really stand out
B00BVB95MQ|3|I still get the &#34;water in fuel&#34; message, though there is no water in the fuel.  No leaks or any other annoyances.  I'd still buy again.
B000CPIGGS|5|Very inexpensive. Replace it if replacing Your shoes.
B00BY9XKWQ|5|Very pleased with purchase of jeep side steps quick delivery and they fit perfectly plus all fasteners included.very easy to install.
B000B8N3IM|5|Perfect fit  saved some money.
B00T6JOJ62|4|Works good easy install
B00D618SWC|1|Product is good quality but the way the corner piece is cut it doesn't fit perfectly to window seal. I've ordered weather tech items before and this is the first item I'm really not happy with. The seller I got this from was good about the replacement the first time but overall weathertech needs to look at how they are manufacturing there product. I would recommend just waiting til a new body style Escape comes out and see if they can get it right then. I hate to see the seller get dinged but when a product doesn't fit right in window and weathertech blames me for following there poor instructions I have to give a 1 star. At a distance they look good. I'm worried about the gap above mirror if it rains and I leave windows cracked will it rain in?!?! They look nice but save yourself a headache and avoid.
B001OMEPEU|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. Great fit and finish.
B000BQWLE6|1|Much, much, much, much smaller than what I thought. Not sure what I'll do with it...
B00CQAR1V8|3|was not a direct re placement  like ad said .
B003TTVCTC|1|Totally wrong for the engine. If you have a 1972 Dodge 360 engine this seal will not fit.
B007DCDJYC|5|Nice details.  Stick well.
B00OEKRBU4|5|Although the instructions were lacking a little, they were easy to install on a 2013 Ford Explorer Sport with 9005 bulbs (low beam/high beam).  Light output seems great (not blinding but sufficient) and color is great.  I don't like the old yellow halogen color and these bulbs definitely took care of that.  My car had dust covers over the headlight assembly but these bulbs (like other LED bulb manufacturers), I did had to keep the dust covers off because of the size of LED bulbs.<br /><br />It was fortunate that my 2013 Ford Explorer didn't have any OSD errors on my dashboard due to the lower watts used.  Aaron does sell a resistor kit but I didn't have to use.<br /><br />Quality seems fine but won't know until I test it for awhile.  Looks like these have a only a 1 year warranty but I will update my Review if these bulbs start failing.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed by the price because I paid for it and then about 3 days later when item arrived/installed and I came online to write this review, the price dropped by $9.
B00B2LCE1E|5|Solved OBDII code issue
B000ZM5IIM|2|excelente
B00USOATSQ|5|It gave my jeep altitude that little something it was missing.
B005DA6BUA|5|excellent product.
B004BCHJMU|4|My headlights were very cloudy and really affected my nighttime ability to see the road. These replacements were easy to install and made my car look like new...<br />I would recommend these as a good value, however, the text of the ad says they come with new bulbs...mine did not. Actually it was probably easier to just pop out the old bulbs and reinstall....that would be the only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating....text needs to be changed so buyers don't think they're getting bulbs.
B0083H4SMI|5|exact match
B00S75A5IW|4|it is ok....but not super bright
B010MHV00O|5|Handles a 40 oz. Hydro Flask although sharp turns do need you to hold on to it. General driving the bottle rides well within the cup. The 32 oz. Hydro Flask I have rides with no problems during sharp turns. I would purchase again.
B00KHC83IM|5|Everyone knows who I am with this big Punisher skull on the back glass of my truck but that's ok I love it. Great buy!
B000GKD5PQ|5|Works well. Puts out full power for apple products.  Ran iPad, DVD player and iPod touch off it for 6,000 mile family trip.  Worked great.
B007D3Q2FY|5|Used prod. in my 1989 Lincoln last year, happy with the results, so I am putting it in my other Lincoln
B001MXTOKQ|5|These products are the only ones I was able to get my motorhome wheels cleaned with.  The wheels are so bright in the sunlight it almost hurts your eyes.
B00KL3ALGO|2|Alright let me first say this product does what it says reasonably well.  The first thing that I didn't love was the size is really not big enough for an entire car window, and it leaves a large amount of unprotected space.  Then I saw how my car looked from the outside... it looks GOD AWFUL.  You may as well tape a garbage bag to your window, it looks just as bad and protects probably better.  I saw it once from the outside and made up my mind to just protect my daughter in a complete and high quality way, I just got my windows tinted.  Now my car looks BETTER, protects BETTER.  Yes, it cost more.
B00BGZ1WCS|5|Fits well.
B00EE259BA|2|Do not buy this product. I purchased it, get the blank cut at my dealership and used it for about six months. Then the other day I went to start my truck and the whole thing came apart in pieces. I cannot get it back together in a usable condition. I contacted the seller and after providing information and a picture to them they responded with &#34;I could not see any problem,except the key blade apart from the keycase&#34;. That is the problem. If the key blade does not stay in the case then the fob is useless. I expected this key to work for years not months.
B005JL2WCE|5|Put on my bosses car. Now i'm fired. Worth it.
B005CNNJ6W|2|When ordering I thought I was ordering the WeatherTech products based on the way Amazon displayed them.  I was disappointed when they arrived and even more so when opening the package.  They will do the job but are no where near the quality of the WeatherTech product.
B003AV69OM|5|I installed these in our 09 Venza when the original front pads wore out. The fit fine, work well & are quiet.
B000HCRGJ4|1|Do not buy this product had for 3 months and leaking oil out of compressor in the middle were it is put together
B009609HTK|5|Great tool
B00P9W2VGU|2|Not want I wanted.
B000ILI1BQ|1|Does not resemble the one pictured. Drip edges are only about an inch long. Returning for a refund!
B00Z808L62|4|I have not put it on my window yet because I did not know it was going to be so big. It is beautiful though and I hope to find an appropriate place for it soon.
B00EC8Y0YS|2|The lights as arrived quickly, and they look cool on the truck. However, I'm in the middle of the install now, and one main bulb doesn't work, and 5 of the 6 lower LED lights aren't working. At least I hope it's just the bulbs. The halos aren't all that bright either.
B000C01U0W|5|Great price oem fit for my 1986 e30.<br />Iam a DIYer when it comes to my Vehs<br />I would recomed to all e30 users.
B006GFMPXI|5|good product
B000CSNK98|5|This is a nice set for the price. Matched our vehicle very well and are easy to install. Good price, too.
B002X1PNRY|5|GOOD PRODUCT
B003V9L05G|4|I was skeptical - worked great.
B00KDRXDFO|5|Wife loved them
B002PQOI32|4|fit as expected in my 94 ranger. Had to do a little work on wiring on driver side, the connector is a 4 pin with only 2 pins used and that side was the wrong 2 pins. They look good and work.
B00EZCL08K|5|So far so good, as usual on a BMW, not easy to get to.
B0008G1PMS|4|Just what I needed.
B006WPQMWM|5|Works great.  Replaced a Thetford that was over 10 years old.
B004J5CV4A|5|It's exactly what we needed.
B00K0VWBE2|3|Would not work on my KLR the controls are to short not the products fault and I had a bud who wanted some so all is well that ends well.
B00067MVBS|4|Had to modify to fit moped. Works great now!
B001U8SJ3G|5|Excellent product, it come with light bulbs, installion is easy.
B000COMXF4|5|made well works great as all milton fittings .
B004NV42PQ|5|Worked great, had to flip the valve around to fit the file line, but otherwise worked as expected.
B00VF0OSFC|4|The first one I received had a faulty auto jumper cable, but it was replaced promptly.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is that it does not contain an adapter to connect to my Dell laptop.  I have used it to recharge portable devices and it works like a charm.
B000VD2K72|3|Wish was a little longer
B00CC2ZU4K|1|Followed all instruction and troubleshooting.  Actually I can check, and trace where or what is the problem. But for what? This is a brand new and it supposed to light up. Everything was followed and everything is correct. I am an electro mechanic engineer maybe simple installation like this is not a problem. I am sorry but I was frustrated. For a brand new Item, you don't need a support.
B000WJA5F4|5|Great DEAL!!!
B004UQIVPQ|5|This the cats meow after you've polished your paint and before you put your wax on.  Removes all residue of polish and leaves the paint squeaky clean ready for waxing.
B005E39NS8|5|Great product, great price, consideribg dealership costs and an evaxt equal  to the original and worked great. It programed  easy and works great. I've benn using it for a couple months now and have yet to find any complaints.
B0000BYEXO|1|I ordered two of these for our wave-runners, and they came from different suppliers. I paid $125 a piece for batteries so they more than one season.  Walmart has a battery for $55, but they only last one year. Well, they were both on maintainers, and only one would turn over this year.
B003YJLAIK|5|Perfect in every way  with the lead free worry and the ability of adjusting the PSI...
B000UVCK9S|4|Not quite as bright as I would have hoped, but still great quality for the price. I am pleased with this interior lighting kit.
B002N1Q7QU|5|Great blanket.....warm!!
B00652G4TS|5|Playing on it now
B008720RR4|5|Works like it supposed to!!
B00H2VTGZK|3|The color is misleading in the pictures. The green is actually more of a blueish green and doesn't match the other green on my bike at all.  I'm going to take it off and replace it with something that matches a little better.<br /><br />On the other hand it was really easy to install and pretty reflective.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Easy to use
B004RZU3Q0|5|Great product
B007L6P2YA|4|front seat covers fit beautifully, the back seat cover seems to be very challenging to install
B00V7ANQT4|4|fits well
B00IMUC9YA|5|I bought this and I LOVE it! My only complaint would be that it can get quite hot in the summer with the sun beating down on it.  Other than that though it is super cute!
B007G2J1JG|5|Made installation of the King Antenna simple!
B00MI1JGB8|5|Still works great a few months later. Light is pretty good and turbo sounds are kinda neat.
B00HT2Y7ZG|5|Skeptical......very skeptical. But I read the reviews and I was still skeptical. Got it and it works. I leave it plugged in 24/7. I smoke....although it doesn't clear out the smoke smell in a short duration, I didn't expect it to do that. But after an overnight, I can go to my vehicle and it smells clean. I own an Expedition, so the interior size to be covered is large. I plug it into the rear passenger outlet.
B000C55MOC|5|Easy install. You get two at this price
B00H1X5NBK|5|Great service and product
B0040CTYAQ|3|Doesn't fit Astro van
B00CKKFDPA|5|Love them. Put them on our golf cart and them look awesome.  But how do I get another remote?
B00XF2RHYM|4|Immediately changed the look of the bland entry ways aka door sills.  Easy installation.  Just peel, shine and go.
B00OM60DH8|5|works great and very easy to install and uninstall
B000C9SHC2|5|Exactly what I required
B00CWJYFSK|5|Great product but only work for the brake side and not the clutch side. Got a 2014 ultra glide.
B000ELP7EY|5|Arrived quick. Less $ than parts store. Good fit.
B00NGHLY4U|5|It was an easy swap and the tailgate is as good as new.
B001898UYU|5|Excellent seat. As others have posted, the hight seems different, but is actually the same. The difference is the front of the seat is angled up. It will move your knees up and bring them closer to the steering wheel. Overall, much better than my original jump seats. My 8.5&#34; wide center console still fits and is about 1/2&#34; from the two seats and doesn't rub even when I am sitting in the seat.<br />Be warned, these seats are NOT cloth and vinyl, they are completely cloth, which I preferred anyway.
B00GJKXW8M|5|Very bright...perfect for our use.
B000786JRI|1|I got this product to heat up food in my truck quit working after two weeks
B000CG8NQA|5|You may have to swap the mounting studs from your old unit over to this for to boot in nice and tight
B00J7RB72M|5|great
B000C459N2|5|Perfect fit. '86 Ford Ranger.  Easy install.  Works great.  Purchased the master cylinder too
B008QGCQHU|3|Did not last long.
B00I2KCSHI|5|This product is very nice and fits my motorcycle well.
B000EALHHG|1|Did not remove fresh oil stains on my concrete driveway after 2nd application
B001Q96Y7C|1|Product ripped while installing. It seemed much smaller than the steering wheel but they make one size fits all type cover and I ripped it. Difficult to install
B00Z8M9KH4|5|What an awesome deal. Came with everything. Shipped fast too. Thank you!
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Bulbs are awesome they are built very well that's why I bought them but they are twice as long as even a 921 bulb so they wouldn't work in a tag light
B0064FX2OG|5|Good looking color, and makes the housing have a blueish shine when off. Thank you!
B002ZTGLCK|5|I've used this hose on a scooter rebuild and my classic motorcycle restore, great stuff! The tubing connections to nipples almost self-sealing, top tip- use a hair dryer to heat connects up for removal during service. Only recommend use in areas with low heat transfer, it really saves room compared to traditional rubber hose.
B000ZARYX6|5|Perfect fit easy to install with special tool that was included in ordersd.  Coloratch was very close to factory.  I was very pleased with fast delivery and product quality
B0076MBL0S|4|It works as it should . What can you say. The dam thing don't sing and dance ! LOL.
B001C4WKDS|5|I would recommend this product. I used this on a Dark Blue 1982  Oldsmobile Regency 98. It was kept in garage until 2006, now it's outside under a cover. Over the last few years driving on the road it had acquired lots of white dots from rocks hitting both sides. Some swirls and lines on the hood. The results from this product surpassed expectations. It removed most of the marks. Leaves a real good shine and even helped the paint a little by bringing back the color. In my opinion this should help any dark blue car. The car in this review has a borderline good paint job.
B00RV83UUG|4|Good for the price
B001GRWZ18|5|Amazingly versatile tool for either removal or installation of virtually all sizes of oil filters.
B00NLJ02ZA|5|We love our sunshades........once I figured how to make it stay in place in my over sized SUV....HAHAHA it works just fine!!!!!! My vehicles are cool.
B00SSKUHAC|5|As promised.  Great that something so simple makes life so much easier.
B004AG9ILC|5|Perfect fit for E90 (2006 325i).
B006B280CQ|5|Very happy with these.
B00VT9E3C2|5|Such a great cover, my second one, love it.
B00BGIW4QS|1|Glue was very weak, barely stuck to truck.
B00NAD1580|5|Great product
B00AC60VEC|5|Awesome product!!!!
B00KTHVE72|5|Cheap replacement that refreshes the appearance of your key fobs.
B00280BL9O|5|Classic and small and perfect
B000630J84|5|Very easy to use. Well constructed. Much nicer than the L-shaped flat bar. Way easier to use than the type you have to screwdown to squeeze the spring.
B00YLZ7C3S|2|did not like at all. shoved it in my closet. It does not stretch and too hard to hang up
B005CW010A|4|Good quality seat over fit was good however on leather seats seams to move around a lot other than that there pretty good
B000CO7CXM|5|Worked good for escape latch cables on electric latch doors
B00FD9AGES|2|It seemed cheaply made. It's very faded and doesn't have bright colors like shown online.
B000FW4LLW|5|Great for the car as stated in name of product.
B0046IC24O|5|Works great!  The only advice I would give is, when programming my Expedition for it, I found out that adding this remote REMOVED all existing remotes.  It then took quite a procedure to get the Expedition back in programming mode.  Once I did I had ALL remotes on hand and programmed them ALL at the same time.
B005R66BG4|3|My vehicle is a 2016 Mazda CX-5. The cover felt nice when I got it and seemed pretty solid. It fit well enough and even compensated for the  changes at about 9 and 3 on the wheel.  The lace and needle were decent and I was able to get started on covering my wheel. Unfortunately halfway through covering the wheel, one of the stitchings on the leather ripped. I ended up returning the product and going with another. I got my return in a timely manner without a hassle.
B00KRKRYES|5|Fitment was perfect! I dont have any shaking on my gmc canyon with aftermarket rims now!
B00GHT6U3Y|5|Replaced my broken one in my BMW 135i, fit nicely
B00BD4JPLC|5|Very impressed with the grille. It took 10 minutes to install and fits perfect. The USPS delivered it in 2 days!
B000182ESW|5|Perfect fit and a great buy!
B000NCOKZQ|5|A+
B00BD4YFO4|1|Covers are too small for my sienna.
B00YUYSDKQ|2|Good for the price
B0013FMW84|4|does the job
B00COOTFX8|5|Highly recommend this kit to anyone who has a 2014 and up GM vehicle. I have no flicker and works like they are suppose too.
B010VUZ99U|5|Super sturdy and looks great. Had for a couple of months now and still in great condition.
B008X0UKV8|5|gud
B00XKQUE16|4|I REALLY want to give this 5 stars considering how awesome this thing is at $50 but there is some room for improvement that shouldn't add to the cost. The installation is very simple and for the most part this unit has a feel of good quality. I guess a short pros and cons list is in order:<br /><br />Pros-<br />Decent sound quality but doesn't get so loud that it completely blocks out the environment (against my desires but that's probably a good thing)<br />Phone call quality is great on both ends<br />FM Radio Tuner!! Why is this not advertised?! Pretty good reception too. (not in the manual)<br />Simple layout with all 4 buttons being multi-function (not in the manual)<br />The speakers are pretty thin. I can't tell they are there in my HJC CY-Max II helmet<br />The foam on the mic is nice, dense, and soft instead of the scratchy stuff. It is flat on the front and back to save room.<br /><br />Cons-<br />The unit does not attach to it's base firmly enough. After pressing the +  button it feels like I have to re-seat it. This seems like a no-brainer for a device that is in such a precarious situation. I'll end up gluing it on.  (This is the main reason I left off that final star)<br />The manual sucks ONCE you accidentally stumble on all the things they left out.<br />This is personal but I really wish the mic was thinner. My beard rubs it pretty good. I guess I could shave (JUST KIDDING!)<br /><br />Stuff they left out of the manual that I discovered:<br />FM TUNER!!<br />The volume buttons also skip tracks and seek radio stations with a short press and a long press adjusts the volume<br />The call button also pauses/ plays the track<br />The power button cycles through sources - Bluetooth device/ Intercom/ FM tuner<br />The device pairing did not work per instructions, I had to follow the instructions for pairing with another headset before my iPhone 6 saw it.
B00PF5P9OC|3|Smaller in size than I expected
B00573N35O|1|cheat material it sag down after one week Not firm at all.
B00EP1QS4M|4|Nice but don't fix all steering wheel
B00ARD28LO|5|Good
B00KC399SY|5|Thank's For your Service! Good Job!
B000GTYLU0|5|Looks and works great arrived on time
B00FLI1OAG|5|Perfect!  Took 5 minutes to transfer parts from old key fob to this one.  Works like a new one for a lot less than manufacturer would charge me.  Would recommend to anyone needing a replacement.
B004A535J4|4|Made well, but wish it had another pad clip per side.  It does fit well
B00NSG5BKC|2|Didn't come with a sprocket now I have to order one
B00HV2KIHA|5|Installed these on a 2015 GMC Sierra All Terrain. Installation went well, about three hours. A little manipulation is required to align the bottom strut bolts once you spin them 180 degrees. I also did not have to trim any off the factory stud. I ended up with 3.25&#34; of lift in the front. However it may settle over the next few days.
B002M3O91E|5|I love this bike rack.  The cost for the rack including the additional 2 bike extension was very reasonable and the quality is great.  I love the ease of getting the bikes on and off.  It is so much easier than the other hitch type (bent fork looking thing)  We loaded 4 bikes on in no time and I used to have trouble with getting 3 on the other type hitch.  Highly recommend it!
B000BR1Q6Y|5|Great product. Easy to install .took about a hour. You can really hear the turbo now!
B005UGGZKI|5|Great stuff . It's hard to understand why others continue to use fossil additives with this product on the market . I have used it when I was racing Bikes back in the 70's. I use it in all my 2 strokes & they burn clean ..
B001AJH1HK|4|Great product.
B00K398D7K|5|It fit perfect and got it on time thanks for the praducked!
B0006IX7UQ|4|I purchased several of these ice cube trays to use in my trailer as I needed something that didn't take up much space and that froze quickly. I've now been using these trays for 1 1/2 years, and they have worked perfectly. I haven't had any issues with them cracking or breaking. The ice cubes generally release easily. If I run into any issues, I just run a little water under the bottom of the tray to get the stuck ice cubes to release.<br /><br />These also work nicely in the the small dorm fridges as they freeze quickly due to their smaller size. They are stackable which means they take up less room in the freezer.
B00V5YOBFA|1|looks good but windshield mounts on my jk didnt fit, the bolts were to big and did not tighted down the light bar the way. 4 leds were shot and did not turn on. SAVE THE MONEY. This loght bar is ass
B0002YUQ4E|5|My girlfriend has a bad habit of putting our nice knives in the dishwasher. She did this to a brand new set we just got and they got rust spots. This polish completely removed them and has seemed to protected them from getting any more spots.
B007D7QOH6|5|Used on my Lexus GX470. Worked great. Way less than the crazy price they wanted at the auto store.
B00IRBPCEI|5|It seems rediculous that I carry so many handy items everywhere I go, until the train stops running, the lights go out, or someone just needs something fixed on the spot and I'm the only one with a tool or light handy, or a comforting travel cup full of coffee and a snack.  Just sneezed all over yourself?  Here's a pack of wet tissues.  I've got ibuprophen, aspirin, allergy medicine. a camera, pen and paper, a mini flashlight or three, a battery charger with a USB outlet, a whistle, .... You get the idea.  Call me weird, and then when you need my help kindly say thank you.<br /><br />But when I'm not leaving the neighborhood, other than my camera, watch, and money I don't feel I have to carry all that stuff.  Still, even then, I wish I could at least have my Leatherman with me--scissors, a screwdriver, and pliers are amazingly handy to have on you at all times.<br /><br />That's why I'm thrilled with this multitool, because I can take it with me without having to carry a bag or wear some kind of holster.  It's pocket size, and flat, so it's about like carrying a Zippo lighter.  (Note to self: Add a Zippo lighter to my go bag.)  In fact, it has a smaller profile than that, and yet so many tools.  It's also lighter and more 'comfortable' but not too small to do the job.<br /><br />Do I prefer it over the Leatherman?  Of course not, but I can't go walking around an urban neighborhood wearing a holster.
B006PHS798|5|Great item
B00TTLR8VK|5|Almost took a sip since it smelled so good. Brought out a nice shine to the paint. I like how this works in my foam gun as well. Good product, good price, good quantity.
B0117EETEK|4|Offers a good clearance to change oil. Front lip could be a bit higher to offer more resistance when tire reaches the top. Overall, works well and strong enough to handle vehicle weight without worrying creaking noises.
B00407YQ04|5|fast and cheap to make some small repair
B0076D5OI2|5|fit perfect easy install works great
B000BZG65W|5|Bought this for my 95 nissan maxima to replace the upflow driver side sensor. This was actually for the passenger side but there is no difference in the 2. It fit perfectly. Installed and car is running great and CEL went off. I contacted them once about harness length and got an immediate response and they were very friendly and helpful. This was a quality well made product and would and am buying again to replace the passenger side. Arrived quickly even one day earlier than expected delivery date. This saved me $60.00 if i would have bought at local parts store, and didn't sacrifice quality! If you need this buy it and save some money you wont regret it! Satisfied customer! I highly recommend you buy the sensor tool to pull it for the $9.99 you will thank me. The driver side is in a tight spot at an odd angle, not easy to remove with out the o2 sensor puller.
B001GEIIF8|4|At first I was going to return it because it did not fit... thank god when I went to take the picture of the back I saw the front notice.  Fits nicely, worried about the GPS hood antena but besides that looks good on my Solstice GPX.
B000EQR2K6|5|ACDelco products are Heavy Duty. This was installed on a 2003 Honda CR-V. Very easy to install with the use of a  grinder to remove the old part. I replaced both front at the same time.
B00BWTW40W|5|These OEM splash guards fit perfectly.  They took me 30 minutes to install all four and I'm about a 6 out of 10 on the handy scale.  The directions are easy to understand although they're just pictures.<br /><br />The rear guards were easily installed using a cordless drill I already had, a Dewalt right angle drill adapter ($15 at Home Depot), and Milescraft 2320 Metal Stubby Drill Bits ($14 on Amazon).  Without these I would have had to remove the rear wheels which would have been a pain in the you know what.  Drill four holes in the plastic bumper cover, insert four screws, and you're done.<br /><br />The fronts were installed using the same tools and diagonal cut pliers which already had.  I also turned the front wheels while working which gave me more than enough extra room.  Be aware that the inside wheel well shield is loose by design; it's not broken.  You use two existing holes after removing the plastic fasteners with the diagonal pliers and insert two spring clips.  The directions seemed to be a bit off here, as I inserted the spring clips onto the fender and then inserted the screws, instead of behind the fender edge which would not work.  Drill four holes, insert three screws and three plastic fasteners, and you're done.<br /><br />The dealership wanted $200 installed; doing it myself cost $104 ($75 for splash guards, $29 in tools).  That's a solid win in my book!!!
B00GOO45LG|5|I went to a junk yard and they wanted $150.00 for completed mirror when I only needed this small glass! I looked online and everyone else was in he $40-$60 price range. This company was only $7.99 and it fits great, looks new and is real glass! Great deal! I recommend to anyone. I will be using this company from now on. I received my product within 3 days. Mirror comes complete with instructions and adhesive tape.
B000CMIYE0|5|Work great, look great. Easy to take off.
B0006I0OSE|5|Use it for many applications. Works perfect for roof repair and we use it on construction sites for all types of repairs.
B000CPCRJK|5|Second time I have purchased, great product !!
B001CHG17Q|5|excellent product and service
B009BEF1WS|5|Overall the Mounting and Display unit Look and function well.  The Suction Cup Sticks well to the window.  The section of the mount that connects to the back of the display unit seams a little flimsy to me.  I would of liked to see a little better design in that area.  They provide a cigarette lighter adapter and a hard wire adapter to power the unit.  To test the unit I used the cigarette lighter adapter and it works fine.  After deciding on a final location I Installed the hard wire adapter.  So far no problems.<br /><br />The Sensors provided with this system seem to be accurate compared with the reading from a pressure gauge.  They provide a special wrench for use with the theft protect cover that goes over the sensors.  I personally decided not to use the anti-theft part of the sensors because of the wrench.  It was difficult to keep from letting air out of the tire while tightening the sensor to the valve stem.  This is mostly because of the design of my rims.  In the future I will probably decide to buy the internal sensors and switch them out.<br /><br />The only slightly annoying thing is it takes a few minutes to display the pressures after being powered off.<br /><br />Overall for the price I can't complain too much.  I like the unit.
B00IJ43Q78|4|Went against recommended replacement in pairs, bought & installed the single. Works fine, although the ball connections seem a bit sloppier than the original.
B00TP11HTS|5|Works awesome it's a must have
B005C6KIVS|5|Works well. Wonderful device to have around. Couldn't get it to work on my iPhone.
B005FKORD6|5|As expected. recomended
B00080QHMM|5|This worked perfect on my motorhome  made it a lot easier to get a quick reading on all the tires in less than five minutes
B008HCV7VE|5|great thank you
B000RUCTSO|5|Fantastic lights, really reach down the road. I was skeptical that such a small light would throw enough light, but they really do the job.
B001RAQGXC|1|Had no impact on a small scratch on windshield.
B0042OX8VS|5|This Dorman 911-601 Toyota Vacuum Switching Valve is an exact fit for my 2002 Toyota Camry LE with 2.4L L4 Gas DOHC Distributorless Naturally Aspirated SFI Electronic FI MFI engine displaying diagnostic trouble codes PO441 and PO446. Amazon fitment guide said this item would not fit the ' 02 Camry with 4 cylinder engine, but it was an exact replacement for my OEM Toyota 90910-12264 Vacuum Switch Valve attached to charcoal cannister. I used an extra long handle srewdriver to remove & replace screw and hoses after placing rear of vehicle up on jack stands, took less than 20 minutes to swap out parts. Fault codes are gone and have not returned. I am extremely pleased with this item!
B00F9XQ138|5|EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED
B00LO0M918|5|Great at a great price.
B000TDQGCE|5|Very well made cleat. Exactly what I was looking for. No one is going to stub their on these and they seem to be very sturdy and strong.

B00KXPMEPG|1|Looks like a grey marker.  Would not recommend on a mountain grey CLA.
B00ABAKHV6|5|Worked great as a replacement for the defective item and was much less expensive than buying the same item from the VW dealer.  It was installed on a 2000 VW Golf.  The part arrived in a timely manner.  I was very satisfied.
B00A7EQJC2|5|This item works as intended.  Removed, then torqued head bolts.  Even removed some bolts which had been damaged by a Torx bit.
B0068ETSPA|5|Solid! I'd recommend these for anyone looking for some rearsets whether to upgrade or your old ones took a crap on you like mine did. Thanks @drivenracing for making such a great product.
B008M9LLOU|5|I use these to educate people on what a mopar is.<br /><br />&#34;That's a dodge! Not a mopar!<br /><br />WRONG oem mopar parts!<br /><br />I can educate people in my ypund age group
B00KCQSOAA|1|It fit my vechicle and material is really cheap
B0039ZS2S0|2|No information no instructions this is generic af
B00KNB2CWA|5|Finally, been thinking about getting one for years. Very convenient.
B009NTSNYY|5|exellent
B00IXP7GUG|5|Installed on my Honda sabre and love these lights! Super bright and make spotting sneaky deer on the side of the road much easier. Minor wiring connection problem (2 male end connectors don't connect well) but PIAA was great when advised of the problem.
B00B0N8OFY|5|Had the Kia remote programmed by the dealership and it works perfectly.
B00KWMCITC|3|The mats was damage like it was drag the plastic wrap was rip so the mat was  damage
B004I12438|4|The taillight came much more quickly than it has taken to install. oops...
B00F9K3JKO|5|Love it just what I wanted.
B005334O3I|5|Love it works great
B004U1Y3VC|1|LYING LIARS THAT LIE!<br />Saying that this inverter produces 175 watts IS AN OUT AND OUT LIE!<br />That's like advertizing  &#34;this car travels at 60 mph&#34; but not informing buyers that if you DO travel at 60 mph for more than 5 minutes, the engine will conk out!<br />It's rated at 120 to 130 watts continuous.<br />BUT WHY BUY ANYTHING AT ALL FROM LYING LIARS THAT LIE!
B00GCX6DB4|4|Lights are bright, but tend to flicker a little. My stock lights didn't, so my best guess is the LED's themselves. But, it's not enough to bother me, would still purchase again.
B002OL7XFI|5|I enjoyed mine so much I bought them for two friends!  They loved them as well.
B00LUS5XLW|5|Good n fit my car. Thumbs up
B00TNLYAGC|5|These are headlights.  They do as expected.
B00MAU9PV8|5|It came how it should've on time and not leaking
B00R3A6IX8|5|Good
B00UHD4HJA|1|I did not receiVe the same stickers as the default photos display. I' am not satisfied.
B00U9YNZC2|1|These are REALLY Thin and REALLY close to the window glass, so there's NOT much room for air to vent...Item is NOT AS DESCRIBED! Save your $$$ and do NOT buy these, instead I recommend buying the genuine ones from AutoVentShade/VentVisor Brand from your local auto parts store...these are essentially JUNK!
B007LICL56|5|Perfect for my car!
B000VVVOYY|5|Wish I would of bought a dozen.
B00H1NI8GC|5|This item if used as described is very sturdy and useful. Don't expect to use it as a carrier with heavy items from your auto to the house.  That is not the intent of the product. It is an aut I mobile organizer not a tote. So used in the proper manner it is a well made product for the money.
B00J7HBRL8|5|I bought a pair of these to replace the stock dome lights in my mom's car. The interior is SO MUCH brighter compared to using the stock dome lights. These lights make it much easier for my mother to enter and exit her car at night.
B00C8EA4GG|3|Installed pretty easy only gripe is the latch that hold the cable in wouldn't shut. it looked like a manufacturer defect, luckily i was able to use the latch and door from the old part. only time will tell if it will hold up
B003L31RK0|5|This is by far the best oil filter I have used. The build quality is high and keeps my car (2007 Ford Focus SE) in good running condition. It's worth spending a couple of extra bucks on a good filter to accompany long lasting synthetic oil.
B00I1LU9II|5|Excellent product! Keep up the good work!
B001UGJKRC|4|Nice, great helmet buy it was too bulky
B004HNW7BQ|5|Overall great. product arrived sooner than expected
B005MVB6TG|1|Well, you get 12 of them in a variety of sizes and shapes, and the case is nice, but these things are really junk. As in mostly unusable as they come out of the box. The points aren't straight and aren't aligned with each other. You'll need to bend them to make a workable tool out of this set.
B001FAO8I4|2|Immediately broke, should not be relied upon for bicycle tires
B001RJN56Y|4|This scent is incomparable when it comes to air fresheners. I have used a variety of scents in my car and this &#34;squash&#34; scent truly reigns supreme. It is a unique smell and it is always a minor joy to have friends in my car asking me what kind of car air freshener I use. This scent is definitely my favorite of them all, but there is a major downside. I have found this product as one that does not last particularly long, which is unfortunate in a consumer sense. Its higher than normal pricing and short quality life makes it a purchase that you must be willing to make and to do so often. *I have experienced a range from 1 week to 3 weeks.* However, if you have the budget, I would strongly suggest this product.
B00VO5JAQ0|5|I was plesad  with everthing I orded thank you.
B00CFALFXY|5|These are awesome cleaning cloths!  I even use them as dishcloths.  Very absorbent.  I would definitely buy these again!
B00CBKOP7G|5|Running catless on my g35. No CEL. No problems. Easy install.
B00V337VNM|5|Up close they look like plastic but from far away you'd think they're actual rims. They installed easily on my 2012 Honda civic coupe
B0002JMEFS|5|great price
B000CCMKZY|4|Had a spark plug that just didn't want to thread in all the way.  It wasn't cross threading, but would just get super tight after getting about 3/4 in.  After applying the Permatex, the plug seated all the way in.
B0029TQDLA|4|These are geat save the handicap signe from bending,<br />Ohly problem is living in Florida and it hanging in the sun for any length<br />of time the hanger part starts to twist and and the out side of the sleave<br />gets all bumby,  I found with that just laying in on your dash is a good idea.
B00I25Z8MA|5|SWEET STICKER FOR THE RIDE!
B008E7Q9GA|5|I'm a shoppers  A DIYer great price  like OEM for 86 E30😊
B00RN6FEY6|1|INCOMPATIBLE with 1.8 L Mazda Miata engines! The sensor's plug is too large for the connector on the harness. It made my harness connector split in half. I was misled by past reviews, thinking that perhaps it was only a tight fit, but it seems that this is the wrong sensor for the car. Amazon compatibility check was also misleading.
B00651CBHI|1|Very poor reception. I was lead to believe it would be as good as the long antenna that was stolen from my vehicle.
B00V9252VU|5|Great product very good prise fast shipment I recommend.
B00IKZTRLA|5|Awesome made and quality finish. Just wish it was about 25% larger over all.
B007UMD300|5|Perfect.
B0002SRGWA|5|good
B0037RZS9G|1|Well, after 8 months of driving and less than 10,000 miles I'm very displeased with these headers. After hearing a slight exhaust leak that went away after a short time with the engine running, I visited a muffler shop to check for the obvious found a massive crack in the passenger side header around one of the tubes. Needless to say I'm very upset as the passenger side requires complete removal of the battery, battery box relay/fuse panel airbox etc. And the fact that I've got no replacement part in hand to install is a major inconvenience. I've done only street and highway driving so hoping that amazon and the manufacturer will stand behind their product.
B00DW6RTZ8|5|great quality works great. Fast and efficient as well. Thanks for shipping to Alaska
B00EEJMEQ6|5|Product came in as described and worked great. Another affordable repair completed with a quality part.
B000C9TWR6|5|Excellent recommend 100%
B00I5058AY|5|Great quality I installed it my self in two hours. And the truck still rides like it came off show room floor. Great buy!!!
B00JAMYDFC|1|Did not work at all!  Followed directions twice-no difference-save you money and order something different.  Wish I could get my money back!
B002P8QTFA|4|Definitely worth the price. Not the color I needed and size a smidge off but definitely a thumbs up for the price
B00GSAUHB8|5|Since we live in Northern California we get the full brunt of the summer sun, and my car must be parked outdoors.  This sun protector helps a great deal in minimizing the effects of the sun on the dashboard.  It it easy to insert and fairly easy to fold up what you get the hang of it.
B005EGMPJY|5|Fit as it should.  Volvo's engineering makes it less than simple to remove and replace.  You tube videos are helpful.
B003SZA49Q|5|worked really good
B00VNBEBCS|5|I got these bulbs along with opt7's fog lights for my 2008 f150. Everything went in very easy, and is obviously built to last! I had a problem with one of the fog lights not working and their very helpful customer service sent me out a new set with no questions asked! I'll definitely be buying from them again!
B00L2PRQ8G|5|nice
B006M7E4IY|5|Replaced my previous aftermarket &#34;hose&#34; style...  Tired of that supid tiny oil hose cracking and leaking oil.  So, this is a wonderful alternative.<br /><br />Works as advertised, the pressure is exactly what it said on my old gauge.  LED is not too bright, nor do dim.  Perfect.
B00I2I104C|1|Item states it will work with 2014. 2014 had auto dim mirror and you can't replace the map lights. The other two cabin lights don't match.
B005FNKSMW|5|Great working
B001DH0QUI|5|Fits perfectly and I can tell you I have fresh air in my vehicle now
B00KTJ9IW8|5|Good quality
B010EUNSK4|5|[[VIDEOID:9f27ec5a64e45752d14e79de098ae250]] This is the best portable jump starter kit that I have used. There are so many uses to take advantage of. It's got a good size battery, lots of emergency lights, built in glass hammer, and of course the jumper cables. The carrying case is pretty nice too.<br /><br />I', definitely going to be keeping this in my car. Mind this was sent to me for free in exchange for my honest review.
B00JFDIV4A|5|Fits on my 97 and 01 civic coupes
B001EMRQBE|5|super great product and so easy to install and is working great on truck
B000VEKRTE|4|I have had several of these on other vehicles, they are easy to install and look pretty good.. but the visors seem so small compared to the size of the window and vehicle. I know its a big truck but these should have been a little bigger, if only for the look. They function as expected and I still recommend them.
B0013FZXA8|5|Exactly what I needed for half the price of everyone else. Thanks.
B00684TAYY|5|I just received mine today and works great highly recommend
B00MWULLP4|5|Great clips!
B003ZA926K|5|These are a great idea for working on the suspension at ride-height when you don't want jack stands in the way.  (1969 GTO in my case.) They are very light weight, simple, and look real nice, too.
B000FOIJXQ|5|Ok
B00XGSK01M|5|Sticks well looks great
B0041WOEYG|5|This is made for a Honda Civic but it fits perfectly into a 2007 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara JK. The fan that is made by MOPAR is nearly $120 and this one only cost $40, MOPAR wake up. If you want us to buy MOPAR products then stop pricing things so high. I saved $80 on this fan and it fits and works great. So Jeep JK owners, save your money and try this one.
B0026Y98YM|3|Can't use in conjunction with Truxedo tonneau cover.
B000CMGHGC|5|fit the car well
B000VKRQ60|5|excellent. thoroughly recommended . meets the expectations
B00UBFZRX4|5|its fine
B002E5HMWI|5|Looks good
B000N5JRBK|5|Just what I wanted.  No droan at cruise but awesome sound at WOT!  Installation took just over an hour and everything lined up perfect.  I'm completely satisfied!
B008G32B1O|5|They fit my truck perfectly!
B001F0IE7A|5|works great , easy yo install
B005G50OJG|5|Fast shipping very pleased with this item!!! Thank you!...
B002PK2TD4|4|I'm not sure that there is a better spray gun at this price point. Fan and fluid controls work well. I got the 2.0 version to shoot primers, and this unit will spray a very heavy U-Pol 4:1 with only the slightest bit of reducer. It sprays a great uniform pattern.<br />I doesn't look exactly like the picture though, mine came with red knobs.....
B008DWKF98|1|Ceramic end casted incorrectly. Broke when connecting to light, had to repin. Still functional but plan to return.
B005P00CPS|5|Heavy duty
B0088PJ2BC|5|Good price! Fit well!
B00JA3BMDW|5|Works good.
B000CON6SC|4|Very soft shock. Used them on the front of my1969 Road Runner. They replicate the factory ride if that is what you are looking for. Next time I will get a firmer shock but these are certainly priced right if you're on a budget.
B000PGVZ30|4|Works fine.  Easy to install.  I recommend this piece, especially because of the handle attached.  Sometimes, when plugged into a fairly tight space, it's hard to get your fingers around the plug such that it can be pulled out of the receptacle easily.  With the handle, this is a non issue.  Also makes it easy to handle when you've attached it to a heavy four conductor cable.  Other competitive products seem flimsy by comparison.
B001NYIHWA|5|As advertised.
B008E11TF2|5|Very happy with this product.  The color was exactly as it looked in the photos.
B011R5B76M|5|just received this item and already put it to use. although i have only used it one time, it worked flawlessly. definitely bang for your buck.
B00YQBAKFO|5|Came with a bit of extra wiring which is awesome, and shipped quickly. Good looking mirrors for my 92 civic hatch. Thank you!
B000816KNC|1|Cheap material it broke after 3 times that my kid used it.
B000M8U6RM|5|Just what I have been looking for.  Had on like this many years ago and it was great.
B00KB5KI1U|4|They are good. They fit my Mazda MPV perfectly. But they are not made in Japan as described on Amazon. They are made in China
B00O83TQLE|5|This is quality plus. Installed it on my Silverado and really looks good. Will purchase this item again if needed.
B00G09Q6H6|5|Worked perfectly. I accidentally broke off this latch on my wife's 2004 BMW 330 CI one night trying to get the hood open - my mistake because I couldn't find the hood release inside the car and thought the hood was jammed. Felt like a real dummy when she showed me the hood release....<br /><br />Anyway, this came in and it was an easy swap and readjustment. Lesson learned and all back to normal
B00FM1CKK0|5|What a super cute item to hang from your rear view mirror!  Everyone loves it.  Definitely a great value for the price.
B00MH45VCE|1|I ordered the shirt and went to try it on it ran very small. I recomend  getting it a size or two bigger.
B013KOGN5I|5|Worked perfectly for my 2008 Ford Explorer.  Refer to the owner's manual for programming with the Securilock system; search Google or Youtube for instructions for programming the remote part.  (Yes, you have to program each part separately.)
B00873J0YY|4|It fit on my Hyundai Santa Fe OEM roof rack.  The width is as describe.  It flexes a little as I load my tandem Kayak, 18.5 feet in length and weight 90 lbs.
B002TBEJDC|5|Welded right in and really quieted down the low RPM's anything below 3000. Everything above that is of course still loud. I think it cleaned up the sound a little bit and might be a bit deeper, but very minimal tone change. No more drone on the highway which is what I was going for.
B00BFU8H0Y|5|Came quickly and was an exact match.
B00KTHT4EW|5|Exactly what we needed. Easy to program. Works great.
B0012ZITJQ|5|Quick wash spray is very convenient. For those in between waxes and polishes this really gets the dirt off. Cleaned the wheels well and removes all the break dust , pollen, or anything else. The bottle is pretty small but you can make it go further if you put a little bit of dawn in with it.<br /><br />The Metal Polish works great and even helps with minor scratches. Meguiar's sells an applicator that I used and it complements this product well. The engine usually builds up quickly with grease and it really cuts through it rather nicely.<br /><br />The plastic polish is great as well but for someone with a mostly metal bike I don't get too much use out of it. I use this on my fenders and it works. If you have a sport bike this is definitely needed!<br /><br />Paint Polish is great for cleaning up any gas splashes that you get from time to time. It seems to also leave shine over it that protects future splashes ruining the paint.<br /><br />The Leather and vinyl polish What more can I say for a cruiser bike, It's someth... Read more
B004EBFDY4|5|Works very well. Easy to install. Must buy for New Beetle Cabrio owners
B003NI6NTS|5|Was a cinch to install and now the trunk lid lifts easily.
B00474N160|2|The head of the Hello Kitty fell off within the first week, it is glued onto the fabric not sewn.  I had to re-glue it, but not sure how long it will last.  They are cute though.
B00A2XD7RI|5|GREAT STUFF!
B00FQ8U0YM|5|Great extra protection! Especially during winter
B00Y040ZL6|1|The bulbs are very very  dim, there is hardly any difference  between the running lights and break lights--or running lights and turn signals.<br /> I got pulled over for not using turn signals. You can not see the break lights or turn signal at all in the day light.
B011BTEA2M|5|Excelente
B00429NKWK|5|This product is the best but I recommend not sanding your headlights with 2000 or the 1000 sand paper because it scratches the headlight just clean the headlights good and use the two bottles that came with this product it's amazing how it makes the headlight clear and shiny at the end I recommend buying this product if you are thinking about cleaning your headlights
B009SF0FWQ|4|Good product  stays stuck on vehicle been thru several car washes
B000WJ9M8A|5|Fast Shipping..Item In Perfect Condition and Works. Thank You!
B000UVAPGI|5|Love
B004ODAS0Q|4|Nice helmet, it looks cool and might be perfect for street racers too.
B00EGO2IC4|5|I accidentally ordered the wrong ones for a crew cab. I emailed the vendor and they sent out the right ones right away. Couldn't be happier, these liners are well worth the money.
B000EDOSKG|4|Works
B000M8R0QM|5|Perfect fit for my purposes!
B005Q88NKK|5|very easy install
B000CF6S0E|1|Did not fit as directed, waste of time and money
B00176FTW0|5|Fast ship and an exact match.  The lawn mower fired right up and was an easy fix
B00E16M1S8|5|my prius is purring now. great price.
B00EKEGRVS|3|First off, they are cheap and free shipping.  Do they work?  YES!  Will they last?  NO!  The first has stretched so it doesn't stay on the visor anymore.  I suggest buying a bunch and throwing them out when they break.
B00GGX9UGU|5|Great protection for your garage floor.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|Wonderful white light for DRLs, had one of them start to flicker and die out about two weeks ago so I contacted JDM and they sent me a replacement right away. Great customer service.
B00YHVYOMS|5|I own a 2010 Ram 2500 4x4 Megacab with a leveling kit and 33&#34; mud tires. It has always pulled to the right with no luck of correcting it by alignment. I had a hard time spending $200 bucks for a steering stabilizer but after installing it I am over the money. I am happy I bought it and now my truck drives straight. Wish I would have bought it years ago.
B00FRHOO9O|1|I was expecting a high quality product, but after trying them out there was some nasty smearing and the blade skipped and squealed across my windshield. I was very disappointed in the product and I returned it for another brand.<br /><br />Also, Drive Success had very poor customer service. They refused to give me the whole refund even after emailing them several times about the issue. Very very dissappointed in their business.
B001GTQMZG|4|Good, but runny. Has the consistency of water and usually runs down the side of the vehicle before you can wipe it off. I've tried other spray products that are too thick, requiring a MF sponge to remove because they cake on contact, but this product has the opposite problem...it's diluted too much. To overcome this, I mix 1 part Barrier Reef spray wax by Surf City Garage (which is like motor oil) with 10 parts of this detailer to get the right consistency and for an unreal, mirror-like wet shine.  The water beading is marginal at best, so a good wax should be applied regularly as this product isn't a substitute for that.
B0000AY8L8|4|The right size for my trailer
B00JRE38EA|5|RePlaced my rear ceiling lights, door safety lights, trunk interior light, and reverse lights. Much cleaner looking white instead of a yellowish white. Very bright. No problems at all. Comes in an antistatic  package to prevent shorting. I think some issues others have had is due to static. Otherwise cannot beat the price for these with this level brightness.
B00A1WH4W4|4|there good. ;long lasting , dosent seem to eat up rotors , and best of all, the price is good
B004I0I1PE|5|excellent product and service
B00XBEK002|5|Light bar looks amazing on my 2000 f150 definitely worth it
