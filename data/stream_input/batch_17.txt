0385493800|2.0|John Grisham seems to be spending less and less time writing his novels, and the plots and character development show it.  A Time to Kill and The Firm are well-plotted with several characters that are more than cardboard  cutouts. But once he quit lawyering and writing part-time and started  writing full time, his books have grown increasingly flat.  Yes, he'll  still sell thousands of copies and probably wouldn't sell any more if he  were to spend more time at crafting his works. But it's disappointing that  he is unwilling or unable to realize his potential.
0385493800|5.0|Although his last two books were a little disappointing, in The Testament, Grisham has found the magic again.  This book will not disappoint old fans, but should win lots of new ones.  There is a spirituality and a maturity  that I've not found in his work before.  The characters are the best he's  ever written.
0375701427|2.0|Phillip Roth is my literary Dick Nixon: the man I love to hate.  Whoever it is, the real author or the persona, the guy keeps dragging me in to hear his agonized, self-involved, masturbatory whining, book after book after  book.<br />&quot;American Pastoral&quot; purports to be a step away from all  that.  Roth's alter ego, Zuckerman, makes his entrance, and then  relinquishes the stage to yet another Jewish main man from Newark, but one  who, believe it or not, is a star athlete with blond hair, known to one and  all as &quot;Swede.&quot;  But, wouldn't you know it, you can't take the  neighborhood from the boy.  Although punctuated by by a string of  gratuitous crises, &quot;American Pastoral&quot; is basically one long  whine.<br />The maddening fact remains that Roth is a fine writer.  And he  even puts this talent to good use with his loving and detailed descriptions  of the golden age of glovemaking.  He should have written an essay or  novella on this subject and skipped the rest of the Swede's sorry life.
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine Dion is probably the best thing to come out of Canada musically since Rush, because her breathtaking voice can equal anything that the great Alex Lifeson can play on his guitar. She has released some very good  albums before, but no previous records, or mabye even future ones ( though  &quot;Lets Talk About Love&quot; comes close ) will ever equal the  spectacular majesty presented in &quot;Falling into You&quot;. As always,  the production is big and very, very clean, almost perfect, somewhat of a  trademark in her recordings. The musical arrangements are even bigger. The  wonderfully crisp piano and strings seem to add new depths to her singing.  The drums and bass go from earth shaking to a gentle heartbeat with each  new track, not to mention the often tearing guitar riffs complemented  nicely by the large cast of rythm and horn instruments. Celine's voice has  a beutifull feel on every song. The sharp album opener &quot;Its All Coming  Back to me Now&quot; is so beutifully sung it would have been o.k. to make  it the album's only song, but the lush background voices togeather with  Celine on songs like &quot;Call the Man&quot;, &quot;Because you Loved  Me&quot;, &quot;If Thats What it Takes&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot; are what  fuels the album. These tunes are well mixed with swinging rockers like the  superpaced &quot;River Deep Mountain High&quot; and &quot;Declaration of  Love&quot;, along with INXS like funk-rock on &quot;Make you Happy&quot;  and &quot;Dreamin of You&quot;.&quot;Fallin Into You&quot; is an album with  absolutely no filler, it delivers from start to finish, which is something  very rare these days. To give it five stars is not enough, but to find out  you have to listen for yourself. As always Celine does not dissapoint.
B000000OUW|4.0|This CD is definitely one of the best. Manowar continue to prove they are not sell-outs like some 80's bands who shall reamin nameless. My only complaint is that the band does these crazy endings to their songs that  remind me of fingernails on a chalkboard, but if you're into that sort of  thing, by all means get this CD. Otherwise, this CD is flawless. For  maximum enjoyment, play it LOUD!
6305169195|5.0|The cast of Armageddon is phenomenal!  They interact so well with each other and make you feel like you are actually in the movie.  Ben Affleck is adorable as A.J., and teams up very well with Bruce Willis.  I loved this  movie and would recommend it to anyone!
6304711875|5.0|That guy from Melbourne has no idea what he is talking about.  Scream is sexy,m funny, gory, and in places, scary.  It is my favourite film of all time.  Even though Scream 2 is not as good, it still kicks a*s.  Scream 2  is my second favourite film of all time.  I just can't wait 'til the final  part in the trilogy - SCREAM 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6302869390|5.0|Both reviews above are &quot;right on&quot; but they leave out one of the great moments in concert music I have ever seen and that is the incredible performance of Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan.
0395754100|5.0|My 3 year old son was sent this book as a Christmas present and six weeks later we are still reading it every night before bed time.  Admittedly, I sometimes wish he would choose a shorter story for bed time, but he just  loves it.  My 18 month old daughter also chooses it every night, and loves  pointing at Curious George every time he appears on the page.  George is so  funny, the story line so interesting, you never know what is going to  happen next.  And the drawings are fantastic.  I never knew a monkey could  have so many facial expressions!  We would not be without George.
0790729342|5.0|I agree with all the previous reviews. The action in the final chase scene was incredible. The Road Warrior is an awesome DVD to own.
0140277447|5.0|(We must remember history) I found I was able to connect with the passion that Chang infused the book with.  Kudos to her for brining us up to speed because as present day peoples we have a terrible case of amnesia.  We  would be very lucky if someone did a similar expose on the egregious and  obscene human rights violations by our foundling (Sic.) fathers
079213690X|5.0|Of course I may be a bit bias because I like so-called &quot;war&quot; movies, but &quot;Braveheart&quot; is really great. The war scenes are incredible. I can't stop at jsut watching &quot;Braveheart&quot; only  once...or twice. I've seen it about 8 times already. It is just too good of  a movie. Parts of this also made me cry, so it isn't all blood and guts.  But, in any case, you have got to give &quot;Braveheart&quot; a try. Mel  Gibson is much better here than in any of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;  series.
B000001F9E|2.0|Update: 11/30/05    Jailbreak.    Its been six years since the review below. And have I taken heat for it!    My opinion still stands - I don't think this is their best. This album appeals to many for the dual guitar harmonies. Personally, the Gorham/Robertson give and take never worked for me.  I found the tones they used and the vibe of this era of the band somewhat plodding.    In the years since the original review I've come more and more to appreciate the Eric Bell era of Thin Lizzy. That era of the band had alot more interesting things going on compared to \\"Jailbreak.\\" Even John Sykes' contributions show more fire.    Resume throwing rocks at me.    -end update-    I can see it now: \\"Thats ridiculous you ripped on Jailbreak.\\" The die-hard fan of Thin Lizzy's highest grossing era would think exactly that. The 2 star rating isn't so much a put-down as much as it is a  commentary that its not their best work. If you want their most artistic  work turn to the CDs - \\"Vagabonds of the Western World,\\"  \\"Thunder & Lightning\\" and to some degree  \\"Renegade.\\" This CD, of course features many FM rock radio  staples. The songs such as \\"Jailbreak\\",\\"Boys...,\\" and  \\"Emerald\\" are good numbers. However, overall it sounds like most  anything else in 1976 that was in the hard rock vien. I hate to admit it.  But, I think this CD is an example of what can happen when the record  company gets behind your album and you get lucky. Pity \\"Thunder &  Lightning\\" didn't get the same treatment - it was more worthy of it.
0385493800|1.0|How much payback did John Grisham receive from travel agencies in Brazil to write this trite, uninteresting,shallow book? A search for what could have been an interesting heir to a fortune devotes itself to the  description of a &quot;Crash &amp; Burn&quot; Malpractice attorney. Who  cares? I ended up hot and itchy from weather and insect descriptions. A  good Calamine Lotion advertisement.
630514415X|3.0|Spike Lee really shows his love for basketball in this movie. I think they could have gotten a better actor to play &quot;Jesus Shuttleworth&quot;. I would have liked more comedy in this movie to depict the fun side of  basketball not just the seriousness of the game.

0385493800|1.0|Though a Grisham fan, this book was a disappointment.  I felt he must have had to dash it off in a hurry.  None of the intricate twists and turns.  No real great characters.  I thought it was more like a Danielle Steele book  (and that's not a compliment), something he wrote to meet a deadline, than  the usual good plot and characters.
6301661737|5.0|Here's one example of a film whose power lies firmly in the visual and aesthetic departments.  Kagemusha is beautiful beyond belief, filled with cinematic wonder, confident in the sheer force of imagery.<br />Much has been  made of the melodramatic style of acting that Nakadai Tatsuyo indulges in,  both here and in Ran (1985).  Kagemusha benefits from the fact that it  doesn't give Nakadai as much incentive to overplay -- as opposed to the  King Lear madness of Ran, which provided Nakadai with a stage to receive  his overacting.  Kagemusha, thankfully, dwells in the exquisite art designs  (Kurosawa Akira took years to draw out the storyboards, having been unable  to get the film produced for a long time), perfect compositions,  inexhaustible wealth of colours, and sublime lighting.  Deservedly the  highest-grossing Japanese film of its time and, I would argue, Kurosawa's  masterpiece.
0783226837|5.0|Just enough horror, smarts, comedy, acting, suspense, and believablity to make this one a classic. I also enjoyed the &quot;Making of Tremors&quot; which is included as an extra. Not to be missed!
0788805843|5.0|&quot;Hercules&quot; is an underappreciated Disney film. The music is superb, the animation audacious, and the story moves crisply and nimbly, with witty dialogue and well-developed characters.
0385493800|4.0|All of John Grisham's books are worth reading.  Some are better then others.  The Testament was good but not a page turner.
0060273224|5.0|This book was fast-paced and dangerous.  It was a good book to read in the summer so I would have all the time I wanted to finish it.  It was a turn-pager and I found it hard to put down.

078401213X|1.0|I hated this movie! The idea was good but the actual production was horrible.The acting was bad and all the actors played two dimensional empty parts and overall the movie was long and boreing. But the idea was good.
6304618344|1.0|Okay, yes it was kinda fun watching Nicolas go to town as the bad guy.  But I'm kinda old fashioned, I like to be able to be listen to the dialoge without cringing, and the in your face forshadowing was a little annoying,  no, it was alot annoying! But If you liked &quot;Con Air&quot; I guess you  will love &quot;face off&quot;
B000001GBJ|5.0|I bought this CD by accident---thought I was getting the soundtrack to the movie of the same name.  Imagine my surprise! But imagine my good fortune. This CD (along with WHite Stones) is one of my favorite musical  possessions.  Beautifully haunting, sensual and relaxing. It is music which  combines new age, classical, celtic and just a hint of rock.  A treasure.

Jimmie, Buddy, Eric and B.B. have a good time  playing Stevie's favorites. If you are a blues fan, this is a must have.
0679428887|1.0|Normally I buy books; this one was borrowed and I'm happy for not having spent the money.<br />What will the next &quot;secret paper, hidden offspring&quot; blizzard of titles consist of, &quot;The Clinton  chronicles&quot;? Between the hackneyed plot, floridly gratuitous  descriptions of everything from sounds in the halls to mid-hangover  vomiting, and boring, overworked, scenarios - a total waste of time - and  someone else's money.<br />The jacket writers and critics who cite this piece  of work as depicting an accurate view of the &quot;new&quot; Russia  obviously didn't experience (or otherwise know) the &quot;old&quot; or  &quot;new&quot; Russia.<br />If &quot;Archangel&quot; is this author's  &quot;third and best&quot;, let's hope there is no fourth.
068484267X|4.0|Never mind that you think you can identify with  Frankie's devastatingly poor childhood. Never  mind that the book will make you both chuckle and  sniffle within the space of half an hour. Never mind  that you think this  is purely over exaggerated self pity. What this book is, and will be  whether you  believe the story or not is a very cleverly written narrative.  No, there aren't any great stretches of perfect prose in this novel -  McCourt isn't Dickens,  and though his subject matter is similar, he  clearly  doesn't want to be. But sometimes, his descriptions are so exact,  so vivid, that I was left thinking, he  CAN write like the best of them,  use the language the way we expect so called good prize winning writers to,  so why doesn't he? Why did he risk people saying that this book was badly  written?  Because he wants us to live the story with him. At times I really  forgot that this was an old man telling his story, and not a young,  ignorant boy. McCourt has managed to pitch his prose at the exact level of  the age of the period he is writing about. So we see the world as a 5 year  old, 10 year old,14 year old,  and 19 year old lad would see it, because he  describes  the events as we would expect a child to do at each of  the  stages in his life that he wrotes about.   It's a skill that Alice Walker  used in the same way and to great effect in &quot;The Color Purple&quot;,  which we now know is a great novel, deserving of the acclaim it had.   I  loved this book; it's a good, and involving story if nothing else.  I think  once all the hoo-haa and attention dies down, people will start reading it  from a viewpoint unbiased by reviews and so forth, and see just how good  McCourt's use of his narrative voice is.
6305126062|5.0|Only Robert Redford could take a well written, captivating book and turn it into a perfect movie. A movie which the whole family can enjoy over and over again. From the tragic family issues to the stunning cinematography  this movie will take you through a wealth of emotions.

0767800958|4.0|This is a very stylistic film shot mostly in black and white.  The early scene where Sally happens by a theater and first sees Pablo Veron perform the tango on stage shows Sally instantly fixated on the magic of Veron and  the tango.  The viewer of this beautiful, very personal film is likely to  experience the same sense of awe and warm discovery throughout the film's  entirety.  The film's only weakness is the brief introduction of a strange  religious connection between Pablo and Sally that is never successfully  interwoven into the film's stylistic fabric.
B000002GWN|4.0|Tom Scott and the L.A. Express helped Joni Mitchell put a more aggressive presentation into her music.  This live album collects many of her early, best tracks in new interpretations.  I am dazzled by her self-assurance at  a relatively young age, penning classics such as &quot;Woodstock,&quot;  &quot;Circle Game,&quot; and my all-time favorite Joni cut - &quot;Both  Sides, Now.&quot;   The original &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; was released  almost as a novelty record; this interpretation presents a clearer message.   Mr. Scott and pals are terrific, putting a jazz fusion sheen on thoughtful  material.  This album (edited) along with the self-titled &quot;Tom Scott  and the L.A. Express&quot; make a great A-side/B-side match on a 90-minute  cassette.
B0000024YL|1.0|I was sorely disappointed to find that half the cuts are live recordings.  So I am bombarded with applause, and the songs don't sound the same as the popular versions.  A waste of money!
0671004107|5.0|After having read everything Stephen King has ever put on paper, I got tired of horror and when I saw Contact, the movie, I immediatly wanted to read the book. But as the weeks went by, I totally forgot about it until I  saw the movie again. Then I went straight to my library and got this  brilliant piece of work and finished it within a week. It is absolutely  brilliant!! My only wish is if Carl Sagan would still be alive so he could  write another book that measures up to this one. This would definately be  very high on the top of my &quot;destert-island book&quot; list. Read it!

0385493800|5.0|This is one of Grisham's best books. I was beginning to think he was more intent on plugging his political views rather than writing a really good novel.  He is back on track with this one.<br />I will admit that other  reviewers' criticism that Grisham didn't spend enough time on the religious  conversion is probably very true.  Since, as we Grisham fans know, he is  very capable of going on ad nauseum on a favorite topic (homeless,  cigarette companies, etc.)  I hate to write that he needed to spend more  time with this - but that is the only criticism I can find.<br />This novel is  a very fast read.  I was hooked from page one and by the end of the 2nd  chapter, I knew I wasn't going to put it down until I finished it.<br />I  recommend this as a great, fun way to spend a Saturday, or any other day of  the week.

B000002ADT|5.0|I can listen to &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; over and over and over and not get sick of it.  As all the reviewers have stated above, it is one of the best if not the best jazz CDs of all time.  Rather than repeat the praises  of others, I want to say that this album is truly seminal because while it  resembles the cool style most, you can hear elements of bop influences in  the solo improvs AND you can sense how the jazz is beginning to morp from  cool into a freer form. <br />&quot;All Blues&quot; alone is worth the money  for this defining masterpiece.
B000000WFU|5.0|The title track is the like the wildest cross between Enigma, Enya, and the choral opening of the Lion King.  It arrived today; I've listened to it 50 times already; great for writing, dancing, and sending to everyone you  know.
B000002LLC|5.0|If you like Madonna...you'd love this album.  I bought the cassette when Dick Tracy came out into the theatres.  It's a terrific CD...with fun, upbeat songs.  A great clean-your-house CD--it'll get you moving!  Also a  great long-drive-in the car CD.  I'm an 'older' Madonna fan, of albums like  True Blue--not Ray of Light, etc.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Be careful when listening to this stuff and driving.  I made the mistake of Die, Die, My Darling really loud in the rain.  Its tough to not put the pedal to the floor, the car was a little twitchy, this CD rocks.  I don't  care what the &quot;purists&quot; say.

0140186409|5.0|Without question one of the best books I have ever read.  An unbelievable story of dirt poor, yet very proud people who made their way with odds against them everyday of their life.<br />I can't wait to read other books  by Steinbeck.  I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates superb  literature and wants to view an era of America that was truly tragic.
0812550706|5.0|Everyone talks about Ender, but to me the most intriguing part of the story here is the line that follows his siblings.  Two equally gifted children, one incredibly ambitious and one just playing along, plotting to  take over the world?  A great subplot.  I don't want to downplay the main  story line, but that has been covered in every other review here.  While I  can easily live without the second, third, and fourth books of this series,  Ender's Game I will keep in my permanent collection.
B000002UTH|4.0|I bought this CD after Blood Sugar Sex Magic and it realy helped a lot of their more recent work make since.  The Chili Peps have always been about brother hood and Freaky Styley explains why, whith works like &quot;Jungle  Man&quot; and &quot;If You Want Me to Stay&quot; its easy to see how a lot  of modern bands fall short of the Chili Peps classic work.  I say, if you  are seriously into the RHCPs then you shouldn't go another day without this  album.  If they seem strange, or just mildly interesting to you, don't  waste your money, their older stuff won't have much of an effect on you.
0792151712|4.0|Titanic is really a great movie but the &quot;media&quot; around it has somehow turned it in more than just a film. Maybe it's more than just a film. Honeslty, the scenario is not so good, just a very classic  &quot;routine&quot; love story but it takes place in the most desperates  hours of maritime history, and that's what makes it so extraordinary: its  EMOTIONAL IMPACT. One can criticise on the love story but when it comes to  the very disaster, James Cameron has brillantly told us how thousands of  people sunk to death... This movie moves you and touches you very much, and  that's the very essence of cinema isn't it: making you feel touched and  feel emotion ?

6304341849|5.0|A serious film that treats homosexuality in the Greek perspective - emphasis on friendship / romance rather than mindless promiscuity.  It's so refreshing to see sex as the final culmination of a love affair rather than  its empty beginning.  In the spirit of author Mary Renault, we find  ourselves centered on characters of real depth and intelligence, though  flawed and wounded like we all are.  A film with innuendo, style and grace,  radient in its genre.
0399142851|1.0|This was a very &quot;wordy&quot; book. There are entirely too many abreviations of agencies that actually don't make a difference in this storyline.

This was left in the  air........and, please get your facts straight...there are NO moving  sidewalks in the Atlanta airport!!!!! I travel there quite often.....I was  happy when it finally ended!

0399143904|1.0|Along with many of the other reviewers, I too was diappointed with Rainbow Six.  I'm a big fan of Clancy's earlier books but his work has been on the decline for some time now.  The battle sequences held my attention but the  rest of the book was a snoozer!  Poorly written and poorly edited.  And  what is up with the photo on the back cover?  Did he even serve in the  military?  What a poser!  Enough with the ego trip, try producing some  quality work Tom.
1573225517|4.0|This novel isn't about pop culture, steeped as it is in it. Countless musical references hold the narrative's events together and serve as setting, in that we're not given a whole lot of the kind of descriptive  passages you find in most other novels. But we know what record stores and  apartments like Rob Fleming's look like. This novel really is a  coming-of-age tale as the 35-year-old, single, British narrator turns the  corner into adulthood. It's as simple as realizing that people are about  more than their record collections and as complicated as navigating all the  emotional turns that Rob's heart takes in his on-again, off-again  relationship with his girlfriend.<br />Throughout, Rob is analyzing himself,  winking at the reader as he describes one shallow, obsessive act after  another. It doesn't come off as tedious navel-gazing, either; Hornby  handles it quite deftly. I don't read enough contemporary fiction to place  the novel properly among its contemporaries or to spot many influences, but  Kurt Vonnegut (who's name-dropped here) is an obvious antecedent, and all  the better for it. The chapters are short (35 of them in 323 pages) and the  type is set on wide leading, so the act of reading is helped by the book's  physical makeup as well as Hornby's engaging style. The dialogue is  wonderful, and it plays off the first-person narrative beautifully. He  drops in some wise observations that you have to admire.<br />Plus, I should  mention: It's really funny.

B000002C1X|2.0|Of all the grand doubleLP's by the great bands (like &quot;The White Album,&quot; &quot;Electric Ladyland,&quot; &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; and &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;), this is the most  bombastic, boring and absurd.  Roger Waters seems to have a Syd Barrett  fixation.  &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were  Here&quot; are either blatantly about Syd (&quot;Shine On You Crazy  Diamond&quot;) or hint at the pressures of fame and the insanity that fell  on Syd.  So Waters does a whole double album around this topic, and other  &quot;deep&quot; things that really just amount to music to go to sleep to.   Skip this vastly overrated album and go instead to &quot;The Piper at the  Gates of Dawn&quot; for the real Pink Floyd--i.e. the Syd Barrett album (I  don't have to recommend &quot;Dark Side&quot; because everybody has heard  it 10,000 times), or go to Waters' Pink Floyd masterpiece &quot;Wish You  Were Here.&quot;

630522577X|5.0|This is certainly a classic film that has been acclaimed and enjoyed for many years, but I think that the DVD version is wihtout a doubt the greatest presentation that I have ever seen of this &quot;Best  Picture&quot; winner.  From the very beginning, the clarity and purity of  the colors and images are really stunning.  You are able to examine even  the smallest details of the sets and costumes.  The commentary track is  another plus, as well as the bonus Audrey Hepburn vocal takes.  This is the  disc that convinced me that older movies can really benefit from the DVD  treatment (I bought it even though I already had the widescreen tape, and  it was worth it).  I would say that this is a great addition to a home  video library.

B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbath made history with its memorable guitar riffs and of course, Ozzy's unique vocals. And from the best metal band ever, comes the best metal CD ever done: Master Of Reality. Some people , when first listening  to this album, may think: &quot;what the hell are these acoustic songs  doing here?!&quot; But after some (very little) time, they'll understand  how genious those guys are. These acoustic songs create a kind of balance,  contrast, with the heavy songs like Sweet Leaf and Children,  making this  masterpiece even more enjoyable and magical.
0790732254|5.0|What a movie!  Martha and George--what a couple.  Taylor really puts it out.  Perhaps they aren't quite sane but what does that word mean?  The dark, clever games their minds play evolve with the movie.  They seem to  thrive on a comic form of cruelty.  Dennis is wonderful as the naive young  woman who just doesn't get much of anything.

630392753X|1.0|Judge Dredd is one of the all time classic comic-strips from 2000AD. The strip has moral ambiguity and a brutal view of the future, where the Law has to be instant and vicious. The Judges ARE the Law, there is no appeal  or higher authority.   Instead of pursuing this, the film ignores the whole  point of bothering with the adaptation and turns it into a generic cop  flick. Stallone removes his helmet, giving Dredd a character and  personality(just), where Dredd should be faceless and emotionless. He has a  'romance', strictly forbidden for judges. Worst of all he shows mercy and  compassion for those who break the law. The idea of Dredd disabling someone  who shoots at him is absurd, or as Dredd would say,&quot;The sentence is  death.&quot; There would be no question of Dredd's integrity because there  would be no evidence of him DOING anything else except Judging.    What  could have been a bleak, shocking, morally interesting action film has been  turned into a vehicle for Stallone's posturing and 'Star Power'.

630518299X|4.0|How many times do we feel like our privacy is being invaded when we become aware of hidden cameras, audio taping devices, etc. in our every day lives?  Well Truman Burbank brings it all home for us, and it's an eerie picture  that someday in the not too distant future, can easily become our reality.  With the age of science and technology which we're living in, who's to say  someone out there is not watching us as we eat our morning corn flakes or  take our evening bath?!  For all his goofy performances in the past, Jim  Carey impresses us this time with true heart and feeling for the role of  sweet, trusting Truman.  See this film, if not for a message, than just for  a look at &quot;the possibilities.&quot;
6305232660|3.0|I'll admit:  ARMAGEDDON is my all-time favorite movie.  For those of you who didn't like ARMAGEDDON (everyone is entitled to their own opinion), maybe DEEP IMPACT is more for you.  I enjoyed DEEP IMPACT because it wasn't  nearly as far-fetched as ARMAGEDDON.  I thought Morgan Freeman did an  excellent job.  Robert Duvall was outstanding.  However, I think this movie  could have done without Elijah Wood.  Another thing would be that this  movie started off very slow while ARMAGEDDON got right to the chase.   Hopefully, everyone can agree on this:  while DEEP IMPACT takes humanity's  destruction more seriously, ARMAGEDDON tends to take it more humorously  with some conflict appeal.  It just all depends on what you look for in a  movie.

While this book is not meant for the  beginner, it does give plenty of structure to help you organize your  approach to value investing. This approach has been used by many very  succesful value investors including Warren Buffet. A very worthwhile read,  and my personal favorite on the subject of investing.

0399143904|3.0|Tighter standards apply to Tom Clancy than to run-of-the mill authors.  By Tom Clancy standards, RAINBOW SIX is disappointing.  The entire first half of the novel is based on two untenable premises, 1) that a sudden increase  in terrorist activities would influence which of many competing companies  an Olympics security contract would be awarded to, and 2) that an  organization would spend 100 million dollars or so, sponsoring such random terror, when simply undercutting competitor's bids would be more effective.  Clancy's writing has achieved a high quality of excellence.  Characters  are evenly and appropriately developed for an action novel.  However, for a  Clancy novel, there isn't much action.  At times the novel is painfully slow paced.  The unnecessary repetition of philosophical an technical  points-frequently verbatim, or nearly so-gives the impression of sloppy  editing.

6304712936|3.0|A film comprised of the elements that make a handful of modern movies rewarding, and far more prevalantly, infuriating. No one can quarrel with  nothing less than glorious to behold; and add on-location shooting in  Mozart's own Vienna, for a prodigously authentic feel. Further delights  include even the undertaking of what originally seemed a very uncommercial  project; and Peter Shaffer's intelligent and intriguing portrait of  antagonist and protagonist. It also includes some of the more compelling  first-person narration--excellently done by F. Murray Abraham--seen in  quite awhile. These compensations are enough to recommend the film; but the  what's left fail to raise this film to another level. First, it's too long,  for what could have been a riveting, tight character drama; i.e., much of  the counterpoint is blunted by its flabbiness. More importantly (and  disappointingly) is the approach to the Mozart character. I fully  understand the intention to convey the character with the parallel of a  modern punk-rocker; as well as the fact that the viewpoint is  Salieri's--convinced that Mozart was some kind of sublime idiot. Even so,  why must the character and his relationship with others by guided with such  an unsubtle hand? If the film-makers had been content to make their points  by implication, it would have resulted in a much more persuasive and  satisfying film. Instead, everything is elaborately spelled out in a  gratingly coarse manner. I have always felt that the textbook illustration  of recreating the distant past was Fred Zinnemann's &quot;A Man for All  Seasons.&quot; Here, the crudities only offend and alienate the audience.  The caricaturization makes it tough to sympathize with the characters.
6300216365|4.0|Probably the best Woody Allen production pre Annie Hall, but like all his early films (and some latter) it is slightly uneven. The first hour is full of some of the funiest material and scenes he has produced. It is achingly  funny, but things taper of a little after that and the ending meanders a  little. All in all, first class Allen though
006097625X|5.0|Understanding Comics is without doubt one of the greatest books written on the subject of comics, and one of the best books written on visual communication. I got it back in '93 and used it as  part of Master's  thesis. This book is &quot;written&quot; in comic book format making the  explanations intuitive and practical. But, don't be fooled: This is a  serious book (and a lot of fun). I highly recommend this book!
0553573403|4.0|I came upon this series from disgruntled readers who had had enough of Robert Jordan's latest nonsense and recommended Martin's book instead.  I have to admit that this is the beginning of a potentially excellent series.  It does not have the grand scope of Jordan's novels (at least not yet),  but it makes up in its rich characters and truly unexpected plot twists.  Tyrion Lannister and Jon Snow were the most intriguing people in my  opinion; I can't wait to read the sequel.
B00000AFDW|5.0|I was a little apprehensive to buy the album because, after 20 years, did they still have the magic??? After a couple of listens, I fell in love! They really shine on the title track, &quot;Within&quot;,  &quot;Dreamin'&quot; and &quot;Journey Of 1,000 Years&quot;. The one weak  spot for me was &quot;I Finally Found My Way&quot;. This  &quot;Desperado&quot; sounding song sounds too much like a forced effort  for another &quot;Beth&quot; or &quot;Hard Luck Woman&quot;. Overall, if  you loved the Kiss of old, you can't go wrong!
0385484518|2.0|A sad story, yes.  Morrie was a terrific subject and his lessons are timeless. But, I have to wonder how Mitch Albom sleeps at night.  From all he &quot;learned&quot;, or allegedly gained from these &quot;Tuesdays&quot;  didn't he exploit Morrie just a bit?  Morrie encourages us all to live for  today, stop, enjoy the little things around us, LIVE, not just to work, to  make money, but LIVE!  I put the book down at times rejoicing in these  simple words. <br />How then, is it that Mitch Albom, one of Morrie's great  students, gets away w/writing his story?    What did/does he get but the  profits from a dying old professor?  Hmmmm....what did Mitch come away  with?  From the look of it, a bunch of dough.  <br />Yes, we're the richer for  learning a little about Morrie and of ALS but Mitch Albom is richer for  exploiting him, and apparently, not that much wiser for knowing him.
0440217563|5.0|I don't think I've ever been so eager to read a book as I was to read Voyager.  After being left with the cliffhanger at the end of Dragonfly in Amber, I devoured the third book to find out what happened to Jamie and  Claire.  This is the most humorous book of the series - both in Gabaldon's  exciting saga of our lovers' reunion, and in the way she makes fun of her  own genre.  I loved the scene where Claire is introduced to the typical  bodice-ripping romance novel while working at the hospital - what a great  bit of tongue-in-cheek humor!  And Jamie and Claire's antics as they try to  get some action while on the boat are truly hilarious.  While the  descriptions of boats and other such historical details were a wee bit much  (even for a history major and lover like myself), the story overall carried  me past that and into the world of the past like few others have done.
B000006GDB|4.0|Although the acting is fairly poor, the dialogue stilted, and the plot non-existent, this movie--as the Re/Search book &quot;Incredibly Strange Films&quot; notes--is about as close as one gets to the flow and feel of a  dream. I would attribute the mood to the bravura visuals--classically  composed still shots a la Peter Greenaway; planes of saturated color  winking on and off as characters move through a outrageous deco sets;  swooping lens movements worthy of Sam Raimi's  &quot;wraithCam&quot;--working in tandem with the gorgeous, occasionally  incongruous prog-rock stylings of ELP keyboard whiz Keith Emerson. Scenes  of great formal beauty are intermittently jarred by stabbings, immolations,  strangulations, eyeball-gougings, and rodent attacks, all fairly gratuitous  (just like in real life!), and Emerson's synthesizer flailings are equally  prone to erupt without warning--often to miraculous effect. The music that  accompanies one woman's taxi ride through the rainswept streets of Rome is  wild and offbeat and sticks with you, and the Gregorian finale--the  repeated incantation &quot;Suspiriarum, Lachrymarum,  Tenebrarum,&quot;  referring to the &quot;mothers&quot; (all of them witches) who cause the  film's mayhem--sounds like a rock opera version of Orff's &quot;Carmina  Burana&quot; (it's hokey, but trust me, it works!). I have also seen  &quot;Suspiria,&quot; but prefer this film on the level of pure, macabre  experience.
0061002860|5.0|I had read most all of Christie's books before I read this one and I still didn't see the ending coming.  It's not Shakespeare, but this is a great work of detective fiction and well worth the read.  I've read it several  times!

0380789019|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in ages.  I could not put it down and began to re-read it the moment I finished!  Neil Gaiman not only has a fantastic imagination, he has a great sense of humor and we are just  so lucky that he has decided to share both that and his amazing talent with  us.  I can't wait to read Stardust!<br />If you read one book this year - read  this one.  A magical, mysterious romp in a world you can only hope really  exists.  My next vacation is going to be to London Underground.
044022425X|5.0|Wow...after coming to the end of Drums of Autumn, all I could think was, &quot;There's got to be more!&quot;  Glad to hear that The Fiery Cross will be coming out, even if we have to wait awhile.  The fourth book in the  series is more thought-provoking than the other three, but it still makes  for a really good time!  I loved the beginning romance between Brianna and  Roger - hopefully this will be just as passionate and exciting as Jamie and  Claire's.  This book is really more about the Fraser family and how  mothers, fathers, and their children relate to eachother.  There's still  enough adventure and romance to satisfy, though.  These books have quickly  joined the ranks of my all-time favorites, and I believe they will someday  become classics of historical fiction.  I'm only left to wonder...what will  happen to Jamie and Claire?  Will they survive, and how will the newspaper  article be explained?  I guess we'll have to wait for the next book.  It  will be interesting to see what Diana Gabaldon does with the Frasers' role  in the American Revolution.  Can't wait to find out!
B000002GJ7|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite CD's.  It's the first time I've listened to Extreme, but it won't be the last.  The group sports a dramatic sound reminiceant of Queen.  They also have one of the most diverse types of rock  music I've ever heard.  They can be sweet and funny all at the same time.   A great buy.
0385493800|5.0|John Grisham has once again amazed us.  This provocative novel follows the death of a billionaire and distribution of his estate.  There are twists and turns at every corner with side plots and abundant, colorful  characters.  Rather than focusing on a sole character as Grisham has been  known to do in the past, in The Testament, he spreads his genius for  creating vivid, realistic and believable characters through the whole cast.   Grisham's description of setting in this novel is unique; you'll need to  read the book to understand.  If you read one book this year, pick up John  Grisham's The Testament.

I actually bought this book because the reviews it had received were fantastic but honestly, I was  disappointed.

B0000021S9|4.0|This is only truly representative live collection in Chicago's history. Including songs thru Chicago V, it is very representative of their live shows from that period, featuring Terry Kath's guitar prominently, and of  course the Chicago Horns! Except for the band singing 2 songs in Japanese  (Lowdown, Questions 67&amp;68) this set doesn't miss a beat. Particulary  good are Dialogue and Hit by Varese. If you want Chicago Live....get this  one
B00000BKI4|4.0|This is a dazed, gentle and full folk/rock recording. &quot;Opus 40&quot; sounds like a psychelicized version of David Seville's The Chipmunks doing a Band tribute. &quot;The Funny Bird&quot; is Neil Young's &quot;Danger  Bird&quot; with vocals by the hick Hollies. &quot;Endlessly&quot; wraps  breakups in a mystical magic. A kooky, charming and great record. The only  proviso is, if you don't like the high tenor, semi-falsetto, rustic choir  boy vocals, it might not be for your taste.

B000002J3W|4.0|Skid Row's &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; received very mixed reactions from the fans.  I have to say that this is understandable.  The album is more aggressive than their previous two albums, &quot;SKID ROW&quot; and  &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;.  The album has some beautiful and brilliant  moments.  I think the problem with it was it kept veering toward negativity  in the lyrics and occassionally launched a full frontal assault with the  guitars in a way Skid fans were not used to.  It may have helped some if  the songs had been presented in a different order.  The album starts with  &quot;My Enemy&quot; in which both the guitars and Sebastian Bach (Skid's  vocalist) growl relentlessly.  The lyrics are somewhat aggressive, for  example, &quot;You can be my enemy and I don't care&quot;.  It may have  been wise to ease folks in to the more aggressive songs by starting with  something like &quot;Firesign&quot;, which has a more familiar Skid Row  sound to it. Some interesting highlights to this album include &quot;Beat  Yourself Blind&quot;, in which Sebastian Bach is given the opportunity to  show his vocal diversity (although it is again not the typical &quot;Skid  Row&quot; sound) and Dave &quot;The Snake&quot; Sabo's beautiful ballad  &quot;Breakin' Down&quot;.  &quot;Eileen&quot;, &quot;Face Against My  Soul&quot;, &quot;Into Another&quot;, and &quot;Medicine Jar&quot; are more  like the style the Skid's fans were used to.  &quot;Frozen&quot; is  interesting nonsense.  &quot;Bonehead&quot;, &quot;Remains To Be  Seen&quot;, &quot;Subhuman Race&quot;, and &quot;Ironwill&quot; are bending  towards negativity again.  I still rate the album an above average four  stars.  It is a very good album, I think it just takes a little getting  used to.  The vocals and presentation are wonderful.  I think any Skid Row  fan who gives the album a chance will end up loving it.  In addition to  &quot;SKID ROW&quot; and &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;, fans of Sebastian  Bach's vocalscan hear him sing two of these songs plus a whole lot of  others on his new solo album &quot;Bring 'Em Bach Alive&quot;, live and  better than ever!
0790729989|5.0|If you loved this movie in the theatre, don't be shy about owning it in DVD or video. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was awestruck, and after watching it over and over again, the awe has not worn off. An  excellent and imaginative plot, intelligent and pithy dialogue, a perfect  atmosphere created by the music and the cinematography. Even Brad Pitt's  abysmal as usual acting can't ruin it. Morgan Freeman is as always  excellent, the kind of actor who can say worlds with just a look. But the  very best performance in the movie is Kevin Spacey's chilling John Doe.  With a mere twenty minutes in the end of the movie (and some brief  appearances before) he delivers one of the absolutely very best portraits  of a serial killer ever seen in movie history.
B000002W3R|4.0|This album is a fine effort.  Culled from recordings in 1976 and 1977, including songs that Elvis recorded at Graceland, it is a fitting finale to Elvis and his musical legacy.   The Moody Blue album is a bit stronger  effort than 1976's &quot;From Elvis Presley Blvd., Memphis,  Tennessee&quot;, his 2nd to last studio album.  Unlike the '76 LP, 77's  major studio/touring effort features songs that are intertwined with  meaning and impact.  From the haunting &quot;He'll Have To Go&quot;,  to  the personal &quot;It's Easy For You&quot;, this is a very personal album  indeed.  &quot;Moody Blue&quot; is a fitting title track and &quot;Way  Down&quot;, the album's biggest hit mirrors Elvis' drug demise only weeks  after this record's release.  Also, don't miss the cut &quot;Pledging My  Love&quot;, a remake of the old Johnny Ace tune.  Strangely, Elvis does  covers of Jim Reeves and Johnny Ace on this recording, both of whom died  young and tragically... just as Elvis soon would. This is a strong effort,  overall, and a very meaningful one too.

B000001FE0|5.0|&quot;Odessa&quot; is an album that I listen to over and over again. This, in my opinion, is The Bee Gees at their finest. I especially like &quot;Lamplight&quot;, &quot;First Of May&quot;, and &quot;Melody  Fair&quot;. This CD is for anyone who appreciates music. They don't make  'em like this anymore. Also recommended are &quot;Bee Gees 1ST&quot;,  &quot;Horizontal&quot; and &quot;Idea&quot;.
6303422020|1.0|Right when I started to watch this movie, and saw the &quot;Creep&quot; I thought it might be stupid.  The stories are pointless and boring.  The movie is like 1 hour long, so the stories are like 20 minutes.  The indian  story *****, the raft ****** but was better than the other two, and the  hitchiker story was very dumb and boring.  I recomend the 1st creepshow,  over this stupid boring  movie.

This is a must have for any Metallica fan; oh though, I must disagree with a lot of people here. I think  Metallica has been doing their best since this album. They had made great  albums then, and they are still making them good. I don't care what anyone  says. Sure they have a different sound now, but it's still great. If every  album sounded the same, then they would be boring. Anything Metallica sings  is great. They are great even when they suck. Get all the albums if you are  a true Metallica fan.
0385493622|5.0|I'm not a mathematician but I want to be one now! Mr. Singh is so good at expressing esoteric ideas in ways that enthrall and in displaying the dimension and sympathy in even the &quot;nerd's&quot; life that he could  surely make a book about nose hair read like a thriller. Yet, his book is  an example of why truth is stranger, more compelling and much more fun than  fiction. This subject has meat on its bones for anyone willing to take a  chance and peek under the skin. Reading for entertainment is fine, but if  one can learn about the world at the same time...WOW!
B000002U82|5.0|I'm one of those cases that just goes to show why this is one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) albums of all time.  I'm into '80s music.  I love synth-pop (Erasure), techno, Enya, New Age.  I wasn't even BORN when  this album came out and I hardly listen to anything else in this genre.  So  when I say that this is my favourite album, I am trancending all of these  obstacles.  The first I heard of this album at all was from a BBC show  called Only Fools and Horses, which used a 1 minute excerpt from 'Money' in  it's 3rd episode.  I asked my dad if he had heard the song before, and he  said it was from his favourite album of all time, Dark Side of the Moon.   He gave me a cassette recording he'd made from an old vinyl record and  after one listen, I agreed with him. Everyone I know has completely  different musical tastes but all agree that this is one of the greatest  albums ever.  If you don't have a copy of this, get one.  This is music  that can be appreciated by everyone.
B000001EYO|4.0|I haven't heard the album as a whole yet, but I'm an addict on the film.  And what I'm wondering is - where is the Creedence, man?  CCR defines this flick.  Where in hell is &quot;Lookin' Out My Backdoor?&quot;  Just  thinking of The Dude pounding on his roof of his car, with joint and beer  in hand has me rolling!  And it's because of the Creedence!
B000002LK1|4.0|This is the only Depeche Mode music I have heard. A friend who owns this CD happened to comment that my favourite band, Erasure, reminded her quite a bit of Depeche Mode.  I borrowed the CD and on the basis of this  comparison, I was a little disappointed at first, but came to enjoy this CD  in it's own right.  By far, my favourite song is 'Enjoy the Silence',  except it should have ended with the fade out before they sing the words  &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;.  Of the others, I mostly enjoy 'Personal  Jesus' and 'Halo'.  I actually dislike the last two songs though.  I was  interested to find out that Vince Clarke (of Erasure) used to be a part of  Depeche Mode in it's earlier days, and have ordered &quot;Catching  Up...&quot; which apparantly includes three of his songs.
0375403477|4.0|Just finished reading the book last night -- actually the wee hours of this morning.  Not as good as some of Clancey's others such as Clear and Present Danger and Debt of Honor, but it held my interest.  With the  exception of the book's climax, which I found riveting, the action  &quot;scenes&quot; were not as suspenseful as in previous novels.  John  Clark deals with the antagonists in his usual unique and creative manner at  the book's end.  Overall, Clancey fans will not be disappointed.
B00000273M|4.0|I can, unfortunately, only enjoy '80s music in retrospect as I was either too young to appreciate it part of the time and out of the country the rest of the time with not much more than Kenny G to listen to (shudder).   Somehow I have come to love '80s music anyway, and one song I particulary  like is the Bangles' 'Walk like an Egyptian'.  I had heard Manic Monday a  couple of times as well and thought it was all right too so I decided to  take a chance on this CD.  I was pleased to find that I got much more than  I had hoped for.  Besides a few tracks such as 'The Following' and 'In Your  Room' I enjoyed the whole thing.  My new favorite Bangles song is 'Eternal  Flame'.  I love it's harmonizing vocals.  Any fan of '80s music should add  this CD to their collection.
B000005ITX|5.0|I agree with all the five star reviews already written.  THIS ALBUM IS SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER MADE!  <br />This is one of the top three albums I have ever heard.  After 30 years this album still hasn't dated.   Its both an album representative of its time, and timeless in the music and  arrangements.  Lyrically powerful and perceptive,  particularly when  getting below the surface of some of the more seemingly ambigious lyrics.   The music is a perfect counter-part to the words -- and the songs hold up  so well (which is particularly good since you will find yourself playing  this over and over again).<br />This is truly THE overlooked classic album.
6305169187|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat, but at other times it made me cry.  The movie had an awsome cast, and only those people could have played those parts.  I also loved Ben Affleck in it.  It's my favorite movie!
6300275213|5.0|Who doesn't like a movie about a mermaid. This is a romantic comedy that will for sure win you over. I really recommend it.
0783225733|5.0|I find myself intensely interested in this tale because of the extras included on the DVD.  I watched the documentary, the Director's comments, Jim &amp; Marilyn Lovell's comments -- and ate up every word. This all  makes sense on DVD because it's more than just a movie -- it's true life.   A must-own for DVD fans.
630392753X|1.0|Judge Dredd is a symbol of justice, a man who is judge, jury and executioner.  He gives the creeps a warning then beats them up a lot, arrests them or just blows them away.<br />He does not stand aroudn striking a  poncy pose or takes his hat off after 5 minutes.  He clobbers people with a  night stick.<br />This film is a wasted license and possibly the worst big  budget action film for many years (not counting any Steven Seagal films).   If Judge Dredd did exist he would arrest the entire production crew,  especially the writers.<br />A waste.
0783226160|5.0|Okay, okay. I know we're supposed to watch only sophisticated films that better us, but here's a guilty pleasure that can't be beat! It makes one long for the old irreverence of the National Lampoon! All you can wish in a movie about college life: toga parties, a wild city street scene, half-naked girls, great 1960's music, even a dead horse! John Belushi is outstanding! Donald Sutherland is excellent as a professor. (As one myself, I can fully sympathize with his sentiments regarding Milton and students' reactions to same.)  Yup. This movie is crass and gross at times. Antisocially motivated. Appeals to coarse sentiments. But if you want uplift, get a Wonderbra!
0385484518|5.0|While many find this piece to be a bit maudlin, I found the book most thought provoking and poingnant.  How I wish that I could have spent time with the most influential man in my life, my father.  Unlike Morrie, my dad  was taken from me rather quickly.  Fortunately our affairs were in order,  but how I wish I could have spent the time with my father that Mitch spent  with Morrie. I would find it difficult for anyone not to enjoy this book.

B000002B7Y|3.0|Q:  WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU COOKED AND ATE THIS CD???  A:   YOU WOULD DIE.  Listen up ozzy fans around the world.  I don't know how accurate this source is but here goes.  I have heared on the internet that if you  take the first letter from every sixth line on this CD and put them all  together you will get a WICKED MESSAGE from LUCIUFER channeling his gospel  through the ozz man.  now I have'nt tried to decode this because I work 63  hours a week at home depot and my free time is spent on the internet trying  to find ozzy's home address so I can return the bloody sweat soiled towel  he threw in my face at the toronto 75' sabbath show in 1975 at toronto. If  anyone can decode this album please e-mail me with the HOLY GOSPEL so I can  quit my job and devote my life to spreading the word of OZZ.  Any way  this album rocks.  I like gettin' real drunk and listen to this CD full  blast until my rib cage starts to throb.  then I yell &quot;THATS OZZY IN  THERE ROCKING MY RIBS,  OZZY ROCKS MY RIBS!!!&quot; I keep yelling that  until all the girls at the registers at HOME DEPOT call management and get  me in trouble for scaring the custemers.  I dont care, I live for Ozzy,  Ozzy is life, LIFE is OZZY.  I plan on listening to Ozzy until I die  and at my funeral I have put it in my will that they have to play Mr.  Crawly as they are spreading my ashes over the baltic sea.  My  coworkers laugh at me for listening to Ozzy because i'm 65 years old and  have one leg.  &quot;Hey pegleg.&quot; they say &quot;bite the heads off of  any hawks lately?&quot;  They laugh now but on Judgement day only those who  have listened to this CD will be spared from the rain of fire.  BUY THIS  CD.

6300216268|3.0|I saw all the hype for this movie, so I rented it.  Although it is original and offbeat, that isn't enough to make it great.  The story (what there is of it) is sloooooooooow.  There were some laughs, but not enough  to keep me very interested.  It was worth renting once, but I won't be  buying it.
B00000G3PA|3.0|For serious movie buffs who like thought provoking films, Armageddon is clearly a bust.  However, for those people who are willing to suspend belief and just want a little fun from a movie, Armageddon is definitely  worth seeing. The special effects and audio were great on the DVD  version-although I do agree with some of the earlier reviews that complain  about the excessive use of Aerosmith throughout the film.  I found myself  chuckling quite a bit throughout with some of the one liners, particularly  Buscemi's.  The shove it down your throat patriotism at the end may have  been a little overdone-it's almost as if they were trying to fill time, but  we know that's not the case considering the length of the movie.  As far as  the acting goes, I give Bruce Willis pretty good marks, Liv Tyler was  adeqaute at best, and Willis' cronies, save Buscemi, were just adequate.   Ben Affleck was pretty good.  The film is definitely carried by the effects  and audio as opposed to the storyline.  But for this alone, I am willing to  go 3 stars - and willing to say its a DVD to buy.

0465068359|1.0|As a professional historian of East Asia, I appreciate Chang bringing the events of Japan's invasion of Nanking to a broader audience, but Chang let her personal bias and her youth/inexperience adversely affect the telling  of her tale.  The events are horrific enough that the reader does not need  to be hit over the head with Chang's inflammatory rhetoric.  Moreover, this  is not a forgotten event--I learned about it in 10th grade world history in  1967.<br />Chang's best contribution is bringing to light the diaries of John  Rabe, which with other eye-witness accounts are perfectly valid historical  sources.  However, Chang's insertion of herself into the narrative and her  inflammatory rhetoric seriously undermine her book on an important and  neglected -- but not unknown -- event. I am at a loss to understand why  this book has been lauded by a number of prominent historians.  Had she  been my student (or I her editor), I would have required her to write with  objectivity so the credibility of her account would not be subjected to the  kind of criticism I see in many of these reviews.
6303921248|5.0|It is not often that the movie does justice to the written word.  This A&amp;E version however is extraordinarily remarkable in capturing to an astonishing degree the different characters as one sees them in the mind's  eye while reading the engaging novel.  It is easily apparent that this  movie rendition has the passion, the hilarity, the intrigue and the romance  of the original to a great extent and will definitely not disappoint even  the most critical eye.
0380018179|5.0|If you like books which make you cry, read this one. I loved it.  The story seemed really believable and was really engaging.
6305013578|1.0|You really get what you pay for. This DVD of the German classic -- quite simply the first great science-fiction movie -- is almost unwatchable.  It's murky, scratchy, poorly framed, and features a music score seemingly  unrelated to the images on the film (take any classical CD and push  &quot;play&quot; while the DVD is running and you'll get pretty much the  same effect). Having seen a tinted print of Metropolis (the same print  Girogio Moroder used in his ill-conceived rock release of the film during  the 80s) with a live orchestra performing an original score, I almost can't  bear to watch this travesty. The DVD format exists so we never have to  watch transfers of this horrendous quality!  TRAITORS! (If it makes you  feel any better, buy the wonderful Criterion Collection version of  &quot;The Cabinent of Dr. Caligari&quot;.  Maybe Criterion will make a disc  of &quot;Metropolis&quot;).
6305263248|5.0|The car chases alone would be reason enough to watch this movie, but it is the little things that seperate this film from the typical Hollywood action genre.  The dialogue and cinematography are brilliant, but it's the  performances(DeNiro&amp;Russo)and the directing that put it over the top.  It's simply a thinking mans action movie. When my nails grow back I'll  watch it again. Don't miss it!
B000006PYU|5.0|Here is an amazing album with an amazing history. It begins as a tale of two musicians in the best of times and the worst of times.  The story starts with Mississippi Delta bluesman Robert Johnson, a fabled musician  who lived a haunted life. According to the most romantic of myths, he sold  his soul at a country crossroads at midnight in order to play guitar and  sing the blues. He died young at the hands of a jealous husband who  poisoned Johnson's whiskey, leaving behind but a handful of songs. The  legend of Robert Johnson has grown stronger---and certainly more  fanciful---with time, but there's no denying the astounding music that he  made, music that has influenced everyone from Muddy Waters to Eric Clapton.  And Peter Green.  Green grew up in England as Peter Greenbaum, a good  Jewish boy who dreamed of playing the blues. He may not have sold his soul,  but he was obsessed with music and practiced until he could play like the  devil. The young guitar prodigy made his name in the early, blues  incarnation of Fleetwood Mac before moving on to replace Clapton in John  Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Green's command of the blues won him renown equal  in the minds of some fans to Mike Bloomfield and Duane Allman. Peter Green  could bend the right note at the right time.  But Green's pursuit of  guitar star fame came to a troublesome end in the early 1970s. One story  states that he was spiked with bad LSD---a story uncannily akin to  Johnson's---and went off the deep end; other tales blame mental imbalance  or stress for his downfall. Either way, Green left the music world and  became a recluse; some accounts liken him to a character out of a Charles  Dickens novel, an unkempt wanderer with scarily long fingernails.  But  it's here that the stories of Robert Johnson and Peter Green diverge. Green  was staying with his friend Nigel Watson in the summer of 1995, when Watson  began playing a Robert Johnson song on his old guitar. The song struck  Green like lightning---or enlightenment. Watson's wife trimmed Green's  fingernails for him, and he picked up the guitar again. The result is this  new CD.  Beyond the story of Peter Green's music redemption through the  music of Robert Johnson, one of the things that makes this CD so good is  that Green doesn't try to ape the originals. Instead, he plays the songs  his way. Sure, there's Johnson telltale slide licks and copped vocal  inflections at times, but in the end, this is a Peter Green record.   The album includes covers of many Johnson greats, featuring Green and  Watson on slide and fretted guitar. Most of the songs are acoustic with  electric guitar added to some; bass, piano, drums, and backing vocals  enhance several cuts.  In the end, this CD not only has a history but  will certainly become a historic album.
6304546386|5.0|Errol Flynn at his best...swashbuckling at its best...action and adventure galore.  This film is simply the best of the genre.  The casting is perfect, from Flynn in the best role of his career, to Herbert Mundin as  Much the Miller's son.  The 3-strip color photography remains as vibrant  today as when it was released 61 years ago.  The dialogue between Flynn and  Oliva de Havilland, between Flynn and Basil Rathbone, between Flynn and  Claude Rains, is always lively, always fun.  And Miss de Havilland's  costumes are absolutely gorgeous, as is she.<br />The film moves, never stops,  and you are never bored.  If you watch this movie alongside Kevin Costner's  ill-advised Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, you realize why one should never  try to improve on perfection.<br />As the New York Times said in its original  review in 1938, this film entertains everyone from 8 to 80.  No argument  here!
B00000DC7J|5.0|Nuevo tanguero Astor Piazzolla's legacy continues to thrive even now, years after his death. Nonesuch has re-released Tango: Zero Hour, which is without doubt Piazzolla's finest moment. If you have not heard Piazzolla,  this is the place to start. His bandoneon playing was never better; his New  Tango Quintet was at its peak; and this collection of old and new songs is  like a greatest hits album with impeccable sound and dynamic arrangements.  Hats off to original producer Kip Hanrahan for masterminding the original  release and to Nonesuch for reviving it.
0790739909|5.0|Although I agree with others that the ending was a bit of a disappointment - I absolutely loved the movie.  It really makes you look at life in a brand new perspective.  If youre in the mood for a tear-jerker - definitly  see
0385493800|4.0|I am a big fan of John Grisham. I have read all of his books. I will agree that some are better than others. I think that this one is one of his best. I think too many people are comparing it to The Firm, though. It is a  different kind of story, and until you accept that you probably won't like  it. It has its slow moments, but it's all worth it in the end.
6305265488|5.0|I truly loved this movie.  So much so, that I saw it twice in the Theater.  I can't remember the last time I did that.  I can't wait to get a copy of the video in my hands.  Drew was charming and strong.  I really enjoy her  acting abilities and her ability to charm you with her expressions and her  coy ways.  Angelica was THE PERFECT wicked step mother.  No one could do  such a meany so well.
6305252521|5.0|I found the film to be thought provoking, yet in the same charming.  It is a must see movie, for those that enjoy a clean fun movie.  The move was funny &amp; sad at the same time.  Get ready for several twists and turns.
630416923X|5.0|This video boxset is worth every penney. It manages to last the time captivating you until the last chords of the final song in the set. The surviving members, accompanied by George Martin and Neil Aspinall give  honest and often humourous accounts of their years as 'the Fab Four' and  musical interludes bring the feeling of nostalgia. There is something here  for any body who has a passing interest in the group. The pop video for  'Free as a Bird' is a masterpiece.

0393312836|5.0|The right to choose, even if it means choosing evil, is one of the most important philosophical aspect of our humanity and society.  That is the point this book makes, and it is a point emphasized beyond all others in  the USA's Constitution, and the Bible as shown in the story of Adam and Eve  (they chose the apple and fell), some of the most important written  guidelines of human conduct.   The framework of the book is pure genius,  the invention of a new vocabulary forces all readers to truly enter its  world, taste it.  Concepts of the chapter division, vocab, mindframe of the  people, are all brilliant aspects of writing that provide new domains for  writers to explore, which they should.   The film adaptation should only be  watched after the reading of the book.
B000002KIE|1.0|please - rebel against the establishment, only to become part of the establishment. this album reeks of hypocrisy, and foreshadow just what length Mr. Lydon (Rotten who?) will go to for fame FROM the establishment  he is rebelling against. depressing. very depressing. buy The Clash or even  Gen X, but this album is terrible
0312954468|5.0|I found myself doling out the number of pages I read because I didn't want the book to end. I was mesmerized.  I have read the Seventh Scroll and hope there will be a third book on the same subject matter.
B000002UAO|5.0|&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is the Beatles' accidental masterpiece. Recorded in a hurry, it nevertheless showcases some amazingly concise pieces of songwriting genius, intelligent (and introspective) lyrics, new sounds, and  amusing parody of American soul music. The door was now firmly ajar for  further glories, though there are plenty of those right here.
044651506X|3.0|As a HUGE fan of DeMille's, I anxiously awaited an opportunity to read this book.  Once I had the chance, I was somewhat put-off by it.  Whereas DeMille's best works have a flavor of political intrigue (see The Charm  School and The General's Daughter) and strong protagonists, Plum Island  focuses more on local lore and a smart-mouthed NYPD Detective whom I do not  find compelling.  Fast, easy read but predictable plot with too many  wise-cracks for Corey.  Not a book I'd hugely reccomend, but wouldn't tell  people to avoid it either.

0671004107|5.0|Like one other reviewer, I don't know what the two one-star raters saw or experienced.  Maybe it was no monsters (except the traditional governmental bad guys.)  I got the movie on a whim after ignoring it for years.  What a  shock--it was fantastic.  I now own the movie and a hard-to-find hardbound  copy of the book.  What an experience.  Read, watch and listen to the book,  movie, and book on tape!!!!
B000002J1C|4.0|An excellent album indeed.  The arrangements of the pieces of music(its hard to call these mere songs.) are out of this world.  Much effort was put into the song-writing on this one.  The instruments( including the vocals)  blend in very nicely most notably Chris Squire's bass.  Six numbers on an  album may not punch everyone's ticket and sometimes it irks me a bit as  well.  However, Yes has put out a creative disc and it is a worthy  purchase
B000002UJQ|5.0|this is one of the most beautiful rock albums i have ever heard. in the 90's it is matched only by U2's Achtung Baby in both it's musical and emotional scope.
0679428887|2.0|Give Harris credit where it's due -- I spent almost 10 years in Moscow and he has certainly done his homework, setting the scene for what should be a gripping tale of what happened to Stalin's secret notebook. But the book  veers wildly off track as it approaches the climax and I hate to think what  Harris was smoking when he wrote the last few chapters. What a  disappointment
0920668364|5.0|To the lady who suggested that this book was about something other than the love a mother has for a child; you are wrong.  When she suggested that this book is a metaphor for sexual relations, you are demented.  If you  knew the story behind the book, I think you might open your eyes.
0553577123|5.0|I believe that this book is a wonderful reminder to me that even though I was not even born until many years after WWII, I must remind myself that it DID happen, and it affected literally millions  of people all over the  world.<br />I was 13 years old myself the first time I read this book, and it  made me feel very grateful that I was spared from the horror and loneliness  that these people endured for many years.  I highly recommend this book!!

0399143904|1.0|Rainbow Six proves that Tom Clancy is just going through the motions and living off the reputation created by earlier works. If you're interested in Mr. Clark, WITHOUT REMORSE is a far better read. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER  is also a better told tale than Rainbow Six. The characters are shallow and  poorly developed, the plot is totally implausable, Clancy tends to run on  and on for pages when he should be concise and surgical in his writing, and  the ending ... well, let's just say it stretches credibility to the  breaking point. IMHO, Tom Clancy has reached the end of his run. I've read  several of his most recent collaborations, and the same problems occur in  each and every one. For my money, Tony Hillerman is a far better writer who  says more in two paragraphs than Tom Clancy says in 200 pages. After  reading Rainbow Six I felt Tom Clancy had shown little respect for his  readers, and forced us to endure a poorly told tale for the sake of meeting  his obligations to his publisher. Too bad. The Hunt for Red October,  Without Remorse, Clear and Present Danger, and Red Storm Rising are the  definitive Clancy. Everything thereafter is pretty awful ... especially  Rainbow Six.

078322706X|5.0|Meet Joe Black is a wonderful movie about relationships. It investigates the depths of friendship, the intricacies of family--and that most special time of first love. It can teach even the most cynical about the wonder of  emotion, if they are not closed off or afraid to investigate how they  really feel.<br />Anthony Hopkins is, as always, stellar. As Bill Parish, he  is understandably stunned to realize his time on earth is up, but he gamely  tries to leave the world behind him a better place.  Brad Pitt is marvelous  as the easy-going man who becomes Joe Black. As Joe, Pitt has a difficult  job of showing a character uncomfortable in human form, but gradually  becoming more at ease, even coming to love certain things about being  human. At the same time, he is Death, an entity who rules us all and does  not accept interference from others. Pitt carries it off wonderfully,  giving Joe Black a sensitivity and caring we all wish for. Claire Forlani  is the weakest link. Her portrayal of Susan is just too soft, considering  the conflicts in her life: born into luxury and yet choosing a life as a  doctor (and not in some cushy clinic). Still, moments with her father and  Joe, help make us forget any inconsistencies.<br />Meet Joe Black is touching  and yet with surprising humor. Three hours may be a little long for some,  but that seems to be the trend lately. I saw it--twice--in packed theaters,  and nobody was restless. The soundtrack is super, and I'm counting the days  for the video.
B000002KHH|5.0|A masterpiece, outstanding, awesome, but not the best. Here we find Paranoid, Iron Man and War Pigs, the three giants in Sabbath's repertoire, but even though, I don't find it the best album. Maybe because it's the  most popular, the most played, the most famous. Remember that Sabbath is  not only this. Other masterpieces are Sabotage, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and  my favorite: Master Of Reality. However, Paranoid is the soul of Black  Sabbath's music. Get it as soon as possible.
1558908358|3.0|Very few films from my youth bring back such memories as Tron does.  I was always a Disney fan, although this particular film departed from the norm for them in many ways.    Disney has always been about timeless  stories, fairy-tells.  Tron was a step towards the future, not only in the  jaw-dropping special effects, but in the plotline.    This was one of  the first big movies that dealt with the idea of computers taking over the  world and some children's obsession with video games, which has grown even  more today.  Computers have almost taken over the world.  Look around you.   Computers are everywhere and have become an integral part of society.   Perhaps Tron's vision was not far off.  Some of the acting is cheezy.   Some of the plot a bit contrivedand predictable, but the special effects  and story were groundbreaking.  For any die-hard sci-fi fan, this is a  great addition to your DVD library.
B000002KE2|3.0|This is average Sabbath. The only song here that is awesome is Supernaut. This one deserving a place in the ranking of best Sabbath songs. I can't even remember of any other good track. So, if you can, go grab Master Of  Reality, Paranoid or Sabotage!
0679424741|5.0|BORING?!?!  Good heavens.  I read this book years ago (in high school) and I loved it.  I re-read it  recently, and found it even more beautiful.  It takes us to the meaning of loneliness and love in ways that other books  don't.  If you can appreciate works that pack a lot of meaning into the  limited actions of characters (It's not a thriller, gang) and ask the  reader to associate rather than merely see, you'll love this book.  My  favorite book is a toss up between this and To Kill a Mockingbird.
B000006ZPY|4.0|This is a little different from other Sabbath albums. Many people consider Tony Martin a bad vocalist. I like him, well, at least in this one, he did a great job! Much better than Tyr and Eternal Idol.
B000002H6C|5.0|This CD is Metallica's best work.  It has more feeling than the earlier albums, and more energy than the later, slower albums.  This CD has some of their best songs, even if the recording isn't that great.  (Also, James  doesn't do that &quot;Yeah-heh&quot; thing at the end of every line- a  definite plus!) If you want a doog Metallica CD, I suggest that you buy  &quot;. . .And Justice for All.&quot;
B000002KFJ|5.0|This is very near to perfection. Very, very near. Better than Paranoid, Sabbath Bloddy Sabbath and Vol 4 (but not better than Master Of Reality), this album is a must-have for any metal fan. Symptom Of The Universe simply  blows your mind away, not to mention Hole In The Sky, Megalomania and Writ.  Grab this piece of heaven (or hell, like they would prefer) as soon as  possible!
B000003BEV|5.0|People, how can you call this a rip off of the Sgt. Pepper's album?? You idiots, they are copying Magical Mystery Tour!<br />  Back then, everyone was copying the Beatles (e.g.. The Doors &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;). The  Beatles were paving the way for Rock 'N' Roll! But, the Rolling Stones had  a lot of good songs on this. 'Citadel,' 'She's a Rainbow,' '2000 Light  Years from Home,' and 'Gomper' are just a few. Get this album if you like  strange, surreal music.
B000002KET|4.0|This album has something special I can't define. Only that it's different from anything Sab had done before and after that! It's like... melodical, psychodelic, a little crazy. Although I prefer the old style. Paranoid,  Master Of Reality, and Sabotage are their real masterpieces.
B000001FDI|5.0|I really love this album since it shows how talented these musicians are. Eric showed his mettle in 'Presence of the Lord,' while Winwood expressed his beautiful voice in 'Can't Find My Way Home.' Don't forget Ginger Baker,  whose talent of drumming shines in 'Do What You Like.' BLIND FAITH is one  of my top ten Rock 'N' Roll albums of all time.
B000002KXV|5.0|Nothing can touch the quality of this CD.  Truly a classic that will endure.
078322172X|5.0|I saw this twice in the theatre, both times in theatres with lousy projection and terrible sound.  Finally it came out on video, and I could see it for the splendid work that it is.  A dark and twisty ride through  several shifting time planes, it rewards repeated viewings like few movies  of the 90s.  Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career,but even  a wizard like Terry Gilliam can't get blood out of the stone named Brad  Pitt.   A great movie. Haunting, funny, thrilling, ultimately moving.
0385484518|5.0|I had noticed this book on the bestsellers lists and thought it might be interesting. I probably wouldn't have gotten it for myself. I received the book as a Christmas gift and it was far more enjoyable than I thought. I  gave the book to someone and told them to pass it along when they were done  - that's the highest praise I can give a book.
079073382X|5.0|Here is a real treat:  a film about two students in Europe that is literate, witty, realistic and very romantic.  Celine and Jesse meet on a train. The two get off a Vienna to spend one night exploring the city and  each other. Time stops for one magical night as Vienna becomes the urban  version of Arden Forrest and Celine and Jesse fall in love.  This is real  Valentine's Day film.
0440219078|5.0|I am a college student who read this book for a Literacy Development course in Education.  It was INCREDIBLE!  I recommend it to adults as well as children.  Even adults can truly get a great deal out of it.  If your  child has a copy, borrow it right away!
0812550706|5.0|The story is very interesting and you cannot put the book down.  It is awesome!!
B000009O8A|5.0|THIS MOVIE RULES. IF YOU LIKE REVENGE MOVIES THIS ONE'S FOR YOU!!
0385493800|3.0|This one started out with a bang! I loved the idea of an eccentric billionaire and a fight over his will.  What I really didn't enjoy was 200 pages of traipsing through the jungle of Brazil.  I found myself skimming  whole chapters trying to find the story instead of endless details  regarding  swamps and boats and so on...enough already. It picked up toward  the end, and was still a page-turner, but could have been better....I keep  wishing he'd do another book with the depth of A Time To Kill....no doubt  this will be a great little action movie....Kevin Costner perhaps? or Mel  Gibson?  for die hard Grisham fans only....
0684833395|4.0|An excellent book that is rich with very interesting, yet simply real characters!  This book will keep you laughing but once you realise what you're laughing at, it makes you stop and think!<br />I can't give it the full  5 stars though because I found that it took some time to warm to this book  and this style of writing.<br />If you haven't read it yet I strongly urge you  do!
B000005Z0G|5.0|phat hardcore album..... just as good as any album  ever released......Pac was the greatest rapper ever......and the realest human ever 2 walk the earth
B000002LE6|3.0|Love this record. Sheila E's drumkit work, small horn section, great jams all over. BUT, the CD was mastered as one long track. That's right, no easy way to get to track 10 if that's what you wanna hear. And forget shuffling.  Prince made it so you must listen to the whole thing, in proper order or  not at all,
0790736942|5.0|The Exorcist is truly in a class of its own.  This film re-defines horror!  Films like &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; are like the Teletubbies in comparison!  After seeing this  movie, I was afraid to go to sleep at night.  I'm surprised the The  Exorcist wasn't re-released in the theaters for its 25th Anniversary  Special Edition.
6302800897|2.0|With the lone exception of &quot;Laura,&quot; (which was really based on another director's vision), Otto Preminger excercises in all of his films  an infuriatingly self-indulgant, pretentious, clumsy directorial style.  This grossly overlong, overblown, and over-praised melodrama is no  exception. With no sense of either incisiveness or cohesion, the issues  raised often seem to steer uncertainly between social comment and tabloid  sensation; thus, not standing a firm ground in either, one is left with a  puzzlement over just what the film is trying to say? Indeed, one suspects  that here Preminger is playing the yellow journalist. He sees to it that  the so-called &quot;controversial words&quot; are repeated endlessly and  reduntantly, to make sure all the world gets the idea that this film is  some kind of milestone; and to obscure the plot inadequacies. A talented  cast is also left floundering. Stewart was so commonly identified as the  &quot;All-American boy&quot;, that directors often took delight in casting  him in &quot;daring&quot; parts. That is certainly the case here, as the  role does not give him room to display all of his talents; but rather to  play the box-office draw. Even so, he survives the project better than  Scott, whose performance--though important to him as a career move--is  overblown. Really, the effort is there--all actors pull their weight--but  the equivocal treatment often gives no direction. If you don't give a damn  about the narrative line, then the performances may entertain solidly for a  while; but best do it on a lazy weekend night!
B00000ADG2|5.0|I drive better when I am listening to Lauren in my car, because I am totally relaxed!!
6305265488|5.0|i really liked this movie. it kicked ***!!!!!!!
B000002AH7|5.0|Being shamelessly ignorant about jazz, I actually heard of this album when Peter Buck of R.E.M. listed it as one of his &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.  I am so glad I bought it, it is staggeringly beautiful.
6305265488|5.0|This movie has the right combination of love, hate, humor, costumes, &amp; scenery. Drew Barrymore was the sweetest, yet strongest, Cinderella ever filmed. I have been waiting too long to buy this video!!
0141301104|4.0|I think the book &quot;The Witches&quot; is a very intresting book.  Even though it is againt some religions it is a novel so it is not going to make everthing true.  Roald Dahl is a great author.  I recamend this book to  ages 9-13.
B000002WYT|3.0|I really liked the song, Crash Into Me, which I why I got this CD.  I must say, however, that pretty much the rest of the CD is a dissapointment.  Okay, okay, there are a few other good songs, but basically, I just program  in that one track and listen to it over and over again.
6305265488|5.0|This film is exceptional. It is an adaptation of the beloved fairy tale Cinderella and captures the story exceptionally. The movie combines an excellent cast, vivid lines, and breathtaking costumes. Dougray Scott and  Drew Barrymore have excellent chemistry together and make the movie come  alive. You'll want to see this one again and again!
1573301043|5.0|Not only is this concert for a great cause, it contains extraordinary music. Celine,Gloria,Aretha,Shania,Mariah blend their unique style to create a unique mixture of excellent music. This is a must for every music  fan..especially women!! The performance of Carole King is exquisite!!!
6304539282|5.0|COOL trilog
B000002UZ4|5.0|The top-rated PSB songs, overall, spanning a half-decade or so.  Obviously a collector's item.
6302038324|4.0|If history were kind at all to Mary Shelly they would not try to say that she only wrote\\"Frankenstein\\" after spending a drug induced haullucinatory night with Byron Shelly et.all.Despite the obvious liberties  that hollywood has taken with this lady's life story this is a very well made  movie.The acting is very good-with the inter-personal relationships filling  in very well when the special effects are not keeping your undivided  attention.An extremely dark and physcolog-ically disturbing story line-it  is definately not a movie to be watched late at night by one's self unless you are  firmly grounded in reality.It is a movie that just wants todraw you  in and does so in such a way that you don't realize how deeply  until it's  almost too late and i found myself having to jerk  myself mentally back  to reality.As other reviewers have so well put-this is not a movie for  the faint of heart or physic.<br />  if you want to get a non-hollywoodized version of the story of mary shellys life you will need to go to your local library or look her up on something like \\"wikepedia\\" but all and all this is a very well made story and alot of the things they mention are true.
B000002JA8|3.0|This is probably my second-least favorite album (ALTERNATIVE being my least favorite.)  I've had this CD for over a year now, and I still wonder why I haven't gotten rid of it.  It's by far, the most overrated of all  PSB's albums, and very unmeaningful, talentless, and flavorless.  I wish  PSB never released this album, and I think that this CD is indicative that  they are losing their talent in producing quality music.  I recommend this  album to nobody, except a bored boy, cause this album is very...BOOORING...
0385493800|5.0|Grisham has returned to entertainig his fans when he writes and not for the movie revenue. I discovered several messages in this novel.  The first message centered around the Troy Phelan family; one of the richest families  in America, yet probably the most dysfunctional.  Another message centered  around Rachel (Troy's daughter).  She had nothing tangible, yet she was the  happiest, sincerest, honest, and most loving individual in the novel.  The  message:  Be kind to your family, with hard work,we can all become the  person we were meant to be if we have enough faith in God and in ourselves.   The character Nate proved this point by going from drug addiction to  becoming complete in himself<br />I'm anxiously awaiting his next novel.  Now  that Grisham enjoys writing for his fans rather than for the movie  adaptation, I'm sure that it will be an immediate best seller.
B000002UTK|4.0|While some of the songs on this CD drag on too long, they're still enjoyable, and fairly-well mixed.  I love the mix on this album of &quot;Always on My Mind/In my House.&quot;  Powerful and dramatic.  This is  a better than average PSB production.
B000002UDV|5.0|&quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot; Caroline, No &quot; are so beautiful, they almost bring tears to your eyes. A thousand years from now, people will still be listening to those beautiful harmonies, creative  arrangements,  flawless composition, and will be in awe of the musical  genius of Brian Wilson. If you love music, you will love this album,  because it is a work of love.
B000002U9K|5.0|This is one of PSB's most powerful, original, and talented albums.  Probably my favorite or second favorite.  There isn't one song that I don't love.  My favorite track is probably &quot;Two divided by Zero,&quot; even  though, for some reason, it seems to be one of PSB's less popular songs.  I  recommend this humdinger to any -&quot;chai.&quot;
B000000WA4|5.0|You've probably heard all of the hipe about mellon collie several times and the simple truth is that it's all true. It is one of the best albums you could ever buy. I love both CDs and listen to them non stop.
B000002USP|5.0|This is probably PSB's most 'danceable' album.  Virtually all the songs are very upbeat and emphatically optimistic,..if not, downright, enthusiastic...yet, undubiously, astonishingly, elating.  This is probably  tied with &quot;Please&quot; as my favorite PSB work.  Although, the songs  aren't as powerful, dramatic or well-thought-out as the songs in  &quot;Please&quot; they're still very enjoyable and ...&quot;fly.&quot;   The only people that I DON'T recommend this album to are lovers of the  genres of music of: alternative, rock and hard rock, which I deplore...
0385471483|5.0|Tita's fascinating journey will warm your heart and soul.  The poetry and imagery are stunning.  A must read!!
B000002UWL|5.0|Certainly, one of PSB best albums, and probably my 2nd favorite.  The songs aren't as 'lively' or 'danceable' as other PSB songs...their more serious and profound.  But the songs are very powerful, well-composed and  memorable.  This is certainly, a must-buy CD and totally reminiscent of PEt  SHop BOys at their climax...
B000002ULS|5.0|This is the only album I have heard that can truely be described as beautiful. It is perfectly formed, with the delightful and angelic voice of Stuart as one of it's many fine attributes.
B000002UD7|4.0|In a lot of ways, Pet Shop Boys oldest music is their best, and most powerful and meaningful.  Most of the songs on this CD typify these things, but there are also songs, that I don't care for and aren't as memorable.  I  rate this about an average PSB album; not one of their best, but rather,  one of their better ones.
B00000AFHM|5.0|I forgot to mention in my first review about their first album, TIGERMILK. If you liked &quot;If your feeling sinister&quot;, then you will love &quot;Tigermilk&quot;.  The original 1000 vinyl copies of the album now  fetch upwards of 250, so you can see it was a gem. I think it is due out  in June or July, so get your order in, or face life without this  masterpiece!! I only tell you this because I feel the words of Belle &amp;  Sebastian should be spread as if they were from the bible!
0679720200|5.0|I recently read this novel in my IB Junior English class. Half of the class hated it, and the other loved it. I was among the latter. This novel opened up new doors into the world of existentialism for me.  Meursault is  both horrifying and fascinating in his complete lack of  &quot;morality.&quot; He blew open the hypocrisies of his society and our  own.
B00000AFHM|5.0|Belle and Sebastian seem to trundle along in a little world far, far away from this one and are happy there. I only hope they continue to do so, so that all the B&amp;S haters out there do not infiltrate.  They don't care  about fame or reviews. They only designated 1 interview per continent on  their last tour, which is endearing, even if it was commercial suicide!     P.S I heard you played a gig in Glasgow this week. Please tell us in  future, because I never seem to catch you!
0385493800|4.0|I've read all of Grisham's books and I find great delight in reading one about an imperfect man who has failed over and again.  That he experiences an epiphany, against all odds is much more true to life than those who seem  to think this is impossible.  For those who find this unrealistic; I would  suggest you spend some time checking out the real world.  It happens!  I  find it a welcome change and nearly as good as my favorite Grisham, &quot;A  Time To Kill.&quot; We have enough books about slick, perfect people.  This  one introduces us to the selfish and selfless.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|Offspring is a good band they just really screawed up on this one pretty fly is the worst song I hav ever herd the only thing keeping this from a 0 is the kids are alright and get a job offspring should stick to the old  style and not try to be an mtv band save your money that is the best advise  I can giv you.
6305291489|5.0|I didn't want to see it at first, but I sure am glad I did.  This is the kind of movie everyone loves, makes you feel good inside.
B000006MS3|5.0|Kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth. The Dreaming was underrated when it was first released, but I think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time. This is a superb album, tracks like  Sat in Your Lap, Suspended in Gaffa, Leave It Open, Night of The Swallow,  Houdini, and Get Out of My House proving this point. Buy it and be  convinced.....
0871137380|5.0|An extremely well documented, minute by minute chronology of the chaotic and horrifying elements of combat that only a select few who have served in the military have experienced.  Everyone should understand how proudly and  heroically these &quot;young&quot; men serve their country.  They train for  combat, but seldom have to face it.  Once they have, most would prefer  never to do it again, but they do.  Read this account and you'll understand  the unmatched loyalty that makes them tick.  Read this account and you'll  understand what combat is all about, and how truly special these men are.   Thank God they're on our side!

B000001DTM|5.0|Don't listen to it in your car, or at a party, or while cooking, or watching TV. Lay down on the floor of an empty room where nothing or no one can disturb you, stare at the cieling, and do nothing but listen. It will  get inside you. It is unbelievable.
068484267X|4.0|Via his childhood memories, Frank McCourt offers a poignant, unflinching view of a poverty so grinding and oppressive as to certainly be almost unimaginable by most readers. Indeed, I had to frequently remind myself  that the years described were endured not in some pestilential  Victorian-era slum, but in the mid-1900's. My only criticism is the lack of  an epilogue to the story. What ever happened to the elder Malachy McCourt,  Frank's father, a devastating example of a life wasted by alcohol abuse and  a peculiar melancholy which is endemic, I suspect, to the Irish? And  Angela, Frank's mother, a sure candidate for sainthood if measured by her  daily struggles to keep her children fed and alive? I hope God blessed  Angela's ashes and rewarded her with riches in heaven.
B000002U82|5.0|Being a fan of Wagnerian opera, it is a rare and worthwhile experience to encounter a band who can blend their instruments so well (Gabriel-era Genesis being the only other).  &quot;Brain Damage&quot; is what made me  buy this album; the use of alliteration (&quot;the paper holds their folded  faces to the floor&quot;) is rather catchy.  This is an album I'd give to  any teen opera fan.  It has the intensity of Der Fliegende Hollander, but  in English.
0140177396|5.0|This book shows that sometimes you have to do something that is hard to do, but in the end it will work out for the better.  It shows that there are two types of people in the world, the compassionate one and the  ignorant ones.  It had many strong themes, and I loved it!
B000002MIF|5.0|This is by far the best (early) work put out by The Smiths. This album has a sound to it unlike any other Smiths record in their catalog mainly because it is a compilation album that was compiled from several different radio shows in the UK. It is in my opinion a definite must own and captures The Smiths in their rawest under-produced form. Even though this record came out in 1984 it still sounds as fresh and unique today as it did way back then. No one else has a sound quite like The Smiths *****
0140186409|5.0|This book, was slow reading at first but the way that John Steinbeck portrays themes through the memebers of the Joad family is an extremly fine knit work.  This book was flawless, It opens your eyes to the immense  desperation of the time.  If a book can change you life, this one will.  It  makes you realize what you have, and take for granted.  Even something as  simple as a toilet, a place to stay and food to eat.  The themes that are  portryed in this novel are strong and clear, I recomend this book to anyone  who has an open mind and a love for literature.  But to truly understand  it, you need to read between the lines and analyze it every step of the  way.
1881273156|5.0|I am the Director of Counseling at a Church near Charlotte, NC. and have been using this material frequently in counseling and in pre-marital instruction.  Presently I am using this material as the foundation for a  Marriage Worshop planned for April 1999.  I urge other counselors and  pastors to look into using these materials for similar workshops.  The  viewer's guide has a section dedicated to setting up a workshop.  Praise  God and thanks to Gary for this wonderful work.
6300189821|5.0|That is the only reason I can think of for giving this movie a bad review.  This movie was absolutely fantastic.  I love every thing about it.  You people who write these professional movie reviews ought to open your eyes  when watch the movie!  Anybody who hates this film ranks right there with  all of those people that thought that Boogie Nights deserved an Oscar. If  you want to see a good movie that can make you laugh and touch you at the  same time, then watch this movie.  It has great acting, great comedy, and,  despite the &quot;professional&quot; opinion, a heartwarming plot.
1558216847|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  The best part about it is the contrast between the insane society under totalitarian Stalin and the compassionate society seen in Tibet and Tibet-influenced Mongolia and Buryatia.<br />Now, as  to the truth of the account: Some aspects of the book ring true:<br />1.) As  someone who has walked over 2000 miles in a 6 month period, I can say that  the distances covered in the book (20-30 miles/day) are reasonable.   2.)  Descriptions of Tibetans, Mongols &amp; Buryats ring true with my  experience &amp; knowledge. 3.) Description of incarcerated life seems  quite real &amp; perhaps is hard to fake in detail.<br />However, some things  don't quite jibe: 1.)  I'm told its almost impossible to live beyond 3-5  days with out water.  (Weeks with out food is not problem however) 2.)   What about the other members of the journey. They could not go home so they  are in free countries with free media who would be glad to tell their tale.   Especially the American (conveniently named &quot;Smith&quot;) would have  come to light by now, unless, of course, he really was a spy.<br />The most  likely scenario in my opinion is that some sort of escape through Tibet  took place, but that the escapees were much less innocent than described in  the book.  Some of the escapees may have died in other ways, and indeed  Russians may have been killed by the desperate prisoners to avoid capture.   Note that when the woman is discovered, the prisoners initially say  &quot;we will have to kill him&quot;  Something like this may have happened  in real life.<br />In spite of likely creative remembering above, in the end  we should probably let bygones be bygones and appaud Rawicz for  (rightfully) pointing out the sad fate of fogotten Poland at the hands of  communist invaders.  His cry for freedom is as applicable today as in 1941,  especially when we consider the genocidal repression under which Rawicz  benefactors, the Tibetans, now live.<br />One Irony, had theprisoners chosen  to enter Lhasa (as I think they should have) they might have met up with  fellow escapee Heinrich Harrier  (author of &quot;Seven Years in  Tibet&quot;)....

6303269826|4.0|If your wanting to see a truly accurate portrayal of Wyatt, keep waiting as it hasn't been made yet (and knowing Hollywood it never will). But seeing Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday is worth it alone. I've  heard people say this is more accurate than Tombstone but each movie has  about the same amount of goofs. It's incredible that a movie made on an  epic scale couldn't figure out a way to show Virgil and Morgans' shootings  on different nights! (They happened three months apart)
B000002HIK|5.0|This CD has some kickin tunes on it. Track 11 is an awesome one to cruise to.
0345423496|2.0|Author Arther C. Clarke exhibits a wonderfuly vivid look into tomorrow with outstanding concepts and ideas that when really given the time to think about, make sense.  However, I believe Mr. Clarke looses track of the  story many times, and when he finaly gets back to the point he tries to  make, he does it in a quick like gesture.  Overal, a disapointing book to  end the &quot;Odyssy&quot; series, but a marvelous look into the third  millineum.

0930289234|5.0|This is a masterpiece. Alan Moore proved to be a demigod after this work. The art is superb.<br />If you are interested in comics or just want to read one of the best stories of all time in any type of medium, you must read  this book.<br />There are added extras in this trade paperback. After each  issue, Alan Moore added information that helps you appreciate the Watchman  universe even more.<br />This has to be one of the best comic series ever.

0784010528|4.0|While the movie in VHS was very good, the DVD edition flat blew me away.  The songs sound terrific and the scenes are crisp and sharp.  Excellant choice for your library.
B000002UDB|5.0|I found the Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour to be one of the best CD's that I have ever listened to.  It has great hits such as Magical Mystery Tour, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, and All You Need Is Love.  It also has some  great songs that I never heard like Your Mother Should Know.
6303972810|5.0|exelent movie i love the plo
B00000DFSK|1.0|I agree with many of the previous reviewers - producing a greatest hits CD of a great band - and using shortened versions of the original songs is simply unforegivable! You have one chance to do the CD right - and in this  case, the publisher blew it - big time. Definitely the most disappointing  greatest hits CD I have ever bought. Do not buy this CD.
B000002MTU|3.0|Like &quot;Malted Milk&quot; on Unplugged, Clapton here is copying, almost note for note, blues greats.  There it was Robert Johnson. Now it's mainly Freddie King.  The beauty of the blues is that evryone has covered  everything - but always in their own way.  I don't see any of Eric Clapton  here.  In truth, this wasthe first blues album I ever bought.  It was my  entre into the works of B.B., Freddie and Albert King, Muddy Waters, the  Wolf, and earlier acoustic pioneers.  But this album isn't The Blues. It's  a tribute to the Blues.
6304167660|5.0|This movie has every ingredient of a great film!  The emotions that you go through just watching it are very sincere and it is worth every moment! The actors' performances are Oscar-worthy (even some actors that you typically  can't count on).  Call it a chick-flick or what you will, but this movie  should be seen by every person between the ages of 18 and 65!
6305229449|5.0|I bought animated Disney movies long before I had a daughter to buy them for.  This movie is a prime example of why I did. The money I spent on Mulan is the best investment I've made in several years.  The music is  strong and beautifully done. The characters while drawn in a simple and  graceful style are detailed and very memorable.  The voice talents were  impressive, but it is the caliber of the co-starring and bit player parts  that impressed me the most.  James Shigeta as Shang's father, Pat Morita as  the emperor, and George Takei as the first ancestor were as entertaining  for me as Mulan and Mushu themselves. I write for a living and I only wish  I had as talented and lucky a cricket to help ME.  My daughter watches this  movie constantly and I pop in whenever I hear a song coming up.  This one  will be watched over and over again in our house.
6303942830|5.0|Incredible soundtrack, lush cinematography, awesome story. I especially like the &quot;fierceness&quot; of the love between Hawkeye and Cora; beautiful honor and integrity (reminds me of William Wallace and Murron in  Braveheart...).
B000002ADT|5.0|This is the CD that truly immersed me into the world of recorded jazz.  I had always shied away from Miles Davis, largely because I was only familiar with his later works.  But on the tip of a friend, I took a listen and was  instantly hooked.<br />This is the jazz CD everyone should own.  And trust me  - once you listen, you'll be hooked too.
6302482631|5.0|I own an copy of the original script, own the black and white version of the movie, and have various posters, etc. celebrating this movie. Having said that...you owe it to yourself to see this movie with no car  crashes,just really good writing, and brillant acting from all parties.It's  so much more than a love story.Good plot,script,director,and actors. The  set would not win any awards today,but still worth the bucks to rent and  see for yourself.
B000001FS3|5.0|i really must say that i feel bad for people who don't like or more importantly don't get u2 . it's quite simple. u2's music, especially joshua tree, is invigorating and exhilerating. after hearing the joshua tree one  becomes a better person. p.s. sorry if i spelled anythign wrong
6300151379|5.0|This was the most amazing movie that I have seen.  David Bowie was excellent in it an Jim Henson did a great job on the puppets.  If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!!!
B000000WZ4|3.0|This cd is pretty good although it gets old fast. There are only a couple songs you'll want to here again after owning it for a week. I wrote this review since most people only write when they think a cd is either awesome  or *****. I think this one is in between. Best song &quot;It's no  good&quot;
B000002H6C|4.0|This is a good CD but I fail to see how it's Metallica's best.  A few songs on this album can be considered in the same league as the songs on Lightning and Puppets.  These are \\"Blackened\\" (the best song on the disc  &amp; one of the band's best), \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", \\"One\\" and \\"Harvester  of Sorrow\\".  The others are good, but substandard compared to the likes of  \\"Creeping Death\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\".  Overall, the sound of this album  suffers, probably from the production.  There's something about the sound  of the guitars that doesn't sit right with me; they're a bit muddy  sounding.
6303921248|5.0|terrifi
B000002H33|5.0|<br />Every song on this album has something dark and sinister to offer, except perhaps the brilliant instrumental \\"Orion\\" and even that has a haunting quality to it.That's not to say that other Metallica albums aren't  dark, but Master of Puppets is the most unrelentingly so.<br />  Kill `Em All  speaks of war, revenge and the Apocalypse but does it in an almost too  simplistic manner and takes time out from its wartorn visions for a couple  of songs that extoll the band's musical stance and the rush of playing  &amp; experiencing a live show (\\"Hit The Lights\\" and \\"Whiplash\\") and one  song, \\"Motorbreath\\" that basically says live life fast and hard, while  another, an instrumental, demonstrates the wizardry of late bassist Cliff  Burton; not terribly dark if you think about it.  Ride the Lightning is  dark, but also somewhat passive, whether foretelling our doom through  nuclear holocaust (\\"Fight Fire With Fire\\"), screaming about being \\"strapped  in the electric chair\\" (the title track), despairing over having \\"lost the  will to live\\" (\\"Fade To Black\\"), being cryogenically frozen (\\"Trapped Under  Ice\\").  It even has one life affirming track: \\"Escape\\" (sort of an  antithesis to Fade To Black).  Its most agressive tune is simply (albeit  ferociously) retelling a biblical story (\\"Creeping Death\\")  The 4th album,   And Justice for All, while drearily and cynically commenting on the ills of  society, with its lamentations on environmental destruction, censorship,  madness and the horrible consequences of war and similarly takes a passive  stance (I'll refrain from comment on Load and Reload since I can hardly  remember a handful songs from either). <br /> But with Master of Puppets,  Metallica reached their darkest peak.  On the opening track \\"Battery\\",  singer/guitarist James Hetfield sings of a war tactic as the agressor, not  as something someone else is doing.  The awesome, quintessential title  track also speaks in the first person, personifying drug addiction.  \\"Disposable Heroes\\" chillingly comments on the dehumanization and, well  disposability of soldiers during war, whether from the point of view of the  martial authority (\\"bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say; finished  here, greetings death, he's yours to take away) or the combatant himself  (\\"I was born for dyiiiiiiiiiinnnng!)  Televangelists are regarded as an  insidious disease in \\"Leper Messiah\\".  The last song, \\"Damage Inc.\\" has  cruel visions of \\"crushing all\\" and \\"damage jackals ripping right through  you\\"; the lyrics are almost cartoonish in their frankness and are hardly  meant to be taken seriously (I think), but the song is no less sinister for  all that.   <br /> Even when the album delves into a fictional topic among all  its commentary on real-life horrors, it manages to be chilling.  \\"The Thing  That Should Not Be\\" broods on a Lovecraftian nightmare, a dark god, come to  destroy or enslave the world.  And on \\"Welcome Home\\", the passive becomes  aggressive as a sanitarium inmate details his and his fellow inmates' cruel  mistreatment at the hands of the establishment and then goes on to plan a  desperate, violent escape. <br /> Master of Puppets could very well be a theme  album, as the album title seems to apply to several songs.  The title track  speaks for itself, of course but the \\"Disposable Heroes\\" are the puppets of  the \\"War Pigs\\" (in the words of Black Sabbath); the album's cover depicts  this.  The \\"Leper Messiah\\" could be considered the master of all the  puppets he managed to brainwash into giving him money and adoration.  And  you could, in a fit of imagination, perhaps stretch the definition a bit.  \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" is the master of the puppets who seek to  conjure him and the rest of the world, if they succeed.  Perhaps the  inmates of Sanitarium are the puppets of the establishment - until perhaps  they tear off their strings and wrap them around their \\"masters'\\" throats.  <br /> But I'm probably getting too carried away here.  Let me end by saying  that Metallica's darkest album is also arguably its best.  The sound itself  is dark and ominous and perfectly accentuates the lyrics and perhaps most  of all, by Hetfield's voice which has never sounded spookier, especially on  \\"Battery\\" and \\"Master Of Puppets\\".   There's more of a sense of intimacy to  this record.  The album just succeeds, through great music and lyrics, to  draw you into its darkness.  You become a participant instead of merely an  observer.
0393314804|5.0|What a cool, modern, intense combination of light and dark. As an American, I was discouraged at first by the thick Scottish dialect and this is why I think some people wouldn't stick with it, but the minimum amound  of perseverance needed to get into the rhythm and colloquialisms of the  speech is well worth this book. While some scenes are just plain black  (heroin use is portrayed extremely realistically and tragically), some  other parts are absolutely hilarious. I laughed out loud several times.  Very enjoyable and a great piece for my generation.
B000000WFU|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've ever bought.  I listen to it all the time!  It's good to listen to when you're feeling down or want to relax, because the music and the voices are very uplifting and soothing.
1573226521|5.0|Alex Garland has succeeded in writing a modern day &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; that is an original in it's own right. What &quot;Rent&quot; has done for Broadway, this book does for literature.  I would dare to say  that it is the only true classic to emerge in this decade and will surely  be part of the reading list in every Modern Literature class for the next  century.
0380977281|3.0|This book has a lot of potential, but it didn't seem to quite reach it. Great ideas for the characters and all, but none were really followed through. Each character had his or her own little story, but none of the  stories were elaborated on very much. Example: Tristran walks a six month  journey in a night, fine, then he has to walk back. Well he does, but it  really doesn't seem like too much happened to him. He did a lot of things,  but each was just a quick little episode. They could have been more  detailed, and the transitions between them were unclear. Ok, so I'm  cynical, but I've definitely read better. Still, it was a very cute story.  Good for reading to littler children ( but, um, you might want to edit out  for a couple of sex scenes before you do). Not for serious fantasy and  sci-fi readers, though.
B00000FCBC|4.0|Mettallica's Garage,Inc. is worth the money if only for their rendition of &quot;Turn the Page&quot;....  Disc #2 is the best of the two....
6302482585|5.0|This movie has all the elements of a classic.  It's romantic, smart, and well-written.  Even if you're not a fan of love stories, you will appreciate how well made this film is.  Bogart's performance is one of the  best ever in a movie.  The music and words come together to create what may  be the best film of all time.  You won't be disappointed.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Of course disc 2 is a great collection- only sad that most band-wagon-Metallica-fans (Black album or later) think these are new covers.
B000002LCB|5.0|GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!!   A great sound track to an excelent movie. Loved it from begining to end. Good thing CD's don't go bad like vidioes or I would have to buy 2.....
B000002TYX|5.0|I guess it's a measure of the age of the Beatles- or the age of their fans- that this album is so popular! Of course, every fan should buy it, as it completes the picture of the Beatles as they rose from being just one  more talented English Invasion cover band to become the greatest pop band  of all time.<br />Forget &quot;Free As A Bird&quot;, the most over-hyped song  of the decade. It stayed in the can for a good reason- it's not one of  Lennon's best, not by a long shot. Instead, enjoy the early performances of  cover tunes like &quot;Three Cool Cats&quot; (my personal favorite!) and  the exciting performances of their first compositions. It's a chance to  relive the beginnings of Beatlemania for all you middle-aged fans out  there.
B000002WYT|3.0|I only bought this album because for some reason I thought that it had the song &quot;What Would You Say?&quot; on it. It didn't, but I wasn't totally disappointed. It did start off well with &quot;So Much To Say&quot; which  is a decent song. &quot;Two Step&quot; was even better (the best song on  the album). I must admit that &quot;Crash Into Me&quot; is a pretty good  song and &quot;Too Much&quot; is also alright, but then, the album seemed  to go into a six song series of album fillers and songs that were down  right annoying. &quot;Tripping Billies&quot; (Track 11) was the only really  good song after &quot;Too Much&quot;. I guess &quot;#41&quot; wasn't too  bad either. Overall, there are just too many bad songs on this album,  &quot;Proudest Monkey&quot; being the worst. &quot;Under The Table And  Dreaming&quot; is a much better album.
B000002H33|5.0|This is one of the albums for which the XX century will be remembered in the long run. A true legacy of our time.  By the way, there is a mistake in the review by the &quot;official&quot; critic, Genevieve Williams, posted  by Amazon: The song &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is not about people who  abuse their power; it is about cocaine consumption.  Cocaine is the master,  and cocaine-users are the puppets...  just read the lyrics again and you'll  see: &quot;chop your breakfast on a mirror&quot;... etc...
0312853254|5.0|I can't emphasize enough the strength of this book. <br />Sci-fi is merely a backdrop for issues that are firmly rooted in the human condition. Issues like otherness, truth, good, evil and the daunting implications of  embracing our humanity.<br />Card wisely casts his narrative's light on our  capabilities rather than our virtues/foibles. In that way, he is better  able to convey our human complexion in its totality. Blemishes and all.  <br />By confronting us with this wide range of possibilities in this manner,  we are forced to reconsider many of the conventions that we've clung to in  trying to make sense of our world. That exercise triggers profound,  sometimes disturbing, questions. Overall though I found the exercise to  have a clarifying, cleansing essence.<br />This is a fascinating, intriguing  read.
B00000I2R5|2.0|Don't waste your money on the ENHANCED version of this CD.  The normal CD already is enhanced, with a Sony music extra (videos + stuff).   Besides, Americana is not worth the money.  Their sellout CD's (Americana, Ixnay on  the Hombray) suck.  So go for it, be a man, and buy the real Offspring, the  hardcore punk, the best albums - Smash, Ignition, and The Offspring
6305297525|1.0|I saw the movie on an American airline flight to  Vancouver form Dallas. I was not impressed.  The  basis for the story line/plot gave me real problems and I am not a Christian Fundamentalist.<br />Once the movie lost me  on the setting, everything else was downhill.
B000002HMH|1.0|If you compare it to all the garbage that is always being played on the radio or eMpTyV, this album is not that bad. But if you compare it to the work that this band did in the 80's, this is absolute trash!!! Long gone  are the days in which MetallicA was one of the top 5 music acts in the  world. It's very, very sad... :(
6300215717|5.0|Instead of the commoner becoming the princess, the princess escapes the drudgery of royalty and becomes a commoner for a day, The princess discovers the simple joys of life (including, a haircut, ice cream and  romance) with a cynical newspaper man in the eternal city. Peck and Hepburn  were never better. This is classy entertainment.
B000000I02|5.0|Richard Sinclair was my favorite member of Caravan, and the band was never the same after he left to form Hatfield.<br />The whole family tree which grew from the Canterbury groups (Soft Machine and Caravan) made their best  records at a time when jazz was going nowhere and jazz-rock had collapsed  into fusion-funk.<br />I recommend that the neophyte start with Caravan's  &quot;If I Could Do It All Over Again&quot; and Soft Machine's &quot;Volume  Two&quot;.  If you like those, then bump it up a notch for Hatfield and the  band it became, National Health.
0385493800|2.0|At the beginning of TESTAMENT we become enthralled with Troy Phelam, his billions and his death.  Unfortunately, his heirs are not that exciting and their lawyers even more dullwitted.  Enter Josh Stafford and Nate O'Reilly,  the decease's high paid attorneys. Josh plays a small part.  He is in  charge.  He is friend and protector of Nate.  Nate, newly released from  rehab is sent to Brazil to locate the missing heiress.  In his quest he  fights his own demons and realizes true enlightenment through sickness.   His Brazilian adventure is the best the book offers.<br />Unfortunately, Nate  arrives back in the States with personal worries and no heiress.  This  situation boils down to a slow, uninteresting account of the greedy  siblings legal actions to contest the will. <br />I found the balance of the  story to be dull and uninteresting.   It's a shame Mr. Grisham couldn't  find a way to continue the heiress and really add some zip and excitement  into the lives of the other characters.  As a true fan of Grisham, I read  the entire book in hope that he'd surprise me.  I'm sorry to say--he did  not.

6305095442|5.0|A film I cite as one of the top inspirations for becoming a filmmaker, ED2 is one the best examples of a creative mind.  And the DVD is one of the finest transfers I have ever seen. Maybe too good, as sometimes ghosting  would be very evident.  But the colors are excellent and it looks as if it  was filmed a few years ago instead of almost 15 years ago.  A must own for  any horror enthusiast with a DVD player
1561385107|5.0|This book is simply one of the best things ever written in the english language.  Everybody should own a copy of this book because, after all, it is still the orginal source for much of the fiction written to this very  day.
0792152328|1.0|what a awful movie.  Hollywood has gone to far
B000002IU9|5.0|Manowar....well what can I say. They are one of the best. I've been listening to them since 1991 and when Triumph of Steel came out I just ate it up. With those killer guitar riffs and monster drumming, they just take  you long with them, to their world. You have no choice but to go along. The  only other groups that I think come close are Candlemass and Obituary. They  all make you want to go out and kill all those poser metal bands. They make  me sick. HEAVY METAL OR NO METAL AT ALL.

B000000WFF|1.0|I really want this band to shut up!  Their music is so lame!  Don't buy this CD!
B0000024ZT|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to Springsteen.  I picked it up 20 years later and was amazed at how well the work has stood up.  &quot;Growin' Up&quot; is every teen rebel's theme song, &quot;For  You&quot; is for that crazy one who broke your heart, &quot;Spirits in the  Night&quot; is one of the finest party songs ever written and worth the  price of admission by itself.  If you doubt that Springsteen is a poet, try  this one.  If you want to see the young Boss at his best, ditto.
6302293553|5.0|The best film in the world ever, not to mention the funniest as well. Those who do not apreciate this film have no sense of humour. Pure genius.
0824940962|5.0|There are 28 editions available on this webiste alone for the familiar&quot;A CHRISTMAS CAROL&quot;. The one illustrated by Russ Flint, published by Ideals is the one I recommend. Unique, brightly designed  layout is a nice change from the usual classical  and somewhat gloomy  approach. The huge yellow &quot;BAH HUMBUG&quot; is just right.
B000002TQV|5.0|This easily is the best album Radiohead or any other band has had! Amazon should give this CD more then 5 stars ! More like *********************************************************************************'s.  &quot; The Bends&quot; has my favorite musical part of the album. Where  Thom is singing and you can only here the drum in the background.No wonder  it was one of the best albums of 1995. GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385493800|5.0|In my opinion this is Mr. Grisham's best book yet. The story and the characters are very believable for I have met such people in my lifetime.  The descriptions of Brazil were fantastic.  I could empathize with Nate--I  don't like snakes and gators either.  Very well written and I couldn't put  it down.  Loved the happy ending.  Man lost self, man finds self.  Need  more books like this.
B000002NJS|2.0|The singles were catchy, but the rest is just that.  William Orbit's backgrounds are just what you thought we'd be listening to in 1999, and I'm definitely going to flip to his page next.  But as for the Queen of the  80's... sorry... I was waiting for the next female artisan-spirit to enter  this talent-deprived music world and listening to the singles, I thought  Madonna now had potential.  But this album offers nothing to the listener.   The lyrics are as generic as you'd expect from a team of four writers.   Orbit made this album by himself and he should have stopped there...  Madonna could have (and probably did) cut the vocals in 2-3 hours.   Tremendous disappointment.  <br />Alanis is still by far the most talented  artist on the Maverick label (by light-years), and Tori Amos is the Queen  of the Keys.  Nobody compares to these two ladies, and nobody appears to  even be close.
6301966562|5.0|If you have ever wanted to hit your computer, or just can't live with out your computer, this is a must see movie. The computer comes to life after champaigne is spilled on it's circuits.  Complete with the corny little  voice, playing fantastic music and even goes as far as falling in love with  his girlfriend. The movie is great for the family, great for the computer  or the non-computer oriented minded person.

0380789019|5.0|Not since Douglas Adams' everyman protagonist Arthur Dent began his intergalactic adventures in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has such a clever mix of humor, adventure and strange new worlds been seen on the  literary front.  The story moves at breakneck pace from street to sewer to  rooftop, and you'll never look at your city quite the same again.  I loved  Neverwhere so much I went out and bought Neil's new book  &quot;Stardust&quot; today!

6300215512|5.0|How can this movie possibly hold up so well?  Afterall, it deals with a silent film star's tragic hopes for a comeback, subject matter that seems inevitably dated.  Somehow, the film never seems dated, though.  There will  always be stars past their prime, longing for the glories of their youth.   There will always be young, hungry hustlers, trying to score a break and  not get sent packing back home.  I just hope there will always be someone  like Billy Wilder around to capture such stories with such breathtaking  artistry.
6304457391|5.0|This tense, rivetting drama of a possible military takeover still enthralls even though the Cold War is over.  This film is a cautionary tale of what can happen if we forget the basic tennets of the American  experiment.  Kirk Douglas, Frederic March, Burt Lancaster and an all-star  supporting cast give strong performances.  Highly recommended.
079073382X|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and never grow tired of it.  Yes, it's talky but in the best sense--you are watching two people talk their way into each others' lives.  They may try to hide who they are but we see beyond that.   There is one moment in this film where Julie Delpy says, &quot;It's  stupid...&quot; to believe relationships can last forever but you see in  her eyes that she wants Ethan Hawke to disagree with her.  It is acting at  its finest and it breaks my heart everytime.
B000000T01|4.0|Anyone who digs the Who digs The Kids Are Alright. The MOVIE isn't the problem here. The editing of the orginal movie for VHS release created a VERY incomplete version of what was. The mini-opera A Quick One While He's  Away is cut by two thirds. The tape also contains other &quot;shells&quot;  of great tunes and live performances. In short, the movie was severely  tampered with when edited to tape and whoever did that is not only fooling  the buyer, he's falsely marketing tampered artistry! Boo! I want the  complete movie, occaisionally aired on late nite cable!!

0783114222|5.0|Tom Hanks did a wonderful job in making the Apollo adventure come alive to TV audiences across the United States.  The best part of the series is how it portrays the astronauts, the engineers, and the rest of the people who  helped get the astronauts to the moon.  <br />What inspired me is watching the  astronauts at work.  Their attitudes and approaches toward solving  difficult problems were simply a riot!  I especially love the episode about  the Apollo 12 crew and how they enjoyed their adventures to the  fullest.<br />I also love the episode on LM engineers.  I'm an engineer  myself, and I appreciate the accuracy of their characterization.  I  especially appreciate the parts of the episode in which engineers work all  night to build a model and having the astronauts getting frustrated durning  integration testing.  I see both of those parts on in my job often. (Well,  not with astronauts, but with fellow engineers and system testers.)<br />In  addition, Michael Kamen's theme music certainly conveys the inspirational  quality of the series.  I plan on buying the CD and sticking the title  track on repeat...<br />All in all, this series is definitely worth buying.   (Perhaps the bigwigs in Hollywood would pick up the hint to do more high  quality documentary drama on science and space related topics if the sales  of this series is good enough.  Hint, hint.)

Of the dozens of shows I saw in the past year, Hedwig offered the most by far. It is definitely  worthy of the cult following it has garnered in the past few years. No  matter how great the music is, however, I was very surprised to find that  both Amazon and one of their competitors was completely sold out on its  first day of release. True evidence of quality music overwhelming the moral  majority regardless of risque subject matter. Seems like Hedwig-fever is  going to be sweeping the nation, and quite soon. Get this before your  friends do. :)

0385474547|5.0|There are two problems with US education shown by these reviews.    One is that so many high school and college students hated what is a seductively charming and moving novel because they were forced to read it.  Educators  should be thinking of techniques to get around this - perhaps allowing kids  to select their own reading from a list of titles, rather than assigning  them a particular title.<br />A second problem is that none of the reviewers  seems to even be aware that Chinua Achebe won the Nobel Prize for  literature for this novel. The Nobel Prize doesn't make it a great novel -  it recognizes that it is.  Why didn't their teachers mention that to the  reviewers?<br />Last, none of the reviewers seem aware of the powerful irony  of the subsequent history of the Ibo people.  The new Ibo society that was  beginning to emerge in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; attempted to secede  from Nigeria in the 1970's, as Biafra.<br />More people were killed in the  resulting Nigerian civil war than in any war since World War 2, most of  them Ibos.  It was perhaps the most horrible war of recent history.  The  irony is that the Ibo people were massacred en masse, and Ibo society  destroyed, not by European Christian colonialists, but by their fellow  Nigerians, Muslims from the North.  <br />How could the teachers not have  taught their students about this, preparatory to assigning them  &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;?  Perhaps because they themselves didn't  know?
0670880728|1.0|I cannot believe the people who think this book deserves five stars: The prose is dire. The plot non-existant, the humour thin, and the character nauseatingly self-obsessed and hollow. I'm not anti-entertainment or fun,  but on a scale of 1 -10 for sharp humour, this merits a wane smile (0.5)  rather than my-eyes-are-about-to-pop-out-and-I-can't-breath  and-think-I'm-about-to-die-for-laughing-so-hard (10) I've had a few women  acquaintances tell me that it's true to life, which only goes to confirm a  stereotype of women as neurotic and empty-headed.  I don't know - maybe the  world is turning into a huge trailer park with cable TV production values.  However, this book has spawned a market of wannabe novelists and tv shows  where being single or weight obsessed is the critical issue - sign of the  times, sign of the times.  If there was ever a case of dumbing down - this  is it. Maybe if I got a lobotomy I would see the light - but what would  happen if after that I still couldn't get the point of this book? That  would be tragic....

B00000DMJF|1.0|This is a most disappointing re-issue. It sounds exactly like the original record, muddy bass lines, lots of tape hiss. I am surprised Capitol Records didn't add clicks and pops. I expected a clean, clear remastering of this  seminal work. Instead, Capitol put out a real piece of audio trash. Do not  buy it. Write to Capitol and demand they remaster this work.

6300151379|5.0|This is probably my personal favorite film of all time. This movie does flawlessly what thousands of others tried to shamefully replicate. It is the best fantasy film ever made and it has a more than dedicated fan  following. Re-release it in the theatres or on tape and DVD. How do I get  in touch with the publishing company? Did they go out of buisiness or  something? COME ON!
630529142X|5.0|I loved the movie soooo much that I went back and saw it 5 times with my friends that had not seen it yet. They loved it. I'm going to go see it again this weekend. Yesssss!! Oh! By the way, I'm 13 years of age.
B00000637V|3.0|Lou Reed, a songwriter of enormous talent, must have realized how talented he was.  That was his mistake.  Concept albums, usually, are dreadful experiences, and this is nothing more than a slightly above average concept  album.  Produced by the guy who eventually produced rocks most overrated  yawner &quot;The Wall&quot; by Pink Floyd, the grit and streetmuck feeling  of The Velvet Underground is gone and replaced with Mantovani dribble.  As  far as the songs, &quot;The Kids&quot; is a harrowing song, and at times on  &quot;Berlin,&quot; the melodrama works.  But now, due to the advance in  reissue technology, the original versions of these songs by the Velvet  Underground are superior (&quot;Oh Jim&quot; [on &quot;Peel Slowly and  See&quot;] as &quot;Oh Gin&quot; and &quot;Sad Song&quot;], and make the  &quot;Berlin&quot; versions sound extremely pretentious.  Lou Reed fans  must own this record, because it is his most elaborate recording, and  reportedly, one of his favorite of his own albums.  It will probably bore  to tears just about everybody else.  &quot;Berlin&quot; is well represented  on the Lou Reed box-set, &quot;Between Thought and Expression,&quot; which  is highly recommended.
0920668372|5.0|My wife bought this book and it became my daughter's favorite. My wife cried everytime she read it. I decided to read it to my daughter and I too, cried. I had Rober Munsch on my radio show and interviewed him about the  book. The book was written to honor the 2 still births that his wife had in  two years. In fact the book is dedicated to these two babies. When I asked  him about the mother going across town with a ladder to see her son, he  explained that it should not be taken literally but rather figuratively  that a mother will always be there for love WHENEVER! Mr Munsch read the  book on the air and we had a bank of 5 callers waiting to talk to him. None  of them could because they were all in tears. I feel sorry for the  reviewers who call this book perverse. Read past the words. Open your  heart. A wonderful book.
6300151379|5.0|please re-release this movie, im in love w/ it ,i cant get enought  i need to own it , its the best movie in the whole wide world.the music is great,david bowie is great  everything is great .just your typical chessy  80's movies  that you cant get enough of
6305229449|4.0|Or would have lurched out, had they devoted any media muscle to this film.  Instead, Disney chose to pull their punches and hope to recoup their money on video.  Had they pushed or hyped this film in any way--more people would  have seen this incredible film.<br />I was lucky enough to see it at the  Uptown theater, the second largest theater on the east coast.  Having seen  the video, I'm somewhat disappointed with the pan and scan job.  Watching  it on a television, it just didn't have the same effect.  Two  examples--when the Huns charge down a mountain on horseback, and when  everyone in the Imperial city bows.  I wasn't filled with awe nor fear,  rather I was filled with disappointment.  I had seen and felt those two  scenes in the theater, but on the video, they come across rather  unimpressive.  If Disney  ever releases a wide screen edition of this  movie, I'll change my review to five stars.<br />The voice acting is  excellent, as is the screenplay.  Ming Na Wen and Lea Salonga do an  excellent job as Mulan, with Eddie Murphy providing plenty of comic  relief.<br />The art and the animation style shows that Disney is not limited  to cookie cutter releases like Pocahontas and Hunchback.<br />Oh, and  finally, a Disney movie where the heroine doesn't end up  kissing/dating/marrying the 'hero.'  That was getting tiring.  That alone  gives this movie an additional 1/2 star.<br />Bottom Line:  Superior to  Previous Disney Releases
6305291446|2.0|As we all know, so few sequels can ever top the original.  This is no exception.  As a longtime fan of the original, I have to say this was another one of the awful sequels trying to milk the Halloween saga for all  its worth.  It was nice to see  Jamie Lee in there, but we all know without  Loomis, it just isn't the same.  The storyline was rather silly, the mask  was a little better than the previous ones, but will not top the first  either.  Along with the mask, I could never understand why the soundtrack  from the first one was not continued on.  That is one of the identies that  you associate with Halloween when discussing the movie.  All of the added  electronics and sound effects was overkill to the music, which was just  about as important to the film as the actors.  All in all, you have to give  credit to Jamie for trying, but it really, yes really, was disappointing.   My advice to you is to stay away from the DVD unless you are a big fan.   Rent the video if you have the cash to blow, or just wait for it to come  out on cable.
B000000WJK|4.0|I really enjoy listening to this album. I love the swirling guitar, and the loose song structure. There's just a certain coolness to the record, even though theres not one track that stands out on its own.
0446310786|5.0|I was assigned this book to read in the 9th grade.  Opening it for the first time, and seeing the small print, as well as the lack of pictures (!), my heart sank.  But I read.  By the time I got to the third page, I  was hooked.  This book changed my life fundamentally; it turned me into a  reader.  Quite an accomplishment, that.

6304994540|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out in the theatres, and I laughed my @$$ off throughout the whole thing.  I got it as soon as it came out on video, and I still laugh, even having watched it a dozen times or more.<br />While  the camerawork, staging and special effects are great, what really stands  out is the dialogue.  I love the interplay between the Dude and his bowling  buddies, Walter and Donnie.  And John Turturro as Jesus is fantastic!  Hey,  nobody %^$#'s with the Jesus!
0802130208|5.0|This has to be the funniest book I have ever read.  Ignatius Reilly is out to guide the world towards a rebirth of Medeival values and understanding starting in, of all places, the New Orleans French Quarter.  Toole keeps  the reader laughing with his tour of Ignatius' psyche and how it is  juxtaposed with varied types of southern folk.  His use of perspective is  astounding.  I couldn't more highly recommend a book to anyone.
6305265488|5.0|Not only does this fairy tale include realistic people, but it also turns the whole story into a realistic and wonderfully romantic tale that is appropriate for kids, teens and grown-ups. I have waited for a movie with a  happy ending like this for a long time....
6305268843|5.0|Firelight is an unusual love story with all the mystery and romance of the gothic era.  However this film is more than an intriguing story.  The movie delights the senses with its visual beauty and the haunting soundtrack.  It  is very easy to immerse yourself in the beautiful experience of Firelight.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|terrible terrible terrible. This is just degrading to society. Bad music, bad lyrics, just a ploy to jam down all 14 year old kids throats. On top of this, the offspring claim to be punk! Try Gen X or The Clash (Heck, even  Wire's first album!), but this is bad. Stay away from this stench.
B0000042MY|5.0|This soundtrack is awesome.  It is my absolute favorite, and the whole track is magnificent, not just a few songs.  It's the kind you can listen to when you need that inspirational drive because the music is so moving  and rejuvinating.  The music takes you, and then leaves you changed, and  refreshed.  I recommend this CD to just about everyone.
6300151379|5.0|I believe that this movie is one of the best movie of all time and that it should be rereleased. I've been looking for this movie to buy for years and I just recently found out that it is not available for sale. I was  heartbroken. If there is any way that I can get in touch with the company  to rerelease it please let me know and I will make it my personal crusade  to get this movie back on thr shelves.
0451191153|5.0|I read The Fountainhead as a senior in high school as I passed through the most fantastic and emotional time of my life. Every single time I  picked up this masterpiece I had a feeling of outright euphoria as I entered into  the realm of true imagination. Every discription, every small word on every  page made me wonder what I am doing on this earth and why no one  understands me. Howard Roark was like no one I could possibly imagine, he  was a manifestation of everything I wanted to do and be. I finished this  book very late the night before I threw the shot put at the state meet in  Denver as I tasted the best years of my life drift into nothingness. The  whole plot and ending represented all that I admire and I can't let go of.  Every time I cry, I cry because Howard  Roark exists now as a part of me.  And every time I wonder what heaven would be like, I know who builds God's  temples.
B000002PCS|5.0|I can still remember trying to find the ALBUM after I saw the movie.  It would instantly have me in tears for years after.  Even now, 18 years later, when I listen to the cassette, I know exactly what rifts of music  went with what scenes of the movie.  John Barry probably had no clue of the  &quot;timelessness&quot; of his soundtrack.  It is his best work in my  opinion.  Go, John!!!
B000000OUW|5.0|No grunge, no punk, no thrash, no progressive, no glam, but good old heavy metal. They always say in their lyrics: &quot;We are the brothers of Metal&quot;, &quot;We'll die for Heavy Metal&quot;. It seems they're  telling nothing but the truth. I'd never listened to something like this  for a long time. Since I'm fan of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, I've seen  lots of &quot;kinds&quot; of metal,  but Manowar created (or ressurected)  an unique sound. Awesome sound.
B000002J20|5.0|I am tired of listening to critics and reviewers expound the tired theories about YES. Critics can  be put into 2 categories:1)the pulers  2) the scrabbling talentless. Yes was pretentious enough to try and compose  serious music and that was not a sin. Jon Anderson wrote some enigmatic  lyrics and they may have bordered on iconlclastic, but they were profound.  Rick W. was our &quot;Merlin&quot; on the keyboards. Steve H. was a master  guitarist and Chris made the fish (sculpin) fly. Alan was the pulse that  gave the group life. The album was supposed to be about Tantric yoga but in  Songs like:&quot;The Revealing Science of God&quot; all of life was  transmogrified into a dance. It is about the journey we all are on, whether  it is on a Roundabout or on the way to the Gates of Delirium. I was just  glad to be there and maybe that is why some critics did not &quot;get  it&quot;, you had to be there.
B000001F84|5.0|Isn't this modern technology stuff great:  Listen to the album while reviewing it.  2112 is the pinnacle of this band.  No gushy love and lost junk. 20+ plus minutes dedicated to the adaption of Ayn Rand's great  &quot;Anthem&quot;.  Okay, so I'm just like the rest of the reviewers: late  thirties, first heard this in our mid-teens.  Nevertheless, 2112 remains my  favorite album by my favorite group. Thank you Mr. Lee, Mr. Peart and Mr.  Lifeson.

B000002HMH|4.0|I'm 32 years old and I started listening to Metallica in 1986.  After two albums, I stopped listening because it was the same old stuff.. It had no originallity what so ever - You can only do so much with &quot;speed  metal&quot;.  Well, because of this album I'm once again a Metallica fan.   It's original, heavy, and better than ever!  It was time for speed metal to  take a bow. It came, it rocked, it went.  Thank God Metallica saw the end  of speed metal - with this album, they have stepped into the boundries of  what REAL heavy metal is all about.  Great CD !
0553573403|5.0|It will be very difficult to put the beauty and scope of this work into words.  Imagine yourself stepping into a time machine and traveling to the Middle Ages or the Crusades and being inside the heads of everyone from the  key player down to the servants and little people.  This is what you get  when you read Martin's A Game of Thrones.  Martin has managed to weave an  epic so incredibly complex, and yet so easy to read and follow, that before  I read this book the concept of such an intricately told tale and such a  realistic world had never occurred to me.  You have all heard the praises  for other authors about &quot;real&quot; seeming worlds that they have  created, but never before has it really been done until A Game of Thrones.  From the characterization to the grandeur of the battles to the intimate  feelings between lovers and enemies, Martin includes everything that can be  asked for, and yet manages to make every bit of it believable, which is in  short supply in today's world of five-cent fantasy authors.  Bravo!  Winterfell!
B000009RC2|5.0|I was a budding rock guitarist, heavily influenced by the great Jimi Hendrix, when a friend turned me on to The Inner Mounting Flame.  Like Hendrix, McLaughlin completely &quot;rocked my world.&quot;  McLaughlin was  every bit as groundbreaking and influential in his own way as Hendrix was,  though obviously not as well-known to the masses as Jimi.  Every song on  The Inner Mounting Flame completely blew me away, but my absolute favorite  to this day is &quot;The Dance of Maya.&quot;  But McLaughlin's solo on the  song &quot;Dawn&quot; is absolutely astounding.  It really defies  description and should be heard by all guitarist everywhere.  Ditto for  McLaughlin's riveting and fiery solo on the song &quot;Awakening.&quot;  I  saw John McLaughlin and The Mahavishnu Orchestra in concert in the early  seventies.  I sat transfixed by John McLaughlin, captivated by his  super-human virtuosity, and completely unable to take my eyes off him, even  when he stared right back at me wondering why I was staring at him even  when he wasn't soloing or even playing his instrument!  At another concert  I saw the legendary Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin both on stage  together in a guitar duel.  Breathtaking though Carlos was (and is), he  simply was overwhelmed by McLaughlin's godlike command of the guitar and  had to defer to McLaughlin.  Anyone interested in hearing a true guitar  genius at the top of his game has got to get The Inner Mounting Flame as  quickly as possible.  It sounds as great today as it ever did.
0783114222|5.0|Tom Hanks' love of the U.S. space program shines through this 12-hour event.  His passion and zeal catapults the Apollo program to new heights and will re-awaken your spirit and pride in America. Superb.  Exhilarating.   Suspenseful.  If America returns to the moon before 2010, it will have to  be credited to the efforts of Tom Hanks and Ron Howard!  This DVD is  definitely worth the investment!
B000002UEB|5.0|This album brought me into the fold of Ryche and Rollers.  I listen to it more than any other album I own.  Queensryche has successfully brought together many complex issues in this album.  It is sharp socio-political  commentary yet it could easily have been written yesterday rather than  eleven years ago.  But it addresses complex psychological/emotional issues  such as identity, love, interpersonal relations, abuse, obsessions, roles,  and needs with rare insight and candor.  Queensryche is aware of the fact  that these issues cannot be separated from each other and that ambivalence  is part of the human condition.  This forms the heart of this albums's  greatness.  The interior monologues (for lack of a better term) that make  up most of the album are simply beyond anything else I've ever heard.  Frankly, I've never heard or read anything that brings so much together so  well.  Musically, the sound is always sharp and controlled; as well as  angry and/or mournful as is needed by what events are occuring lyrically.   Wilton's and DeGarmo's guitar work is second to none individually and  jointly.  And all of this is densely woven together.  What can I say...I  really love this album.  It is far more than the sum of it's parts.  The  other reviewers I've read here are right, it deserves far better than a  mere five stars.  Settle into your favorite chair, unplug the phone, turn  out the lights, fire up the stereo and let Queensryche tell you a story  about a young man named Nicki...

B0000028RR|5.0|Rage is tied with 311 for my favorite band.  I also think the Urge kicks some serious *** too.  Rage Against the Machine is a CD you can just listen to.  You don't have to skip the bad or anything like that because there are  no bad songs on this CD.  It just beats Evil Empire by a bit, but it is the  best.  They are also very kick *** live.
0316548189|5.0|This book will not only make you respect Mandela more than you thought possible, but it will also, most certainly, make you look at your own life differently. (And shed a tear.) <br />Hero is a gross understatement.
B000002C1X|5.0|Some may consider Dark Side of the Moon the best Pink Floyd album ever.  I feel, however, that The Wall is superior.  It provides an elaborate social commentary on the failings of modern society, and how this affects us all.   While the content of the album is vast, there is a consistent flow to it.   A story is being told, and the album must be studied at length to trully  appreciate all of the hidden symbolism.  There is a connection between all  of the songs, and listening to them in sequence is highly recommended.   There are, however, several songs which are also self-contained  masterpieces.  For example, Another Brick in the Wall(part 2), Mother, Hey  You, Comfortably Numb, and Run Like Hell are all hits in their own right.   Another great aspect of the album is that it is one of Pink Floyd's most  sonically &quot;dense&quot; works.  A high definition sound system is  highly recommended when listening to this album.  The lyrics, themselves,  are very good, and elaborate.  This is Roger Waters at his poetic best.   Overall, I feel that this is Floyd's best album.
B00000DGUG|4.0|You people oughtta be ashamed of yourselves! I don't see you out there putting out albums. I like this album.I got it for Christmas.I personally liked Jaged Little Pill better but I like this album very much as well.It  is sorta on the slow side though.My 2 fav. songs are : &quot;Thank U&quot;  and &quot;Unscent&quot;. I think it has some similar music to the song  &quot;Uninvited&quot; which I love! I like this album but the singing is a  little on the Dull side. GOOD album i would say. ~Chris~
B000002BYD|5.0|A truly great CD.  I love almost every single song on it.  I think those few people here that gave it a poor rating (1 star !?) either didn't give it a fair chance or aren't real fans of Pearl Jam's music.  And for the  latter there is no excuse.  :)
630518299X|5.0|Even if you can't stand Jim Carrey from his earlier flicks, you will love him in this one. It is a wonderful movie that made me feel a little creeped out. One of the reasons I loved it was because MY name is Meryl
0792151712|5.0|I had never cried non-stop for one and a half hours before watching this movie! Make sure you have a whole roll of toilet paper with you! I didn't and left my boyfriend Xav's arm very wet and dirty...
0441172717|3.0|Great setting, rounded characters, and fine plotting.  But amazing?  One of my problems with the book is that the action takes place &quot;off-screen,&quot; and devotes way too much time to the sometimes  pretentious and boring inner monologues of the characters.  While it is  eons better than that lousy movie, I was disappointed with the ending.   Once Paul Maud'Dib is aware that he's the Kwisatz Haderach, he loses his  humanity.  There's no sense of struggle or conflict with the Harkonnens,  Saurdaurker, and Emperor -- you know he's going to win.  The knife fight at  the end lacks dramatic impact -- he chooses it, it doesn't feel inevitable.   However, the book does make one think and can be regarded as a  &quot;Hamlet&quot; revenge story meets an interplanetary &quot;Lawrence of  Arabia.&quot;  While it's hard to believe that 20,000 years in the future  societies need a spice for geriatric purposes and the Bene Gesserits wait  90 generations to perfect their genetic line when in the near future OUR  genetic engineering will do the same -- the plotting keeps you on your  toes.  The depiction of the Fremen is both moving and interesting.  Before  Paul becomes the messiah, you really care about him.
B000002IGP|1.0|What the hell is this?  This is the worst album I've ever heard.  These guys are such posers.  They aren't even heavy metal.  They're washed up glam metal retards from L.A.  I don't see how they are considered heavy  metal.  Their lyrics are ones that a second grader could write.  And I  still don't know how they got on the same bill Metallica did at 1985's Day  On The Green.  Metallica is actaully heavy metal, unlike this poser band.
0783221487|4.0|Dune, as a novel, is incredible. To make the transition to a movie would be difficult, if not impossible. David Lynch made an excellent attempt, and while the version sold commercially is unfortunately difficult to follow  for the Dune Novice, the uncut version is fantastic(if you have the time!)  <br />My major complaint is the lack of attention to Liet-Kynes and the Fremen  society, which is the center of Dune. Too much assumption is made by  Lynch.<br />If you're interested in Dune, read the book. The movie is a nice  addition, but is also completely unnecessary. :) Just enjoy the weirdness  of it.<br />What a story. I hear it's being remade, based exclusively on the  novel, so we may yet gain further visual insight into Mr. Herbert's  ecological epoch.
6303921248|5.0|Six hours might seem long, but believe me its worth it. It is my sisters and my favorite movie, we watch it every opportunity we get. The cast was picked perfectly and all did a great job of portraying their characters.  Watch it and be pleasantly surprised!
6302902010|2.0|This is primarily intended for all those other reviewers on this page who were disappointed at &quot;being duped&quot;.   The TODD-AO Preminger film version will probably not be seen for a very long time as those in control  of the Gershwin estate loathe it and have permanently barred it from being  screened as a film, being shown on television or being released on video.  Since they retain the music rights and without their consent, the film  cannot be exhibited, it looks as though this film is headed for oblivion.   The same holds true of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN which the Irving Berlin Estate is  barring for the same reasons.   These remain the only two films of  important Broadway musicals that have never been released to video.
630018403X|5.0|A great movie like this comes only once in a great while.  I mean, any kid that grew up in the 80's should own this movie.  There have been movies that have tried to show how the kids and  the school system are, but this  is the only one that shows it truely and honestly.  It takes a kid from  every group of school society, puts them in a room together along with a  jerk principal, and makes an incredible show.  This movie shows the lives  and personalities of a nerd, weirdo, prep, jock, and stoner which was not a  common group to have in one room.  It also brings back the good times of  the 80's and shows us what were missing out on.  If your to have one movie  form of the 80's, I believe that this should be the one to buy.
B00000BKDW|5.0|I truly judge a great album by the amount of time I have the lyrics running through my head when I am either surfing or snowboarding.  Ryme of the Ancient Mariner is one of my all time favorite songs.  This of course  is not to disparage on all of the other insane titles.  Maiden rules heaven  and hell!
B000002VCW|4.0|&quot;Dutch&quot;?  He's no more Dutch than Winston Churchill.  Stewart is Scottish, to be precise.  Good album, though.
6305265488|5.0|Superbe! Magnifique! Excellente!  Mere words cannot do justice to the artistry that is Ever After. The classic Cinderella story is retold (some may suggest reworked) in this gloriously delightful film. It will charm  you, make you laugh, make you cry-- the whole gamut of human emotions!  Brilliant casting all around... Bravo, bravo, bravo!
0451191935|5.0|The Bachman Books shows that Stephen King is the best writer of horror as well as general fiction.  Rage and the Long Walk could possible be the two best novellas in American literature.  I could not put this book down.  It  drew me in and would not let me go.
B000005TQO|4.0|Bravissima! Wonderful, brilliant songs set to catchy rhythms & lyrics! Audiophiles, this is definitely one to buy!
0553573403|5.0|What are you doing here reading this review when you should be reading A Game of Thrones.  'nuff said.
B000000OSE|5.0|Some would argue that appetitte was a better album i would probably have to respectfully disagree,the great thing about the illusions albums were that not only were they balls out rockin but they also had some hella great  songwriting from stradlin and rose--my personal favorites from the set are  definetly &quot;coma&quot; and &quot;estranged&quot; among the other great  songs on the set.Which really makes it that much worse that the egos of  this band couldnt subside so they could keep playing great music--a real  damn waste of god given talent wasted on ego, ah, so be it!! Anyway,i  digress, to put it simply if you want to hear the greatest rock band  ever.You would be hard pressed to find a better band than GN fn R!!!
1559408758|5.0|I have been a fan of &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; since it's release back in the early 80's.So I assume that it must have been an act of god that my VHS version of this movie had not only been eaten by a very hungry  VCR, but also dicontinued. Because if these examples of divine intervention  never happened, I would have never searched for Spinal Tap on DVD and would  have never found The Criterion Colection of This is Spinal Tap. This  version is for the person who just can't get enough of &quot;Tap&quot;.  There is over 4 hours of material on this DVD. Besides the actual movie,  you can watch it with the commentary of Rob Reiner, or with the guys from  Spinal Tap explaining every scene and wacky idea that came about in making  this film. You also get over 2 hours of cut scenes and subplots(which you  learn were cut not because of bad ideas, but because of time restraints).  Scenes that will have you laughing just as much as the movie itself. That's  not all, you get a 20 minute &quot;demo&quot; reel that was used to try to  sell the idea to all of the different movie studios. It is really  interesting to see some of the great &quot;classic&quot; gags in their  early stages. Different movie and theatrical trailers are included(the  cheese trailer one of my favorites)and just when you think that there can't  be any more room on a DVD, you get behind the scenes material,music videos  and a goofy commercial for a mock Spinal Tap greatest hits album(done in  the classic K-tel style that some of us grew up with). Bottom line, any tap  fan who has a DVD player should already own this. It is well worth the  price. You get so much for the money when it comes to The Criterion  Collection of Spinal Tap.
B000000OSE|5.0|Guns n' Roses is without a doubt the best band that has ever existed. Use Your Illusion 1 contains some of their best work, including the best rock song in history, Coma. It displays different styles and tempos as well as  very profound lyrics. Even if the rest of the album sucked (which it  *doesn't*) it would be worth buying just for Coma. Any rock/metal fan  should go right now, not passing Go and not collecting $200 (although that  would be helpful to buy more music) and buy EVERY G'nR album avaliable,  then start praying to whatever god or goddess they belive in that these  guys will pull themselves together and put out more. But while we're  waiting, there's always Slash's Snakepit and Duff's solo, &quot;Believe In  Me&quot;
6304068441|5.0|I'm not the biggest Sean Penn fan, but his performance in this film is incredible.  Half an hour into the film you'll forget that he's an actor and not the real convict.  The film presents both sides of the capital  punishment debate; one minute Penn's character should be left alive, the  next minute you'd flip the switch yourself.  An intense, extremely well  acted film.
B000002HMH|1.0|I can't believe that the Metallica I know and love put this album on music store shelves. When I first listened to it, I thought someone had mixed up the CDs and put some other band's album in the 'tallica case. I didn't pick  up listening to them until the black album, but I've since bought and  listened to the others and found something that truly rocks. After  literally listening to death tapes of all their other albums, I couldn't  wait for Load, until I heard it. I never even bothered to buy it. Honestly,  I think it wouldn't have been a bad album...if someone else had done it.  Guys, I hate to say it, but this was worse than a disappointment. Fans, if  you want *real* Metallica, go buy &quot;Lightning&quot;.
6301007875|5.0|This one is definitely a keeper! Schwarzenegger makes this film both Action packed (so much that the action was seeping out of my VCR!!! ) as well as chaotically fun! Forget about &quot;I'll be back&quot; this one has  got some of his best ever one liners! As well as some great action scenes  which make you think that maybe this time he doesn't make it! The host of  the game show, Richard Dawson, who was the ex-Family Feud host as well,  played a great part in being the Devilish Host of the sadistic mayhem that  they call a game show! The supporting cast is also a treat with Maria  Conchita Alonso and Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura. Overall, this was  one Action packed movie right from the get go! This one will thrill both  Arnold fans as well as Action thrill seekers alike! 5 Stars!
B000006045|5.0|Once again an extraordinary piece of art. Yes, it´s no music anymore, it´s a drug from outer space. These guys are my girlfriend, family, and friends in one subject. Get everything, every little silver disc!!!!! It´s  necessary  <br />RIK
B000002L9J|5.0|This has to be tied with The Cure's &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me&quot; as the most unique and most incredible album of the eighties, if not all time. What I love most about The Smiths is the contrast of Morrissey's often  depressing lyrics and the upbeat/joyous way he sings them! Some of the  melodies on this album are very beautiful, especially the song &quot;There  Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot;, which also has very romantic lyrics,  even if they are a bit warped in a Morrissey kind of way! It is definitely  in my list of top five songs of all time. &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; is very  catchy and happy feeling, and always puts me in a great mood! &quot;Never  Had Noone Ever&quot; and &quot;I Know It's Over&quot; are amazing songs  with a lot of emotion. It is an album with a lot of different kinds of  songs, but is unmistakably The (incredible!) Smiths! You can't go wrong  with this album. If you are looking for an alternative eighties album IT'S  A NO BRAINER!!!
6300189821|4.0|I thought this was a very entertaining movie....Kim Cattrall is beautiful!!  I think you will really enjoy the performances by McCarthy and Taylor.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes fairy-tale like  stories.  You won't be disappointed.
B00000GRL0|4.0|From the very first scene where Bruce throws that fat slob all over the mat (who, by the way was fortunate that it was just a sparring exhibition), he cannot be beat.  The fight scenes have a serious mood about them,  especially Bruces.  For the many people who I'm sure have seen the film,  the one flashback scene featuring the great and very underrated Angela  Mao-Ying as Bruce's younger sister shows what a really tough and skilled  fighter she is.  And has anybody seen Jim Kelly lately or know of his  whereabouts?
B0000025L8|4.0|THERE ARE GEMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RUINED BY RADIO PLAY. THEN AGAIN, THE CLASH HAVE NOT GOTTEN THEIR DUE. SONGS; &quot;UP IN HEAVEN,&quot; AND &quot;POLICE ON MY BACK,&quot; ARE STUNNING EXAMPLES OF THE BAND'S  &quot;POWER POP&quot; NICHE. THE CLASH HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY THE DARK CLOUD  OF &quot;SELLING OUT,&quot; BUT WHO CARES? THESE GEMS SOUND GOOD, FEEL  GOOD, AND SIMPLY, ARE GOOD! OH, IF ONE LIKE'S SOME REGGAE, THEN SONGS;  &quot;VERSION PARDNER,&quot; AND &quot;THE CROOKED BEAT,&quot; SANG BY PAUL  SIMINON WILL BE OF GOOD FLAVOR. AS FOR &quot;LOOSE THIS SKIN,&quot; TIMON  DOGG, AN OLD SONGWRITER PAL OF STRUMMER SANG IT. ACCORDING TO STRUMMER,  TIMON DOGG TAUGHT STRUMMER HOW TO PLAY BEFORE THE 101'ers DAYS (TROUSER  PRESS, CHRIS SALEWICZ). THIS CD IS WORTH THE MONEY.
0425166805|1.0|I first read Von Daniken's masterpiece when I was twelve, and I could see right through it even then. In fact, most twelve-year-olds will find this book way too superficial. However, I now think the book is so bad it's good  - it should have cult status. Von Daniken spends much of the book wingeing  about the lack of recognition he gets from the scientific community (in  fact, he gets too much - once or twice his work has actually been seriously  discussed), he ignores science and physical evidence for the most part, and  concentrates on two themes. The first is that ancient people were too  stupid to have solved any but the most trivial problems, such as walking,  gathering fruit, and eating. Feats of science and engineering, such as  building pyramids, needed help from more advanced beings. The second theme  is that, if something superficially resembles something else, then it is  that other thing. Thus, if a sculpure in India is ornately carved in a way  that resembles pipes, then the detail is not decorative - it depicts actual  pipes. Furthermore, if the figure in the sculpture appears to be reclining,  as - say - an astronaut would in a spacecraft, then the sculpture depicts  an astronaut in a spacecraft surrounded by pipes. Yes, it's that simple.  I'm sure if Von Daniken came across a symbol in an ancient ruin comprising  a square divided in four segments he'd conclude that ancient people had  computers and ran Windows on them.<br />Still, it's a good laff.
B000002NHN|3.0|If your a fan of Enya's slower pieces then you may like this album. The music is relaxing and somewhat spiritual but did not stir my soul very much. I prefer music with a little more energy.
1573225517|1.0|It's easy to read and mildly amusing, but all these devotees of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; should read some classic literature before they start gushing about its deep insight into the male psyche.  At least, I was bored  by yet another first person pathetic male rant of a book (reminded me of  &quot;Independence Day&quot;).  I used to think that baby boomers were far  and away the most self-obsessed, but in this book X'ers are giving them a  run for their money....
B00000F1D3|5.0|The old girl sounds better than ever on this worldwide smash CD. Though she looks a little like Medusa on the cover, she has an eternal beauty throughout every song, especially the dancable &quot;Believe&quot;. Madonna  eat your heart out on this one baby! Nice tribute to Sonny in the liner  notes. But hey Cher, what is this &quot;Taxi, Taxi&quot; song? Kinda funny  honey!
630512065X|5.0|I love this Cats video, it is my all time favorite and alot of it has to do with the Curious Cat-Rum Tum Tugger.  John Partridge is my favorite actor in this video.  &quot;And there's really no need for me to shout  it!&quot;  I need any info or links on John Partridge.
0800139151|5.0|I've read a lot of mediocre reviews of this film and I have to believe that people are looking too deep.  This movie is a pure blast all the way through.  Not all movies have to have complicated plot lines, character  development, and scholarly dialogue.  The characters in this film are used  as cannon fodder.  All one learns is that Mr. X is tough.  Then Mr. X dies.   This movie is about people being tough, rugged, and mean.  This movie is  about amazing camera work surrounding dialogue of intense bravado.  Movies  like Airplane are simple movies about other people's scripts, packed full  of jokes.  And if one appreciates the art in good slapstick, that's all one  wants -- the idea is to laugh hard.  The Quick and the Dead makes no  argument for being classic literature, but what it does do is present an  amazingly quick, intense series of moments that make the viewer laugh and  say &quot;WOW!&quot;  In any good action film, which scenes do you like  best: the scenes where the hero is getting beat up or the scenes where the  hero is kicking everyone's butt all the while delivering one-liners?  The  Quick and the Dead knows what pumps up the action movie viewer and only  delivers that.  And I can't fault it.  And who's to say what's supposed to  motivate a western?  I only watch Clint Eastwood westerns to see him  deliver the punishment we all know is coming.  Sam Raimi says &quot;why  wait,&quot; let's get to the action.
B000000QFY|5.0|Focus, the instrumental group made this album in the seventies.  Combining wonderful sound with a  little flute in the end, this album rocks.  It has  a sound of classical, rock, and flutes!  This is one of their best albums.   I suggest getting this album. (thats why I gave it a 5 star rating)ENJOY!!!
0060977493|1.0|I had high hopes for this book, having read a few reviews and enjoying books I've read about India in the past.  However, the language of metaphors and simililes was WAY overdone and forced and made it difficult  to read.  The characaters were confusing and annoying also.  Don't waste  your time, I didn't finish it---  too  many good books out there!!!
0790731509|5.0|Perhaps one of the best movies of all time.  A true gem.  Paul Newman is at his best as a rebellious and charasmatic member of a southern chain gang.  His Christ like attributes have made this character a part of many  film studies classes in Jesuit colleges around the nation.  Along with the  religious aspect of the movie, the story is a remarkable tale of one man's  fight against society and its harsh laws.  This movie is an absolute must  for any collection.
B000001EXR|3.0|Carnival Of Souls, despite being utterly blasted by &quot;old school&quot; Kiss fans (who, by the way, lost interest in the band around 1979 and subsequently missed a lot of good music), is a solid album.  Although the  &quot;drop-tuning,&quot; grundgy sound is atypical (geez - what a contrast  with those B.C. Rich guitars they played on Crazy Nights), tracks such as  &quot;Hate&quot; and &quot;The Jungle&quot; are great rockers. If you're a  TRUE Kiss fan, buy this album if you haven't already.  For all of the  &quot;Kiss Army&quot; enlistees who lost interest in the band 20 years ago,  well, you missed half the band's catalog, a lot of great music, and...you  get the idea.
0767802659|5.0|This film is incredible! How they got a R rating by todays standards is remarkable. excellent blend of sci-fi and gore. This DVD is a must have for owners of this terrific format. The ac-3 sound is equally beautiful.
0790739909|4.0|City of Angels was by far one of Cage's (Face Off, Con Air) best movies.  He plays a real heart touching role.  Cage and Ryan just click.  They really set the mood and the scene.  You wonder if they really are in love.   The ending just made me realize how much a person can mean to another.  Not  at all what I expected.  I'd recomend it to everyone.  Four Stars.
0393312836|4.0|I didn't think I would make it through the first chapter of this book.  The slang of the narrator is used much more than I expected.  After accepting the fact that I would need to learn a new vocabulary, the book  smoothed out.  Actually, after a couple of chapters the strange words make  sense somehow and you can concentrate on the story which is pretty  captivating.  This was a completely new reading experience and though I  wanted normal english at times to speed things up, the book as a whole is  quite good and the story even without the slang is unique and imaginative.
0380973634|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a master with putting the images into your head.  This is a must have book that you wont be able to put down.
0802130208|1.0|Obviously there are two camps of people that reviewed this book, those that loved it and those that hated it.  Not many in between.  I'm not sure where the camp of lovers are coming from.  This book was not funny.  I  repeat . . . not funny!  I didn't laugh once through the first half of it  which is how far I could stand to read.  It portrays a pathetic fat slob of  a jerk that deserves all the bad that life deals him.  It's slow, it's  pointless, it's really hard to understand why this is a popular book.   Please read the one star reviews as well as the fives before quessing if  you'd be a lover or a hater.  Yuk.
B0000028M7|5.0|When i listen this album i find something in my life i see life is dirt.IF you want to see the real life listen and learn
6302181569|5.0|I saw this as an original release in Atlanta, GA in 1956 and had nightmares for weeks.  It has had such a powerful effect on later SF movies and series that its worth to the genre is beyond calculation.  A definitely  &quot;must see&quot; for SF fans.  Powerful visuals and special effects!
0871137380|5.0|I first read the story over Philly Inquier's web site. It's the best modern battle scene narrative I 've ever read. The bravery and courage of the rangers and the Delta troops had choked me into tears. By the end of  the story, I had to put down the printout of the story and saluted these  young soldiers I came to know.
B000003TSP|5.0|With this album Portishead has achieved the darkest sound i have ever heard. It gets deep into your brain, from the frightening &quot;Cowboys&quot; to the last second, making you playing it again and  again. Maybe is not as accesible as &quot;Dummy&quot; was, but i think this  is a better album as a whole. One of the best records of the 90s.
B000002TQV|4.0|so let's see...you record this small little record named 'Pablo Honey' and one song off of it connects with the disgrunted, disillusioned and otherwise pathetic (but quite numerous) American lads. You become famous  but are starting to wear thin because you could be filling the 'One Hit  Wonder' cliche. What do you do? you make a record which destroys every  preconception that everyone else had of you. Hell, there's even a song on  the album which mocks 'Creep' (do you know which one?) No other album I can  think of gives you the sonic attack that Radiohead does with their three  guitar lineup. Yet for all the harshness in here, the simple songs stand  out the most... I never liked 'Creep' or 'My Iron Lung' anyhow.
6300151379|5.0|If there was only one movie that I was able to own, Labyrinth would be it. When I was a kid I watched this movie over and over and I never once got sick of it. Anyone that I ask about the movie have also said that it is  their all time favorite.  But my copy of the movie has since grown worn,  old and unplayable. I want to be able to share this movie with my children.  But now I find out this might not be possible. This movie is so beautiful  and imaginative... I just hope someone out there demands justice and gets  it rereleased. This movie screams out to all children and adults who love  fantasy and have and wonderful imagination, and are yearning to explore it  more. It was a sad day when they decided not to make Labyrinth any more.
B000002UJQ|5.0|i bought 'ok computer' the 3rd or 4th day after its release not on the strength of anything they previously did (what the hell was 'creep'?) but because of the massive airplay and radiospots that were highlighting the  album's release here in NYC. I got the album and everything rushed in, the  sonic imagery, the pulsing guitars, the insane chord progressions  (reminicent of a legendary British rock group...) and manic feel. The album  is one of the most prized possesions in my cd collection next to Mutations,  Brighten the Corners and Sgt. Peppers. Critics throw around words like  'Concept Album' too easily and this album has heaped the most mileage of  that phrase in a while. Individually the songs are stellar. Airbag easily   starts off the CD with the biggest bang since Nevermind and SLTS. Paranoid  Android is a stretched out 'Happiness is A Warm Gun' with harsher guitars  (and one hell of a bridge...). Exit Music (For A Film) destroys Fake  Plastic Trees in its search for desolation. Let Down has the chiming  guitars of the Byrds and Karma Police's chorus is gives its nods to 'Sexy  Sadie's great chord progression.The album's not the 'anti' album that  someone stated in a past review. You hear the influences clearly that U2  and the Beatles especially held on this group. It also isn't the album of  the century as others have claimed. I'm not even sure if it is album of the  year (Brighten the Corners). Still, the most impressive album this group  has come out with. If Radiohead could follow this up, they got my vote as  artists of the decade...
6303686796|5.0|What can be said?  If you can walk away from this film and not feel upset, you didn't pay attention.  This movie demonstrated the brilliance of DeNiro.
0399143904|5.0|Everything about Clancy's work is fanitasic.  The characters, the story, sub plots, and more.  I found it difficult to put down on many occaisions.  A must Read!
6305128944|5.0|I saw &quot;Horse Whisperer&quot; twice in the theater and once on video.  Then I did the best thing possible - I read Monty Roberts &quot;The Man Who Listens to Horses.&quot;  Then I watched the &quot;Horse Whisperer&quot; a  fourth time.  It all made sense - the technique is real.  I have a friend  who used the &quot;gentler&quot; technique to gain the confidence of an  adopted Mustang filly.  It works!  I was raised on a horse ranch where  old-fashioned macho breaking techniques were used by my father like that of  the common old west cowboy, and hated it.  This summer I will be getting  new horse for therapy riding, and will faithfully use the techniques  learned by both the book and the movie.  I highly recommend both the movie  and the book.  (I have not read the novel &quot;Horse Whisperer,&quot; and  don't intend to - suggest if you really what to understand what is  happening in the movie - read &quot;The Man Who Listens to Horses.&quot;)
6305128952|5.0|I first watched this film with my husband on a rainy summer night at a drive-in theatre in Montana.  What an awsome setting for a movie as wonderful as this.  I would highly recommend it!
B00000G3PA|4.0|Story gets maybe 2 to 2 1/2 stars--slow in places and light on some character development.  Special effects and action very good.  This movie has no redeeming value and is not intellectually interesting, but is good  for  &quot;brain dead&quot; viewing on a weekend night.
0553277472|5.0|Robert's book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is more than a primer for beginning philosophy, psychology and zen students of life. It's not only a story of a Father and his son traveling from one state to  another. Its about the  difference between &quot;static quality&quot; and  &quot;dynamic quality.&quot; One may imagine learning about the better  questions. It's not a book about motorcycle maintenance per say. It's about  the history of philosophy and an inquiry into values. What is Quality?  What is Philosophy? This is truly the great american novel. No big  explosions or human killings, but a culture bearing book about the dynamic  quality of life. I had an interesting experience with the author, 9 years  ago.  I sent him my graduate psychology paper on &quot;Personality  Psychology.&quot; He read inked most of my letters and my paper then sent  it back to me.  He said do a zen sesshin, and that my work was unfocused.  I read his book around 5 times to try to find the meaning of what he said.  Since then I'm just beginning to understand the difference between  &quot;classic quality or static quality&quot; and &quot;dynamic  quality.&quot; This book will help you think upon things deeply. It's not  for weary, it's for those who want to challenge themselves and their life  with new philosophy and new paradigms.
B000006NPY|5.0|The problem with most reviewers, is they base their review of this album, based on what the previous albums sounded like. Hence, all the bad reviews. Stated quite simply, this is an excellent and different album. It's very  funny to see all the grunge and hard rock fans say how much they hate this.  I guess they'll have to stick with Pearl Jam (who haven't put a decent  album out since Vs.). This type of reviewing is a tradgedy (Mansun's  &quot;Six&quot; was a victim of this also). Excellent and recommended.
0783204914|5.0|I've read a lot of critic complaints that the ending was shameless and manipulative or somesuch. One critic complained that the ending was unrealistic.  Hello?  As if the premise of a high school kid escorting a  blind man to New York city from Vermont is all that realistic.  Frankly,  the story for the whole movie is contrived, but it's artfully contrived.   This movie isn't about so much about real life and realism as it is about  the performances and the way the story unfolds. Moreover, it's an Al Pacino  showcase, through and through (albeit with good supporting performances all  around), but dammit, it works!  Maybe the ending is manipulative, but it  works!  Manipulation is not always a bad thing.
B000002H8F|5.0|Doolittle is a masterpiece. nuff said. What puzzles me, is the mixed reviews given this album. This album is the companion to Doolittle. Both compliment each other. This for the surf songs and melodies, the other for  the harder, edgier stuff. Check this CD out....
6300215814|5.0|I watched the first five minutes, and I was hooked. Now, I know, I do have the detriment of being male, and that does make me more apt to look upon Audrey as a godess, but this film was still stunning. I mean, wow. I  watched it on what I had heard, I mean, solely through it being so  timeless, and now all my friends who had known it only as so much before,  you know, just knowing it by name, or from the song, are all watching it. I  sat one of my callosed, action-movie-fan friends down to watch the first  five mintues, and he ended up watching the first 15, completely transfixed,  and only stopped then because he had to go home, but that's not the point.  It's a great movie, go now, click, buy.
0812550706|5.0|No other sci-fi story will even come close to surpassing this amazing story.  I could not put it down.  This book will remain in my collection forever.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in sci-fi or military  novels.
B000002KHF|5.0|Absolute passion. Songs like,into the mistic,brand new day and it stoned me are classics. A must for music fans and dreamers.
6305095566|4.0|I think the reason why 'Evil Dead' is such a good  horror (in my view at least)is because it manages to create a very good of fear simply because there is no escape for the teens.  Also, fear is made even more frightful  by the fact that one by one each of the teens are killed off..untill there  is  one left! (at least untill you watch the sequel). Overall, I'd say that  this movie has got to be  worth a try, even if the actoring is...well, a   little odd in places.  I would also recommend  Evil Dead 2, which is an  even better film and gets the full 5 stars from me.
0374172897|5.0|I LOVED this book. Cunningham's sinuous, evocative descriptions (I'll never forget his retelling of Woolf's suicide in the prologue) and his masterful construction of complex characters will leave you breathless. But  the best thing about the book is how Cunningham touches on the deeper  emotions of our everyday lives. The difficulties of being a mother, a wife,  a daughter, a son, the regrets and hopes and comprises--they're all there  in a way that dignifies and ennobles us all.
6305171769|5.0|Halloween H20 will hopefully if the ending is any indication be the last in the series. jamie lee curtis again plays bedeviled laurie strode who is still fighting the demons from her past. she now has another reason to  fight back, love for her son. halloween H20 starts with a bang including A  surprise appearance at the begining of the film by the original nurse from  the first halloween flick. Halloween H20 is A perfect ending to the series  and A great tribute from Jamie Lee Curtis to her fans.
B000003N7Y|4.0|MingusX5, an energetic and richly arranged contribution to the Charles Mingus catalog, should come with a warning.  The titles listed for this album are deceptive: &quot;II B.S.&quot; is very similar to &quot;Haitian  Fight Song,&quot; &quot;Mood Indigo,&quot; as you may already know, is a  Duke Ellington composition, &quot;Better Get Hit in Yo' Soul&quot; is a  faster variation of &quot;Better Get It in Your Soul&quot; with a new  ending, &quot;Theme for Lester Young&quot; is an alternate title for  &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,&quot; and &quot;Hora Decubitus&quot; sounds  really familiar, like something off of Mingus Ah Um, but I can't place what  it is.  All of these pieces, except &quot;Mood Indigo,&quot; are available  elsewhere in varying forms, though, from what I can tell, this is a pattern  among Mingus' recordings.  That leaves only &quot;I X Love&quot; and  &quot;Celia&quot; as surprises (unless they too are recorded elsewhere, but  I have not seen or heard them).<br />All of these tracks are also available on  a budget priced introduction to Mingus on the MCA label, which is about  $4-5 cheaper than this album, and it includes the first section of  &quot;Black Saint and the Sinner Lady&quot; and, I believe, a piece from  Mingus' solo piano album.  However, there is a bonus track on Mingus X5,  &quot;Freedom,&quot; which is not listed above and is not on the original  album or budget priced CD, and is a rousing contribution to the album as a  whole and to the Mingus Catalog.
078322706X|5.0|It was so touching.  I love it, there's nothing else to say about it.  It's just a perfectly sad and romantic movie.
B0000004V2|5.0|at the time of this albums release it spawned not only a brand new sound but a culture as well. british rock had suffered mortal blows to its ego before the arrival of this debut album. it was rescued from the tiring  banality of groups like duran duran and abc. the songwriting team of  brown/squire combine sweet melodies and lyrics which consider the  intangible things we all long for but arent quite sure how to express. im  not sure if i could explain what these feelings are but that is the  esoteric nature of it. i know i feel whole again after one listen. the  words flow out of Ian Brown's mouth with such grace and beauty and the  melliflous tones of John Squire's guitar are sonically abberated. those two  elements are as perfectly matched as sugar and spice. long live the roses  and madchester!
B00000HZFP|5.0|I ran out to buy the CD on the day it came out, but I wasn't sure if the music would hold up outside the incredible theatrical experience I had last year while seeing the show. Well, it does. I have been playing the CD over  and over again, and enjoying it more each time. I can't wait to go back and  catch the show again. Some of the most rocking and yet touching music to  come out of musical theater in a long, long, time.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|This album shows how my favorite Orange county punk-rock outfit is getting progressively worse with each big label release.  Ever since they left Epitaph their music has been going downhill.  Ixnay on the Hombre was a  halfway decent cd, but Americana is outright pathetic in comparison to the  Offspring's all-time greats SMASH and Ignition.<br />The only reason I gave  this record the second star  is because the first two songs on this cd are  great, if not inspired.  The remainder of the album, however, is awful.   &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot;?  I guess that's how the Offspring  sees themselves these days.  Too bad I don't.
6303122876|5.0|The Dark Crystal is simply fantasy at it's best. The storyline is enthralling, the characters are highly imaginative and the villains are almost creepy. The ending will totally blow your mind away. All-too rarely  do Hollywood's producers surprise an audience with an ending like this. I  loved it as a child, and I love it even more as a budding writer. If you  like fantasy or even a just plain great story, check this movie out!
B000002UY5|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's of All-time.  Shannon Hoon wasn't blessed with the best voice,  but it is distinctive.  Shannon's songwriting is uncomparable.  It's not often that you can find a great CD that endures  even as your tastes change, but this one will always be one of my  favorites.
B00000FCBC|5.0|if you like metal you must buy this cd it is like prayers for metal fan
B000003N89|5.0|Diana is much more feminine on this album than on her others.<br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams alone is worth the price.<br />This was my favorite album of 1997.
B000003TBP|3.0|After the release of Odelay, Beck was compared to everyone from Bob Dylan to David Bowie.  However, even though this cd isnt bad, it definately doesnt live up the hype that surrounds it. While songs like &quot;devils  haircut&quot; and &quot;jackass&quot; are good, theyre not great. Most  tracks find themselves weighed under by overproduction and some sound  almost amatuerish at best. Dont get me wrong, this cd isnt bad, its just  not that good either. If looking for something to purchase by Beck, start  with Mellow Gold and work your way from there...
0345403959|4.0|Let me start off simple.  I liked this book.  While it will not satisfy that demon in you that wants realism and balltes and betrayal that is believable, it is a rather humorous account that spans an incredible amount  of time, which is interesting, being read by us humans who have so little  of it in the scheme of things.  Eddings manages to contain well-placed  humor and seriousness within this book that draws you in.  While Belgarath  the Sorceror will not go down in history as one of the best fantasy books,  neither will it's author, who is normally only meager at best.  But this is  quite realistically one of his greatest works and worth a look.
B000000WAC|4.0|without the restraints of the pressure an official  bowie release brings on, david bowie cuts loose offering very elegant, melodic tunes that come through where so many recent releases have failed.  the opening track is  pop at it's most synergistic, flowing from bowie and collaborator kizilcay  effortlessly.  tracks 2 and 3 are the only weak points, but 4 is a return  to the instrumental brilliance exhibited confidently on low and heroes.   each remaining track emerges fully formed as a music thought process,  working on the subconscious through almost excesive keyboard use and  opulent rhythms, while seducing the senses with subtle, yet catchy  melodies.  all in all, this album is a tremendous example of bowie's  capacity to develop complex, innovative songs with pop aesthetics.  a final  warning: stay away if its heavy rock music you seek; this album is firmly  ensconced in berlin territory.
B000009DUY|5.0|I Bought this soundtrack about 3 months after I saw the movie. It took me a little while but i really started to enjoy it.All of the songs wonderfully written and performed. Like Hymn To The Fallen it is so moving  and sad that i absolutly love it when just the drums set in then the french  horns it all so good and Revisiting Normandy The saddest part in the song  is when the violin in playing.I am so glad that Steven Spielberg asked John  Williams to write and perform the score it is nominated for best score.God  hope it wins because it really derserves to win bacause it is such a  wonderful soundtrack
B0000025VI|4.0|SRV's exploration of the 12-bar blues is wonderful! The boy could GO and he shows it-almost unbelievable playing, especially for an as  yet unsigned artist. He is laying the foundation for things to come on this album.
6303184499|2.0|Fuckyo

067942850X|5.0|This book has the potential to change your outlook on life- and perhaps life itself
6303686796|1.0|I have seen a lot of movies, some good and some bad, but I have never seen one as over rated as this one.  I wish someone would tell me why it is good.  It is absolutely stupid.  The script, story line, the entire movie  is all bad!!!! If you value your sanity, don't watch it.
B000002ULS|5.0|I have never encountered a more beautifully fluid album as &quot;Sinister&quot;. Delicate but commanding, I cannot imagine any other vocals doing justice to the wonderfully crafted lyrics. This album will  speed up your heart, give you goosebumps, and, if you concentrate on it at  all, bring tears to your eyes.
B00000373U|5.0|Elliott Smith is one of those all too rare artists who is honest, talented and deeply moving to any deserving listner.  Either/or, his third album is delicate and beautifull.  The variety of fragile, tragic songs like  &quot;Alameda&quot; along with endearingly happy songs like &quot;Say  Yes&quot; leave the listner gripping every note and chershing the gift he  dared to share.
B0000029AP|5.0|Its impossible to choose Aerosmith's best album, but this one definately is up there.  I'm only in my teens, and hadn't really been exposed to earlier Aerosmith at first.  But the first time i heard this album, i knew  it was great.  Every song is strong, from the bluesy Big Ten Inch Record,  to the classic Sweet Emotion to the quiescently explosive You See Me  Crying, and who can forget Walk This Way, simply the biggest hit aerosmith  has ever had, yes it was bigger than Dream On, Sweet Emotion, Crazy, and  Pink... give it a listen, pick up a copy &lt;or 2&gt;
6305252521|4.0|The main character in The Truman Show is not Truman, the character played by Jim Carrey.  The main character is really Christophe, played to ultra-pretentious perfection by Ed Harris.<br />As I watched this movie, it  slowly dawned on me that Truman represents the 'real people' that media  types talk about (as if they are not real at all), and that Christophe  represents the people who think they create the reality that regular people  live in.<br />I suspect there is a huge undertow of anxiety in the media elite  as they become increasingly estranged from real reality while they create a  marketable, pseudo-reality for us all. They know that they, like  Christophe, are not God.  Some of them, like Christophe, are terrified that  we will find them out.  And some of them, like Christophe's assistants, are  terrified that we won't.
B00000DBXL|5.0|Cake prolongs their magic with yet another hit recording.  The group just continues to get better with each new recording they put out.        The CD contains mega-radio hit &quot;Never There,&quot; but also features such  infectious songs as &quot;Satan Is My Motor,&quot; &quot;Alpha Beta Parking  Lot,&quot; and &quot;Cool Blue Reason.&quot;  I find myself singing all  these songs out loud at work every single day.  They're just songs that  easily stick in your head.        A few years from now, Cake may be  considered the best band to come out of the 1990's.
6300216365|5.0|This movie isn't quite in the same league as Woody Allen's greatest work but it's wonderful nonetheless.  The scene where Woody nervously makes an jackass out of himself on a blind date is a true classic and should be  required viewing by anyone who really blew it with someone they were trying  to impress.
0140277447|5.0|I saw the purpose of this book as an attempt to draw attention to a horrific event that the world has overlooked.  A more dispassionate, scholarly account of this tragedy would not have gotten anyone's attention.   I find it interesting that people still want the author to &quot;dress  up&quot; the events that happened to make them more palatable. Had she done  so, this book would have landed on the back shelves of a few Universities.
6302800420|5.0|This movie is one of those rare miracles that Hollywood just can't pull off often enough.  The combination of acting and writing is unmatched in any comedy since.
044022165X|5.0|Anyone looking for a book that has everything should look no further. This book tells you all about the life of lawyers. It was so great, and it made me want to become a lawyer.
6304057709|5.0|Since I am a Jane Austen fan, the most wonderful thing to me about this film is the way that Emma Thompson remained loyal to the novel.  Her screenplay absolutely captures Austen's dry humor.  This film is such a  treasure.  I bought it and watch it all of the time.  I would reccomend it  to anyone who loves a good story full of wonderful characters.  It is a  timeless story.
B000002JBG|5.0|This is a great CD. It has Grammy nominee R. Kelly on it with his kick butt song &quot;I believe I can fly&quot; It aslo has about 7 other great songs on it.
6305078564|4.0|This mini-series, produced by the BBC and A&amp;M network, is quite simply the best of its genre ever produced.  The electricity and tension between the two main characters is impossible to miss, resulting in a period drama  which will satisfy the most ardent fans of romantic fiction. It quite  simply should not be missed. Unfortunately, the picture quality is very  disappointing being only on par with a good quality VHS recording.  This is  inexcusable given the quality of the original broadcast. So is it worth  buying on DVD, rather than the less expensive VHS version? Yes. This is a  superb production of a timeless love story, an you will watch it again and  again. DVD is the only format that will keep the performance fresh for  years and years to come.

6303921248|5.0|I've seen this movie countless times and have yet to get tired of it.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle do a WONDERFUL job with this movie!  I've yet to find a better movie - and I promise that it is well worth setting aside  a day to watch this.  While you're at it, invite your friends over to watch  it with you - they'll be thankful to you for introducing them to Pride and  Prejudice!  :)

1853260983|5.0|I remember having read this book in  high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately,  though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of  the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which  was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and  perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember  the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been  about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common  practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I  sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I  was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see  what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the  pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any  story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22,  and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children,  perhaps? And this is among my very best.
006109594X|1.0|The author is certainly an expert on U.S. and British naval policies and procedures, but the book ultimately fizzles. For a country (ultimately identified) and/or a world leader (ultimately identified) to use a nuclear  weapon against the United States, and suffer no comparable retaliation, is  just plain silly.
6304712499|1.0|I expected an adult movie, as dark and cynic as the comics. What I saw was a children's film, with a ridiculous story and silly dialogues. Are there no more science-fiction movies for people older than eight ? I liked the  special effects and the soundtrack, but this film will be evidence for  everybody to claim that science-fiction and comics are for simple-minded  people. For a few moments it creates a sinister atmosphere like &quot;The  Crow&quot;, but most times &quot;Spawn&quot; is very disappointing.
B000007T1M|5.0|probably one of rocks best albums last year.  S.O.A.D combines armenian folk beats with brutal korn-like metal, and fused it into a nuclei that destroys anythng in its path.  Vocalist Serj Tankian is insane,  his vocals  go from a quiet whisper to schizophrenic madness.  I have seen the band  perform live and they have captured all of their charisma into the disk.  Songs to look for on the disk are Sugar,War?, suggestions, Soil. and  Ddevil, allthough all the songs are great these are some of the highlights.   Even rarer songs like marmalade are good though hard to find.  so if you  wanna try a heavy band out or love metal, give system of a down a chance,  im sure they will blow you away!!!!
B000001DTM|5.0|This might be U2's best album.  It was the one on which they took the longest chances - their most radical departure.  Although I generally prefer their earlier albums, it's hard for me not to be impressed by how  well they pulled off such a new sound.  Standouts include &quot;Zoo  Station&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, and &quot;One&quot;, which is  kind of fusion of their earlier sound and their later more techno-oriented  sound.

0767802659|5.0|C'mon, I know Titanic was expensive, but the special effects in this movie are state of the art (simply the best I've ever seen). But, since Titanic was more expensive. The special effects aren't the only thing, the  screenplay is incredible and the actors are &quot;acceptable&quot;. And the  actors are well-chosen ones. Michalel Ironside is simply incredible with  his army sadistical look, and Casper Van Dien was &quot;a good  soldier&quot;. I saw this movie four times and I didn't get bored, 'cause  the action is unstoppable. It's just shooting and flying, but with style.  And the bugs... oh the bugs. I'm sure you wouldn't like to meet a Tanker  Bug face to face, hehehe.
0060920386|5.0|While the authors concentrate on the story of  RJR Nabisco, you can't help but get an insight into the firms that specialize in LBO's.  The book focuses on Ross Johnson and provides a fascinating portrait of the CEO of  the 80's.
067158037X|5.0|I would never dare waste your time with my review of any book, except this one - you owe it to yourself to listen to this man's account of his rise from child to man.  An honest hard look at himself.  He has a rare talent  for capturing the innocence of the child becoming aware.  His voice is a  delight to hear, the songs, the emphasis is remarkable.
038533348X|5.0|I spend a lot of time reading, being in college.  And I must say, that this book was one of the most powerfully disturbing books I've read in a long time.  I highly recommend this book to everyone who's ever had the  slightest inkling about the future of the world...this book might just keep  you up at night...

B000000WG4|5.0|I first heard this album in 1973, and have since worn out an 8-track, vinyl, and cassette!  I now have the CD and still play it for hours on end, after 26 years and close to 1000 times.  This is the music that takes me  back to that passionate time when I grew from adolescence to adulthood, and  the memories of old times and old friends do not fade as I continue to  enjoy this transcendental music.
B000009EAD|5.0|If you are looking for something fresh and exciting when it comes to metal look no further.  Iced Earth is the most important metal band to come out of the 1990's.  At times heavy rocking and at other times subtly eloquent,  Something Wicked this Way Comes deserves the ear of every skeptic.  If you  try only one new artist this year, let it be Iced Earth!

B000001GK9|5.0|This live recording, first released in the infancy of CD (and in direct competition with Karajan's own studio version released mere months before) is a must-have for anyone interested in Mahler (or in early 20th Century  music, for that matter).  It is beyond riviting and approaching obsesive,  as this music requires.  The rerelease of this early CD has improved the  sound somewhat.  (Yes, I liked it enough to have purchased it again.)  Of  course, if you are allergic to live performances, stay away.  I'm one of  those people who can ignore minor flubs and weird ambient sonic events in  favor of the frission between performers and audience which comes through  in a good &quot;live&quot; recording.  My one gripe is that not enough  attention has been paid to the studio version issued at about the same  time.  The two performenances are different, but I am hard-pressed to say  that one is better than the other.  If anything, in my estimation, the  studio version is even more bleak in its own way than the live version.   Perhaps this is offputting to some.  I find it appropriate to the music and  quite compelling.  Of course, the playing is unmatched.  The closest thing  to these performances I ever experienced was a concert performance  conducted by Guilini in Chicago when he was the Principal Guest Conductor  of the CSO, and that was way back in the Solti glory days when half the  orchestra (and most of the brass) was composed of Reiner recruits.  Get the  live Karajan, but if you haven't heard the studio version, seek it out.
0767805712|5.0|GREAT!!!!!! ORIGINAL!!!!!!
6301777387|5.0|Although this wickedly funny satire on political culture during the Vietnam War has enduring value, this reviewer finds another aspect of M.A.S.H. to be a quite amusing comment on contemporary culture.  The movie,  when originally released, was rated P.G.  With the rising tide of  conservative intolerance in the land, this fine flick is now rated R.  The  leftist satire still has a bite, and the young must be protected from it,  lest they come to question increasingly the dominant political culture the  way a minority of their parents did!
6301390725|5.0|I watch this movie every chance I have. The dancing clothes are soo funny! And when they're at the bottom of the sea and the soccer game. This is a great movie for younger childeren.
0060977493|5.0|Impossible to put down. It draws you in with an ending and you are compelled to plow forward through the past to understand how the ending was created.  Lyrical, passionate, and ultimately heart-wrenching.  Arundhati  Roy has exposed the reality of the human spirit - innocent imperfection -  and I am patiently waiting for her to deliver a second novel in which to  fall in love with.
0451191153|3.0|Why are all the protagonists in Ayn Rand's novels male?  And with a female playing against him or submissively joining him, etc.?  Is Ayn Rand really a man or is it the sign of the times or what?  It seems that it would make  much more sense if Rand had made the protagonist a female.
6301871952|5.0|Gremlins was great,Gremlins 2 was better! The fun just won't let up!I remember when I was eight I was a huge gremlins fan and then Gremlins 2 hit the big screen! My mom called the theater and asked what was playing and  they said Gremlins 2. So we hurried over, sat down and as Bugs bunny says  &quot;roll'em&quot; and the title &quot;Gremlins 2the new batch&quot; comes  on to the screen I wanted to leap with joy! I hadn't been to the theater  that much before and it was wierd seeing these creatures on the big  screen.It was wonderful! If you haven't seen it before I suggest you watch  it! There are lots of cameo's in this movie, watch out for Henry Gibson (my  personal favorite actor) and Jerry Goldsmith who did the wonderfully zany  score to this movie! watch it,then watch it again,watch it,then watch it  again...
6305177473|4.0|I Rented this after one of my friends told me about this he said it was'nt half bad.So i rented it last weekend i rather enjoyed it Lindsay Lohan is quite good. The scenery is is effective and the performances are all good.  I rather enjoyed Lisa Ann Walters Performance which very funny and the pace  of this movie is very fast for 128 mins of fun and romance.
B000003AEB|4.0|I hate rap...and I'm a metalhead...and I think Snoop Doggy Dogg's first album is hilarious, funky, and awesome...I hate new Snoop, he sold out, but this album is classic!!!  Check out &quot;Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't  Have None)&quot;!
B000002UWF|5.0|These cats can swing!  This CD has a strong, tight band that nothing less then hot.  Prima adds wonderful humor, and a style that is truly his own.  I concur with the above reviews praising Prima and this CD.
B000001Y5D|5.0|Although its been quite a few years I bought this CD, I always enjoy listening to it. I think there are so many different styles that everyone should find a song who he likes. So it is just great!!
0790725657|3.0|I like the movie well enough for what it is, but it's not as good as 1993's &quot;The Secret Garden.&quot;  The girl who played Sarah Crewe did a wonderful job.  She gave her character a lot of spunk and energy.
B00000DLVA|5.0|...but this album sounds remarkably like one of my favorite bands - Portishead. Songs like &quot;Paralyzed&quot; and &quot;Marvel Hill&quot; (which you can listen to above) are exceptional songs with good beats and  creepy backgrounds. I think that it's really great that the Cardigans no  longer sound all &quot;up-beat&quot; because their new style is much more  refreshing and shows their mature side much better. I also became curious  about their new &quot;style&quot; when I bought the soundtrack to the  X-Files movie and listened to an awesome song by them that was titled  &quot;Deuce.&quot; It is cool. &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; is a great piece of  work that, in my opinion, bears a better and more attricting group that  what you would find on &quot;First Band on the Moon.&quot; This album is  great for all lovers of dark trip-hop. grade: A
6303481272|4.0|Okay, I'm not going to go into the plot too much because people already have. The fight scenes are amazing, and the plot is better than the vast majority of anime. The only thing that stops me from giving it a full 5  stars is that I've seen some anime that I liked better. &quot;Fatal Fury:  The Motion Picture&quot; has equally good fight scenes, and was quite  simalar to Ninja Scroll, but I liked it a bit more. This anime is well  worth buying however, and is a valuable addition to any anime collection.
B000000W6F|5.0|I bought this album to complete my collection of Smashing Pumkins CD's and was surprised to discover their best album. Every song is great. I could'nt think of a better way to spend your money. Buy it now!
B00000064G|5.0|...I think this is the one you want.  Gone are the ornate, flowery string arrangements of his first two studio alblums--piano on the title track is the only other instrumentation besides Nick's guitar.  Very much present,  however, are Nick's most focused songwritting and beautiful tunes. Songs  like 'Road', 'Things Behind the Sun', and the surprisingly optomistic  closer 'From the Morning' are clearly among his strongest. And sans the  sugary string arrangements of previous work, which in some songs works for  me and in others is just too maudlin, this is Nick Drake stripped bare of  any and all distractions.  This is a short, sad, beautiful album.
630521610X|4.0|I don't know how good the original DVD of Scream is but I do know it has the commentary on it. All this one has is a bunch of Trailers and TV ad's and some lame a** behind the scene's footage. I can't find the special  effects gallery, maybe i'm retarted or something. Now don't get me wrong I  think SCREAM was a bad a** flick but when I spend $40 on a DVD I want some  nude pic's or Rose Mcgowan or something. To sum it up if you want to save  money just get the original&gt;at least it has the commentary.
B000000OUJ|5.0|whoever gave this album one star must have high or something.  GZA's lyrics are amazing, and the RZA is the best producer in the world.  It's thematically tight and musically fascinating.
1567184855|5.0|This book, obviously very popular, is so because rather than providing a fabricated explanation of what we really are, it serves as a reminder of what we already know. If you can read this book without being struck by a  strong sense of recognition, then you are probably very new. Even so, this  book exists because it is time for us to remember.
6303443214|2.0|Whoever said that Brad Pitt could act is an idiot. I first saw the movie, and read the the book.  I found the book more interesting than the movie.  I dont like the fact that hollywood makes up characters instead of  following the characters in the book, example who in the hell is the widow  Ste. Claire.  What happened to Freneire.Tom Cruise was a passable Lestat,  but Pitt as Louis, I felt was dragging thru the scenes.It felt like he  didnt want to play in a movie with gay undertones.  He even had the nerve  to criticize Rice's Vampire Chronicles.  How it left him depressed.  If you  ask me nothing was more depressing than watching this actor portraying the  beautiful Louis.  Cruise is just to full of himself to portay Lestat.   Banderas was not a convincing Armand.  The only real good character here  was Dunst as Claudia.  Another thing is the next time they should use  younger actors to portray these characters.
B000000OF6|4.0|Several colleagues and I were sitting in a restaurant talking about music we listened to while growing up.  We grew up in different parts of the world, yet we all knew several songs by one band - Queen, and all of them  are in this CD set. One of the few rock bands that I'll remember always,  and this set has all the favorites.
B00000DD2D|5.0|I found out about this disc from the Amazon recommendation list.  It is outstanding!  Not a weak cut on the entire disc. I especially like the 3 Mick and Keith cuts. (I wish the Stones would do more songs like these.)   Sorry to read that Jimmy Rogers passed away before this disc was released.   As it turns out this will be remembered as a fitting tribute to a true  blues legend.
6302136105|1.0|When I heard that Stone was going to make the movie I was excited, but very disappointed in the movie.  It failed to capture the essence of Jim Morrison the man.  His life and the fact that he was more beautiful than  the actor who portrayed him.  As a doors fan from the 60&quot;s, Kilmer  didnt play Jim as convincingly.  He wasnt as beautiful as Jim.  Ryan as  Pamela was boring.  She had more dye in her hair than Pamela ever did.  The  rest of the doors were not as defined as well as they should have been.   Jim had a troubled life, but where in the hell did the bald guy come  from,what was up with him.
0606026347|5.0|This book is great!!! It is nice, funny, hilarious and enchanting!! It is about a guy named Mr Hoppy and a lady named Mrs Silver. Mr Hoppy tricks Mrs Silver into marrying him by replacing her pet Alfie with other turtles that  are only two ounces more than the previous turtle. In the end, Mrs Silver  wants Alfie to be smaller. Mr hoppy gives her another magic word paper  (like he did in the beginning) and then replaces the other turtle with  Alfie. &quot;Will you marry me.&quot; &quot;Oh! Yes, my dear!!&quot; they  both say to each other. One day, a little girl buys Alfie and Mr and Mrs  Hoppy live happily ever after. I recomend this book to any English or  American person!!!!!!Esio trot (tortoise) is by far                     !!!THE BEST!!!
B0000026TD|5.0|In one expression, I love this album. New efforts were made for this recording, I feel. In particular, piano was effectively employed for the first time, as long as I know. Andreas is ingenious in expressing his  emotion and feeling with mixing-up of various instruments. With Grammy  awarded &quot;Down to the moon&quot;, this is my favorite. Don't say  anything about Andreas before trying this CD!
6305177473|5.0|This movie is very good! It is good for a family night, a sleep-over with a friend, or slumber party!
B00000FBRE|5.0|well, I definitely think this is their best album yet...the whole cd is just *GrEaT*....all the songs,all the lyrics....Lagwagon is definitely one of the best punk bands out there....:)
B00000G3PA|1.0|An awful movie with no taste at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6305297525|5.0|If you wondering the other is Contact(1997) starring Jodie Foster, but you can read my review there if you want to know why.  Besides being a Robin Williams fan, this movie was great even if he wasn't in it.  The visual  effects are incredible(it was nominated for two Oscars for them) and the  picture it creates of the afterlife is one I have never imagined.  I  especially like the explanation of what happens to suicides, which if  you're further interested in that or any other &quot;theory&quot; in this  movie you can read MUCH more in detail in the book version by Robert  Matheson.  The movie is much different from the book, but also much better.   The plot includes a lot about before he and she goes to heaven and hell.   Personally, this movie has one of the greatest beginnings and endings I  have ever seen.
044022165X|5.0|Grisham is the best author ever born. The plots to his stories are so compelling. This book puts you in touch with &quot;The Real World&quot; and attaches you emotionally with each character.
0517122707|5.0|This book is, without a doubt, one of the most beautifully drawn character studies I have ever seen.  Reading it was alternately excruciating and hilarious.  Ignatius was so well-developed and complete, so wonderfully  morally ambiguous.  I cannot recommend this book enough.
6302869390|5.0|The Eastern (India) Music is so quickly and perfectly delivered, it is hard for the eye to follow the hand of these great artists. George Harrison is fantastic, right after release of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.  Billy Preston and Leon Russell each have a terrific number. Peter Hamm of  Badfinger with Harrison in &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; and Leon and  George singing backup for Bob Dylan in &quot;Just Like A Woman&quot;, are a  thrill.
B000001FV3|5.0|Although I do acknowledge the clashing moods of some of these tracks, I would contend that it is simply a testimonial to the diversity of the members of this band.  It was once hard for me to understand how Steve  Winwood metamorphasized into a lame 80's pop artist, but the talents of  Wood, Capaldi, and Mason cause it all to make sense.
0800184327|5.0|I was enraptured by Dance With Me.  I have rented it 5 times and watched it too many times to count.Chayanne - WOW! What can I say!  Can't wait to see more of him.  I bought the soundtrack and two of Chayanne's CDs.  The  song &quot;You Are My Home&quot;, a duet by Chayanne and Vanessa has become  one of my all time favorite songs.  Chayanne is multi-talented, just as  Vanessa Williams is.  They make a wonderful couple.
B000000W5B|5.0|Coming right after what is arguably the most transcendant string of blues-rock produced since Muddy Waters (Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main Street), it's hard at first not to be  disappointed. But cut the boys some slack. The song that sums it up I think  is &quot;Coming Down Again&quot; , as this largely downtempo opus has the  band coming down from that coke and slide guitar rush that produced the  forementioned  chef d'oeuvres. Despite some well-produced but  (for the  Stones) mediocre cuts (Dancing with Mr. D - very danceable, but maudlin  lyrics; Silver Train, a boring rehash of the soaring All Down the Line;  Starf--er, an amusing Chuck Berry clone a la Stones, Hide Your Love - nice  try Mick) there are some truly haunting, exquisitely beautiful cuts -  Coming Down Again (thanks Keith for finally putting that into song for us  all ), Winter (with its wistful beautiful imagery), Can You Hear the Music?  (innocent and exotic), and, of course, the bittersweet Angie. The cut that  keeps growing on me (much like the vastly underrated Sway from Sticky  Fingers) is 100 Years Ago - dramatically seguing from sweet ballad to  country funk and finally into the hard-edged bitter blues of Taylor's  wailing guitar. But the high point of the album is Heartbreaker - what  passion, what pure heart and anger - and Taylor's never been better  (except, perhaps, in Sway and Time Waits for Noone). A different album,  with moments to cherish. Keith's smack habit's taken its toll on his guitar  and voice, so musically this one's the Jagger and Taylor show (and of  course, the bedrock of  Watts).  It's grown on me and I think will grow on  you.
B000007T1M|4.0|I think this tape is good. It sounds to me like it would be  played at the Espn Extreme Games. This is because I think it could get the athletes going, and get them fired up.
0783225970|5.0|A must se
B000002H33|5.0|This has to be the fastest album Metallica has put out. &quot;Battery&quot; is my personal all time fave, and if you listen to it, you'll know why. This album has something for everyone. For the speed  lovers there's &quot;Battery&quot; &amp; &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot;, for  those who like depth and slower songs, there's &quot;Welcome Home  (Sanitarium)&quot; and &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot;. Plus  &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; &amp; &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;, two more  classics. Theres also the instrumental masterpiece, &quot;Orion&quot;, that  shows just how refined Metallica really is. Overall, a great, if not the  greatest, classic Metallica album!
B000002O4S|5.0|This CD really brought me back to the movie.  The terrific songs and wonderful instumentals put scenes from this fantastic movie back in mind.
B00000253N|4.0|I grew up with Dylan, listening mostly to the classics lke maggies farm, Like a Rolling Stone and tambourine man, but, after a long hiatus from his poetry and music, I was driving in my car after having dealt with a tough  fight with my wife of 25 years, when I heard the song &quot;Shelter From  the Storm&quot; after which I actually found the reason I needed to not  only fall in love again, but to actually pick up the acoustic guitar again  and start to play.  That has to mean something about his talent, Lay lady  lay, is also quite special.  Dylan wil no doubt be cool again, just you  wait and see.<br />Steve Castellanos stevencpr@aol.com
B000002O4S|5.0|This is a really great soundtrack! &quot;The Power of Love&quot; &quot;Back in Time&quot; and &quot;Heaven is One Step Away&quot; are all winners on this track. The instrumentals are beautiful too. And those old  fifties tunes put you back in the do-wop decade. This is a great CD from a  Great movie!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|cool it has all the good song
0780623703|5.0|Pleasantville is a masterpiece of cinema
006016848X|3.0|A rather simplistic approach that offers a minimum level of insight into the differences between men and women.  Read it at face value and don't expect a real enlightening experience. Readers interested in a more  insightful view of how men and women differ in their view of sex and  relationships should read FRIED CALAMARI, a well written, funny novel  between a man and a woman on a first date sharing their views of sex and  relationships.
B000005DQR|5.0|I picked this up in an awkward decision between Endotrucing, Marilyn Manson, and Spawn (I was trying to find something new, instead of normal rock or pop). Anyway, the cover wasn't intrestng, the liner notes weren't  intresting, the actual CD was kinda brown and I wasn't very excited. As I  popped it in my CD player, I just kept reminding myself that some kid named  Josh was on Spin's &quot;Top 40 artists of 1997&quot;. WOW! THIS CD IS  AMAZING. It's not for everyone, but is a collection of breaks, scratching,  samples, funk, and a whole lot of drums. The best tracks are Track 2,  &quot;The Number Game&quot;, and &quot;Stem/Long Stem&quot;. And as a  novelty, &quot;Why Hip Hop Sucks in '96&quot; represents my sentiment  exactly. BUY ENDTRODUCING... NOW!!!
1568495110|5.0|i love this book. the language is my favorite part, it never gave me any trouble, and after the first couple of chapters you understand it as good as english. i could not put this book down and finished it the day i got  it. the last chapter was great and brought the whole story together.  burgess is one of my favorite authors and i love the way this book makes us  think about not only free will and the boundries of society, but also about  growing up and maturing. amen. and all that cal.
6305169187|2.0|I thing Armageddon had a good idea when it started, but it went downhill.  I think that the movie is too long and drawn out.  It would be uch better if it was 2 hours.  Also, what the NASA people say would happen if the rock  came crashing down to Earth is an understatement.  Aswell as the number of  nukes it took to blow up the asteroid.  1 nuke do destroy a rock the size  of Texas!?  It would take a lot more than that.  In Deep Impact 4 or 5 did  not do the job for a six mile long comet.  Also when the two shuttles are  flying so close, the egsaust would probly tear parts of the other's hull  apart.  A good idea, but too long with too many scientific errors.
B000002C2E|5.0|Dark, brooding, desperate, intense, moody, exciting, hopeful...it goes on. Can be favorably compared with anything Dylan has ever put out before....
B0000019PA|5.0|Only true musicians can express their compelling souls through the music that they write. A voice is a voice, but a message is something that only stong ones can deliver. Those who say bad things about this album have only  given harsh remarks about the singer's voice. But what is the importance  here? If your kind heart can bare to let the words soak in, you will have  all the emotions intended by Jeff when he wrote the songs in the first  place.
0767811038|5.0|&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has great action, graphics, and sound.  The effects are the best I've seen so far.  The movie touches real issues of society, but in a more futuristic state.  It makes you think and most  action movies don't give that chance.  The movie is probably best for  people who like action, thrillers, and gore.  As far as the less inteligent  parts of people goes.  The movie also, has alot of substance though so if  you're not into action you can still enjoy the movie.  At one point  everyone should see this movie.
0385493800|2.0|This is the first Grisham book that took me a week to finish. The plot was dull and predictable; the characters sparsely and hastily sketched. Just because he took a trip to Brazil doesn't mean it's fodder for an adventure  novel.I miss the twists and turns and tension I found in his last books.
B000000WCV|4.0|Great dance music. I would recommend this CD to any disco lover or any 80's techno remix lover. Unfortunately, I think the CD is not a very good deal pricewise because it takes a sharp dive AFTER song 7 (which Around The  World, which is my favorite). I really only like songs 4, 5, 6, and 7 (but  I really like them). Songs 8 and up sound like a different band (these  later songs are hard industrial sounding).
0792151720|4.0|I saw Titanic 3x's in theaters and 6x's at home, i love this movie!
0800184327|5.0|It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a movie so much that I watched it everyday for almost a week!! I had to stop or my husband was going to wonder if I had gone crazy!! How can you help it when Chayanne and Vanessa  light up the screen like that?? I just wish that the credits weren't all  rolling by while they were finally able to &quot;consummate&quot; their  relationship!! Wow was this one hot!! My husband and I have signed up for  Latin dancing lessons and I can't wait!! This will be in my collection!!
B000002U9L|5.0|It so hard to separate the movie with the music because it's such a big part of the movie (duh, its a musical).Pretty much if you loved the movie you'll probably run out to get the soundtrack. Even as a David Bowie fan,  good transition to children's musical.
B000002UAU|5.0|I think that this album is an overall winner, with songs like &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;, &quot;Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; and &quot;Within You, Without You.&quot;  I absolutely love it, and also, if  that's not enough, you can always have fun looking for Paul death clues.  I  reccommend this to anyone who enjoys good-yet-interestingly-weird music.
6304145225|5.0|This is, in my opinion, anyway, one of the best movies I've ever seen! Great special effects, acting, and music!
B000002KMY|3.0|Riding on the tidal wave that was &quot;Heaven and Hell,&quot;  I expected another masterwork from Sabbath (w/ Dio) on this one.  Primarily this runs the same blueprint as H&amp;H, with more structural complexity as well as  peaks and valleys.  However, this does not make for a better album here  because the songs, and more specifically the riffs, are not as strong nor  as memborable as on their last.  Geezer's bass playing is still  outstanding, the best single attribute of this record.  New percussionist  Vinny Appice does a fine job, and I really like his licks on &quot;Slipping  Away&quot; even if the song itself is dopey for Sabbath.  I lean towards  the goth rockers, &quot;Sign of the Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;Falling  Off the Edge of the World&quot; for some needed inspiration in the guitar  &quot;brood&quot; department.  But awh shucks, &quot;Country Girl&quot;  could have been written by Ronnie back in his days with Elf!  Not a bad  song, not a bad riff... but it does not belong on a Sab release.   &quot;Turn up the Night&quot; doesn't do much for me either, sounding too  mainstream, straight-forward, and hell, too much like &quot;Neon  Knights&quot; for me to accept as a good song.  RJD is definitely working  his mystical vision here.  The swords and sorcery imagery is practically  overruling the feel of the record, but not in a bad way.  It reminds me of  what Rainbow might have sounded like if Ritchie had turned evil and  downtuned his guitar an octave. At any rate, this album song for song is  not as strong as Heaven and Hell but maintains its predecesor's  rejuvenation from the increasing lame late-era Ozzy days.  Play this one on  a stormy night when you have no ambition, hope, or booze.
6300214435|4.0|If it stood alone it would be a stunning movie, but when compared to the other two it pales in comparison, especially to Raiders. One thing about the movie I didn't like was that Indy was much more Han Solo-like than in  the others. He was in it for his own &quot;fortune and glory&quot; and not  for archeology and Right like in Raiders.
6304117752|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was 5 years old.  Although I didn't understand what an abbey was, or why Maria was considered a problem, I loved the movie.  I recently bought this movie, and it has been all I  want to watch.  I love the songs &quot;Edelweiss&quot; and &quot;Something  Good&quot;, which is sung when Maria and the Captain declared their love  for each other.  I reccommend this movie for anyone  who wants to see a  true classic.
B000002GMT|5.0|This abba c.d is the greatest c.d of all time, not only is it by abba (which is a straight away topper) but it is also appealing to people who have just heard abba
B00000DGUG|1.0|I bought my friend this for her birthday. I was sorry when I was forced to listen to it all during her birthday party.  Alanis has the worst voice I've ever heard.If I hear Alanis croak out Thank U one more time I will  scream. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
630518299X|5.0|Good Thing: Jim Carrey's performance is the best yet, with an exception to &quot;Doing Time on Maple Drive&quot;. A real breakthrough for him and he'll surely be recommended for practically any role in a movie.<br />Bad  Thing: Sadly, his performance doesn't seem enough for the Academy Awards.  He's not in the Best Actor category, not even nominated. But It'll probably  be made up if he wins other awards (i.e. Blockbuster Awards, MTV Movie  Awards, Kids' Choice Awards) Then again, maybe not. =)
6304056958|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Crawford is a winner at the man-stealer.  The color segment for the fashion show is superb!
B000005ILF|5.0|This is possibly my favorite album of Sting's.  As a writer, I'd have to compare him to Wordsworth.  &quot;I Was Brought to My Senses&quot; and &quot;La Belle Dame Sans Regrets&quot; show his awareness of the physical  world and its effect upon the person.  I also enjoy &quot;The Hounds of  Winter&quot;, &quot;I Hung My Head&quot;, and &quot;Mercury Falling&quot;.   Sting manages to use double entendres in these songs that create irony and  feeling for the listener towards his compelling characters.  He has grown  and matured from his angry days with The Police from songs like  &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; and &quot;Every Breath You  Take&quot;, but he retains the creative tapestry of words like in  &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; and &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot;.  Any true fan  of Sting should enjoy and treasure this album.
6305107122|5.0|This movie is great in pan &amp; scan.  Widescreen is even better.  Now you start with an exceptional movie, Digitally Remaster it, return it to its original widescreen format, add a documentary, trailer, TV and radio  spots, a still gallery, AND a 20th anniversary scrapbook, and you have the  best film ever made.
1573226521|5.0|I could not put this book down.  In fact, as soon as I finished the book, I flipped back to the beginning and read the first 40 pages again. I have lent the book to so many friends, and bought it for others, just so I can  talk to them about it.  This is an awesome book.  The best I have ever  read.
0783225199|5.0|A rather good movie about two brothers that want to save their childhood home, and go out and raise the money to save it.  The performances of Ackroyd and Belushi stand out.  But overall, the movie is just hilarious!
B00000G3PA|1.0|My brain hurt so much after seeing this movie and you want to know why?  I could not for the life of me recall a worst movie.  My God what have they done!
B000007T1M|5.0|buy it. its good. really good. comperable to slayer meets rage against the machine. fast riffs with political statement. one listen and you'll be hooked. if you don't believe me check out the samples and listen to  &quot;war?&quot;
0679428887|5.0|In his latest book Robert Harris takes the reader to present day Russia. He offers a grim description of the political and social situation of the once evil empire after the fall of communism. Nevertheless, the novel is a  historical thriller very much like its predessors FATHERLAND and ENIGMA.  This time Harris deals with a secret surrouding the former leader of the  USSR Josef Stalin, one of the darkest figures of 20th century`s history.  Packed with meticulous historical detail, ARCHANGEL makes us believe its  fiction to be true. High on suspension the book is a page turner from the  start. Very realistic.
0517543052|5.0|I really enjoyed this resource.<br />Great book for students of psychology, new age and nlp.<br />I liked the simplicity and style of this square sized tome.<br />You'll like the unique intro to Spirit.<br />It will lead you to many  doorways.
6300151379|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time when me daughter was a little girl.  Now when I have one of those days  I put it on grab my iced tea and just watch.  I find something new everytime I watch it.  I was really  disappointed to hear that this is no longer available on the market.  I  would truly love to have another copy as mine is very well worn.  I have  some nieces and nephews that would love it.  I hope they bring it back!
B000002NJS|4.0|Madonna never grabbed me until this one came out, but I'm a convert now! Maybe it has something to do with &quot;Evita&quot; and the work she put in for Alan Parker's film. Maybe I'm one of the few (in my part of the world  anyway) to have seen that movie several times, enjoying the extent to which  the director subverts an inane musical and catches the irony in a true tale  of an ugly dictatorship and a nation's heroine-worship. In company like  that, Madonna really learned to act, she learned to sing, and now she seems  to have found herself (sometimes -- from motherly love to &quot;Mer  Girl&quot; still sends shivers down the spine) and learned to do her own  thing. How well she does it. I never thought I'd buy a Madonna album, let  alone listen to it as much as I have, but then maybe I was  &quot;Frozen&quot; too! &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is a lesson in surviving  stardom. I hope Madonna's next tricks will be as different again. (I even  bought &quot;Evita&quot;, too; Madonna and the Parker magic remade it for  me.)--&quot;Le Loup&quot;, Paris.
B00000DMJF|2.0|The only reason i am giving this two stars is because the music is so good.  The Beatles albums were re-issued on CD in 1987, this was before much time was put into mastering.  For 1987, the sound was very good, but  for 1998, it's not.  So for a while I've been waiting for new re-issues of  beatles material.  I thought the day had come when I saw the words  [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] next to the white album.  So I bought it  and low and behold it sounds the same if not worse than the 1987 re-issue.   In fact, I suggest buying that one istead.  I also am pleading for Amazon  to remove the [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] from the title. It isn't,  don't be fooled.  If I had read a review like this I wouldn't have bought  it. I don't even know why they put remastered in the title, it doesn't say  it anywhere on the album. So anyway, if you have the other white album,  don't buy this one.  And EMI/Capitol, please remaster this great music.
6305066345|5.0|I love this movie. Definately one of my all-time favorites. If it isn't then the only thing that comes close is Glory. Also with Denzel Washington.  I love the way the story is told about an upcoming basketball star who  gets caught up in lots of trouble. It is an all-star movie. Check it out!  And if you don't have a stomach for graphic sex, violence, drug abuse, and  harsh language, please check out Glory. It is an excellent movie about a  black regiment in the Civil War. Possibly my favorite movie.

I never had the &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; album, but a  few of these tracks were lifted from it and I feel &quot;South Saturn  Delta&quot; stands up on its own two feet! Buy it!
0399143904|2.0|I've enjoyed all of Clancy's other works, especially the concise way he changes venues and characters.  This had very little of this.  Muddy character descriptions, almost no plot, just vaguely interconnected scenes,  (some that don't appear to connect until 2/3 through the book), and the  worst villians I've read in a long time.  His book reads like half  political diatribe and half like the first draft of Executive Decision.   This one should be missed completely and allow Mr. Clancy a chance to try  again, this time without the political undertones.
1564428117|5.0|Director John Carpenter uses Surprise, instead of buckets of blood, in the movie that set the trend for slasher films.  A goody-goody babysitter, faces the death of her friends, protecting the childern shes sitting for,  and the showdown vs. the maniac in the famous, haunting white mask.  A boy  murders his sister on Halloween night 1963, he is locked up for 15 years,  but escapes on Halloween Night 1978, and returns home.  The Music score  sets a very eerie mood, and will make you think twice about watching this  film alone in the dark!!!  &quot;You can't kill the Boogey Man!!!&quot;
B000000OSO|2.0|I give this 2 1/2 stars...why?...well, the ballads are ultra cheesy, and there are about 5 of em...and the songs that aren't ballads...don't rock at all, and really are just filler...only a minute amount of tracks stand  out...&quot;Eat the Rich&quot;, &quot;Shut up and Dance&quot;, &quot;Line  Up&quot;, &quot;Livin' on the Edge&quot; stand out on the album.....
6305064679|5.0|The Full Monty is perfect. It is light hearted, amazingly funny and has a great cast. The plot is really engrossing and the end will have you laughing so hard you can hardly breathe. This movie is magnificent.
0800178394|5.0|I love violent movies like this.  I often watch it before my races to get me pumped up.  A great movie which can be enjoyed by almost all (except those who don't enjoy vulgar language and extreme violence) Bad Boys is a  must see!
068484267X|5.0|I was sitting on a plane when I finished reading Angela's Ashes, and even then I couldn't put the book down. I literally sat and stared at the cover for about 10 minutes - at which point the lady sitting next to me spoke for  the first time and said &quot; You look really sad to have finished that  book!&quot;. It is a truly brilliant book - I experienced so many emotions  whilst reading it - not least of which was admiration at the way someone  who lived such a trying life managed to maintain a sense of humour. I was  so disappointed that the book ended when Frank got to America. I wondered  for days about what happened next.
B000002BBY|2.0|nothing else than boring, even the main track (&quot;Wonderwall&quot;) is as exiting as a math lesson. Don't buy it, simply buy &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, their first commercial album and their greatest, or take a  look to Blur o Radiohead instead. I save only &quot;don't look back in  anger&quot;, the reason of the second star
B000002UA0|5.0|PEOPLE SAY THAT THEIR BEST ALBUMS ARE THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON AND THE WALL ARE FLOYD'S GEMS. THIS ONE SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS WELL. IT HAS THE ORIGINAL FLOYD WITH ORIGINAL LEADER SYD BARRETT IN WHICH HE DISPLAYED  ABILITY TO BE CREATIVE WITH SOUND AND LYRICS. IT IS JUST TOO BAD THE WORLD  NEVER HEAR FROM THIS MAN.  SYD IF YOU'RE STILL AROUND SHINE ON DUDE!
6305107122|5.0|If you had to see one horror movie brfore you died, you should choose this one.  You'll be thankful THAT YOU DIDN'T DIE LIKE THEY DID.
6305076464|5.0|If I was trapped on a desert island and could only bring one british comedy, this would be it. Fawlty towers is probably the best british comedy ever made- and it gets better with repeated viewings. I dont know why John  Cleese hasnt been knighted for this... I hope someday he  does.
B000002GYG|5.0|First time I saw Tom Waites perform was about  1975 or around that time, at a club in downtown Denver called Ebbets Field. He was the opening act for Kenny Rankin, another great talent. Waites' raw voice and connection  with us in the audience left an indelible mark for me. I have enjoyed his  albums ever since, but especially &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner. &quot;Big  Joe and Phantom 309&quot; is still one of the most haunting compositions of  all time.
B0000047CW|5.0|I found a tape of this years ago identified only as &quot;Samba&quot;.  It's been one of my favorites since the first time I heard it.  I'm so happy to have found the CD.  'Samba Triste' is my favorite, but all the  tracks are delicious.
B00000FC5H|4.0|Finally a collection of all the hits on one disc! The writing and production on this disc are tremendous. It's hard to believe this music is more than 20 years old. Philip Bailey's soaring vocals are hard to resist.  Great ballads and grooves. A couple of questionable songs (Saturday Nite,  Kalimba Story) are the only drawbacks. A couple of songs from the 80's and  90's would have been nice instead of the above(System of Survival?!).
B000002UA9|3.0|...but nothing more, it could have been made by any good Rock'n'Roll band, and if you compare with any other Beatle's album you see that it doesn't deserve more than 3 stars. If I had choosen 5 stars to this album then I  would choose at least 12 to The White Album, Let It Be or Abbey Road. It  has two or three beautiful musics but nothing more.
6305229449|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  I think Mulan is an overall good moive.  The animation is excellent.  For example, the scene of the battle field is very impressive on silver screen.  The scores are good and the voice and singing  are also very good.  But the story development is quite weak, so are the  characters.  <br />I don't mind having Mushu in the movie at all.  It is fun.   I don't mind the characters being Americanized.  Disney is an American  enterprise after all.  But I do mind getting history all mixed up.  For  example, in the era where the Huns were threats, I don't think the  &quot;Forbidden City&quot; has been built.  As for a bunch of girls  marching down the main street, that's just plain laughable.<br />As to the  characters, the &quot;hero&quot;, Shung, is quite weak.  I don't know how  Mulan ever falls for him.  And in a movie with the female protagonist's  name as its title, I expect to see more of Mulan.  Does she like sword play  as a little girl?  In taking her father's place in the army, is she trying  to prove that she is as good as a son in a culture that values boys over  girls, or she just loves her father too much to see him fighting at an old  age?  There could be more details like these in the movie, but Disney just  didn't care to spend the time and efforts.  I am really disappointed.  It  could have been better.
B000002GBJ|5.0|I bought this record when it was first released in 1973 (not the 60s, as other reviews here would suggest) at the tender age of 14.  Now, at the ripe age of 40, &quot;Six Wives&quot; remains one of my favorite albums of  music.  Only the overlong &quot;Anne of Cleves&quot; cut mars an otherwise  great collection of progressive rock compositions.  To call them  &quot;songs&quot; does the music an injustice -- these are complex and  entertaining works that invite listening over and over again.  I've since  purchased five copies of this record, and now that I've got it on CD, I  hope it will last a while!  Very highly recommended!
B0000025HU|5.0|Hmph.  If the title track and Death or Glory are the only things that stand out to the previous reviewer, he or she clearly needs to listen to the album a few more times.  I won't say I'm fanatical about every track  here (it kinda drags a tidge on the second half, I feel), but how can you  argue with Hateful, Rudie Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Guns of Brixton,  Clampdown, and many more?  If you want to here punk in its purest form, you  should listen to the Clash's first album (which outstrips Never Mind the  Bullocks by miles), but as a pure musical statement, nothing beats London  Calling.
0385484518|5.0|Just that Life Changing... Just don't put the book down and forget what Morrie Said.
B000003S0B|4.0|As someone else pointed out, Poseidon is very similar to In The Court...  In a way, this &quot;biggest weakness&quot; is also its &quot;biggest strength.&quot;  For fans of the original band personnel, most of those  guys are still around for album #2.  It is not a stylistic or thematic  departure, and some people like it when bands release multiple versions of  the same album (AC/DC springs to mind...)  Fripp's acoustic playing here is  often better than on the first record.
B000002G1Y|5.0|John Hiatt has outdone himself with this album. I first heard &quot;Perfectly Good Guitar&quot; on a classic rock station that also threw in new stuff by established artist. Wow what a song. I bought the C.D.  immediately. When I put it in, little did I know that the title track, the  first song I heard off the album, was not the best. &quot;Straigh Outta  Time&quot;, &quot;Permanent Hurt&quot;, &quot;Something Wild&quot;,  &quot;Buffalo River Home&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot; all top the title  song. I recently saw Hiatt unplugged in Ashland, Ky. at a little theatre.  He was absolutely awesome. If you get only one Hiatt album, make sure it's  this one. Then go with Slow Turning and then Little Head. He is one of the  finest artist out there that has yet to get his due. Let's make sure that  happens.
B000003S0I|5.0|I won't spend 1000 words going on about how this is one of the greatest albums of all time, but by gum it is.  To this day it is one of the most melodic, heavy, experimental, &quot;alternative&quot;, and strange CDs ever  to come across my CD player.  That one album could be all of the above and  not a confused mess is a staggering testimony to Messrs Fripp, Wetton,  Muir, Cross, and Bruford.  All the planets lined up (not just the tantric  sun and moon on the cover), all the stars shone brightly, and radio and MTV  didn't matter.  They played from the heart and from the head.  I still  remember the first night I heard it: November 17, 1989, an impressionable  but discriminating high school senior at the time in search of new musical  worlds to explore.  Larks' Tongues was the key to a door of imagination.  I  hate to use cliches, but the best thing about cliche's is that they express  true feelings.
B000002OHF|5.0|Wishbone Ash came out of England and brought a fresh new sound to the U.S. This album, their fourth, is the best yet. They rock out when needed and go little into the art rock area that so many British bands were doing at the  time. Songs like &quot;ballad Of The Beacon&quot;, &quot;No Easy  Road&quot;, and &quot;Rock And Roll Widow&quot; are some of the finiest  tunes released in the early part of the 70's. They aren't the most talented  band, but, the most talented bands also don't make the best music. These  guys have a duel guitar attack that will flat out floor you. And they can  also sing. Check this C.D. out...I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
B000003S0F|2.0|Islands can be a tough first listen, or a tough tenth listen.  I myself am probably only up to about listen number twelve (to paraphrase author Eric Tamm).  Of all the Crimson albums released from 1969 to 1974, it is by far  the strangest and weakest (excluding live albums, which at least have  versions of &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; going for them!)  Of  course Islands has its moments; &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot; is good  bluesy fun, and Fripp beats the bejezus out of his Les Paul on the extended  solo to &quot;A Sailor's Tale,&quot; but guess what?  These two bright  spots can be found on Frame By Frame, one of the greatest boxed sets of all  time.
B00000DHR0|5.0|What a beautiful album! Celine does a great job with the songs. I get the chills every time I hear &quot;O Come All ye Faithful&quot; and &quot;O Holy Night&quot;. My favorite is &quot;I'm Your Angel&quot;. It really  sends a great, uplifting message. If you are a Celine fan, you ahve to gt  this CD!
0887307280|5.0|As a young entrepreneur with no formal business training, I believe I can take my business to a whole new level... making more money, in less time, with less energy spent.  It's exciting to learn that I don't have to do it  all.  It's exciting to learn that my business is there to serve me, not  vice versa.  This book teaches anyone how to turn a business into a systems  dependent company that runs itself.  <br />If you can get passed Gerbers new  age subtleties, and feely-touchy injections, you'll only have to condense  the book by about 20%.  Any book with 80% of hard core information deserves  5 stars in my opinion.
0792151712|5.0|This was one of the best movie ever made!  The movie gives history, but is intersting as well.  A must to see and get!!!!
0767812646|2.0|not the character  i mean the kid who plays him  is a brat..<br />i hate him  he cant sing and is very annoying and ruined the movie for me
B00000AFWW|4.0|I can honestly say I don't know a whole lot about this band other than what has been osmosed about its leader from our every reliable media. That doesn't prevent me from enjoying every minute of it though.  State of the  art production, buzz saw guitars, layer upon layer of harmonies, and Love's  vocals and lyrics which as interesting as they are . . . well let's just  say she needs to enjoy life a bit more. I believe the record is up for the  Grammy and sincerely hope it wins.  It's that good.  Then maybe, just maybe  that will put a smile on Courtney's face and a little joy in her heart, if  only for a moment.  Pick this up.
B000002H97|5.0|The first 5 songs are the best. i haven't even listened beyond that, so it can only get better!
B000000WA4|5.0|I love the Smashing Pumpkins! My favorite songs are Beautiful, Farewell and Goodnight, To Forgive, and of course, Zero(Doesn't everyone?).  Melloncollie and Infinate Saddness is the greatest album that has ever been  composed. By the way I think that James is really cute.
1559408855|5.0|It's capital
B000002L71|5.0|Fifteen years later, this album still stands up.  &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; is one of the best live recordings ever released--tremendous musicianship, songwriting, energy, elan.  And this recording is VERY good.   The Heads were unique--amazingly tight and clean for such a large rock/pop  band. The fun they had while performing this music is contagious.  It's  impossible to keep still while listening to this album.<br />It's a real shame  that they haven't re-released the Heads' other live album, &quot;The Name  of this Band is the Talking Heads&quot; (1981), another great album (with  performances spanning their early days through the &quot;Remain in  Light&quot; tour). I've heard an unreleased performance from their  &quot;Fear of Music&quot; tour (1979); the Heads were an absolutely  fantastic live band.  <br />Your life will be complete with &quot;Stop Making  Sense.&quot;
B000002AHC|5.0|I saw the Byrds in late summer of 1967 at the Fillmore Auditorium. I only remember two things about that event: #1 How amazingly good they sounded live.  #2 While David Crosby was addressing the crowd (with McGuinn and  Hillman ignoring him), Michael Clarke impishly reached a stick over his  drumset and flicked Crosby's porkpie hat to the stage floor, mussing up his  hair in the process. The only response was a seething, controlled rage as  Clarke and the crowd snickered. The studio fracas included in the last six  minutes of this CD captures some of that enmity in a way that finally  explains their breakup to me after all these years:  it was the DRUMMER'S  fault! (Anyone  who's ever played in a band knows that drummers are not  real musicians anyway; they're  just &quot;rhythm pigs&quot;.) This CD can  be set on repeat play and left untouched for hours. The instrumental break  in &quot;Change Is Now&quot; still amazes me: how McGuinn can find that  much to do with so few notes is beyond comprehension. Even if you own the  original LP, this CD is worth having because of the added bonus tracks from  those sessions, not the least of which is Crosby's version of  &quot;Triad&quot;, (which absolutely buries the familiar Grace Slick  version.) So much talent; so many egos.  You've just got to love it.
0767802772|5.0|I had just recently bought this movie at a local video store,and I love it!Matthew and Salma make such a cute on-screen couple.Girls,if you are looking for a movie to watch with your special someone,THIS IS THE  ONE!!!!!!!!!
B000002C25|5.0|Hey, all musicfans out there, this album is a must-buy. Soft melodies, strong Brit-Pop, this is just cool! I just would buy it!
6305205620|5.0|I've never been a superbig Metallica fan, but I have to give 'em two thumbs up for this one. This DVD will set a new standard for how to do concert videos. Metallica is a band that truly cares about their fans and continues to develop its music and image. The band is also known for putting in great effort into its videos and other releases, this is a prime example...Great stuff from Metallica, again!
0312952813|5.0|What starts out as a obvious suicide by a Los Angles narcotics officer, turns into a top notch Harry Bosch mystery. This one is a real page turner, that will take you to the darker side streets of L.A. to the poverty  stricken border town or Mexacali Mexico. And all the way through you will  be kept on the edge of your seat as you try to guess who is who. Michael  Connelly has to be one of the best mystery writers around. His characters  are so real and life like, it's as if they are just going to jump right off  the page. I strongly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed.
B000009O8A|3.0|I remember reading a book by the PMRC's Tipper Gore back in the 80's that mentioned this movie.  Mrs. Gore said that it is a blatant rape and violence movie.  This was back when she wanted records and such rated.   <br />Well, I was browsing though the DVD selection and saw that this movie  was available.  I picked it up for curiosity's sake.<br />What I got was what  I expected.  (If not more, most movies don't ever seem to live up to it's  hype)  Blatant Rape and Violence.  It was actually quite disturbing.   Something I won't pull out for my mother when she wants to watch a movie  with me.<br />The DVD is good quality and contains the trailer on it as well.   The scene selections are nice too.
6305265488|5.0|This movie is a real departure from the dumb junk Drew Barrymore usually does.  At last she has done a movie that showcases those famous family acting genes to the maximum.  And don't let the fact that the story line is  so familiar keep you from seeing this one---it's the sweetest, most  romantic retelling of the old fantasy I've ever seen, and the costuming is  absolutely beautiful.  My husband saw it with me, and even he was  pleasantly surprised.  This is definitely one I'll be adding to my film  library.
0767805712|4.0|I have seen the movie Gattaca, and I have many things to say about it.  First of all, this movie portrays that science &quot;plays God&quot; if we let technology go so far that we are living in a semi-communist world based  on genetics.  For example, people who are &quot;invalids,&quot; or those  who were not genetically enhanced before birth, and born &quot;the old  fashion way,&quot; shows how discriminatory perfectionists can be.  People  are way to obsessed with people being all they can be.  Don't get me wrong.   I think that it's great for everyone to have a purpose in life and live up  to cure a disease or travel to mars, but discrimition is where the whole  system goes to hell.      This movie did an excellent job of portraying  what actually might become of us if we litterally go through everything  with a fine tooth comb, only to pick out invalids.  We should learn from  this movie to integrate the less fortunate with the not-so-fortunate, and  that's how we can build a better world.
6301978587|5.0|Michel Legrand's outstanding and underated score is one of the masterpieces of cinema. Although the majority of Alan &amp; Marilyn Bergman lyrics are worthy of Legrand's music they are sometimes simplistic and  &quot;sappy&quot;. This is a great vehicle for Streisand and she sings  beautifully. I recommend that you but the CD and listen to the music and  see for youself how great it is.
0385493800|2.0|This book is a stunning disappointment from a terrific trial lawyer, whose previous books always held the reader's interest.  The first 75 pages of this book are intriging and keep you on your toes, however the lenghty and  totally unbelievable treks to Bolivia are verbose and I tended to skim.   None of the characters, including the main character, Nate O'Riley, are  interesting.  Incidentally, the remaining characters, including all of the  respective attorneys in this book (of which there are many)have no  redeeming features.  All of Grisham's previous books presented a character  worht rooting for; not here. Walk, don't run to buy this book.
0679437223|5.0|Always jumps to mind when asked the inevitable,&quot;What is your favorite book?&quot; Catch-22 is laugh out loud funny the 12th time you read it, can be read and enjoyed by every age, rails against war, stupidity, greed, and  demonstrates the valuable recouse to absurdity in an insane world. Dozens  of memorable characters, incredible dialogue, and humor from wry to  outright outrageous.<br />This book is a TITAN.
B000002KBU|5.0|there is only one way to play this album .... in a dark room.. alone with your soul..... it may well in the fullness of time prove to be the best album ever made by anyone.. if the criteria for &quot;best&quot; is that it  touches parts of you that you never knew you had... and then of course,  there's &quot;a case fo you&quot;... performed more sweetly by tori amos,  among others.... but  never more poignantly... joni's version is up there  with any song i have heard in over 30 years of beiong captivated by the  music that began with elvis, chuck, and little richard
0451169514|5.0|Simply the best book I have ever read. I am an avid reader, and I have never been drawn into a book like this. I have read this book at least a dozen times cover to cover and that says a lot for a book of this size.  Captivating!!!
B00000DGUY|5.0|THE BEST RECORDING I HAVE EVER HERD FROM ANY ARTIST
B0000009SY|5.0|This album previews the classic DesCarteian Mind/Body dialectic of the 80's cyberpunk literary movement through both lyrical content and recording technique. Plainly speaking, this is the prototype Cyberpunk album.   &quot;We could jam in Joe's Garage&quot; !  As you read this review, keep  in MIND the nature and/or medium of your consumer habits, (all tucked  neatly away within the files of amazon.com) and then give all props to the  immortal words of FZ &quot;a latent appliance fetishishist is a person who  refuses to admit to his or herself that sexual gratification can only be  achieved through the use of machines.&quot;
B00000DBXL|4.0|Cake is at its best with &quot; You Turn the Screws&quot; but &quot; Never There&quot; is also a notable song. Their style is unmistakable and always liked.
B000002U82|5.0|THE GREATEST OF ALL PINK FLOYD ALBUM'S ! ! ! !<br />SHOOT YOURSELF FOR NOT OWNING THIS.
B000002KHF|5.0|I cannot believe the number of years I considered myself a fan of music and was not aware of the unbelievable talent of Van Morrison.  Every song on Moondance is better than most of the releases of current albums coming  out I have been buying.  I was happy to hear &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; in  the movie &quot;Patch Adams&quot; maybe more people will discover Van  Morrison.  If you want an album that does not contain a bad song this is  it.
B000002OK3|4.0|This soundtrack has the one thing that MAKES a soundtrack, and that is dialogue excerpts.  With the clips from the movie interwoven with the great music and the monotone comments from Steven Wright's DJing, this is a  winner all the way around.  Sure to be enjoyable for everyone, even the  kiddies!
B00000ADG2|1.0|This is the worst CD I have ever heard! It's absoultely terrible! I can't belive that it's number 11. This woman has no talent! All of the songs sound the same, and the best way to describe her voice is a cat being  strangled. Miseducation? Ha, I'd say that.
B000003N7Y|4.0|&quot;Hora Decubitus&quot; is similar to &quot;E's Flat Ah's Flat Too&quot; from Blues and Roots, not something from Mingus Ah Um (although there may be a piece on Mingus Ah Um that is similar as well, but I haven't  listened to Mingus Ah Um lately).  Mingus performing &quot;Mood  Indigo&quot; is also available on Mingus Dynasty as a different recording  and possibly different arrangement.  Therefore, Mingus X5 includes only two  new pieces (or three if you count the bonus track) for the listener.  I  recommend it for the Mingus fan for its altered arrangements and  performances, but for an introduction, I recommend Blues and Roots,  Pithecantropus Erectus, Mingus Ah Um or Mingus Dynasty instead.
6305205620|3.0|Don't get me wrong I am a HUGE Metallica fan! The quality of this DVD is unmatched when compared with other music DVD's. The picture is phenominal. The sound is incredible. The camera work and behind the scenes footage  makes this a fun DVD, but 5 stars? Too often Hetfield sounds strained when  doing earlier material. He has lost that edgy sound in his voice. He can no  longer pull it off live. Buy this DVD. It's awesome! Just don't expect the  Hetfield of old. It becomes difficult to watch the DVD in one sitting,  listening to Hetfield strain. That's why I give it 3 stars. Jason and Lars  will bow your mind in this DVD. Enjoy.
6304504012|2.0|While I'm not an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, I was looking forward to the release of this adaptation of one of his better works.  Sadly it left me cold.  In adapting the play for the big screen, the authors took the edge  from the plot.  Their biggest mistake was to make Eva a sympathetic  character.  Except for Banderas's performance (ever noticed he sounds kinda  like Niel Diamond impersonating Ricky Ricardo) this movie is a nicely  filmed waste of time.
6302902010|1.0|Thank you viewers for your review.  I now do not plan to purchase the video. You see, I too am a fan of the orginal version with Sammy Davis Junior. My mom and I loved it!!!! I remember this film from my teenage  years which began my love for Gershwin music. I remain a Gerwhin fan and  would love to have the orginal released. I still have the album from long  long ago. My search will cease for the video. Porgy and Bess was the first  video I ever wanted and still do not have.
B0000046KM|5.0|This CD  has outstanding renditions of love songs, sung with feeling and style that only Shirley Horn can sing.
0679423001|5.0|This book stunned me when I reached the end.  Throughout, I enjoyed reading about the various characters and the British ambience, and I didn't expect the very moving way in which the main characters ultimately  developed.  In addition to telling a good story and depicting a beautiful  world, the author made some very profound statements about religion and  character.  It is a book that I will enjoy reading again.
B00000DGUG|5.0|This CD is great! Just as good as JLP, which I still love and listen to every day. I love Alanis' voice and her excellent lyrics. She is the best!
0060926317|1.0|This was dreadful...Very poorly written, boring, and obvious fiction made to look like nonfiction.  Amazon - please give us a no star category...this one doesn't deserve the one star I was forced to give it.
B000002I27|5.0|The Doors on of the classical 60's bands. On this album Jim Morrison lyrics are eerie and great. The guitar of Robby Krieger is outstading.  This album will put you in another rhealm.
B000006NPY|5.0|I bought Adore while I was searching for Soul Coughing's new cd (which I found later, and still love) and was expecting.....nothing. I was a virgin Pumpkins fan, having heard hardly any of their songs, new or old, except  the gigantic hits. For expecting a whole lot of nothing, I was VERY  pleasantly suprised. Billy Corgan has one of the most interesting voices in  music today (whine! hmmphhh) and paired with some brilliant music, BOOM!  You've got this wonderful cd. I sadly have no other cd of theirs, and am  current ly lobbying with my parents to get me Melon Collie... Pray for me!  This cd is one of the only bands (the other is Garbage) in my Sarah  McLachlan dominated top 10 cd list.
0780624890|5.0|hey. its gory
B000002V07|5.0|This cd is the perfect mood music.  When you find yourself in a melancholy, angry, bitter, sad, or anytime of an emotional mood pop this cd in, turn off the lights and let the hypnotic ballads take you away.  A  masterpiece of emotion captured on a digital recording.
0385486804|4.0|Leading a life few in America even know exists, one is fascinated how a college educated, bright young man turns his back on money and explores America to find himself.  While the publicity of his death hogs the  headlines, the highlight of this book is his travels in the Southwest and  the friendships he made.<br />Another masterpiece by Krakauer who is probably  better suited than any American writer to write this story.
B000003AEB|5.0|How much can i say.  Everyhthing works and his skits are funny too. it sjust good music.!!
B000005H4K|5.0|This album is a definition of jazz.  It is one of my favorite trio records, and one of my favorite albums of all time.  Duke, Mingus, and Max Roach become involved in some of the most creative interchanges I have ever  heard.  If there were another star, or another ten, I would give it as  well.
6300270424|5.0|If your'e a LED ZEPPELIN fan this video is a must! The fantacy sequences of each band member are a little silly, but the live concert footage gives you the essance of what LED ZEPPELIN was!! Also the behind the sceens  footage gives you a feel for what life on the road is like.
6301986024|5.0|This is a non-classic Steve McQueen with the brains. What a wonderful plot, of the man who has everything and thirsts for more. The classic line is a question, &quot; Who am I goign to be today?&quot; It says it all.  Faye Dunaway is gorgeous in her role of the insurance fraud detective. The  chemistry is perfect.  A must see for all Steve McQueen fans
0784011605|5.0|Anything with Harvey Keitel is worth watching. He fills the screen, but here he outdoes himself. This was the first Holly Hunter film which caught my attention and since watching it I have looked for others.  All three  principals put in magnificent performances.  Jane Campion's direction  captures the mood perfectly.  Worth a second, third and fourth look.
B000002MY3|1.0|Bad music mixed with wordy, bad lyrics make for fooling loads of mid teen americans. This is awful
630349255X|5.0|This movie kept me silent for its entirety. The beauty of the images juxtaposed with the subtle and sad ironies of the world, backed by a magnificent soundtrack all added up to make it one of the most breathtaking  and powerful films I've ever seen.
0780625129|5.0|Because of the fact that the movie hasn`t been released yet on VHS it`s impossible for me to review the video however it is possible to review the movie itself . I just saw it tonight (Feb.14/2-99) &amp; the reason that I  saw it this &quot;late&quot; in the year is simple . I live in Denmark and  the release date wasn`t until the 12/2-99 . For those of you who know the  movie &quot;Rumper Stomper&quot; from 1993 &amp; also about neo-nazis you  felt the short momentum of what made these &quot;men&quot; tick but it  never sought to show why! Well Tony Kaye`s &quot;AHX&quot; shows the human  perspective of neo-nazismen - if one can call it human? but you get a face  to put on neo-nazismen without ever sympathizing with it. Edward Norton  plays Derek who in the begining of the movie is a 110% loyal  &quot;true-believer&quot; of the neo-nazi-movement but after he`s send to  jail for murdering two members of a street gang he see`s the wrong in all  the hate he`s lived with. It now becomes Dereks goal to liberate his family  from the claws of his former tutor , Cammeron Alexander (played by Stacy  Keach) , &amp; particularly his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who  has been swallowed by the same ideals that once was Derek . Together with  the Venice Beach High School principal , Sweeney(Avory Brooks) Derek starts  out on this mission .  Without revealing the end of the movie  &quot;American History X&quot; is a critismen of american society that  rarely ever come from Hollywood &amp; it`s use of raw violence , both in  picture &amp; sound are by no means unrealistic nor overexaggerated . The  thing that made a special impact on me was that the movie doesn`t show one  side of the problem . It shows that it`s not only whites who are prejudice  , racists &amp; full of hate but that it works both ways . I will not get  more in to how this runs in the story because that info. would ruin the  movie . Norton &amp; Furlong function well as the two brothers and their  complementation to each other is excellent &amp; I really hope that Norton  gets the Oscar for his performance but since &quot;AMX&quot; isn`t your  typical Hollywood movie it`ll probably go to Tom Hanks or some other  character who played a part in some billion $ political correct movie .  Beverly Dngelo (Derek &amp; Danny`s mom) is great as the brothers ill  mother who manages to love her boys even with their political views &amp;  what this brings down on her/(personal life) I can`t recorment this movie  enough &amp; if I could I`d give it 6 stars out of 5 .
0375701427|4.0|In this fine novel of ideas Roth shows us the pain that often lies beneath the veneer of our affluant suburban lives.  The The Swede is a noble tragic figure, almost shakesperian in depth, and by the end of the book sensative  readers will care about him, and, maybe, weep.  Roth understands, and  shows, the arbitrary randomness and banality of evil.  His book is one of  the best I have read in many years.
B000002UAO|5.0|I've been a &quot;hardcore&quot; Beatles fan for about 10 years now (I'm 22) and I keep listening to their music everyday. And it seems that the album that I play the most is &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. I don't know if this  is their best (anyway I can't choose ONE album as their best!) but if  that's the one I'm playing the most, there must be a reason. Imagine this :  an E.T. lands on Earth and asks : &quot;What's Beatlemusic ?&quot; What  will you give him to hear ? &quot;She Loves You&quot; ? &quot;A Day In The  Life&quot; ? What I mean is that their music has evolved so much through  the years that a single track or a single album wouldn't be representative.  Or maybe &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; could be this album. &quot;Classic&quot;  pop-songs with first-rate melodies (that's the least you can say), and  already amazing things in the instrumentation going on, signs of what would  come next : sitar on &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, fuzz bass on &quot;Think  For Yourself&quot;, double-speed piano on &quot;In My Life&quot;, sounding  like a harpischord, and so on. Most of the songs on the album are  masterpieces. Listen to &quot;Girl&quot; : it sends me shivers down my  spine whenever I hear it. Listen to John's voice on this song. Listen to  &quot;In My Life&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;... and &quot;The  Word&quot;, a very underrated song. If you don't know this album, well, in  a way you're very lucky cause it will be so wonderful when you discover it!  So what are you waiting for ? Buy it!
B000002UA0|4.0|Note: Sharkbites did not review this objectively! Excellent album. A far less serious fare than later Floyd albums. Funny, intelligent and witty. Not terrible like sharkbites says. Just very different.
0385493800|5.0|Since I have recently returned from Brazil, this book sparked my interest because of his incredible descriptions, Portugese language, and the kindness of the people &amp; memories that were stirred as well as John  Grisham's incredible way of weaving a story together.  The Testament kept  my attention from the beginning to the end and I hated that it ended!  This  may be one of his greatest books yet!
B000002BBY|5.0|This album will still be spinning 30 years from now and be just as revered as any Beatles album.  Don't listen to Oasis detractors, kids - nary a band exists that doesn't shamelessly lift off their musical heroes!  Oasis are  one great band!!
B000002UAU|5.0|I won't spend my time doing a complete analysis of this album, because so many others have done it before and my English may not be good enough to do that ! But I'd like to say that when I read reviews giving Sgt.Pepper 2 or  3 stars, I just go mad. Maybe it's just a childish reaction because their  own favourite album or their own favourite band hasn't been praised as much  as Sgt. Pepper and the Beatles...(WHO is he talking about ?)  Anyway THIS  IS A CALL TO ALL BEATLES FANS : please review this album and give it 5  stars, in order to reach a 5 stars average review which it deserves, of  course. If you take each song separately and forget the cover and concept  bit, I'm not even sure this is the best Beatles album. Maybe Rubber Soul  and Revolver are as good. But how could you give less than 5 stars to an  album featuring &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, &quot;With a little help from my  friends&quot;, &quot;Lucy in the sky&quot; and, above everything else in  the world, &quot;A day in the life&quot;, the greatest piece of  &quot;popular&quot; music written in the 20th century ? And I do mean it. I  won't be there to see if I'm right, but I think it will remain in the  centuries to come. So don't listen to these people telling you it's  underrated, buy it and you'll see by yourself : you'll love it, of course.  P.S.:about a reviewer who said not to buy &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and  saving the money to buy the Beach Boys' &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;: buy both.  They're both worth it, to say the least!
B00000DGUG|1.0|terrible. does anybody realize that Jagged Little Pill was NOT her debut. She used to be a Debbie Gibson sound alike, until she figured out she could hit it big by sounding tormented ex. &quot;Oh my god, I relate Sooo much to  Alannis. She feels tortured just like me!&quot; Pathetic. If you have a  brain, you will stop supporting artists like this
B00000AFWW|4.0|This is a good album, but Courtney belongs in the heavy style of music that she evolved in. I bought &quot;Live Through This&quot; shortly after this album and believe me - their earlier songs were better.  &quot;Malibu&quot; is TOO SAPPY for Hole - the group that defined angry  girl rock along with PJ Harvey, Bikini Kill, L7, etc... in the early  nineties. L like this album and all, but the grunge lives in Hole and it  needs to released again. This album just doesn't stun like their earlier  albums... Rating: B+
0590353403|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorceror's (or philosopher's) stone is really good. My mum, my twin sister, and my six year old sister have all read and enjoyed it. We can't wait for book three!
B000005RT8|4.0|Most of the songs on &quot;McCartney II&quot; have a strange sound, with synthesizers which do sound like synthesizers, wacky, crazy melodies... Nothing like &quot;Yesterday&quot;, that's right (except &quot;One of these  days&quot;, in a more classic McCartney style). So what ? Critics always  put down Paul as a soppy balladeer or things like that, saying he never  takes any risks and always does the same thing, well they sure are wrong  this time. This album may sound weird to some people. But this is why I  like it, really, a thousand times more than &quot;My Love&quot; or  &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot; !!! I love &quot;Temporary Secretary&quot; and  all the other crazy tracks, I love &quot;McCartney II&quot; !!!
0783801602|3.0|It's really a good story. But I like it when the end of a book is the best part. This is not the case with Rainbow Six. The best part is the first half. After that the story is a bit boring. The book would be the best if  the syory was told in 600 pages instead of 800. But it's good to read.
6303832563|5.0|This movie is VERY close to my heart.  Phillip Glass' music is inspiring and mixed with the cinematography it is ASTOUNDING!!!  It is a crime that such a piece of film is not available!
0345423496|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviews which claims that the plot is pretty light--almost non-existent.  However, I rather liked the book, his treatment of religion is worth the price by itself.  The technological  details were pretty fascinating, as usual, but overall I guess I'd have to  say 2061 made a better ending to the 2001 series.  If I look at 3001 as a  stand-alone book, it seems much more fulfilling.

0609603086|4.0|I will agree that this is not the quality of Pillars of the Earth - few books are!  But I found reading this book thoroughly enjoyable.  Interestingly enough this was one of the few books I have ever read that I  was pulling for both sides - yes there were &quot;good guys&quot; and  &quot;bad guys&quot; but I wanted both to win!  A fun read!
6300181286|5.0|Frankenstein is what Boris Karloff is mostly known for. He made a wonderful performance as the monster who was created by Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive). This film is considered to be the most memorable horror film  ever made. Karloff was totally unknown when he was chosen to play the  monster. Today he is considered one of the most famous horror actors ever.

1567407757|5.0|check out this book! In an age of instant gratification and a world which at times moves needlessly fast, Mitch Alboms masterpiece brings clarity to the important things in life. His book touched my soul and, at least for the moment, helped me re-prioritize things in my life. Hey, I even left my  cell phone turned off this weekend!
B000003S0D|5.0|The year was 1971or72.I was in college and was beginning to listen to a kind of music different not named progresive yet.I had already listened two their first 2 records.When Ifirst listened to Lizard ididnt like it.Too  different from the previous two.But after listening to it afew more times  Irealized this was one of the best records of all time.Just listen to the  opening minutes of Circus.I think thi K.C.was the most progresive of all  their rencarnation.By the way then i began lis<br />tening to yes and  elp.Every progrock fan should have this one.
0783114222|5.0|If you aren't convinced by all of the other glowing reviews of this DVD set, I guess that I am not going to convince you either... But, if you bought a DVD player and you are wondering what is so great about it.  BUY  THIS SET! It is THE REASON why you have a DVD player.
0451160916|5.0|Much better than the movie! King's descriptive talents are unheard of. Truly a find.
6305069611|1.0|I read the book that this movie is based on a long time ago and I thought that I would enjoy the movie.  So, without having seen it before, I bought the DVD.  What a total waste... To put it another way, I have purchased  140+ DVDs and I consider this movie to be the worst. Specifically, this  movie is too long and David Bowie's character (the main character) is just  too wierd.
B000001BX0|5.0|Puto!!!! Le faltan tanates Al Puto!!
B000002VMH|5.0|The first song 'Why' sets the tone for entire CD which is haunting in it's melodies.  Lennox's voice commands attention, and this first solo effort proves that she is in a league of her own. 'Cold' elevates her voice and  spirit to new heights while 'Walking on Broken Glass' makes her signature  style shine.  This early edition makes way for albums that continue to  showcase her incredible voice and talent as a soulful singer.
0767800958|5.0|Flinging his leg to the divan, the dancer in repose, nimble his leg cradles there, the joint, calf to thigh arching with tension and grace, the lifted trouser-clad knee extended like the Bridge of Sighs. He is an easy  god lounging on a Greek urn.<br />Down the Left Bank they tango twisting  'neath descants of stars, following the diamond lights of the bateaux; down  the Seine in the breathy cold-- it begins to snow-- tango in the snows of  Paris.<br />Tango in the rain of Buenos Aires'''' She dashes her leg smartly  beneath his thigh. They are heavenly wet, in perfect rhythm. &quot;You move  like and angel,&quot; she tells him, &quot;like an actor you present  yourself, elusive, holding back, yet divulging, generous.&quot; At the bar:   &quot;Do you give tango lessons?&quot; She must know.<br />The dual fleet  steps of the dance, sinuous and semiotic, the long drawn-out line of an  unrelenting melody, cool and quick, languid, pulsing, insistent-- they  entwine, vine on the trellis,  roots beneath the bower. Life comes in these  lessons.<br />The he-dancer, crisp and coiled. The she-dancer, taut, lithe,  precise. The dance:  brooding, sentient, electric. They are cosmopolitans,  dancing the  weight of the world, its sex, its passions, its destiny and  death. The lesson begins.  She beside him, &quot;Walk, walk, walk.&quot;  That which was second nature suddenly strange, transformed,  a Duchamp nude  on the staircase; two nudes, one strong and one swift: she in the master's  arms, skin shivers like a snake's; kinetic eyes, Cubist athletics, gypsy  feet-- my very own!<br />Bodies recombine, forestall gravitation, combust.  Life's questions in a tango, dancing the way to God.
B0000025DV|5.0|This is probably the Best ELO to date, it is a mix of upbeat songs that sometimes are silly, but who cares.  Jeff Lynne's arrangements are sure to please and delight you for hours on end.  Contrary to Steve Gdula's review,  this is a must for ELO fans everywhere!
0783229526|1.0|This is, without a doubt, the worst, most disturbing movie I have ever seen.  If you are goning to waist your money on this, you might as well buy some cheap liquor, get hammered, and you would get the same stupid effect,  but then you wouldn't have the tempation to blow your own head off while  suffering through this crap heap.  If I could have, I would have given it  negative 5 stars. Anybody who buys this movie deserves to be hit by a car,  then pumped full of acid, shot in the knee caps, have their genitals blown  off with dynamite, and then have their bloody carcasses fed to starved  alligators.  My recommendation: don't buy this movie (if you couldn't tell  that sentiment from the rest of my review).
B000002HHB|2.0|Just wanted to let a little air out of the Natalie Adoration Society.  Yes, there is no voice like hers, but I believe that the weight given to her work is off the mark.  I find &quot;depth&quot; in her lyrics to  actually be pretty lacking - there seems to be an air of pretense that has  followed her solo career.
1558803602|5.0|Has it all, it's a love story, a comedy, a drama and an action movie all rolled up in one.  Pairs a couple of my favorite stars, Dreyfuss and Hunter.  Their on-screen chemistry is perfection.  This movie has been  extremely under rated, probably because it was directed by Spielberg before  he was truly respected in the industry.  Don't miss it.
B000006OAM|2.0|Just wanted to let a little air out of the Natalie Adoration Society.  Yes, there is no voice like hers, but - I don't see the brilliance in her lyrics.  Whirling Natalie seemed sweet and fresh in the early days of  Maniacs.  But the eccentricity has become self-important - there seems to  be an air of pretense that has followed her solo career.  &quot;Thank you,  thank you&quot;?  Not sure it rings sincere...
078322706X|5.0|If you looking for a touching, romantic movie, then look no furthur than Meet Joe Black.  I know Brad Pitt gets a bad wrap sometimes, but I think he gives a great performance in this film along with Anthony Hopkins.   The  finale at the end of this film will  leave you in tears and goosebumps.
0312958455|4.0|Again an absolute must for mystery readers. Bosch is digging in his past, in his roots. What he finds is depressing, but it helps him too. It is a novel full of tension. But the ending is not so good. A man like Harry Bosch should be able to cope with what he found. He is not someone who  cracks too easily. Or does Michael Connelly want to forget him?

0790739909|5.0|The first time I saw the movie I was unsure of how I felt about the movie.  After my second viewing I fell in love with it.  City of Angels made me hope that we are being watched over in some form.  The movie also made me  hope to find a love like that. Call me a softy I can't help it I loved City  of Angels
6305268177|5.0|Enjoyed this so much.  With the superior quality of DVD reproduction and the 5.1 sound you couldn't ask for much more.  This ranks very high on our list!
B000002KIK|3.0|Many Sabbath fans don't seem to like most or all of Never Say Die, but it's a decent enough collection of songs save for some filler at the end of the disc.  Great guitar playing from Tony, and Ozzy's voice is sharper here  than you might expect.  In fact the first four tunes would be worthy  additions to anyone's desert island disc.
6304297912|5.0|Ewan Mcgregors's best movie so far!  Better than his other movies, potraying an addict going strait is his genre!  Plus the remarkable performance of jonny lee miller as &quot;sickboy&quot;, a distraught fellow  who's a conman and such.
B000002L1L|3.0|When it first came out, The Battle Rages On seemed almost as good an album as Perfect Strangers.  After all, the Mk. 2 lineup was finally back in business--clench your fist and turn up the volume!  And compared with  Slaves &amp; Masters, this disc is close to a masterpiece.  But a closer  listen reveals that the band sounds tired in places, underinspired, and  somewhat derivative.  Many of Ritchie's riffs are Rainbow rip-offs; many of  his usually stellar solos sound like little more than fast open-string  pull-offs with a few decently vibratoed notes thrown in for good measure.  Ian Gillan's voice is somewhat subdued and the patented screams are few  (and those that did make the final cut sound overdubbed and forced).  If  there is any upside, it is to be found within some of the songs themselves.  &quot;Anya&quot; is dark and fierce, &quot;Nasty Piece of Work&quot; is  one heavy machine, and &quot;Time To Kill,&quot; although many DP fans hold  a grudge against it, is a moving tune based in an uplifting major key.  Blackmore bailed out on tour months after this commercially hampered disc  hit the stores; his replacement Steve Morse brought the band back to an  artistic perch not seen since the 1970s.
0385486804|5.0|There are nearly 200 reviews below for this well-written, gripping, emotionally compelling little book, so I have little to add, other than to ask a question: what is it about Chris McCandless that seems to inspire  such kind empathy in some and such forceful hatred in others?  What buttons  in the American psyche has this young man's short life--and Krakauer's  brilliant telling of it--pushed?
B000002KKS|5.0|All the other reviews pretty much sum how I feel about this album.  But I will go on to say that it ranks as one of Ronnie James Dio's finest hours in a career filled with, well, many fine hours.  &quot;Heaven and  Hell&quot; is the perfect song--lyrically, musically, texture-wise, with  just the right mood and tempo changes to propel it along.  Not to be missed  either is &quot;Die Young.&quot;  Albums like Heaven and Hell are just not  made anymore.
B000002UC5|5.0|This isn't jamming, nor is it slight; it's melodic catharsis after the breakup of the Beatles. This is the epitome of Paul's musical soul, and it's his most personal, expressive, honest work. Not in a lyrical way, for  the most part, but in the music. John was using primal scream therapy and  writing really bitter, damaged lyrics, but also looking forward; Paul was  doing all that with melody. This is the sound of someone lost for words and  healing himself by retreating into his basement and his music.  Self-indulgent? Self-expressive! Unfinished? Unpolished! You think no  effort went into it? It was an effort for Paul just to get out of bed after  the Beatles broke up, let alone record an album. Especially a lovely one.
6305265488|5.0|I was very pleased with how well filmmakers did with this film.  From the moment it began, my attention was yanked right into it, and it gave me the feeling that I had actually traveled somewhere.  Drew Barrymore did an  excellent job, and I commend her for her effort.  Most of all, I applaud  those who made this film for making a good, clean, wholesome movie that I  don't mind showing to my family.
0792140923|5.0|Hi movie lovers, If u haven't seen this movie at least twice then DO SO !! Its touching and very very sensitive and I bet Tom Hanks would never have dreamt of such a performance. when he uttered 'I miss you' at his best  friend's grave ..... u are done with ...... emotions come strolling out.  enjoy this and do give a pat on the back of Tom Hanks for me.<br />Kurian  Thomas Olakkappady.
0440211727|4.0|The depth of the characters displayed in the story draws you in so deep that you will not be able to put it down until you have finished reading it.  Although I don't condone the behavior, it makes you understand why  some people would feel the need to take the law into their own hands.
0684847817|5.0|If you enjoy beauty, style, elegance, and knowledge.. BUY THIS. Hell, even if you don't, buy it anyway. It's got something to read, and something to look at in wonder.  And if you want a little of both, there are small  captions for the pictures to read.  It's simply put, a great buy. Worth the  money you pay for it, and more. I LOVE IT!!! and cherish it...
0026009102|1.0|THE MOUNTAINHEAD                           (a parody)                             Chapter 1         Howard Rock pulled himself to the summit.  He was the first to climb Mount Everst.  Or was he?  There was flag planted at the  summit.  And that flag belonged to Peter Cheating!          Rock's  attention was diverted by a growing whirlwind.  The heavens parted and Rock  hafl expected a repentant God to offer an explanation.  Instead, he saw a  helicopter.  A rope ladder was lowered and he saw a shapely pair of legs  desend.  Rock would recognize those legs anywhere: he pried them open once  before.l        &quot;Hello, Rock,&quot; Domino said, now joining him at  the summit.  &quot;Too bad Peter was here first.&quot;  Rock did not reply.   &quot;If it means anything to you, Peter didn't climb Everst; he took a  helicpoter.       Rock smiled.  He knew Cheating was no mountain climber.   Cheating and his ilk would never be more than mere social climbers.          &quot;But the credit will go to Peter,&quot; Domino said.        Rock said  not a word.  What did her care for the recognition of fools and  humanitarians?        &quot;Anyway, Howard, I just wanted to let you know  that I'm filing rape charges against you.  I might have enjoyed it, but it  was still rape.&quot;       Rock said not a word.  There was only one  person who could have put such dangerous ideas  in Domino's head, and it  wasn't Susan Brownemiller.       &quot;Fooey will represent me,&quot;  Domino said.        Of course, Hellsworth Fooey!  Fooey, a humanitarian  plotting to destroy the world through la ethal injection charity.  Fooey  would start with a soup kitchen and wouldn't stop until he had housed  all  the world's poor.        &quot;You'll spend a few years in jail,&quot;  Domino was saying.  &quot;You can use the time to study and get a real  job.&quot;        Yes, that's exactly what he would do.  Cheating had  beaten him to the top of the highest mountain, but he - Rock - would build  andscale the world's highest building.                             Chapter  2       Five years later, Rock's plans were complete.  There was a knock on  the door.  Rock knew it was Domino.         &quot;Hello, Howard,&quot; she  said.  &quot;I'm sorry I didn't visit, but the slammer is such a depressing  place.  Are these your plans?  Why, I'm flattered, it looks just like a  domino.&quot;        &quot;It will be the world's tallest building,&quot;  Rock said.  At thirty thousand feet, it will be taller than any mountain.   I'll be the first to climb it.&quot;        &quot;But Peter will beat you;  hel'll take the elevator.&quot;        &quot;There will be no  elevators.&quot;        &quot;Then he'll take the stairs.&quot;          &quot;There will be no stairs.&quot;         Domino was struck with awe.   She was in the presence of no mere ordinary date rapist; Rock was a man who  could stick it to the world. &quot;But, Howard, don't you think it will be  hard to get financial backing for a building without elevators and  stairs?&quot;        &quot;Fooey has arranged everything,&quot; Rock said.                                       Chapter 3             Howard Rock  looked skyward.  His building, Mount Neverest, was complete.  He, Rock, had  refused to pander to softed-hearted philanthropists and hard-headed  corporatists alike. Only true mountain climbers would scale his building.   Let social climbers like Peter Cheating design buidling with stairs and  elevators.  Why word had it that Cheating had included wheel chair ramps in  his last building!       &quot;So, Howard, we've finally done it,&quot;  Fooey said.   &quot;Where is your climbing gear.?&quot; Rock  looked at his  feet.  Fooey understood: Rock would pull himself by his own bootstraps.                               Chapter 4         Rock toiled for forty days and  forty nights.  Why mounting Domono hadn't caused him half so much trouble!    Finally, he pulled himself to the top.  And there, fluttering inthe wind,  as though laughing at him,  was the flag of Peter Cheating.  But how!?         &quot;What's the matter, Howard?&quot;         Rock turned.  It was  Hellsworth Fooey.         &quot;I took the elevator,&quot; Fooey explained.   He smiled and added, &quot;I'd like you to meet some of my friends.  Fooey  opened the door and a procession of wheel chair bound invalids rolled out  onto the roof.  Hellsworth was in his glory.  &quot;Express elevators,  local elevators, escalators, emergency stairwells.  All the creature  comforts a degenerate public and a unionized work force could ask for.          Rock said not a word.  He knew what he had to do.                             Chapter 5        &quot;The People rests,&quot; Fooey said.  He had  presented an ironclad case.  Howard Rock had, with malice and forethought,  firebombed Mount Neverest, killing three hundred children in the day care  center.  Rock did not deny the charges.        &quot;If you wish to apply  the letter of the law, I am guilty,&quot; he said.  &quot;But I appeal to a  higher authority.  Mount Neverest was an affront to artistic integrity.   Elevators and stairs and worst of all, priority parking for the  handicapped!&quot;        Rock continued on for another three hundred  pages, after which he said not a word.                             Chapter  6       Has the jury reached a verdict?&quot; the judge asked.         &quot;We have your honor.   We find the author, Ayn Rand, guilty of wooden  language, cardboard characters and contrived plotting.  Worse, we find her  guilty of foisting her infantile philosophy upon us.        Any Rand said  not a word, but fourteen years later replied with fifteen hundred pages of  nonsense.
0345350472|5.0|A dark tale of unforgiving hatred between man and his creation, this story dives deep into the questions of not just who are we but what are we? And where do we come from? Deckard, a futuristic government hitman hired to  kill manufactured humans struggles with a foreboading conscience asking  himself who really decides which life is valuable and which is expendable?  <br />And in the process finds he is the one, wether he likes it or not.
B000002I2G|4.0|This is not the Doors' best, nor the worst by far. If one is to rate this through the cassette version, the B-side would rank, in my opinion, as the best. &quot;Wild Child&quot;, &quot;Running Blues&quot;, &quot;Wishful  Sinful&quot; and &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; are the best entries. Side A's  &quot;Touch Me&quot; is the best of that portion, while the other songs are  just, well, there. Those entries are not bad, but just lack noteworthiness.
0399143904|2.0|...*somebody* needs to edit it for spelling and punctuation.  The errors are glaring.  It's distracting to read.<br />And here's an idiom that is used too often: &quot;for him, killing is as automatic as zipping his fly after  taking a leak.&quot;  Interesting the first time.  Do we have to repeat it  again and again?<br />I always expect the best from Tom Clancy, and he should  hold his editors to the same high standards.<br />I remain an avid Tom Clancy  reader.
B000002I27|4.0|It is said that The Doors were under a lot of pressure in 1967 to come up with a second album, with the success of the first still on their tongues. Well, they delivered nicely. Just about all the songs are very easy to  listen to. Not a lot of chance-taking tunes that the debut album had  featured. The long ballad here is &quot;When the Music's Over&quot;, the  song that rocks the most. Of all six albums, &quot;Strange Days&quot; seems  to feature the most slow songs. A great album!
0790729652|4.0|The movie itself is great and the sound is excelent but they did a horrible job of transferring it to DVD.  There is jumping all over the place.  On the other hand, like most of their other movies, this company  did put it in both letterbox and widescreen which allows me a lot of  freedom depending on company of how to watch it.
B000002KGT|5.0|One of those examples of a group that's been around a while, but hasn't broken out of the ground until now. In 1977 Fleetwood Mac gave us this spectacular album. Stevie Nicks provides some good solos here, in  &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; Many of the songs became  hit singles. Overall, an extremely enjoyable album that was to be a  highlight of the late 1970s, and yet managed to not have a single disco  dance tune(hooray!)
6303393977|5.0|Great movie.  I think some of the best work by Newman and Redford.  Captures some innocent moments that shows that even dangerous outlaws have a heart.  Good soundtrack too.  I may be somewhat biased, this was one of  the first movies I ever got to see at a movie theatre.
B000002I2I|5.0|Despite the band's internal problems with Morrison's drinking and what not, The Doors still managed to come up with a rockin' album amid the Miami &quot;heat&quot;. <br />   No bad songs here, though it is strange that  &quot;Waiting For The Sun&quot; is here, raher that on the same-named album  two years before. &quot;Peace Frog&quot; is a fun song, probably the  album's best. Very rocking, bluesy album that is a sure pleaser
B0000024Z7|5.0|From surrealist psychedelia to smooth R&amp;B to balls to the wall free jazz explosions, Carlos and company take you on a musical journey you'll never forget.  The serenity of opening tracks &quot;Eternal Caravan of  Reincarnation&quot; and &quot;Waves Within&quot; gradually progress, as the  album plays, into the sheer jazz chaos of closing tracks &quot;La Fuente  Del Ritmo&quot; and &quot;Every Step Of The Way.&quot;  This album, though  maybe not for the casual pop rock listener, is a definite must have for any  fan of Santana or of jazz in general
B000002I2M|5.0|A powerful last word from Morrison. There are one or two disappointments here, particularly &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot;. &quot;Hyacinth House&quot; is also a weak entry, but has a good tune. The entire  &quot;A-side&quot;, right up to the title song, is superb. The &quot;Side  B&quot; entriesare made up for in &quot;Texas Radio &amp; The Big  Beat&quot; and &quot;Riders On The Storm&quot;, Morrison's somber exit  song. Suggestion: listen to The Doors, then to L.A. Woman, and hear the  difference in Morrison's voice between 1967 and 1971. The drugs and  drinking had made the vocal cords quite hoarse, which worked on many later  songs that might not have worked on earlier compositions.
6303430570|1.0|This has gotta be the worst script I've ever heard in a movie. Kevin Smith seems to be trying for a world record in tastelessness. His jokes aren't funny or clever, just vulgar. Like other overrated screenwriters like Matt  Damon/Ben Affleck and Tarantino, Smith seems to think that there is merit  in vulgarity. He doesn't realize that the is NO merit in such. Anyone can  think of profanity; it requires niether creativity nor intelligence.
B000002I25|5.0|The year 1967 introduced a new kind of rock with The Doors. Unlike other groups whose songs tended to sound the same in the '60s, The Doors debut album provided something different with each song, from good ol' rock and  roll to slow, somber love tunes, to a mesmerizing Oedipal ballad at  &quot;The End&quot;. This is the album that gave the world &quot;Light My  Fire&quot;, &quot;Break On Through&quot;, the German-sounding &quot;Alabama  Song&quot;, and the highly suggestive &quot;Back Door Man&quot;. Tremendous  debut album, not all bands can open to the world like this.
B000002USN|3.0|I don't care what the 'pro's' say about Duets. I like the album and play it all the time in my car. It's some classic Frank with a few other voices mixed in and I don't know why some people hate it. Sure, it's mixed and not  altogether real but the sound is good. Great driving music. T Bennet is  great in 'New York', and of course there is Streisand. Buy it!
0780624890|5.0|i saw it at the cinema and loved it i saw it on dvd and loved it even more second time around this is definitely one for a big screen, a dark room and speakers so damn loud it makes your ears bleed i now wish i was black -  blade is just too cool for it's own good!
B0000035E7|3.0|Bleach just isn't complete; the band needed more time in the oven.  Kurt's getting it together, but it just ain't there yet.  The album is amateurish.  Then again that's the point, but, then again it's not.  Don't kid  yourself, the brilliance was yet to come; this is nothing but a notice to  serve.  It's for the hardcore fans only.
B000001DYD|5.0|as this decade draws to a close and people take a minute to step back and reflect over the outstanding achievments in music, i find that this album  is definately one of the best.  PJ Harvey's voice and songwriting are  totally raw and sincere.  PJ Harvey is also a great guitarist, listen to  the guitar solo on &quot;Dry&quot; or the song &quot;Ecstasy&quot;.  also,  the album was produced by noise-guru steve albini, and many people have a  love it or hate it view on the sound on the album.  personally, i think  it's great, though it does make listening to the album at low volumes  difficult, this is an album that was meant to be turned up!!  every song on  this album is strong, i find it hard to pick out a favorite.  these songs  bespeak power, emotion, honesty, truth, beauty and love, each in their own  way.  i find it difficult to find a more compelling artist making music  this decade.  although all of her lps are excellent, if i HAD to pick a  favorite, it would be this one, and this is the one i heard first...it  definately gets my vote for top ten of the '90s.
6302902010|5.0|This visually beautiful and excellently sung version of Gershwin's opera explains why his estate refuses to allow the Hollywood version to be seen. The sets of this Glyndenbourne production underlines the closed environment  where the characters are psychologically imprisoned, but through Gershwin's  music and especially Porgy's character, the drama ends in hope. If anyone  wants Sammy Davis (who at least sings) and Sidney Poitier (who mouths  them), all's the pity.
0790729628|4.0|Blade Runner is a fantastic, thought provoking movie.  The video quality on the DVD is excellent, but the lack of 5.1 sound, and lack of special features hurts the overall package somewhat.  <br />If you've already got this  on VHS, there's no real reason to buy the DVD (unless your VHS copy has  worn out with use, of course).<br />An excellent movie, though.
6305265488|5.0|Drew Barrymore displays excellence once more in this 2-b classic film. This is a great movie for any collection!
0399137084|5.0|This book shows the power of Poirot's &quot;Little gray cells&quot;. If I was to solve the crime I wouldn't have solved in a million years. Agatha Christie is the greatest writer ever!   If I could give this book more  stars I would!
B00000GAIW|5.0|This is Tull's best ablum.  Enough said.  Regarding the previous review's question:  I think the only difference between this release and last year's release is that the packaging is not as elaborate on this new version (the  same holds true for Thick As A Brick).
0345350499|5.0|This book was given to me years ago, as a gift, and I have since read it three times!  It was one of the first books I'd ever read that made me think I actually knew the characters, in person.  Since then, I have given  it to several friends and everyone agrees....it's an exceptional re-telling  of Arthur's story, from many points of view.
B000002TQV|5.0|In my opinion, many great albums are great because they straddle a line.  On one side of the line are albums where every song sounds the same, or there are no definite songs (like mood music). On the other side of the  line are singles collections, which have a lot of great songs, butdon't  coalesce together for a greater effect.  Most great albums occupy a medium  space, and no album (that I've heard) occupies this space like Radiohead's  The Bends. There is no song that sticks out llin this album, which is  exactly how it should be, because all of the songs are uniformly great.   Each song is a classic, but the album is even better because the whole  transcends all of its parts.  Borrowing from folk, punk, electronica, arena  rock, psychedelia, janglerock, and New Wave, while throwing in Thom Yorke's  mournful, versatile falsetto, Radiohead conjures up a vision of despair,  pain, and fear so personal, it's hard not to react to it.  It could very  well have been called the Paranoid's Guide to Popular Music.  But even  though the album flirts with disaster by being so diverse in scope, the  songs string together bvy Yorke's ache and the band's sad and spooky sense  of melody.  Every song fits into a puzzle, and amazingly enough, wherever  the band goes on this album, they never lose their focus.  Not once. In  tone, versatility in style, power of effect, intelligence, energy, and  bizarre intensiy, this album is without equal in our decade.
6305079811|4.0|I love this movie but really.....what is the persentage of people who own huge projection TVs compared to the number of these &quot;widescreen only&quot; video releases (particularly on DVD).  I watch the thing on my  27&quot; normal size set and I can't even see the action.  Release more  movies that have both versions on the disk, please.
B00000AFWW|5.0|With the help of Billy Corgan Hole has finally reached full materity as a band.  No longer do they rely soley on brash lyrics and loud music to stand out from the crowd.  On this CD Love has a little something for everyone.  She shows us her softer more femine side with Northern Star and Dying, well  at least she gives us a more toned down version of her brash lyrics anyway,  and she also gives us long time fans a taste of the old Hole with Reasons  to be Beautiful.  All in all this is Hole's most complete effort to date  and by far the best of their work.
B000003GMQ|5.0|Steven Wilson's guitar solo on &quot;Dark Matter&quot; alone is enough to make Eric Clapton green with envy and David Glmour blush with embarrassment! And his blend of etheral acoustic guitar and slide  &quot;steel&quot; guitar on &quot;Every Home is Wired&quot; is positively  euphoric!
6303212379|5.0|If you are a fan of 80's movies and you like a little adventure then this is a great movie. I loved the dynamic of the kids and the adventure they undertake.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|When i listened to this album the first time, i didnt like it as much as i do now. All of the songs have grown on me. I can't stop listening to them. Not as good as the earlier release &quot;Smash&quot; but very enjoyable.
B0000069NC|5.0|For all of you jazz fans out there who, unfortunately, think of Bill Evans as the lush, smooth, romantic stylist, this album will come in as a shock. Evans turns in an absolutely powerhouse, intense performance; he swings the  hardest he ever did, and his melodic lines are more acerbic and biting than  usual. His chording is also much more dry and tense; it's almost like he  had been jamming with Herbie Hancock before the concert. Sometimes his  solos are hysterically intense, as on &quot;Someday My Prince Will  Come.&quot; Of course, having Jack De Johnette's angular, disjointed  drumming contributes mightily to this previously unseen element in Evans'  style. This album should disprove the lingering image of Evans as the  &quot;cocktail pianist&quot; among great jazz keyboardists.
B00000DGUG|5.0|From Jagged Little Pill to Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.<br />Alanis Morisette is certainly an equal to Mr. Bob Dylan. She is using her voice in a a very broad way. Writing marvelous lyrics, music, protests, views about  relations etc. The songs varying from a very hard rocking to soft, acoustic  melodious  character.  It's a very versatile compilation of styles and  sounds. Place your headphones, sit down, (read the songtext) and you gone  love this songs !
0780624890|4.0|From the start Blade contains some of the most kinetic fight scenes ever filmed.  What's even cooler is that the lone warrior is taking on hordes of blood-sucking vampires.  With lots of high-tech weaponry and super-human  martial arts, as well as a healthy dosage of blood and gore, Blade is great  for action and horror fans alike.<br />The DVD itself is amazing.  The  supplements it contains are astonishing.  Blade is the reason DVD was  created!
630280082X|5.0|For the Blues lovers, this is one of the best movies that i ever seen in my life. Feel the sadness, all the feelings in your body, get a guitar, and start to play  a deep song... I was 15 when i saw this one, and i'm trying  to get it, now i have it.
0670880728|5.0|I have not read a good book or had a rather good laugh until I met Bridget Jones!  She and her Singleton friends are an absolute crack up. This book is a must read for all twenty and thirty somethings!  I love Bridget's wit  and humor and how Helen Fielding potrays her as a real 90's woman.  I can't  stop laughing with Bridget even after I put the book down!
031286504X|4.0|This is not only one of the best modern horror novels, but one of the essential books of this century.  It captures well the alienation and horror of conformity that characterizes much modern literature.  I think  this book would appeal to readers of Kafka and Camus as well as to readers  of Stephen King.  When it comes to good books, genres are irrelevant.  This  is one of my favorite books.
0399103422|5.0|After doing an extensive report on the accuracy of The Godfather, I have learned to appreciate the book for more than its literary perfection. A MUST read for anyone! It has a section for sadists, romancers, romancees,  action-junkies, etc. Just Read it already!!!
0767817478|2.0|The special effects were in a word - cool. The movie was in a word -  bad. Any movie that has characters who make me want to physically abuse my TV has a problem.  At least Jean Reno was a highlight in an otherwise  &quot;enh&quot; film.
B0000028UK|3.0|Yellow Ledbetter was a bside for the Ten album. Which is the only PJ album I own. Before they started on the journey towards boredom with this OK album, with a couple of terrrible songs. Hmmm.. For such a passionate  review, you really should know what your talking about.
0385493800|3.0|Grisham's latest is not the frenzied, fast-paced, all action,no character book of recent years.  Although he remains true to his muse and focuses on a Southern lawyer with personal problems, he takes the time to let the  character develop and even gives space to some introspective and insightful  musings from  Nate O'Riley.  His protagonists (the Phelan family) are still  one-dimensional, perhaps tempering their greed with some more admirable  qualities would make them more interesting.  Troy Phelan emrges as a comic  book character without any clue as to why he would act the way he  does...since the entire plot hinges on his initial action, more attention  to motivation would have made a great deal of sense.      Passages that  take place in the jungles of Brazil and the Chesapeake cottage ring with  more authenticity and depth.  All in all, I enjoyed the book despite its  shortcomings and found it a change in the right direction from recent  Grisham offerings.
B000001Y42|3.0|just what the world needs a few more korns!  korn is gay enough by themselves, we really dont need anymore do we?  although limp bizkit actually show a little bit of talent...i gave this cd 3 stars, one for each  song worth listening to.  don't make the same mistake i did,  dont bother  buying this cd..unless you are really into korn.
B000002VCQ|5.0|I love the inspirational song &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;, it really helps me when I am down.  I also love the emotion - filled &quot;Saving All My Love For You&quot;.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|Ok first of all, I read the reviews for all of the other Off Spring CD's out(amazon). This album is still Off Spring and the main purpose is still there.  Rock, punk whatever.  Its still awesome music that catches your  attention.  I recommend this album to any fans that respect good lyrics and  fast guitar playing.
0606030573|5.0|The book begins (as all of Maugham's works) slowly, only after you are in the story do you appreciate the foundation he has laid. This is a book to read and put away for six months and read again. Maugham introduces you to  to many characters wandering in and out of Larry Darrell's life, each with  their own hidden agenda. Each one of them falls victim to their own  weaknesses, Larry remains true to his agenda and not only survives but  thrives. If you like this novel, then The Moon and Sixpence should be your  next book.
6300216748|5.0|In &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; we are reminded how the smallest of actions can make the biggest differences in our lives.  A trip to pick up lunch saves our hero, Joe Turner, from being massacred like the rest of  his co-workers.  Then we are taken by this common man through a journey of  personal terror and self awareness of what heights we can reach if the  situation presents itself.  Redford, as always, makes us feel as though  perfection is the main ingredient of acting.  Dunaway shows us a side of  herself that she has never before brought to light.  She is scared,  vulnerable, intelligent, and forgiving all wrapped up into a woman caught  up in circumstances beyond her control.  Max Von Sydow is cool and  nonchalant in his role as the assasin.  He is all business and his loyalty  is to the highest bidder. His Jolbert is a man completely comfortable with  his profession and finds peace and solitude in it.  John Houseman and Cliff  Robertson are perfectly cast.  From the first frame to the last frame we  are treated to a full range of emotions that makes the journey one of the  most enjoyable ones that we will ever take.  If you like Redford, and how  could you not, then take the time to enjoy one of his most memorable  performances.  You can even have a bag of popcorn while you're at it.
0140177396|4.0|The wonderful narrative style that Steinbeck uses here helps to make the book even more brutal and touching. Unlike others, I feel that this book is not too short. In its brevity, Steinbeck has still effectively portrayed  the difficulties of the life of ranch hands in the 1930s.<br />The special  relationship that Lennie and George share is especially heartwarming, and  is the focal point of our compassion. Lennie's childlike innocence is also  enduring and when we see how he has unknowingly killed Curly's wife, we  cannot help but feel that George's decision to kill him instead of letting  him face the wrath of the mob is the right one. That way he will still die  preserving his innocence.<br />All in all a deeply moving novel that is both  heartwarming yet tough and brutal, like the life of a ranch hand.
6300208699|4.0|Confirmation that the rich are as bad as we poor folk think. Sellers' performance is excellent, so dry and yet endearing. Must see for any Monty Python or Pink Panther fans.
B000002BYD|5.0|Jamers show their ability to make the greatest sounds one more time.Yield is just a masterpiece from its faithfuly sound of the &quot;faithful&quot; to the top mountains of the &quot;evolution&quot;.Eddie's awesome voice  gives the greatest feelings to the listener.
0385484518|5.0|I was given this book as a gift after learning my mother has terminal cancer.  I would recommend this book to everyone and I am planning on getting the audio for my Mom. Morrie was a very fortunate man to have so  many friends and family when he reached the &quot;bridge&quot; in his life.   His words will always stick with me &quot;Invest in the human  family&quot;. &quot;Invest in people&quot;.
0425129586|5.0|It happens to be my first Christie and I must say I am thoroughly impressed.  The story is top-notch and it has you going till literally the last page.  Read it to believe it!
6302906636|5.0|There can only be one, instead of seeing sequels just watch it again and again.  What puts this movie apart from others?  The wonderful translations between scenes as it flashes back into the past and back into the present.   In fact it seems to falter in this only once..and recently I found out that  was due to editing (the directors cut should have that extra flashback).   Anyway, it is a wonderful film and if you haven't seen it you must!
6303674984|5.0|The Gettysburg gift box set is a must for any Civil War buff. The directors cut adds so much more to the story, with the additional footage of John Bufford and his role at Gettysburg. We love the movie, the extras  in the gift set are well worth it, the making of Gettysburg vidio,sound  track, book, bullet and pictures. A definite collectors choice
B0000024Z7|5.0|Neal Schon and Carlos Santana complement each other so well here it's hard to imagine this album marked the end of their synergistic collaboration.   &quot;Downbeat&quot; published an interview with Schon (I'm thinking like  15 years ago) and he said that he played the bulk of the lead in &quot;Song  of the Wind&quot;.  I've listened to that track close to 100 times over the  intervening years and I'll be damned if I can detect the Schon-Santana  transition(s).  It's totally seamless.  The raspier Schon leads, so  distinct on Santana III, are also in abundance on &quot;Caravanserai&quot;  - an album that marked the band's foray into the &quot;eastern&quot; sound  of the early 70's popularized by John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra.   <br />Speaking of McLaughlin, the pioneering jazz-fusion guitarist appeared on  Santana's &quot;Welcome&quot; LP that immediately followed  &quot;Caravanserai&quot;. No doubt, Carlos missed swapping it  back-and-forth after Schon departed for Journey.  Although they've recorded  many times together, I believe this was the first, and in my opinion, best  Santana-McLaughlin effort.  I only mention this here because  &quot;Welcome&quot; seems to be unavailable (in the US anyway) on CD.
6303921248|5.0|My friend was studying abroad in England when the miniseries came out on BBC.  When she returned, all she had to talk about her trip was Pride and Prejudice.  We all thought she was nuts but when we sat down to watch it,  we became just as big of fans.  It makes you truly appreciate Austen's wit.
0131103628|5.0|This book is great for helping, So many parts of the language can be tricky to someone just learning it. But this book is great for referencing those tricky parts.
0792151712|3.0|I saw TITANIC and I would have to say that even though the special effects are great the acting leaves something to be desired and here's why. I found leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet seemingly miscast in thier roles also  the mushy diolouge dosen't help either as well. I admit I would have found  the film much more enjoyable if the story had focused on some of the real  people on the TITANIC such as MOLLY BROWN, THE ASTORS, etc.  I feel that  would have made the movie a whole lot better than it actually was. Don't  get me wrong I'm not saying this film does'nt have great oops! I mean  spectactcular effects but that seemed to me the best part of the film so in  my opinion this film wasn't deserving of it's eleven oscar awards to say  the least. My advice see AMISTAD instead now that's a really great picture.
B00000AFFF|5.0|I have to admit that I bought this CD out of curiosity of such a strange pairing of musicians. I was totally captured by the uniqueness of the Bacharach sound (still there) and the vocals of EC.  This has quickly  become my favorite CD.  &quot;Toledo&quot; has played on my stereo so many  times, I think the cat is about to protest!
6300189821|5.0|I love this movie!  It's full of harmless fun.  Andrew McCarthy plays a sculptor who falls in love with his mannequin creation (Kim Cattrall).  This is a modern retelling of the black and white &quot;One Touch of  Venus.&quot;  The chemestry between Kim and Andrew is unbelieveable, and  Meshach Taylor of Designing Women is a scream.  Buy this movie!  I did!
B00000DFRS|5.0|Whitney Houston is one of those rare artist who can adjust to the \\"times\\" and \\"trends\\" of the day. \\"My Love Is Your Love,\\" is an example of how it should be done. Extremely well! With  the release of this CD, her recording career picks up where it left off. At  the top! I was delighted to see her and Mariah Carey come together for a  long overdue duet. 'When You Believe,' is a fitting showcase for displaying  both of these equally gifted talents. Almost everything is listenable, but 'My Love Is Your Love,' 'If I Told You That,' and 'Get It Back,' seem to  take it to another level. WHITNEY IS MOST DEFINITELY BACK!
0964385619|5.0|ROBERT'S BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE. I HAVE PERSONALLY GIVEN THIS BOOK AS GIFTS TO OTHER PEOPLE I LOVE AND CARE ABOUT AND ALSO HAD MY 17 YR OLD AND 11 YR OLD READ IT. IN MY OPINION THIS BOOK SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SCHOOL  SYSTEM
B000002BQK|5.0|This CD shows us a side of Mariah we have never seen; vulnerable, sensitive and hurting. It makes for her best effort yet. Through personal setbacks, (her recent divorce) Mariah has matured into one of our greatest R&B divas. The album ranks extremely high in my book. By far, my favorite track is 'Breakdown'. This song has reached a level few others  have attained with me. It has an emotional passion that is a thrill to listen to. Close behind it is the equally passionate 'Babydoll'. 'Honey', 'The Roof', 'The Beautiful Ones' and 'Outside' all come across as  transparencies of her heart. This is the adult effort the critics have been looking for for years. Great Stuff!
0767800958|5.0|I too give tango lessons and I was so impressed. What a wonderful story.  Great acting.
0790738139|1.0|Why, oh why are people obsessed with promoting movies that depend more on vulgarity and sex than plot?  Why do these movies never-the-less garner all sorts of critical acclaim?  This seedy study of a creep cop and his slut  girl had every cliche in the book, and every cuss word to boot.  I think,  gee, what would I rather watch?  A masterpiece like Lillies of the Field or  this LA Confidential garbage?  Moral of story:  I'll never be a Hollywood  critic because I favor movies that lift the human spirit, not that show us  what rotten scum we are underneath our veneer of civility.  So be it.   Please, Amazon, allow us to rate films with no stars.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This recording does not disappoint. As a matter of fact, it tends to show exactly how far hip-hop can reach in terms of diversity. Ms. Hill's powerful voice as well as her penchant for penning personal as well as  relevant lyrics combine to produce an entirely enjoyable CD. By blending  reggae on tracks such as Lost Ones and Forgive them Father with  &quot;traditional&quot; hip-hop beats, while maintaning  an old-school  R&amp;B flavour on most of the other tracks, she shows the extent of her  diversity. The most striking thing about this album to me however, is the  way her extremely personal lyrics manage to be relevant to me as  well.<br />Maybe I'm just biased because of my love affair with reggae but  this is easily the best recording I heard in 1998.
078062551X|5.0|A lot like the Crow and Bladerunner, dark as a film noir movie ought to be. My only complaint is the overdramatic music. The visual effects are stunning, and the plot is very well written. A great movie all around.
0790739909|5.0|Excellent Movie.  Sad, but at the same time it gives you a warm feeling inside.  Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan are perfect actor and actress for the two major roles.
B000002HPV|4.0|This album takes everything that I ever thought about Bjork and music and turned it into something completely unrecognizable;however, because I was staring at my coffee table at the time I finished listening to the album  and I knew that that was my coffee table, I couldn't immediately see the  change that her voice and music had made in the things around me.  Now,  every time I look at that coffee table, I think about the song Bachelorette  and how it made everything kind of jiggle and warp.  I really was moved.  She is an amazing artist, my world would be less of a world without her  voice and vision. This album only makes me want more and more. She  successfully meshes all opposing forces, spirituality and materialism,  classical singing and techno-rave-space music.  It is indescribable.  I  have heard no other artist do this so well so many times.
068484267X|5.0|I found this book very compelling.  I was touched by the memories Frank decribed.  I love the book because of the hope and courage it showed me.  It proves that anyone can make it in this world if they chose to.  My heart  ached reading this knowing people out there still suffer like Frank did.   The hope Frank offers to people in his same situation is amazing.
6305265488|5.0|I thought that this movie was an excellent spin on an old story. Usually, Cinderella is portrayed as this little waif girl who hopes someone will notice her. Someone who waits for a Man to rescue her. However in this  story, Cinderella(as portrayed by Drew Barrymore), has a strong sense of  self and of herself. She knows she is smart and cunning, and, unfortunately  knows her stature in the rigid class system of the Middle Ages. Yet she  overcomes this with grace and humility, even when she is insulted by her  family.I felt that Dougray Scott did an excellent job as the Prince. His  character even had to be rescued instead of the other way around.The angle  with Leonardo da Vinci was rather awesome, it fared well in the frame and  context in the movie. Also, the idea of libraries at the monasteries was so  historically accurate. For that I was proud of Hollywood itself! This movie  puts a 90s twist on the Cinderella story. This film is even suitable for  children, it does not have profanity, nudity, or anything else that could  be of high offense to someone. The innards of the film such as direction,  production, cinemotography and the like were all solid. I recommend this  film highly!!!!!
0552131067|5.0|I think that Mort is the best Pratchett book I have read so far. Too bad they are so hard to find that I have to buy them!
0790737973|2.0|Crichton is a masterful story writer, and has rubbed a dab of his style off on me. The movie sphere is not completely terrible, but not amazing. I guess that Hollywood believes if you throw in enough cursing it will make  any movie good. But I think, as some of the other viewers do, that they  should have stuck more to the book. It is a terrific story that I have read  enjoyably several times.  But the makers should have spent more time on the  film! If the basic plot would have been as inspiring as the book, I  wouldn't have minded to sit two more hours for it.  It had the basis to  become a terrific blockbuster  equal to Jurassic Park. But unfortunately it  doesn't come close to what I anticipated. The movie is ok for the,  &quot;Blow em up, blood and dribble&quot; lovers. But if you want complete  satisfaction, READ THE BOOK!
6304698798|5.0|Watch the VHS of this movie then watch the DVD.  The colors seem to be more vibrant on the DVD.  The outtakes let's you get a deeper perspective into the storyline, however you must read the english subtitles.  THE GOOD,  THE BAD, &amp; THE UGLY  is bigger and better than ever.
6302180163|5.0|what i really want to say (and i can't find anywhere else to write this comment) is that i would love to buy this videotape but i live in new zealand where we only have the PAL system. if you're a truly international  outfit why don't you supply this too. P L E A S E  T R Y!!
630419143X|5.0|This is the best animated video ever. my youngsters have seen this video almost everyday for the past 24 months and still haven't got tired of it. I can't wait for TOY STORY2 to be available on video from amazon.com
B00000DBXL|4.0|Well, I don't really know what to say.  I mean, Fashion Nugget used to be quite awesome, but now I'm somewhat tired of it.  Will Prolonging The Magic suffer the same fate?  Who knows.  Its certainly a different album--the  whole feel of it is different.  There's a lot more experimentation (if you  want to call it that).  Never There, Hem Of Your Garment, and Sheep Go To  Heaven are the best tunes.  The thing I don't like is that it doesn't have  the quirkiness that the first record had.  SOme of the songs do, but on the  whole, it just seems like the band wasn't as enthusiastic while manking  this record.  John McRea sings a bit too much, instead of his traditional  speaking of the lines, but thats ok most of the time.  Only on songs like  You Turn THe Screws does he get bothersome.  So, I guess you should pick it  up if you've got some dough.  I like it, but the question is, will you?
B000005H4X|5.0|This is Blakey's best Record. Try it. Bobby Timmons, Lee Morgan, Benny Golson formed the Messengers's best line up. I do not have words. Go and get the record, then we will talk.
6303379214|5.0|This funny movie is one you'll love if you like witty dialogue, great acting,(Marisa and Robert are a great team),and exciting costumes.  Marisa's clothes were beautiful. It's a family movie, so you can relax and  put down the remote. No fast-forwarding here! Well, you may find  yourself...rewinding. One of my favorite scenes is when Robert helps Marisa  get ready for a date with someone else and gives her the items BEFORE she  asks for them.Then he sprays some of her perfume in the air then holds the  bottle to his nose as if he were holding her.  Be still my romantic heart!   I hope these two team up again for another romantic comedy. Enjoy!!!!
B000009CEM|5.0|Fear Factory's most recent release, &quot;Obsolete&quot; is by far their best work yet.  While &quot;Demanufacture&quot; was toned down a bit from their previous album, &quot;The Soul of a New Machine&quot;, it is  considered by most to be an improvement.  Well folks, Fear Factory has far  outdown even &quot;Demanufacture&quot; this time.  Every song on this album  gives a different look into the tormented souls of the members of the band,  while unfolding an album-long short story about machines taking over the  world.  With insane head-pounding songs like &quot;Edgecrusher&quot;,  &quot;Shock&quot;, &quot;Hi-Tech Hate&quot;, and &quot;Securitron&quot;,  Fear Factory keeps it's crazed, wall-banging fans (like myself) happy.   They do this while showing their technical genius in songs like  &quot;Resurrection&quot; which combines Burton C. Bell's steely, yet  melodic voice with nasty riffs and power chords.  Fear Factory even shows a  mellow, compassionate side as they conclude their pessimistic,  machines-ruling-man tale with the emotional song &quot;Timelessness&quot;.   The album's jacket even includes a storyline which fills in the missing  details of the plot between the song lyrics.  In all, this is, by far Fear  Factory's best album to date, and is a must-have for any collector of heavy  metal or industrial.
6304118392|5.0|This is the most exciting movie i have ever watch.I watched it maybe 10 times ,each time i felt different thoughts about the movie. It would be really nice to have this movie in DVD.Waiting for it..!!
B00000GRL0|5.0|I laughed, I cried...Bruce Lee takes you on a roller coaster of emotion in this 1973 action thriller.  Co-starring John Saxon and Jim Kelly this is martial arts mahem at its finest.  Forget plot, forget acting, Bruce will  captivate and amaze in his finest perfomance since Gone With The Wind.
0385333846|4.0|With &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut has done the near impossible - he has created a surrealistically cautionary novel that uses humor to get at the horror of war and destruction.  While the  aforementioned intent is almost oxymoronic, somehow Vonnegut manages to  strike this very balance between humor and horror.  The chief reason this  novel succeeds is because it downplays dramatic confrontations and  characterizations and focuses instead on a detached, external perspective  in an effort to contrast the futility of mankind with his circumstances.   Truly a funny book that you won't dare laugh at.
6303234844|5.0|I found this video absolutely mezmorizing.  The musicians are in peak form - including a wonderful Paula Cole as backup singer.  Gabriel sounds and appears relaxed and in control.  Tony Levin's bass work is as much fun to  watch as to hear as with almost every song he incorporates a different  instrument or playing technique.  Gabriel continues to find ways to express  his thoughts and ideas with visceral, meaningful music with a depth that is  far too often lacking in most music these days.  This video only adds to  that richness.
0446310786|2.0|This was an extremely boring book (contrary to most opinions) that had an extremely slow start.
0792153367|5.0|This movie has something for everyone- love,humor,drama, and a happy ending! In this movie, Audrey Hepburn plays Holly Golighly,a party girl who plays by her own rules. When she falls for her upstairs neighbor, an  amazing story unfolds. You have to see this timeless romantic fairytale!
6305076650|5.0|I love this movie with all my heart and soul. It's definetly not for everybody, though. If you think cannabalism, murder, cross-dressing, and good old fashion rock and roll  are inappropriate subjects for a movie,  pass this one by. For the rest of you, BUY THIS!
6302994063|5.0|As others have already said.  This movie is great.  I love the part where Ken comes to ask Liz to dance with him after Pam Shore is in the accident.  The singing of &quot;Perhaps&quot; is wonderful.   This is a strangely  wonderful movie.
B000002HRE|1.0|THREE WORDS DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM &quot;STINK, STANK, STUNK&quot;! GET THE F$#@ OUTTA HERE. THIS AIN'T METALLICA, THIS IS POPROCKICA. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY WHEN EVERYONE KNEW WHO THEY WERE. I MISS THE GOOD OL' DAYS  WHEN I COULD MOSH AROUND MY ROOM AND AIR GUITAR TO THEIR SONGS, BUT NO  MORE, NOW I HANG MY HEAD IN SHAME AND BASK IN THE OLD ALBUMS OF YESTERYEAR  AND ASK MYSELF, &quot;WHAT, DID I MISS SOMETHING HERE?&quot; STICK A FORK  IN 'EM THEIR OVERDONE! SEE YA!
6304578458|3.0|This is like two separate movies -- the hit man black comedy starring John Cusack, Dan Akroyd and whoever plays Cusack's secretary, which I would unreservedly give 5 stars, and the insipid romance starring John Cusack and  Minnie Driver, which bogs down the action every time Minnie and her  chipmonk-like jowls appear on the screen.  Coulda been another &quot;Repo  Man&quot; (well, not quite) if Hollywood didn't feel compelled to insert  True Love into every computer-generated plot, even where it is completely  out of place and makes no sense whatsoever.  Have Cusack be hired to knock  off his old prom date, and actually waste her without batting an eye, and  you're talking a 5-star classic.  Worth seeing, but not something I'd want  to own.  Spend your hard-earned moola on &quot;Repo Man.&quot;
B000002N2P|5.0|this is one of green day best works although it is said to be a fluke just listen to it, its a great album that can really get you pumped or mellow you out. brain stew is probably their best song
B00000DFSK|2.0|Having never heard a U2 song before, I bought this album simply for its &quot;historical significance&quot; to the music industry. I was both surprised and dissapointed at its content.<br />&quot;Pride&quot; sounds like  something out of a nursery rhyme,but it grew on me after a while. &quot;New  Year's Day&quot; and &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; rank as two of my  favorite songs ever. And I thought &quot;I still haven't found what i'm  looking for&quot; and &quot;Where the streets have no name&quot; were  dandy, but that was pretty much the end of the  surprises.<br />&quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, and  &quot;I will Follow&quot; are three of the worst songs I've heard. The last  four songs sound like used car advertisments.<br />Verdict: Buy &quot;The  Joshua Tree&quot;, and possibly &quot;War&quot; because the rest of this  CD, besides &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot;, is crap.
6304057709|5.0|The mere fact that this was a movie based on a Jane Austen novel turned me off to this video initially.  But, being the true romantic that I am, curiosity got the better of me.  If you're hesitant to watch this movie  solely because it's an &quot;old&quot; story, I suggest you go ahead and  take the plunge.  The cinematography is gorgeous, and the character  development is sensational.  I was sincerely impressed by the actors'  performances;  Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet were fabulous.  You won't be  disappointed if you take the time to view this wonderful film.
0812046625|5.0|This is a unique book for anyone learning Russian language. The title says it all. When it comes to Russian verb conjugation, this book does it all, perfectively!!
0385484518|5.0|I had heard wonderful things about the book, but I had no intention of reading it.  I didn't want to get depressed reading about someone dying.  But when I received the book as a present for Christmas and I had some  extra time over my winter break, I sat down to read it.  I was completely  wrong about the book; it wasn't about dying, it was about living. I am  unbelievably grateful that I had the opportunity to read this book when I  still had the chance to make a change in my life.  Thank you Morrie, you  are in my prayers.
6304493738|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER. THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT AND COLORFUL. THE PLOT AND THE UNCOVERING OF THE PLOT ARE MASTERFUL. ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE HAS TRULY LOST OUT.
630512762X|3.0|An uncomfortable marriage of Woo's brand of violent melodrama and Hollywood assembly blockbuster, FACE/OFF is so out-there, loony, exciting, flimsy, bathetic, and occasionally profound that it would either leave you  breathless or bemused. The opening action blast-off and the final  mind-boggling boat chase sequence are pure Woo; maniacally choreographed,  they are somekind of religious celebration of montage, slow-motion, and  other barrages of techniques delivered with frightening dexterity. Cage is  great in his dual roles, perfect for Woo's operatic excesses, but Travolta  is a lightweight chipmunk. The film is shamelessly ludicrous,  scientifically and psychologically. You either draw a series of  &quot;Getouttahere&quot; blanks or get into it (I am somewhere in-between).  The anamorphically enhanced DVD looks superb, almost too perfect. The  soundtrack will give your system a good workout. Watch out for the bullet  ricochets. The lousy cheapskates at Paramount only give you a trailer. But  I'll bite.
6304578458|5.0|Every scene in John Cusack's movie (he co-wrote, co-produced and stars in it) helps to make it the best movie of the last dozen years.  It's the best human comedy that I've ever seen and the elements of romance and violence  make amazingly watchable.  I could literally see this movie every week.   The humor still makes me laugh ouot loud and the &quot;discovering  yourself&quot; plot almost brings tears to my eyes.  Plus, the use of color  and music to enhance the scenes and really highten the level of emotion.   It's an outstanding film.  My favorite and hopefully one of yours.
6305268835|5.0|ADAM SANDLER GOES BACK TO THE CHILDISH COMEDY THAT MADE HAPPY GILMORE AND BILLY MADISON SO UNBELIVABLY GOOD, NO SCRACH THAT, GREAT!
0790739909|5.0|This was the best movie of 1998. It gives us all a needed boost of spirituality. We all will never fear death again thanks to City of Angels.It may not be what happens to us when we die but at least now death  can make sense. Just magnificent performances by Ryan and Cage.
0441172717|5.0|A brilliant book by a brilliant writer.  Frank Herbert had an unique ability to write in an interesting, compelling and thought provoking way about complex human social issues such as religion, philosophy,  politics,  love,  warfare, ecology, and power (and the eternal abuse of power).  Dune  has it all and more.  The characters are real and believable and all too  human (warts and all).  Treachery, deceit, honor, sacrifice, heroes and  villians.  It's all there, in Mr. Herbert's fine prose, set in the  stunningly harsh and brutal realities of the planet Arrakis.  I've read all  of Frank Herbert's books, and without a doubt, Dune is the pinnacle of Mr.  Herbert's creative powers.  I highly suggest reading the whole Dune series.   But, if  you're only going to read one, read Dune.  It's the first and the  best.  This book is a must have on any self-respecting sci-fi fan's  bookshelf.  Dune is literally a masterpiece of science fiction.
B000002MU3|4.0|Ignore the negative reviews, this is a great album.  You'll be humming &quot;Kenneth...&quot;, &quot;Crush With Eyeliner&quot; and &quot;Bang and Blame&quot; over and over after listening to this wonderful CD.  A must-own  for any REM fan, and any fan of edgy alternative rock.
B00000HZFP|5.0|Jeez, it took long enough for this to come out--thankfully, it was completely worth the wait. Songs and lyrics hold their own away from the show's in-your-face experience, and I am very glad that cooler heads  prevailed and they did not include snippets of dialogue on the CD (a  tiresome, cheap and unfortunately common trend with cast albums).
0553275976|5.0|This book sums up New York and the criminal justice system.  Don't waste your time on A Man in Full.  Wolf lost the gift after Bonfire.
B000002MTU|5.0|Eric Clapton goes back to his roots:  The blues.  This is where he should stay.  All sixteen cuts on this album are covers of blues greats.  Only Eric adds his precise technical flash to them.  I listen to a lot of  electric blues.  There is no one, except the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, that  can play electric blues so perfectly.  Eric doesn't miss a note.  He feels  his way through each song, as blues was supposed to be played.  All of  these cuts, (except one), were live studio sessions.  What you hear on this  album is how it was played without all the mixing.  I wish all of his music  were this powerful and uplifting.
B00000AFWW|4.0|It is nice to see that this band can evolve, a lot of people complain that it lost the darker and angrier spirit that &quot;Live Through this&quot; has, however, I find that the new album is very attractive in many ways.  Sure, Live Through This is their best album, but this one is also very  enjoyable. especially Malibu, this song always makes me smile.
0679720200|5.0|Of course The Stranger is a brilliant novel, better than 99.9% of anything ever written, but readers should not think they know Camus because they've read it.  I read it in English and French, and if you can read French don't  bother with the English (Matthew Ward's translation is fabulous, but you'll  get so much more from the French.  And don't go anywhere near the Stuart  Gilbert translation!)  Anyway, the rest of Camus' work is so important  also, notably &quot;The Plague,&quot; an utterly betraying work of seminal  brilliance, &quot;The Fall,&quot; a mordant first person narrative seething  with wit (Sartre's favorite), his novellas in &quot;Exile and the  Kingsom,&quot; especially &quot;Jonas.&quot;   Camus was also involved  thoughtfully in world affairs, and the essays in &quot;Resistance  ,Rebellion and Death&quot; are timeless and provocative, and Camus also  wrote for theater.  His &quot;Caligula&quot; is at the top of my list for  the best plays of the century with &quot;Endgame&quot; by Beckett and  Sartre's &quot;No Exit.&quot;  &quot;Caligula&quot; explores the  phiosophical roots of tyrrany with insightful and clever banter and action.   Finally, there are those brilliant larger essays &quot;The Rebel&quot; and  &quot;The Myth of Sysphus&quot; to add to the list.  Perhaps the most  personal of his wrtitings if &quot;The First Man,&quot; a semi-bitter and  pensive evocation of a stark childhood, the manuscript of which was found  in the car which Camus was accidentally killed in at Sens in 1960.   &quot;The Stranger&quot; should never be seen as required reading for  school, because by essense it is so much more than that,  but people should  also see that Camus was so much more than &quot;The Stranger.&quot;
6305265488|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!  It's the first truly &quot;feel good&quot; movie that I have seen in ages.  I simply could not stop smiling for hours after I saw it (four times in the theater).  I've been counting down the days for  it to come out on video so I can have some instant cheer sitting on my  shelf at home.
6302641888|5.0|I saw this film over three months ago, but the brilliant images still stay with me, and I have a feeling that, like most great works, there are things that happen in this film that no one can ever forget.  The opening sequence  is far more original and artistic than most films of today which think they  are influenced by Bergman.  Along with being a startling intellectual  puzzle, this film also stands for many emotional problems and slips of  sincerity. The scene where the two women become one is reminiscent of the  bathing scene in a different but similarly harrowing work, The Plague, but  Camus.  Utterly breathtaking and provocative.
0780624890|5.0|This movie has amazing visual and sound.  It is like a living, breathing, blood sucking comic book. If you have just purchased a DVD player, this movie will reiterate why you cannot ever go back to VHS.
B000005ALP|4.0|This album grows on you. Its very well put together. The first time I listened to it I was not that impressed, but then I really listened to it the second time. It is a good album after all! The lyrics are very creative  and there is alot of things happening under the surface melody. Very  entertaining.
630438551X|5.0|This is a really good love story!  Everyone needs to see it
B00000HYXB|5.0|This is clearly the most intelligent, thought out,  melodic, and just plain incredible CD you'll ever own!  They somehow combine the cinematics of The Wall, yet it doesn't interfere with the music as much!  It's worth  every cent and more!  Get it!
6304711891|5.0|this movie is the best one that I have seen ever and is is just really cool I love movie that have to deal with seals, medical virsis, action
0887309372|3.0|I can't believe some of these other reviews.  Some guy gave it 5 stars and admitted that he hadn't read it yet!  I assume that isn't a plant, because it's too stupid to be a plant.<br />The book is good, thought-provoking, and  has some real insights.  HOWEVER, it is a little simplistic, and it's  written for the brand manager of Coke.  For those of us without 80+ years  of brand history behind us yet, some of his advice isn't relevant.  Also,  some of his conclusions are just too simplistic:  &quot;Symbols are  overrated and don't matter much anyway&quot; (paraphrasing).  Come on.  You  can't tell me the swoosh isn't a powerful asset, and the authors admit it,  but they poo-poo the entire concept.<br />Section on naming is very  insightful.  And the hard advice on expansion is right on!  Overall, good,  and worth buying for any marketing person.  But, this is definitely NOT the  bible.  Come on, people!
0802130208|5.0|sat on a shelf for several years until a friend began reading it and describing what he read. I couldn't stop laughing out loud even though i think i have met several people just like ignatius. have been recommending  it to anyone who isn't sick of hearing me rave about it. the characters are  first rate! the plot is insane and worthy of wodehouse for twists and how  it all comes together at the end. i especially loved miss trixie and wish  her well... hope they let her retire finally! Lots of fun to read.
B0000009OU|5.0|It's almost superfluous to offer a review of this record, Costello's, and one of rock's, finest albums.  What, after all, remains to be said?  From the furiously headlong beat that would quicken the pulse of a dead man (try  driving 55 while &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; through &quot;Lipstick  Vogue&quot; play on the car CD) to the direct and forceful writing that  hadn't yet been marred by EC's need to out-Porter Cole Porter (&quot;The  Beat&quot;, &quot;This Year's Girl&quot;), this is the perfect soundtrack  for anxious adolescence or, well, anything after.  No less so than  Beethoven's Fifth, it states its theme squarely at the start and only  builds -- dizzyingly and ecstaticly -- from there.<br />It is unfair to put  this inspired work up against all of the &quot;good&quot; albums that get 5  stars on this system.
B00000DFRS|5.0|I don't care what anyone says Whitney Houston is not only a force to be reckoned with but she is &quot;THE DIVA&quot; that consistently sets the standards.  Yes, her latest has alot more R&amp;B but what is the problem?   She is an African-American woman, with a beautiful voice, yes she has  crossed over but just because her album is not totally satisfying to the  &quot;pop&quot; culture that is no reason to down her.  All the Mariah fans  who are putting her down should really quit!  You're childish.  All I have  to say to Whitney is YOU GO GIRL!!!
0399143904|4.0|The main strength of the novel is its main idea - an all-out war on terrorism.  Clancy focuses on John Clark, Domingo Chavez and other characters who have had minor roles in previous novels.  While the action  scenes were exciting, there was not much transition between them.  Finally,  the book appears to be targeted to the general population, and thus appears  to be more of a financial endeavor on Clancy's part than anything else.  In  short, I did enjoy reading the book, but its quality was less than many of  his other books.
0783229011|5.0|this movie is so adorable!  I am 16 years old and it has been my favorite from the start.  Don't have any worries when you purchase this video. It is worth ever penny and is sure to bring you lots of laughs and tears.
B000002IJL|5.0|Oh god this is just one of those movies that hits you straight in the heart and the music for it just adds on to it. The music for this film was so welled picked it leaves a deep impact when the Stand By Me song comes  out in the end. I recommend you buy it.
B0000025D0|4.0|Being a early child of the MTV generation, 1979, I grew up hearing songs such as &quot;Born in the USA&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; on the radio, and I still worship them now.  Recently at dinner with my father  I mentioned the album &quot;Born in the USA&quot; and he told me that he  was actually dissapointed when it came out, as he felt it paled in  comparison the &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town.&quot;  I couldn't fathom  how this could be, so I pulled out an old vinyl..and guess what, it is  great.  Although I'm not quite as inspired by songs such as  &quot;Badlands&quot; and &quot;Candy's Room&quot; as I am by &quot;Dancing  in the Dark&quot; or more recently, &quot;Secret Garden,&quot; I have to  admit I love the album.  If you have any love for the Boss, take a shot at  this one =)
078401213X|5.0|Somehow, Aronofsky et al. have brought in a world class movie for less than the price of a Porsche.  As a mathematician who plays go, I found this film fascinating.  However, I'm a formalist (vs. Platonist), and so I must  ultimately reject the film's premise.  Why, then, did I give it 5 stars?   Because it made me think.  What a totally NOVEL idea in the age of $200M+  movies!
B00000G3HZ|4.0|This is a movie for anyone who has returned to a college reunion or a funeral and went to college in the 60's.  The ideals of the 60's have been replaced with jobs, mortgages, broken relationships and children.  The  reality is most are living a life of yuppie affluence and out grubbing for  money.  Their parents were right, study hard, get a good job, marry someone  with a future.  I don't recall the movie depicting anyone who went to  college and really didn't make it afterwards.
0792151712|5.0|I absolutely loved Titanic.  I've seen it many times.  I originally saw it because I've been interested in Titanic related stuff for several years.  I've seen Titanic (1953) and A Night to Remember and this is definitely the  best one.  I would recommend this movie to everyone in the world.  It is  absolutely amazing.  It easily replaced my former favorite movies - The  Silence of the Lambs and Clueless.  Have fun watching it!! =)
0783114222|5.0|As one of the world's biggest space-junkies, I was totally impressed by this series.  It sticks to the facts (and believe me, I have the books and the knowledge to prove it), the special effects are unbelievable, and the  quality of the writing and acting is superb.  Every child in America should  see &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; so that we as a nation do not  give up that natural urge to explore.  See this video...crank up your  surround sound...and dare to dream!
B000002UJQ|1.0|How people can compare this piece of garbage to any pre-1987 Pink Floyd is something I will never understand.
0553573403|5.0|I first began reading fantasy about thirty years ago with Lloyd Alexander's Prydain series, an introduction that would make any reasonable person a lifelong fan of the genre.  In the thousands of books I have read  since then, only a very few enchanted me (pardon the pun) the way The Book  of Three did; Zelazny's first &quot;Amber&quot; series, Saberhagen's  &quot;Empire of the East&quot;, Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series, and  now, cresting above its predecessors, Martin's Song of Fire and Ice.<br />A  Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, collectively, currently reign as the  all time champ in my personal fantasy rankings.  I tried to decide if it is  merely the newness of the series or some other quality(ies) which  distinguish it from all the rest.  I think it's the latter.  I wish I could  think of something more clever to say than &quot;the writing is just so  damn good&quot;, but that about sums it up.<br />These are two of those rare  books that create that annoying, glorious internal struggle of striving  desperately to get to the end of a book while simultaneously dreading the  fact that the book is going to end.<br />I wind up with a new favorite  character almost every chapter, then change my mind back to an old favorite  the moment he or she is revisited.  The story flows, takes clever twists,  and Martin absolutely refuses to have a character behave in the manner we  expect; not because the character is inconsistent, but because the  character is alive and doesn't know how to act like a stereotype.<br />So now  I begin the interminable wait for the final book in the series, and already  that conflict is in my gut.  I can't wait for the book, but I dread its  coming and the end to a wonderful reading experience.
6304057709|5.0|I loved this film.  It was funny and sad and everything a good movie should be.  Its definitely a keeper.  Emma was fantastic and so was the rest of the cast.  Kate was wonderful in it.  If you're a fan of Kate or  Emma or Hugh or just want to see a great movie, this is definitely a great  one to see!!
B0000024UX|5.0|The culmination of an exciting sixties career, this is a massively enjoyable album filled with eclectic hits and striking production. A must for any pop music collector.
B000002C25|3.0|This is an enjoyable album except for one factor which is present throughout the album:  The stupid lyrics!  It would be far more enjoyable is Noel or whoever writes them to actually put some effort into the lyrics.   George Harrison is right in saying that no one will know who Oasis is in  15-20 years.  If Oasis want to leave a legacy like the Beatles, Stones,  Zep, Floyd, etc.  then they got to start releasing albums and songs that  people will think about when they aren't listening to them.       In  January 98 I saw them in Toronto and their shows are just like their songs,  very forgettable.  I think I paid $40 for more than a 1 hour show!
B0000057C5|4.0|I think that this album is great, even though I don't speak a word of German. This album is good because of the simple fact that LYRICS ARE NOT A PART OF MUSIC!!! Their only purpose is to produce a musical quality through  the possitioning of words. Often times, reading the lyrics to a song can  total ruin the entire experience for me. Anyway, the German Lyrics sound  great and the songs here are quite good.
0788811355|1.0|Yeah, everybody loves this movie.  Right.  The Critics love it, but everyone I've talked to seems to hate it.  Gee, I wonder why?  Could it be that the acting is cardboard, the two main characters are repulsive, and  that the story is so slow it makes James A. Mechner's Alaska seem like a  Saturday morning cartoon?  This is one of the most boring movies I have  ever seen.  Fiennes acts like he is constantly constipated, and none of the  main characters other than Juliette Binoche are actually likable.  This  movie is insipid, dull, and overall a huge waste of your time.  Take some  advice from me, and avoid this movie.  You'll thank me later
0385493800|2.0|I got disappointed every time I read John Grisham's new book.  On the book jacket, it even misguide the nature of the book.  &quot;... Returning to the real world is always difficult, but this time it's going to be  murder.&quot;  Unless I misunderstood what the word &quot;murder&quot;  means, I found no murder or even close to murder in this book.  It's a  straight forward story about distributing an estate, and finding the  rightful heir.  There is no suspense, nor is any murder mystry involved.   The scene of Brazil and the life of tribes are only skin deep at the best.   I'm disappointed.
0792839692|4.0|Hey, I liked the movie!  I remember seeing &quot;Logan's Run&quot; when I was a kid and the story moved me so much that last year I invited some friends over for my 30th birthday party and we watched it and had a good  time.  Granted, it wasn't some of Farah Fawcett's best work, but Michael  York and the cast did a great job, the story is good, and it's worth it  just to see Washington DC covered with plants. I'm looking forward to  seeing it on DVD. It's a great piece of Sci-Fi history, and now that I'm on  &quot;the other side&quot; I can say with confidence, &quot;Yes,  Virginia...there IS life after 30!&quot;  Buy &quot;Logan's Run&quot;!
0780622553|5.0|Though this movie is not for everyone, anyone who appreciates a well thought out script that has you guessing until the end will love this movie.It screams genius all the way with amazing set design and a  completely of the wall story.I watched this movie with a girlfriend and was  very surprised at the end to find out she loved it as much as i did! I  actually bought my DVD player just to get a superior copy of the movie. I  guess you can tell I enjoyed it alot. Happy Watching..
B0000024SI|5.0|I'll keep it very brief. This album is perfect. Dylan comes out like an electric Rimbaud and doesn't let up through out the entire album. I'm not aware of anyone who could fuse such brilliant poetry and raw blues based  rock and roll like Dylan. I feel no need to comment on any of the songs  except to say that time will prove Desolation Row to be one of this  century's most prophetic poems along side Eliot's Wasteland and Ginsbergs  Howl. Like Robert Johnson would say &quot;the stuff he's got will bust your  brain's out&quot;
B000002AV5|5.0|This CD is soo great. I can listen to it over and over and never get sick of it. I definitly recomend it.
B000002UB6|4.0|Though most of the CD is filled with the good songs.&quot;Two Of Us.&quot; But on the bad side I'd say &quot;Dig It&quot; would be about the worst with &quot;I dig a Pony&quot; second behing DIG IT. Dig it seems a 50  second mesh of words creating nothing but a meaningless song. But overall  it's a good album and I recommend that you buy it!
B0000025H4|5.0|For those of you who believe that Judas Priest is nothing but the soft-metal &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; and &quot;You've Got Another Thing Coming&quot; then you've got another thing coming!  Pre &quot;British  Steel&quot; Priest is some the hardest and true metal you will ever hear.  &quot;Unleashed&quot; captures some of their greatest songs, such as  &quot;The Ripper&quot;, &quot;Tyrant&quot;, and &quot;Victim of  Changes&quot;.  Get &quot;Unleashed&quot; and then explore their studio  albums, most notably &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;.  To think I had  written these guys off as not heavy enough!  Hell, these guys practically  invented heavy!
B000007NYS|4.0|Often beautiful songs - my only complaint (and it is a minor one, in context) is that stylistically the material is a bit homogeneous.
0792153189|2.0|I found DEEP IMPACT somewhat dissappointing although the special effects are great the acting is not and here's why. I found the whole storylines involving TEA LEONI'S character as well as ELIJAH WOOD'S  soap opera style  and boring although I do think MORGAN FREEMAN and ROBERT DUVALL do a great  job in thier roles it's not enough to compensate for the above metiond.  Anyway in my opinion the special effects are the only thing besides FREEMAN  and DUVALL that save this movie so all in all I can't recommend it.
B000001GQJ|5.0|This CD is not a recital at all, but a re-release of Argerich's 1961 debut studio album with the addition of the Liszt Sonata from 1971. I am a novice critic of classical piano, but I've heard enough to say that this is one of  the best recordings I've ever heard. Her playing is nothing short of  extraordinary - a mixture of intense feeling and virtuoso skill. The  selections, especially the Liszt and Chopin, are all solid works, with not  a filler piece in the lot. And the sound quality is top notch. A desert  island disk.
6305014140|5.0|Definently one of best anime movies I have ever see.  Great action and animation.  I liked the characters and the story very much.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is even remotely intersted in anime  movies.
0767812417|5.0|Loved it , definitely a classic. It's not as gloomy as the first though the story is a gloomy one. This is captivating and entertaining.
6304711905|5.0|The lines of the characters were original and chilling.  Val Kilmer, in one of his best proformances plays the funny, careless drunkard who quickly draws his mouth as well as his gun.  Unmistakenly a great film about the  west with a touch of unforgetable humor and duelry.  I know people who can  recite the whole movie with out the  sound.  Either they are people with a  whole lot of time on their hands or they were truly obsessed  with this  great film. ------Chris Haughey
6305265488|5.0|It is a really nice movie. The actors did a great job. Wonderful
630529142X|5.0|I saw The Waterboy 3 times with my friends!!! We loved it!  I normally don't like this kind of screwball comedy, but Adam Sandler was wonderful.  I can't wain until it comes to DVD on March 16.  It already has a place  reserved in my film collection.
B00000258P|5.0|Animals marks the first chapter in the Pink Floyd Trilogy.<br />1)Animals - attacks the social pressures of the world<br />2)The Wall - attacks the mental pressures from within<br />3)The Final Cut - attacks the political pressures  of a war torn world<br />This very downbeat trilogy also documents the end of  an era for the Floyd. It is in essence Roger's final encore and curtain  call. Animals, is perhaps the most symbolic of the trilogy. Comparing  people to the different animal traits works well, and Waters is perhaps at  his most venemous during sheep. The Wall and Final Cut without a doubt deal  with much of Roger's disgust at war and his father's passing. But Animals  is a beginning of all of this, It shows how to begin to analyze huiman  behavior, and how in the end, we are merely dogs, sheep, or pigs...
0792838769|5.0|At the time that this movie first came out in the theaters, it was the first Bond movie I had ever seen.  I went nuts over it, and I'm still going nuts!  (The only downside to this is that all the other movies with  Connery, Moore, and Dalton seem boring, because nothing really explodes  quite like this one!)  Unless you have a grudge against one of the cast  members, as I do against Leonardo DiCaprio, GO FOR IT!!!
B000002A3T|5.0|It is often difficult to judge what is better than something else. This is extremely true in the case of Pink Floyd's music. Take a listen. Piper sounds nothing like Dark Side,Dark Side sounds nothing like The Wall, and  The Wall sounds nothing like the Division Bell. But these three albums in  my opinion best represent Pink Floyd at what they do best. In the case of  The Division Bell, Gilmour's soaring guitar, Wright's hypnotic keyboards,  and Mason's heart thumping drumming are still second to none. They are  trully the most talented musicians ever. The album constantly makes me cry.  Why? Because it is still amazing that a band that begun it's journey more  than thirty years ago still has new magic and mystique to add to music.  Barrett,Gilmour,Mason,Waters,and Wright along with a select few others  (Lennon,Mercury) will eventually become the Beethoven's and Mozart's of the  twentieth century. Quite simply put there is no one better than Pink Floyd.
078062551X|5.0|This is a keeper for any science fiction fan.  Dark City is a world where the boundaries of reality are blurred from the beginning, and are constantly shifting.  Terrific performances from William Hurt and Keifer  Sutherland.  I recommend this to anyone who loves the  &quot;dark-and-moody&quot; type of sci-fi!
0385493800|1.0|After the first few chapters, I thought this was going to be an excellent book.  The rest of the book completely disabused me of that notion.  There were large sections where nothing at all was happening-- yes, he has an  amazing talent for describing details, but I'm not interested in 50 pages  of it at a time unless it actually has some bearing on the plot.  I agree  completely with the reader that said this could've been written in 100  pages or less.  A disappointment.
0800196341|5.0|This is the film of the millenium and in my humble opinion Kenneth Branagh should me named an actor of the millenium of the highest caliber. In this film he has done precisely what he set out to do and thats bring a  Shakspearian classic to the big screen in an entertaining and delightful  way, those who concern themselves with the length of this film, should  perhaps stick to Wile E. Coyote as their preferred entertainment choice.   Mr. Branagh breaths the life into Hamlet, and his choices for the remainder  of the cast are superb, as are their performances. I intend to watch this  film over and over, as it is a story within a story and one cannot fully  apreciate this epics full scope without several viewings, come on rainy  days!! WONDERFUL!
6305252521|2.0|I saw this at the show (in the theatre for you outside the midwest) and loved it - I usually dislike Jim C but here he shines cause he *under* plays his role (hard to believe huh). HOWEVER, it's been said before here -  I just wanted to add my vote: except for 2 trailers there is NO additional  material - this obviously was *rushed* to DVD (I'm afraid we'll be dealing  with this from now on). Also the &quot;widescreen&quot; isn't 1.85:1 - it's  just narrow black bars at the edges of the screen, and there are some  obvious cut-offs (half-faces, etc). If you &quot;must&quot; own this get a  pre-viewed VHS and save some $$$.
6303184499|5.0|I thought the film was excellent and that more movies of such quality should be made every day ... Sharon Stone was superbly elegant in this thrilling and extremely sexy movie.
0792151712|4.0|Let me start by saying that I love this film.  I saw it at the theater 6 times.  Even so, it falls short.  The gratuitous cursing and nudity did absolutely nothing to enhance the film.  Leo's 1990's dialogue doesn't  sound so good in 1912 (&quot;You're a spoiled little brat, even!&quot;)  Having said that, the real star of the movie, the ship, is incredible!  My  mouth was agape for the nearly hour long sinking.  The effects were more  than spectacular.  They were astonishing.  The heroic string quartet and  the ones who stayed behind to certain doom received short shrift.  Still a  fine film
6304765789|5.0|I instantly loved this movie.  I must have recommended it to a hundred people.  Douglas is masterful in his portrayal of selfishness and self-pity.
0385493800|1.0|I was hoping that his last book, The Street Lawyer was an aboration.  Unfortunately, it wasn't!  Mr. Grisham wrote so many suspenseful and interesting books, I expected more of the same.  I was very disapointed  with this book and his previous book.  There was no courtroom drama. There  was no suspense.  I could not connect with any of the characters as I could  with The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The pelican Brief, etc.  My Grisham  shouldn't write a &quot;book-a-year&quot;.
6303921248|5.0|Pride and Prejudice, the film, was a perfect rendition of Jane Austen's masterpiece novel.  I don't believe any two hour film would do it justice. The six part series brought endless entertainment that was filled with  romance and humor.
B00000HZFP|5.0|I also bought the CD the day it came out and it has not left my car's CD player.  Great songs, lyrics, performances.  If alternative radio is cool, they will start playing this CD in heavy rotation.  A MUST HAVE!!!!
0788811355|5.0|El Paciente Ingles es una verdadera joya cinematografica. Los actuaciones son magistrales (quien no aprecia a Ralph Fiennes, Kristen Scott-Thomas y Juliette Binoche en las que son a mi juicio las mejores actuaciones de  estos artistas)  La adaptacion realizada por el mismo director ha sido muy  fiel al libro que tambien es excelente. Hay que poseer una minima  sensibilidad para darse cuenta que esta es la historia que descubre y  expone los sentimientos mas profundos del ser humano. Es una obra maestra  que recomiendo a todos.
6303109950|5.0|First there was the Magnificent Seven. Then the Clint Eastwood westerns were the rave of western fans.  But this movie is by far the best western I have viewed in the past five decades.  Hats off to Val Kilmer, Doc was  great.
0767811038|4.0|Starship troopers has got to be on of the most engrossing movies that I have ever seen. Paul Verhoeven, one of my favorite foreign-filmmakers-comes-to-America directors, sure does know how to  unleash a magnificent sense of style. For history buffs, the style of the  movie is very much like the propaganda ads of WWII and in general past  society's views on warfare. The acting was wonderfully tongue-in-cheek and  1950ish, and the whole cast (with the execption of Doogie Houser) give a  stellar performance. I would not like to live in that kind of neo-fascist  society, but it is fun to imagine taking part in it and being exposed to a  satirical, comical version of their patriotism and self-righteousness. The  people here who have been giving this film negative reviews are obviously  taking the film way too seriously. It's not supposed to be taken seriously,  it is merely showing us a kind of patriotic society that reflects many  other creations of human culture. I think the society in Starship Troopers  is fascinating and, considering that it is not real, even fun to root for.  I have read the book and I am proud to say that Heinlien would have been  proud. The government in that film was misleading the people with lies and  misinformation (like saying that the bugs were sending meteors from over  half the galaxy as an excuse to wipe out the indigenious race). There were  really no good guys in that movie, but you end up rooting for the main  characters because they provide a wonderfully distorted example of victims  of an opressive government with a silver lining. The viewers can somehow  relate to them. For those of you who didn't read the book, the Klendathu  were as bad as the humans. They tortured them and studied them, and they  even had lasers attached to their bodies. The space sequences were nothing  short of inspiring and wonderful. I am a major war movie buff and war gamer  and at times a patriot, and I enjoyed this movie. Paul Verhoeven knows what  he is doing as a filmmaker (except for Showgirls) and deserves good  reviews. He studied every single WWII movie before filming this one.
0783226160|5.0|A comedy spoof of a 60's college,Animal House is a typical comedy involving Corse language, nudity, and funny coments! I would put this on your watch your movie list
0446310786|5.0|This book is awesome! You get to personally know the characters in it, and it imparts so much truth in the story through the eyes of children (which makes hard topics such as prejudice easier to &quot;digest&quot;) It shows  how prejudice can destroy families, and how friendship can save them.
6303618065|5.0|I watched over ten times with my girl friend and now my wife. We both love it very very much. Why can't we own it on DVD? So our son can have a chance to watch this top quality movie.
6305268177|3.0|This live-concert DVD covers the career span of Bee Gees, from their early hits (Massachusetts, I Started a Joke) to the disco hits (Staying Alive, You Should Be Dancing), to the more recent efforts (One, Still Waters).   The interesting selections include songs made popular by other artists,  such as Our Love (Don't Throw It All Away) by late brother Andy Gibb,  Guilty, Heartbreaker, Island in the Stream, etc.  The only disappointment I  have toward the program is the fact that Barry Gibbs' falsetto has clearly  aged and lost its piercing quality.  You can really see him strain to hit  some of the notes.  However, balanced that with the tribute to Andy, and  the shots of Olivia Newton-John and her daughter during the song  &quot;Grease,&quot; this DVD is still worth having for those of us who grew  up with &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and the Bee Gees music.  It brings  back happy memory.
0780624890|3.0|After two discs that would pixelate (is that a word?) from about 1:18 to 1:30, I finally got a third one and was able to watch the rest of the movie.<br />Very gory, good effects, nice integration of technology and  mythology.<br />One and a quarter thumbs up.

0792107683|5.0|Shane is one of my favorite movies of all time,A battle between two groups of people and just one person to stand in the gap. A classic story for great western.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Siamese Dream is beyond spectacular.  The Pumpkins are my favorite band and have been since they first came out.  This album expresses just about every mood you could possibly feel.  And whatever it lacks Mellon Collie  and the Infinite Sadness will fill in for you.
078322706X|5.0|Why do I say this?  Brest's remake of the 1934 &quot;Death takes a Holiday&quot; was quite a cute little film.  Aside from the fact that Pitt was sorely criticized by fans and critics for just being  &quot;cute&quot;--by way of sucking on a spoon of peanut butter for about  ten minutes--this film was rather good.  I thoroughly enjoyed Pitt and  Hopkins, and the movie's soundtrack (superbly done by Thomas Newman [Horse  Whisperer]).  Brest did an awesome job with his vision.  I have to wonder,  however, if anyone really saw the film for what it was worth--for what it  stood for.  I'm sick of people going to see Pitt for his good looks and not  for his acting.  He is a wonderful actor who works hard at his JOB!  And,  as usual, Pitt takes a sticky and potentially vapid situation and turns it  into triumph.  Congratulations, Brad.
0399143904|1.0|I have read all of Clancy's novels.  I even buy them in Hardback because I can't wait to emerse myself in his world Jack Ryan etc.  This anticipation magnified my dissappointment with Rainbow 6.  This is a formula book with  way too much formula.  I found reading this book like jogging, you have to  push yourself not to give up.
0800135954|5.0|Ever since the dawning of &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;, it has never amazed me just how much of Tristan Ludlow was inside Brad Pitt and vica versa.  Watching &quot;Legends&quot; was like seeing two sides of a two  headed coin.  Brilliantly acted by everyone(Pitt, Hopkins, Quinn, Ormond,  and Thomas), awesome direction by Edward Zwick (Glory), and unbelieveable  cinematography.  &quot;Legends&quot; made America take note of Pitt's  screen presence and his talents.  Never once did Pitt steal a scene from  his fellow actors--he stood out on his own.  I was very impressed with his  style and grace.  He was Tristan and Tristan was Brad.  Brad can only get  better.
0767803434|3.0|If you are looking for a DVD movie with great sound, then this is one of them.  If you are looking for a great movie as well as great sound, get  something else.  Harrison Ford is my favorite actor and I looked forward  with great anticipation to seeing it for the first time.  But WOW, was I  disappointed.  I tried to use my imagination during this ridiculous movie,  but I was too busy constantly saying &quot;Awww, come on...&quot;, &quot;No  way...&quot;, or &quot;Gimmie a break!&quot;  Harrison Ford was pretty  good, but Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell give miserable performances.  I  even gave it a fair, second chance and was equally disgusted as the first  time.  This may be one of the most unrealistic blockbuster movies of all  time.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the sound, otherwise  I give it 2 stars.
B000002BFZ|5.0|I often hear people say that No Code is one of Pearl Jam's &quot;weakest&quot; albums. Although it doesn't have the slamming rhythm of &quot;Animal&quot; or some of the tracks off of Vitalogy, it offers a  variety of great tracks.<br />&quot;Hail, Hail&quot; and &quot;Habit&quot;  for instance, measures up with any of Pearl Jam's harder songs. And  although &quot;Lukin&quot; is terribly short, the same can be said for it.  However, the typical Pearl Jam rhythm is softened to offer a entertaining  change of pace and an often inspiring message. Tracks like &quot;In my  Tree&quot; and &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; retain their catchy lyrics and  melody, while offering a softer feel, in case you've been headbanging too  much. And if you want to hear an atypical Pearl Jam song, listen to  &quot;Mankind.&quot; Written by Stone Gossard, it sounds almost reminiscent  of pop music.<br />It took me a good year to get hooked on No Code, but once  I listened to it enough it really grew on me. Now I think No Code is  perhaps one of Pearl Jam's best albums. I'm very upset that none of the  songs on this album form Pearl Jam's radio staple. If you are looking for  an alternative to the often hard-hitting PJ stuff, you can find a great  blend of music in No Code.

6304119046|1.0|This movie has the pacing of an elephant walking through quicksand. Orsen Welles is an okay actor, but he's no Frank Stallone.
0792839846|2.0|I thought the movie was going to be a lot better than it was. They could habve done so much more with the movie other than making it a boring, totally wrong love movie.
0670880728|5.0|I pride myself with being a rational, well educated, fairly successful woman in a great long-term relationship, but I just can't deny that deep down inside of me lives a starved and suppressed Bridget Jones who loved  this book more than almost anything I've ever read. Sure - it's a gross  exaggeration of all the stereotype female irrationalities that ever  existed, but I think most women can identify Bridget with all the things  that they are constantly fighting so hard not to be, but can't help being  at times. Loving or hating Bridget Jones is only a matter of if you are  able to laugh at these dismal facts and find comfort in that at least you  are not alone, or get into a state of complete denial and frustration over  that everyone else loves this book!!!
6304119046|5.0|to make a movie truly great without all the action or slapstick comedy, it has to make you think. Citizen Kane has it all mystery, tragedy, and the the saddening love trials of the richest man in the world. The end of the  movie puts the whole thing together with a perfect message. Anyone who  doesn't get this movie, or doesn't like it either is too stupid to  understand it or, doesn't have any taste in movies and only likes watching  action movies or comedies without any plot. this movie makes you think and  feel you've got to be able to use your brain like a real person instead of  acting like a stupid hick and not giving the movie a chance. My 10 year-old  brother understood the movie, and it shocks me that a lot of adults don't.
6304509154|5.0|This is probly the best horror movie in the history of the universe. I first found out about this movie when it cames on televison once. I was scared to death, probly because I was about 7. But now I watch it all the  time!!!!
0783801602|1.0|This is a novel that may be worth more in the second edition -- after Clancy and the publishers hire an editor.  References to a &quot;Kansas tornado&quot; twice in 20 pages; using the idiom &quot;faster than zipping  your fly&quot; more than three times; referring to a character as both  &quot;Tim&quot; and &quot;Tom&quot; in the same paragraph.  Not to mention  all of the completely ridiculous military and medical errors in fact.  I  actually started hiliting errors until my pen ran out of ink.  You'd think  an 800-page book would have rich character development and meticulous  detail.  All it had was glib references and redundancies.  Tom, I know you  needed this one done in a hurry, but you owe me $30.  I would, however,  like to thank you for giving me strong forearms and biceps.  That's about  all I got from what was far and away your worst book ever.  I hope you're  as embarrassed about writing it as I am about reading it cover to cover.   One bad one in ten isn't a bad average. If you're planning on making it up  on your next one, that's great.  If not, then please, don't bother sullying  your once-impeccable reputation.

B0000019PA|4.0|A bit more tame than their debut album. This record takes you on a trek of sublime sound. The sound at first can be a little distant but after a few spins becomes quite addictive. On no other album have I heard a focalist  rip his heart out and put it on the table leaving you asking &quot;Who in  the hell broke this guys heart?&quot; Nothing but gold for this album.  Perfect for anyone with a twisted sence of romance.
0609603086|5.0|This book kept me engrossed in it for a while. It was an exciting and thrilling book. I almost counldn't put the book down!!!
0887309372|5.0|If you want to keep it simple, then this is definitely suggested reading.  Branding is probably one of the most nebulus and subjective artifacts of modern marketing.  Whether you are a Fortune 1000 VP managing an existing  brand or a new graduate, the simple concepts and analogies in this book  will help take some mystery out of branding and help every marketer do a  more effective job.  Even Nike could learn some new ideas, I read today  that they are planning to increase ad spending by 46% in 2000, wonder  why...?
0451191153|5.0|I write here a review of The Fountainhead and also refer to the review I am writing online of Atlas Shrugged. It is no secret that Ayn Rand intended to challenge Judeo-Christian ethics by her writings and philosophy. Most of  her followers have interpreted this to mean than she was anti-religious.  but this is not so. Her books are actually intensely religious but not at  all Judeo-Christian in emphasis or perspective.    In the Biblical Garden  of Eden story, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was in fact not a  Tree of information or of any useful knowledge but rather of Judgment, and  as such could only work for its rightful Owner who also created and owned  the Garden. Judeo-Christianity emphasizes only that Adam and Eve disobeyed  and therefore sinned. In fact they violated a Divine Property Right. The  Fountainhead emphasizes this.    In The Fountainhead, Roark can be  juxtaposed as having the same Divine Right in regard to his own  intellectual property and work. with Toohey as the Serpent who instigated  the violation, etc.    In the end, we have Ayn Rand elevating all mankind,  with the exception of Toohey et al, completely out of the confines of the  &quot;sin&quot; which Judeo-Christianity still levies upon the descendants  of Adam and Eve, through a thoughtful and philosophic appreciation of  property rights rather than through some mystifying emphasis on mere  obedience.    This is a book which should be read before one reads Atlas  Shrugged, which takes this philosophic approach to religion even further.     The reader should also notice that, in both of these books, Ayn Rand  refers to the Garden of Eden &quot;Tree of Knowledge&quot; incorrectly ...  as if it is in fact a tree of information ... and therefore herself always  defended &quot;disobedience&quot; by advocating that it was always intended  to be eaten. This was not a ploy on her part. Despite all of her intense  philosophic precision inclusive of religious study, Ayn Rand misread the  clear meaning of the forbidden Tree ... thus proving she never ate of  &quot;it&quot; herself!    So, rather than waste time reading hearsay  regarding her alleged &quot;instability&quot; or wondering why a woman who  would not keep a dime she did not earn and who would therefore have had to  invent an empathy test-tube &quot;affair&quot; and take transcription notes  to be of real help to the myriad of broken hearted divorcees who flocked to  the Branden Institute for paid counselling, we can all instead think of Ayn  Rand as a provable Immaculate Evolution ... and completely above the  suspicions currently being implied.   There is even a Biblical analogy  appropriate for this brilliant and honorable writer which i will refer to  more precisely in my review of Atlas Shrugged.
0394533054|5.0|Awesome!  This book will make you reevaluate everything you have ever held as true.  Your assumptions will either be reassumed or they will disintegrate before you and the text.  Camus goes deep into the heart of  things and takes a serious look at what is occuring.  He shows you things  you have never seen.  The best part is that they have been there the whole  time.
0385493800|3.0|It holds your attention! The first 100 pages are better than the rest of the book. The adventure in Brazil is too much!

B000006OAM|3.0|I have to admit that I am dissapointed in this CD. I was expecting more from Miss. Merchant than just three Merchant-like songs (Life is Sweet, Kind and Generous, and Break Your Heart).  Oh well.  I guess that's what  you get for buying a CD in a cardboard sleeve with cheesy pictures of  Merchant in different costumes.  That entertained me more than her songs.  If you don't have &quot;Tigerlily&quot;, buy that instead of  &quot;Ophelia.&quot;  Her first album was solid.  I won't give up on her  though, I figure its just the sophomore jinx, where every musician these  days seems to find themselves in India and flood their songs with chamber  music.  Such a sad condition we live in to write drowsy songs about  society's ills.  Yet people like me listen to it!  Oh, the humanity!
0553212478|5.0|When I was first assigned this book for my senior literary criticism I nearly cried, but complied anyways.  I liked few books from the era especially horror types, and didn't look forward to 6 weeks worth of  analyzing and research.  My views were quickly changed.  Perhaps it was  because I was analyzing it so closely, but I found the book to be  fascinating.  Everything had a meaning to it, and it was easy to become  attached to Dr. Frankenstein's creature.  The various settings in the story  each worked perfectly to draw me in and help me feel all that was  happening.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially a senior  trying to write his literary criticsm.
B000005YZM|3.0|This is a good album, but all the revisionist hype surrounding it greatly amplifies its virtues.  Only about half the songs on the album are really wonderful.  Only about a quarter of the songs stand up to Beach Boys or  Beatles quality.  One song, &quot;Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)&quot;  is downright awful!  This album is really not that thematically cohesive -  at least not as cohesive as some critics seem to think.  But this is,  on-the-whole, still worth owning for any fan of mid-to-late sixties pop.   So, go ahead and buy it, but just don't be expecting a &quot;Pet  Sounds&quot; or a &quot;Revolver&quot;.

B0000028RR|1.0|I would rather listen to fingernails on a black board! This is less than 1 star
0792838769|4.0|Tommorow Never Dies is a good action filled movie. I'm a Bond fanatic and think that Bond was acted better in Goldeneye. I think the action element in Tommorow Never Dies is much better though with better weapons and plot  line. The song piece was interesting but not with the best lyrics I've  heard in Bond movies like Goldeneye or Moonraker. Its full of explosions  and gunfire though and got a little annoying near the end.
0688052304|5.0|i didn't know that this was biography until i finished it; thought it was one of the best novels i'd ever read. chasing a ghost and talks on philosophy are juxtaposed. the ghost story is especially fascinating. what  a shock to realize it had really happened! have not bothered to go over his  beliefs with a fine tooth critical comb but that's ok with me. i enjoyed  his insights and found it riveting to watch him trace his thinking back to  its origins. i have reread this book over the years and it is still a  favorite of mine.
B000002VMD|5.0|Whitney Houston is one of my favorite singers because she has a great voice and great songs. I think the person from Boston, MA, is wrong. I think that that person is wrong because this album deserved to be album of  the year. &quot;I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU&quot; and &quot;I HAVE NOTHING&quot;  were especially great songs, along with most of the others. Buy this CD!  You won't be disappointed!
630414542X|5.0|This fantastic movie is visual tour de force (sorry to be trite)!  Everything about it pulsates.  It is one of my favorite movies.  For film students and directors, take note of the fantastic transitions that help  make this movie what it is.  If you were disapointd with the original  Highlander, don't be put off.  The director's cut here clearifies  everything that is essential, and even adds some.  Essential plot, humorous  scenes, and touching character development cut from the original has been  faithfully put back in to make this movie a legend!
0780622650|3.0|The best thing about DVDs is that if the publisher chooses to use it they can add all sorts of extra features rather than stamp out a movie on a disc.  This DVD offers a lot of info on the classic series, including plots  for every single episode.  I hated the movie, but I bought the DVD for the  extra features.
0380789019|5.0|I have never before been compelled to write a review of anything but this book was just so amazing it blows my mind!  Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are the coolest villain duo ever, and are impossible to top.  The marquis de  Carabas I have grown to love also and I didn't want this story to end just  so I could read more about his character.  Him and Door and Hunter and  Richard and... THEY'RE ALL SO COOL!  I absolutely can't wait until the  movie version (being worked on by Jim Henson Productions) comes out.  What  else can I say except...YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!
0590373587|5.0|I thought the Giver was a wonderful book but almost disturbing at parts. It makes you think before changing things and really makes you think about how lucky we are to have choices in our society. i read this for a college  adolescent literature course and suggest it to anyone. You can take this  story so many different ways.
0385493800|5.0|I love you John Grisham.<br />You showed us the sewage of life and the nectar of life in this book. <br />The putrid and the pure.<br />I don't need War and Peace from you, John.<br />There is a depth of understanding that always  shines through with your work.  Some miss it because they dwell on looking  for the obvious.<br />Thank God you stopped being a lawyer.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a poignant story about life. I have recommended the book to my mother and many friends. It is for anyone who has questioned or struggled with the meaning of life. I personally am going to go back and  re-read the book to seek out the deeper meanings.
B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leppard was king of rock during the 1980's!!! I wish they wouldn't have changed their style. Hysteria, Adrenalize, and Pyromania were great albums.
6304595247|4.0|This video is absoultely hilarious!  If you like Victoria Holt style romance, you will find it very amusing.  The film is one of those &quot;so bad it's good&quot;.  On arthouse drama level I give it one star but for  the laughs I give it four.  I found the spectacle of Ralph Fiennes  staggering around with glassy eyes a very enjoyable one, and the number of  anonymous wolves howling in the background was all very fun.  The death  rate was somewhat high, however, and the ghosts very ludicrous.  Just don't  expect it to do credit to the book.
B00000DBXL|5.0|i love cake!  this cd is definitely a little slower paced, but still that great cake style. just saw them at celebrity theatre, phx, az. great show and great band. make them your favorite!
B000003S2O|5.0|Having listened to Eno for many years, I can say that this is perhaps my favourite album. Its desert and island implications are truly fascinating. This is a &quot;mental&quot; album in that, for me, it inspires thought and  creativity.
0440214041|4.0|I've watched the movie before reading the book so I might have missed some of the surprise-effect of the book. I just wanted to drop a line mentioning that I really liked this book but I think that John Grisham could add a  little more consistency to its story (it is incredible how things turn out  with no clear explanation). That is why I gave it 4 stars.
B000006BSS|5.0|Excellent performances by both Brando and Karl Maulden combined with a very interesting story make this a must-see for all Brando fans.
0671015206|5.0|Great message. Good book.<br />My philosophy isn't about becoming a millionaire though. It's about not getting myself into debt and piling on unnessesary bills. <br />I try to stay away from financing. Even though lately  they have lots of deals where you can &quot;buy now pay later&quot;. Sound  familiar? Or those irritating informercials targeting folks who have bad  credit? Only to add to our problems by adding another enormous bill to the  stack.<br />Buy generic brands that are still good quality. The ingredients  are the same. Check it out! <br />Save your money for the things you want  wheather it's living below or above your means. Treat yourself and Invest  your money to have it work for you. Good luck.
0784011605|5.0|This movie is a fantastic piece of work. The cast is excellent. Keitel is great as usual, as is Holly Hunter, who despite not speaking throughout much of the movie, turns in an outstanding performance. The young girl is  truly great as an actress, and Sam Neill has found the weaknesses and grace  of a complex &quot;villain&quot;. (Perhaps &quot;villain&quot; is too harsh  a word.)    The movie earned every bit of acclaim it has received, and then  some. Very unique and touching. I can find nothing bad about the  film...it's all good!
006025520X|5.0|our 3 year old son loves this book so muc that we have borrowed it from the library indefinitely... or at least when we locate our own copy.  This is a book that he can sit down and open up and enjoy on his own.
B00000ADG2|5.0|To those of you who criticize this CD because it falls short of what hip-hop should be.... I hate to break this to you, but Lauryn did not record a hip-hop album... she recorded and R&amp;B album and there IS a  difference.  <br />Just because she raps on a few songs does not mean she is  trying to make a rap/hip-hop record.  And though her rapping style may  sound like Lil'Kim, just remember that Lauryn was rapping with the Fugees  long before Kim hit the scene with her debut.  <br />Lauryn has constructed  amazing songs.  Yes, she uses samples... the proper way!!!! There IS a  difference between how Lauryn samples past music and how Puffy and Mase  regurgitate almost whole songs with a few rap versus inbetween the original  chorus. <br />People need to stop thinking that someone is lacking in artistic  merit just because the critics praise thier work.  Believe me, if A Tribe  Called Quest or Outkast or Mary J. Blige got nominated for ten grammys,  they would get the same backlash that Lauryn is getting.  <br />The title song  evokes emotion, beauty, pride, humiliation and pure soul that I have not  heard since Stevie Wonder's &quot;Never Dreamed You'd leave in  Summer.&quot; <br />A stunning, stunning piece of music.
6302136105|2.0|I saw THE DOORS after I had read LIGHT MY FIRE by RAY MANZAREK and I could see why he hated it.The movie THE DOORS focused in my opinion way too much on JIM MORRISON'S self-destructive tendancies not on how the group made  thier fantastic music. Don't get me wrong VAL KILMER while he's potraying  morrison does the best he can with the inept script his performance besides  the music is the only thing that saves this film from being a total  disaster and don't get me started on MEG RYAN I thought she definatley was  a lame PAM COURISON to say the least. I felt that OLIVER STONE did'nt  really research THE DOORS either and it shows so all in all read LIGHT MY  FIRE by RAY MANZAREK for the real story not this movie.
0385493800|3.0|I have always eagerly anticipated Grisham's books and have ordered them before they are published. I will still read Grisham but he's now been demoted to paperback edition. I won't spend my money on his hardcovers  anymore. No suspense, the journey to Brazil was not believable, and Troy's  suicide was unexplained.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I wrote a review further down this page several months ago.<br />At the time, I had recorded the CD on both sides of a tape, so that I could just auto-reverse it on my car stereo when I got to the end, and listen to it  all over again. It was a bit intense.<br />Since then, I've mellowed with it a  bit, but I listened to it again last night, and I can't stop thinking about  it.<br />Some people seem to hate it. But even if you don't like it, you can't  call it 'garbage'. It's like saying DaVinci should have used a better brush  for The Mona Lisa (or: it's like saying you should have mixed it in  'Dobly', or used better conditioner for your hair). Even if you don't like  the tunes, you've got to appreciate that these boys are onto something. I  mean, *really* onto something.<br />As a comparison, I also listened to  Sergeant Peppers, which people seem to think is similar in some way. And,  although the music itself is totally different, there is a definite  similarity in the way you just 'know' that they're both seminal works.  There's an elusive touch of genius inlayed into each one, which we  instinctively understand because it's in the language of popular cultural  music. You don't have to study fine art or classical structure to glimpse  what's going on.<br />That's about it. I was completely gob-smacked, now I'm  totally blown away. I hope this feeling doesn't stop.
B00000099Y|5.0|It's my opinion that this band has transcended any musical genre's labelling. Multifacted music only best appreciated by a listener with the IQ to handle it. Powerful, earthshaking music to be played LOUD. One of the  most talented groups to come down the road. Don't pass up the opportunity  to see these guys live.
0783211856|5.0|Possibly the greatest film I've ever seen. The use of b&amp;w was a no-brainer, in my opinion. In color, the film would simply have been about violence. What amazed me was the use (or the lack thereof) of music.  Several times during the film I jumped in surprise, because there was no  music to telegraph when the &quot;bad stuff&quot; was about to happen.  Brilliant! When the Jews were about to be invaded, there was no music to  warn them in advance. Made the film that much more real. I actually felt  sorry, at one point, for the character played by Ralph Fiennes, and his  conflict over his growing feelings for the young Jewish girl in his home.  Though the film was honored with numerous Oscar nominations, where was Ben  Kingsley? Moving as the Jewish accountant, I thought he stole every scene  in which he played, and often without saying a word. The scene of the  Schindlers' escape, particularly the gold ring, had me in tears, and the  final scene in the Jewish graveyard reduced me to a blithering, sobbing  idiot. I even cried when Spielberg won the Oscar! An absolute must-see for  anyone who believes that any history that man ignores, he is destined to  repeat. You will say, &quot;Never again!&quot;

It would be unwise of you not to buy this movie!For only the cool people have this movie. This is the greatest movie  ever!!!!!!! I cannot stress enough that this is the greatest movie in the  world and it's even greater than the majestic moose and that's pretty cool.  So waste no time and BUY THIS MOVIE! If you do not but this movie you will  be haunted for the rest of your miserable pathetic and worthless life.  Mwahahahahahahahahaha! Oh and Final Fantasy VII (that's seven) is the  greatest game in the world that I have played so buy that too or bad stuff  will happen.
B00000FCBC|3.0|It strikes me as odd that there are two versions of this disc, a clean version and an explicit version.  Why the hell is there a clean version?  What, does Metallica want to expand their fan base that badly?  That really  bites; not the CD itself, just the fact that there's a clean version.   Please tell me this is a mistake.
0553108034|5.0|I'll admit I picked up Game of Thrones basically because it had a quote from Robert Jordan on the cover, and I was desperate for a book to read. Good luck, I'd say. Martin's successfully created a fantasy world that at  once seems as real as our own history and at the same time embraces the  utterly fantastic. What he started with Game of Thrones has only improved  with Clash of Kings. For an erstwhile fantasy novel, there's very little in  the way of sorcery and fairies...which is not to say those aspects are not  there. Clash of Kings features a significant increase in the role of the  fantastic from Game of Thrones, but continues to let his enthralling  characters and amazing ability to tell a story of politics within the scope  of what almost feels like historical fiction. To me, most fantasy novels  have an almost dreary lack of originality. Even such modern masterpieces as  Guy Gavriel Kay's Fionavar Tapestry, Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and  Thorn, and Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time are positively drenched in Tolkein  and Arthurian archetypes. Martin has written a brilliant novel of conflict,  human flaws, and strength, using the traditions of the fantasy genre, not  to supply him with the basis for all his characters and his plot, but as a  supporting aspect of a far grander theme. Bravo.

If you own this on vinyl, you are really cool. I don't (I have the CD) but I do  have a Burl Ives album on vinyl and also Richard &quot;Dimples&quot;  Fields, the Love Messenger. Just buy it!
B000003S5H|5.0|What can I say about this album? It's superb. It's more than just an album, it's a mood. Subtle, evocative, fresh, mellow, and all around smooth. I have had this CD for over six months now and it still maintains  MVP status in my CD carousel. It's difficult to find words to effectively  express my appreciation for this CD. A perfect accompaniement to any aspect  of one's day, particularly for driving, or quiet contemplative time at  home. Perhaps one of the best CD's I've bought, EVER.
B000001EAQ|4.0|Once again U2 try to explore different avenues while maintaining their uniqueness.  A few of the songs on this album seem to be rooted in earlier  albums (please, do you feel loved). while others are an exploration of  modern music (mofo).  PoP is a very solid recording which went to #1 in 29  countries (excluding the US).  The songs on pop seemed to get better the  longer U2 played them on tour.  Perhaps if U2 hadn't rushed to finish the  album ( it was overdue &amp; they already committed to an opening tour  date) some of the other songs may have had a little more polish.  However,  POP is a  very fine album that just never received adequate radio support  in the states.

0694006300|5.0|Laura Joffe Numeroff is an excellent children's author!  My daughter and I have read this book so many times, she can recite word for word throughout the story.  The cassette tape that comes along with the story book is  excellent, because after the story is read, there is a fill-in-the-blanks  game.  Your child fills in the blank.  (example - &quot;If you give a mouse  a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of _____.)  The answer is milk.   And this continues throughout the story.  I highly recommend this book.    No child's library should be without it!
157492589X|5.0|Lonesome Dove has a great story line.  One that keeps you involved with the characters at all times.  I especially appreciated the depth of friendship that was portrayed in the movie.  Robert Duvall was excellent!!
6302732875|5.0|Get ths for no other reason than to see Alec Baldwin's portrayal of the biggest sales shark in Movie History pitching his sales team on their incentive plan. First prize... a cadillac. Second prize... you're fired.  Hysterical.
0788811355|5.0|Most of my friends told me they hate this movie - they find it too slow moving and they (especially the guys) labeled it as just another soppy love story. However, I do not share their views. I find &quot;The English  Patient&quot; one of the best movies ever produced. It is more than a love  story. The movie is set in the backdrop of World War II in Cairo. The main  characters are each of them unique in their own ways and purpose, and you  will find yourself emphatising with all of them. Ralph Fiennes' character,  Count Almasy, is the model of a true gentleman and hero. His only  mistake(?) was to fall in love with a married woman, Katherine (played by  Kristin Scott Thomas). But their romance is doomed right from the start.  Then there is the outspoken and passionate Canadian nurse played by  Juliette Binoche who nurses Almasy after his plane crashes and he was badly  burnt. He has lost his memory but it was soon recovered thanks to his diary  and his past is shown to us in flashbacks. To me, apart from Almasy, the  other character that I find truly special is Caravaggio portrayed  brilliantly by Willem Dafoe. Too bad his character wasn't given sufficient  opportunity to develop. This movie much deserved the Best Picture Oscar it  won. The movie is an epic and over 3 hours long. But I advise that you  watch the movie with some patience and an open mind as you'll find yourself  completely immersed in the storyline in no time at all. If this movie had  to compete for Oscar's Best Picture Award with &quot;Titanic&quot; or  &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (both Best Picture Oscar winner/touted to  be winner this year), I would say &quot;The English Patient&quot; is a much  better movie and would win hands-down!

B00000DF6O|4.0|B.B. is the king of the blues; ain't nobody gonna question that.  And this CD is B.B. at the top of his form, with a very tight band.<br />Maybe, just maybe, this is a bit too much of the king for most listeners.  With very  little stylistic variation and a long running time, the CD blurs into what  sometimes feels like one big familiar song.  Is that a bad thing?  You  decide.
B000001OAA|5.0|This CD was amazing, with music and lyrics good enough to rate up with the Smashing Pumpkins, Hole, and Radiohead. Every song is worth listening to over and over. The Japanese edition includes &quot;Subhuman&quot; and  &quot;#1 Crush&quot; which just makes it all that much better.
0385484518|5.0|This book made me look at life in a different manner.  Instead of looking at it as a stuggle, I learned to look at it as an adventure. I became attached to Morrie and to the other characters in the book, and cried when  it was through.   I am charging my entire family to read the book.  I hope  it has the same meaning for them as it did for me.
0140277447|4.0|Great book for someone who knows little about The Rape of Nanking. I loved the structure of the book  providing a view from the; soldiers commiting the crimes, westerners in nanking at that time, victims, and the author. It  raises many questions with me about human ignorance and how mass stupidity  sometimes equals intelligence.
0312857063|5.0|This book is just as good of the first, Wizard's First Rule.  There was a great plot and many unexpected events.  I like the way where prophesies could be interpreted into different ways.  The book seemed to totally  fascinate me with its several suspenseful events.
6300246876|5.0|This movie was a critical and financial flop when it was originally released, but I loved it then and loved it now. It tries to resolve the problem of making a drama out of something when everyone knows what the  result will be--And does as well as could be expected--I find myself still  rooting for the officer trying to alert his superiors to the possibility of  an attack. The real star is the amazing model work--It's incredible to  realize that these special effects are done without computers! If you've  read this far, I predict you will enjoy the movie.

B000003BDJ|5.0|This is a great compilation. Or rather, it's a great collection of songs. Essentially, it is indeed the best of the first 8 years of the Stones. However, the sound is extremely thin, and I would have to wonder if it  could have been done better. Also, both CDs could easily be compressed into  one: there is only slightly less than 40 minutes of music on each CD.  However, the quality of the songs makes up for (and then some) these  lapses. A must have.
6300151379|5.0|My first contact with this movie was at a jim henson convention when I was ten years old, and I got to touch the puppets used in the movie! (Incidentally, I first met my bride there too! Labyrinth brought us  together!) Since, I have fallen in love with the film, and like everyone, I  think that it's a crime that it is unavailable. Oh, if only. Anyway,  Excellent. Stylish and original, charming and captivating, reminds one that  we are children at heart. Campaign!
0425107469|5.0|This is my favorite book. I am a confessed animal lover but the depth of the story is what caught me.  I read this book in ONE DAY!!  I then turned it over to a friend and I still haven't gotten it back. She wants her Mom  to read it because she wants to cure her of being a BOOK HATER!  It  deserves TWENTY STARS!!!  Perfect for long trips or a boring stay at a  inlaws house.  Eintein and the Outsider will keep you company.  I would  talk more about the story but I'd hate to give up even one ounce of  surprise!  Enjoy...
630469797X|5.0|Great film,full of all the gory bits originally cut (yeh like they look really real!).<br />My only gripe is that you have to turn the disk over half way through yet the film is only 2 hours long why?
0609603086|1.0|It appears as though Mr. Follett has a book contract he must fulfill.  &quot;Hammer of Eden&quot; as well as the &quot;Third Twin&quot; are quite evident of the fact we are writing only to fill a quota.  &quot;Pillars of  the Earth&quot; is a masterpiece.  A &quot;Dangerous Fortune&quot; is  genious.  &quot;Hammer of Eden&quot; is better than &quot;Third Twin&quot;  but this is like saying coming in 87th place is better than 90th!  This  book is not what I expect from Ken Follett, he is a much better writer than  this.

0784011796|4.0|Although wonderfully acted with an excellant script it isn't the &quot;BEST movie I've ever seen!&quot; And on a larger screen (52') some of the white effects gave me a headache. Also, although the &quot;film  noir&quot; effect is nice during the night scene with marcy dawson looked  like the film was ready to split into pieces right in front of me. But,  some will like it, and others may perfer something a little more  mainstream. And I can't help but mention the title sequence which I think  is perfect.
6302968100|5.0|In what other film EVER would we see brad pitt actually act, val kilmer impersonate elvis, Dennis Hopper as a GOOD guy, Gary Oldman as a black man/pimp(and not surprisingly pulls the sucker off!), and Christian Slater  and Patricia Arquette in probably the best roles ever cast for each of the  two...all in ONE movie?...Tarantino is a genius(although there are those of  you out there who disagree whole-heartedly), and just proves it over and  over again, proving that a basic stereotypical plot can become what we all  least expect it...There aren't many videos out there on the shelves that  even compare to this puppy...one of the greatest...
0783228600|5.0|People have gone in to see Fear and Loathing expecting to see drama, or even Brazil (or some other Gilliam movie), but if you expect a road movie, you will get just that. Fear and Loathing is the funniest most real movie I  have seen for ages. Gilliam himself was laughing when he saw how seriously  people were taking this movie. I love this movie. It will surely be a cult  movie always for me.
0800177177|2.0|Although the acting in this movie was superb on Oldman and Ryder's parts(and even w/ Keanu Reeves at some points), the movie did absolutely too little justice to the novel itself. The cinematography, in an attempt  to be spooky and ominous, ended up being cheezy and overdramatic.  Dracula  was done MUCH better by Lugosi in...'54, was it?..All in all the movie flat  out STUNK.
6305229449|5.0|This is in my humble openion by far the best Disney cartoon I have ever seen. Besides those old classics make us nostolgia about our own childhood, this one is an achievement in both art and style. It earmarked the first  large scenery shot. Remember, the last dance of &quot;Beauty and  Beast&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;? Spectators are all motionless!  I mean dead! Only the two main characters are moving. This time you can see  the Hun calvery stampeded down the hill in hundreds. Wow! I love it. I love  to see the girl portraited smart, witty, and kind! Hey, it is not just for  Chinese girls, it is for all of you - all the girls! Where is the blond  bimboo? Certainly not in this film. This is the right direction for  Hollywood to take. Girls are not sex object only. Girls are stronger than  most men! Girls should be brought up as a proud leader for the future.  Every men appreciate what Mulan's father said: &quot;The greatest gift and  honor is having you as my daughter!&quot; Well, I am a proud father of  three wonderful daughters too.
0062502182|5.0|I had the pleasure of reading this entire little book at the airport while waiting for my son's 6 hour delayed flight to come in.  It put a whole new perspective on how I might have felt about being held up by the unexpected  delay.  The story is simply and eloquently told, as the boy goes from  adventure to adventure, teaching to teaching, meeting an amazing variety of  mentors, some unknown even to themselves.  Reading the book was the perfect  way to spend the afternoon.
6302787300|5.0|I didn't think I wanted to see this movie, but was  riveted to my seat.  It was amazingly interesting  and created a great story of Christopher Columbus  and how the Americas were discovered.  It also gave the other  side of the story -- how diseases were brought to the areas they  discovered, and how they had to conquer the people when they arrived. The  sound track was beautiful and moving.

0784011796|5.0|There are some movies that could be called the greatest of all time.  Stuff like Star Wars, Braveheart, etc.  But then there is a *completely different category* of the Greatest Movies of All Time.  This uber-category  includes movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and, at the very pinnacle,  Citizen Kane.  This movie, Pi, belongs in that second category.  And even  at the level of its finest.  Few movies change people.  Pi is such a movie.   See it as though your life depended upon it.

1558803602|5.0|My all-time favoirte movie!  Although Dryfus is billed as the star, Holly Hunter is a believable actress who carries the emotion of the movie.  Audrey Hepburn appears as a wise (and beautiful) angel who guides Dryfus  through the heart wrenching  process of moving on.  John Goodman is the  added touch that makes this a sweet, funny romance flick. Keep it in your  collection for those days when you need a good laugh and a cry all at the  same time.
6304509162|5.0|Poltergeist is the first movie to star the extrememly talented young actress, Heather O'rourke.  This movie is filled with the best child acting I have ever seen.  It's thrilling, exciting and scary.  The two sequels are  wonderful, as well.

B000002P5R|5.0|This CD shows how Jimi's music was progressing around the time of his death.  It is a peek into what the future might have been had Jimi lived.  I have been into Hendrix for about twenty years now but never appreciated  the songs that make up this CD until recently.  After you listen to this  CD, you'll never want to hear &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; on the  radio again.  The only unfortunate thing is that &quot;Message of  Love&quot; doesn't appear on this CD.

B000002PHM|5.0|I've had a passing acquaintance with Astor Piazzolla's work throughout my 9 years as a community radio programmer.  When I encountered the re-issue of his &quot;Tango:  Zero Hour&quot; in our station's new bin, I thought  I'd check it out.  [Insert Argentinian term for &quot;wow&quot; here.]   When an artist who has been at the top of his genre for decades says  &quot;this is my finest record ever,&quot; I listen.  Produced by Kip  Hanrahan, this record lays bare the intensity and beauty of tango in a  stunning manner.  This record has, in some subtle way, changed the way I  hear music.  A true masterpiece!
B00000DHRZ|1.0|If this band is such a great punk band, how come they're so bad as a live act?  When I saw them, they stopped in the middle of songs at least four times.  Forget the lyrics?  Prerecorded tracks mess up?  Who knows, but the  moshing idiots ate their lame act up with a spoon.
0792151712|3.0|The hype about Titanic was overdone. All this film was really about was two lovers. A girl from a rich family and an average boy. Both of them are doomed to die on the ship. The special effects in the film are excellent  and so is the excitment. But that dosen't come until near the end. Most of  the movie is just about two teenagers in love. After awhile that gets  pretty boring. Sure the end will make you cry and it gets thrilling, but  before that it's nothing but talk, talk, talk, and romance. This movie  should have focused more on different people than just two lovers. It's not  the worst movie ever made, but it is far from being the best. Their are a  lot of other films that should have gotten best movie of the year award. If  you like romance, go ahead and see it. If you want more of a thrilling  story you will fall asleep on this one.
0446310786|5.0|My copy has pages falling out of almost every chapter. It has been read and loved as well as a childhood teddy bear, the only difference being that it will never stop being relevant.

0800130928|5.0|I can't believe I am the first to write a review of this film.  I'm not worthy.  This movie has been quoted to death and picked apart as much or more then any film in the last quarter century.  There is good reason.   More then anything this movie is a study in madness and sanity.  We all  feel as Travis does sometimes.  The world has gone to hell and a rain  should come and wash away all the garbage off the street, all of it.  Of  course we, as sane people, realise this is wrong thinking and get over it.   Travis does not.  Travis Bickle is an  unbalanced person who just wants to  be a normal person, like anyone else.  He tries this.  He gets a job  driving a cab becouse he can't sleep nights &quot;there's porno theaters  for that&quot; the cab manager tells him.  And indeed there are.  But  Travis has no interest in sex, he just goes into the pornos becouse that's  were other people go, he wants to be like other people.  Had he lived in a  small town instead of New York, he may just as well have followed the heard  into church or to the mall.  his neighborhood has no churches  so he goes  to see dirty movies.  Travis wouldn't know a dirty movie from a pop-tart.   This is made painfully clear when he asks a girl out on a date.  Bickle is  sitting in his cab whe &quot;she&quot; walks by.  Cyble Shepard.   &quot;she&quot; is wearing a white dress, she was like an angle in this  filthy mass, &quot;they must not touch her&quot;.  Travis actually  convinces this high class beauty to go to the movies with him.  You can  guess what happens next.  He takes her to the only movies he knows about.   Needless to say, Betsy (shepards character) is not a fan of &quot;Somethime  Sweet Susan&quot; and &quot;Swedish Marrage Manual&quot;   She storms off  and refuses his calls.  Travis didn't mean any harm.  He can not understand  why his genuine efforts to fit in don't work.  He becomes angry and self  absorbed.  He meets a 12 year old prostitute and after  his ill fated date  withBetsy goed to see her.  Harvey Kietel is as good as he has ever been  as the pimp who tells Travis about the little girl he is going to see.  I  won't quote him here as I am sure the good folks at Amason would not  appreciate it, but he gives a graphic detailed discription of all the  sexual things Travis can do with this 12 and a half year old girl.  Travis  had no intentions of doing anything with this child.  He talks to her and  says &quot;you're a young girl you should be in school&quot;  What a nut.   Any sane person can see that she (Iris) is a whore and can only be a whore.   No one in this film, none of the &quot;sane&quot; emotionally stable,  normal people do anything to help or are even upset at this arrangement ( a  pimp and a 12 year old girl) they either buy her services or ignore the  situation.  Bickle takes Iris (Jodie Fosters 12 year old hooker character)  to breakfast and tells her she should not be selling herself on the street  for a bunch of pimps and lowlifes.  In a very moving performance, Jodie  Fosters character looks at him like he is form outer space &quot;I don't  know who's wierder, you or me&quot;  She really can't understand that  someone cares about her and that what she is doing is wrong.  The only  person in the world that says what is right, that 12 year old girls don't  belong ont he streets whoring, is a raving nut.  Who are the crazys and who  are the sane? Travis eventually loses control and goes on a shooting spree.   He kills off a bunch of people the police don't like anyway so he is a  hero.  Some problems can only be solved by a crazy, lonely white guy with a  pistol.  &quot;You talkin' to me?  I don't see nobody else here&quot;.   This is the first time Jodie Foster was recognised as a great actress, she  was nominated for best supporting actress and deservedly so.  Martin  Scorsese has done films as good as this, but never better.  I can't  recomend in enough. &quot;Lost Johnny&quot;
0380018179|5.0|I cry when I even think about this book. The only way to describe this novel is huge - an unbelievable multigenerational story that conveys emotions between mother and daughter, woman and man, man and God, all so  insightfully. Father Ralph deBricassart's struggle in his choice between  God and Meggie is outstandingly written because he's so human it makes you  want to cry for him, and so is she. There's not a cheesy word in this book.  Comes extremely highly recommended from me.
B000002KOQ|4.0|Joni Mitchell continues to evolve towards her full maturity in this fine collection of atmospheric songs that includes the hit &quot;Big Yellow Taxi.&quot; I enjoy it very much. At moments it is a bit self-conscious,  but it is an important stepping stone and a good thing in and of itself.
0670880728|2.0|There's nothing inherently bad about this book if you take it as a light-hearted piece of entertainment. Nothing wrong with that; it isn't remotely realistic, it's stereotyped, it doesn't pretend to either  originality or literacy (I hope!). I read it in the bath, then gave it away  to someone else.  However: I do find it slightly worrying to see so many  people who genuinely see this book as a kind of manual for the times.  No-one is saying Bridget is real. God help us, surely no-one is saying we  should be like Bridget. As far as I know, a generation of adolescents  didn't suddenly develop a craving to be Adrian Mole. Be amused if you can.  Be very amused (if you can, I just managed the odd smile). But please don't  let's pretend this is literature.....
B000002ULO|4.0|There is the inveitable dead weight that comes from just messing about, but for the most part Paul is offering up some remarkably good tunes here, simply and clearly produced, at times masterful, and always fun.  &quot;Young Boy&quot; is a particular hit. Liner notes by Mark Lewisohn are  so detailed you'd think this was a reissue of an old classic.
0316152196|5.0|Another book that takes you out of this world and never let you escape till you finish it.Thats the kind of book that anyone would like. To transport you to the places where the book take place. Michael, if you read  this, thank you very much. Hope that you are now writing, because we need  more great books from you.
B000000ORX|4.0|In her husky maturity, Joni Mitchell can still be highly evocative. Many of the songs on this album are done in a peculiar layering style of recording, sometimes with wonderful results (&quot;Passion Play&quot;,  &quot;Slouching Toward Bethlehem&quot;) and sometimes middling. The title  song and the final track, &quot;Two Grey Rooms,&quot; are good explorations  of the emotional poles, joy and sorrow, yet both are equally wistful.  &quot;Come In From the Cold&quot; is a long and catchy hit.
B0000025ED|4.0|It was at the tender age of 14 that I discovered there were more kinds of music than the twangy country my parents listened to.  My Life, Honesty, and especially Big Shot were my first rock and roll favorites.<br />There are  some other great songs on this album.  Zanzibar, Rosalinda's Eyes, 52nd  Street.  Love the trumpet/flugelhorn on some of the songs!<br />This one, The  Stranger, and Glass Houses are Billy Joel's best.  Songs From the Attic is  also worth checking out.
0694003611|5.0|This book was a great sell to my 6 1/2 month old daughter.  She is easily attracted to the colorful pictures and easy words.  It has caught her attention each and every time.  This is a great book for every child to  have in their library!
B00000F1D3|4.0|I picked this up in Singapore as I always liked Cher and had been hearing &quot;Believe&quot; everywhere. I don't give it a 5 because most of the other songs on the album are very similar to the title track and  repetitive. However, I do love the beat and her voice, as always, is deep,  powerful and very mature.  Go Cher!
B000001FP8|5.0|This album brings back so many memories of my years as a young kid.  I still listen to their music, and can sing every word of every song.  This CD has got to be my favorite of all of them.  Keep on rocking guys!
6305126062|5.0|Whenever I watch a movie I usually get up a number of times, make coffee, paint my nails or browse through a catalogue - not with this one!  I watched from beginning to end without taking my eyes of the screen,  occasionally reaching for the box of tissues!  Best film I have seen in a  very long time but then I am such a romantic...
B000002B7S|5.0|I believe this cd is a great investment. The title track is awesome, and Jake E. Lee does a great job on lead guitar, especially when you consider the shoes he had to fill. The title track is completely awesome. It has has  great lyrics, great vocals, and GREAT guitar riffs. The song &quot;Rock and  Roll Rebel&quot; is a great anthem for any rebellious, punk-assed high  school kids who may read this. It may not be as hard or as fast as  &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; by Metallica or &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; by  Slayer, but it still rocks and is great music for a party with all your  headbangin' freinds.

B000002H92|5.0|This is a great 2 CD Doors live music set.  The sound quality is pretty good and Jim Morrison's banter with the crowd is always entertaining.  I loved it when he asked the audience what they wanted to hear after  &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; and you could hear shouts from the people for  &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, but instead the band went into &quot;Alabama  Song (Whiskey Bar)&quot;.  Classic Morrison.  Always the antagonist.       Morrison and the rest of the Doors are in great form throughout all the  tracks.  The improvisation on &quot;The End&quot; makes it radically  different than the regular versions on the studio CD and the extended play  one from the Box Set.  The songs that really struck me were the already  mentioned &quot;Who Do You Love&quot;, &quot;Universal Mind&quot;,  &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot;, and &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;.  But all the  rest of the songs were great too.  My only complaint is the edit of the  song &quot;Gloria&quot;.  The Box Set contains the unedited version which  sounds more complete.  I guess Elektra found &quot;Gloria&quot; too graphic  to be released in its full form on this sample of Doors concert material.        Great listen though and well worth the price.

0425098389|5.0|When it comes to detectives Sherlock Holmes is an obligatory reference. Many have tried to copy the surprising qualities that Holmes got from Conan Doyle's pen. All of them are far away from him!.
0385493800|5.0|He takes a different approach with this book which is the alter ego of The Chamber.  I found the book refreshing and totally enjoyable, especially the details describing the Pantanal, an area that I also have been.  Easy  reading compared to the Pelican Brief where it was sometimes difficult to  keep up with the action.  The book has its surprises with everything tied  together to a very enjoyable conclusion.
B000002H6C|5.0|I think this cd is pertty cool, the best parts are just unbleavable,  the song that is pertty cool is &quot;One&quot;, that is where a man has lost his arms and legs and just wants to die.  The rest are good for rock, the  first on has a really neat beginning.
6305263248|5.0|Every aspect of this movie is enjoyable, most notably the two spectacular car chase scenes.  The cast provides just the right amount of European intrigue and class that is required for their roles.  The movie makes us  want to know what is in the case so bad, but all in all it does not matter,  it is the mission that matters.  Please don't miss out on one of the most  enjoyable films of the year.
0385493800|5.0|I enjoyed this Grisham book better than any of the others.  While it did not have the action of The Firm, it did have an intriguing plot and what I considered to be great character development.  As a lawyer, I was  interested in the portrayal of the attorneys for the Phelan heirs.  I think  I recognized some of them!!!  Most of us do not read John Grisham books for  their depth.  We read them as a diversion.  I can honestly say that Mr.  Grisham has once again kept my attention for a sustained period of time.   If you are looking for deep psychological meaning or heavy philosophical  messages you will not find it here, but this book does have some subtle,  but serious religious messages.
B000001IPL|5.0|Smash(along with Ignition)is an album with punk written all over it.Americana and Ixnay are more like the guys were just playing around in the studio and making up funny lyrics. Come Out And Play,Genocide,Self  Esteem and Smash are worth having by themselves.If The Offspring stayed  like how they were in Smash and Ignition(and the earlier albums)and still  went mainstream,they would be the Nirvana of the late 90s
6305252521|4.0|The Truman Show is very good film.  Good picture, good audio, good story.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!  My only gripe with the DVD is the glaring lack of bonus material on the disc.  Is'nt this what we buy  these things for? Well, and the sound and picture quality!  Four stars out  of five, could have easily been five stars with the addition of bonus  material.
6305161976|5.0|Watching Casablanca is like greeting an old friend. Sure, one has probably seen it many times and, definitely, one probably knows the dialogue by heart, but there is something that keeps you coming back.  Bogart is in top  form and the pairing with Ingrid Bergman is first rate. One has to wonder  if the world would have been a different place if Warner Bros. first choice  for the role, Ronald Reagan, had played Rick. Would Casablanca be the  classic it is today? Would Reagan have gone into politics? These are  questions that don't, and won't have answers. The story is one that holds  the attention and the supporting cast is one of the best, from Peter  Lorre's courier to Conrad Veidt as the German major and, in a class by  himself, Claude Rains as the politically astute Police Prefect. All in all,  Casablanca is a wonderful viewing experience for our time and for all time.

0790729725|5.0|This movie will keep you glued to your seat. Buy the video as you will want to watch it again and again. The story never gets boring and the film is filled with memorable catchphrases, like &quot;As far back as I can  remember I've always wanted to be a gangster&quot;. This is simply the BEST  mod, no no, the BEST MOVIE ever made!!! Watch it you'll love it. I did.
B00000DD2D|5.0|I own *lots* of blues albums - this is one of the top-of-the-heap - outstanding!
B000003NA4|5.0|The quality of the music, together with cool jazz sounds, are enough to make this album good.  Add Diana Drall's sultry voice, the album is outstanding.  &quot;Peel me a Grape&quot; has to be the sexiest song and  rendition of all time.
6305165912|5.0|it's a movie that really isn't about anything...aimless like the dude's life, but funny as hell.  The Coen Bros subtly subvert the action/kidnapping genre by setting you up to believe the movie actually has  a plot, which seems plausible right up until the end...by the time you  realize you've been duped you've watched the whole movie and enjoyed it  despite yourself.  OK, so I'm not making it sound very good...but it really  is a lot of fun....
0767817478|4.0|One thing I will say about this movie is if you want to impress your friends with your new home entertainment system get this DVD. The sound effects are excellent!! With my sub-woofer turn to 75% it felt like  Godzilla was walking down my street. If you do not have a sub-woofer this  is a good argument to go out and get one.  On the other hand the movie is a  little long but the special effects will keep you hooked.

B00000FCBC|5.0|When I first bought Garage INC, I didn't know what exactly to think.  I mean, hell, the second disk is filled with classic Met covers (Breadfan is drastically underrated tune), but the first one was a bit of a shock.  The  feel is a little looser (like Load &amp; Re-Load...), but Metallica still  seems to pull it off in stride.  Turn the Page is good, but Sabbra Cadabra,  Whiskey in the Jar, Tuesday's Gone, and Astronomy are the real gems here.   Like Metallica's old covers, they take the new songs and truely make it  their own.   This 2 Disk set offers a lot to the older fans like myself  (nothing like hearing the evolution of one of the greatest bands of our  time...) and the newer fans (a &quot;Crash Course&quot; in Metallica's  roots). An excellent buy.
078322706X|4.0|In MJB, Brad Pitt portrays &quot;Death&quot; who decides to take a holiday on earth and experience what it is like to be a mortal. First, he takes the life of a charming lawyer (portrayed by Brad Pitt again, of course) and  chooses Bill Parish, a rich tycoon and whom he sees as a perfect example of  a successful human being, to show him the ropes. Bill has no choice because  &quot;Death&quot; told him that he is actually here to claim Bill's life as  his time is almost up, but he will postpone that task so long as he is  enjoying his stay on earth. But &quot;Death&quot; did not prepare himself  to fall in love with Bill's daughter, the lovely Susan (demurely played by  Claire Forlani) and vice versa. Of course, Bill raises hell and objects  strongly when he found out. So, will &quot;Death&quot; get to be together  with Susan in the end or will he have to go away? What will happen to Susan  and Bill? I guess you have to watch the movie to find out. Brad Pitt and  Claire Forlani are beautiful looking and makes a great pair. I'm only  dissapointed by the ending, which left me wondering whether the  lawyer/attorney (killed off earlier in the movie so that &quot;Death&quot;  could take over his body) was brought back to life again or whether  &quot;Death&quot; decided to stay for a while more on earth. I raise this  question because &quot;Death&quot; may have the power to take a person's  life when his/her time is up, but I don't think &quot;Death&quot; can make  a dead person (the lawyer) come to life! Could someone write and tell me  his/her views? Despite the above, I highly recommend this movie for its  great storyline and fine acting. Also, Brad Pitt looks absolutely divine in  suit.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Cher has outdone herself this time with her new CD called &quot;Believe.&quot;  The songs are exhilarating, the sounds are stimulating, and listening to the CD is quite invigorating. My favorite  song's on the CD are &quot;Believe&quot; and &quot;Love is the  Groove.&quot;
1558216847|5.0|If true, this is one of the most remarkable adventures of all time. It really demonstrates the human will to live.<br />Some phrases and words should have been changed to make it more readable by a western audience.<br />It  makes climbing Everest look like a summer stroll.
B000003S2M|5.0|The best of the four Ambient Music albums. This one starts off and ends with a warm evocative tune that invites relaxation and reflection. Great music for making love.
B000005S27|5.0|Although Take That was not a big success here in the US until the 1994 release of &quot;Back For Good&quot;, many of us dance-clubbers had already built a long standing relationship with the group since the early days of  &quot;Do What U Like&quot; and &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot;.<br />Here, all  on one disc, is the very best of a band responsible for the success of many  other 'boybands' to follow (ie: Backstreet Boys, 'N*Sync, 98 degrees).  The  collection features a little something for everyone.  For the helpless  romantics, there's the wonderful love ballads &quot;A Million Love  Songs&quot;, &quot;Love Ain't Here Anymore&quot;, &quot;Babe&quot;, and of  course &quot;Back For Good&quot;, also the final single &quot;How Deep Is  Your Love&quot;.  Dance-clubbers will remember &quot;Could It Be  Magic&quot;, &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;, &quot;Do What U Like&quot; and  &quot;It Only Takes A Minute&quot;, all big dance club favorites here in  the US.  If you're looking for kick-back music to just listen to, check out  &quot;Sure&quot;, &quot;Never Forget&quot;, &quot;Pray&quot;, and &quot;Why  Can't I Wake Up With You&quot;.<br />Many have criticized the boys for being  merely singers and not playing the music on their records, but then again  this is how it was for many successful groups.  Can anyone say The  Temptations, The Miracles, The Four Tops, The Supremes, or even The Monkees  were not 'Real Groups' simply because they did not play the music on their  albums?  I think not!!<br />Anyway this album will remind anyone of how much  Take That will surely be missed.  I have both Gary's and Mark's solo  albums, both wonderful albums in their own right.  I have yet to get  Robbie's solo album but I've heard good things about it.  Somehow it's just  not the same without the whole group together.
078322608X|3.0|This movie tried to be too different. I thought it could have been much better. It was too unreal.
B000002UDV|5.0|Nothing else even comes close.<br />Just imagine how Pet Sounds would be worshiped by the general public if it had been done by the Beatles or the Stones or some group that the rock press told them was cool. . . .
0783225733|3.0|I wanted them to make it on the moon not have to worry about getting back to earth somehow. I felt it was boring and predictable. It needed more action like Armagedon or Star Wars. This movie was too realistic which made  it all the more boring.

0792833279|1.0|If you think violence is funny then you may like this movie. I don't like what this movie teaches. Don't let your kids watch it. I hate how Hollywood is starting to promote these types of movies were violence is standard.  This one reminded me a little of Pulp Fiction which I felt was another  bust.
079073382X|5.0|Funny, romantic, jazzy, and ultimately heartbreaking, this long-night's-journey-into-day is so beautifully written (by Richard Linklatter) and exquisitely performed by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, it  will probably soon be regarded as one of the three best love stories of the  '90's.  If you can keep from weeping when Hawke takes Delpy's  &quot;picture&quot; by simply staring at her lovely face for  thirty  completely silent seconds, you are a stronger man than I.

6305229449|5.0|This movie is very well done.  The animation is by far some of the best to be seen on the big screen in years.  The music is very good, too, but the part that I like the best is that the &quot;star&quot; is not a caucasian!   My children are adopted from Korea and it's wonderful that they see that  courageous and beautiful people come from all over the world!
B00000ADG2|3.0|Lauryn Hill is pretty good. I heard it was good, so I bought this album. But it didn't meet my expectations. Certain songs like &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, &quot;To Zion&quot;, &quot;Superstar&quot;,  &quot;Final Hour&quot;, and &quot;Every Ghetto, Every City&quot; were  really good. But overall, it wasn't that good. I do recommend it though.
0792838297|5.0|Paddy Chayefsky's outstanding screenplay and scathing comedy about television gone horribly wrong says something about the power of the media and about what people really want to watch.  Fiction in 1976 is reality  today!  Oh yeah, the DVD is above average with very good transfer, a  theatrical trailer, and a quiz covering quotes said in the film.  A  must-see.
B000002H2H|5.0|To me, Metallica's musical brilliance started with this album.  More than any other, even Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning captures the spirit of &quot;old&quot; Metallica with it's combination of dark melodies and  vicious beats.  Next to the Black Album (Metallica), this is probably  Metallica's greatest, most original work.
6304119046|5.0|Film historians have called this one of the most important films of all time.  Film critics call it the best film ever made.  The AFI called it the #1 American movie, of the more than 20,000 entries.  You've heard it said,  but let ne say it again: this is one of the top five films ever made.  Orson Welles does everything right in this masterpiece; he is, along with  Woody Allen, the only man ever to be nominated for Academy Awards for  writing, acting and directing for the same picture the same year.  The  direction in this film is magnificent.  Against all that had been done  before, Welles employed a fluid camera that looked at the world through  expressive angles (and in perfect focus, I might add).  Welles had a  personal theory that one should be able to understand what's happening in a  film without being able to hear it.  Doing so, he created a stunning array  of visual tactics that make the film more colorful and more expressive than  any other I've seen (i.e.: the camera looks up at those in the scene who  are dominant, and down at the weaker characters).  The cinematography is  flawless, producing a perfect picture that can be enjoyed in the video.  I  had an opportunity to see this visually stunning movie on the big screen,  and although that is the best way to watch it, the video is a nice  alternative.  The writing is, in its own sense, ingenious.  Although it  might leave some bored and/or confused, it uses a dramatic structure  (looking back at a man's life through those who know him) that would be  immitated ever since.  This type of storytelling adds spice and power to  this already great movie.  Although Welles plays the only major role (as  Charlie Kane) and is at his peak in it, the innumerable other supporting  performances are almost the same caliber, if not the same, to Welles'.  Using relatively unknown actors from Welles' own Mercury Theater troupe, he  crated a colorful cast of characters that burn in memory. Allong with the  superb picture, the video also includes a first-rate documentary about the  making of it.ure, the video also includes a first-rate documentary about the  making of it.
B000002H33|4.0|Though people tend to say Master of Puppets is the greatest of Metallica's earlier works, it seems a bit too commercially driven to me.  That is not to say it is not hard, intense, and fast--all Metallica is wonderful work,  and this is no exception.  Still, Ride the Lightning felt fresher, more  innovative.
0553565915|5.0|A dear friend of mine asked me to give the book to a friend whom was dieing of Aids in 1995.  I brought the book home and in the process of caring for the patient and working, simply forgot about the book.  The  patient was admitted to a nursing home for extensive care and I discovered  the book on my bureau.  During my friends illness I found it difficult to  talk with him, unsure of the correct things to say to a dear friend that  was dying.  I picked up the book and could not stop reading....I was  awakened at 6:30 A.M. the following morning by the nursing home that my  friend had summoned my mother and I, that the time was near.  In our  journey (40 miles away) my mothers prayer was that David would not die  alone.  As we arrived, he was waiting, my mother sat down beside him, and  after her greeting, started receiting the Lords' Prayer, his nurse was  singing a beautiful gospel song, and I on the other side of the bed, spoke  to him and began telling him of the journey that he was about to make.  How  he would be greeted and welcomed, and how he would walk through the  beautiful rose garden and hear the glorious voices of God singing.  I asked  him if he could hear me and see what I was describing, and if he could - to  give me a sign, and a teardrop fell down the right side of his cheek.  I  was elated and anxious to continue the outline of his journey and eliminate  his fears. I told him that he would see the light and that it would warm  his body and his pain would cease. I told him that when he reached his  destination I could see him directing the choir and to send me some kind of  brainwave to let me know how things really were up-there! (Smiles)  I asked  him to be my guardian angel and to help me out here on earth. More tears  fell, and shortly thereafter God slipped in between my mother, the nurse  and myself and David began his journey.  I am sharing this experience with  you because Ms. Eadies' book gave me the courage to say goodbye to a  friend. I have shared the book with other bereaved families and it has been  a consulation to them.  Several weeks passed and I was at work and I looked  up and saw a vision of David in the doorway, and naturally I wanted to  talk, talk, talk.  I knew from the depths of my heart that he had walked to  the light and my heart was truly happy.  That was Davids' sign to me that  we remain friends today and his journey is complete.have shared the book with other bereaved families and it has been  a consulation to them.

B000002H97|5.0|Quite simply, this album is the best piece of metal on the market.  With the Black Album, Metallica redefined both themselves and rock in general.  With it's intense sound, powerful riffs, beautiful structures, and  thoughtful lyrics, no other album even comes close.
