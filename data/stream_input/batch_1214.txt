B005GSVFF0|1.0|Not sure why, but this movie is so poorly written conceived and performed even my young children couldn't watch it.  I buy anything 3D, but not this one..
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I begin with high hopes and without seeing anything give the set 5 stars, and go from there.<br /><br />INITIAL POST:<br /><br />Immediately upon opening the set I removed a star. The all cardboard case is a joke, and all but ensures I wont watch these that often, for fear of destroying the discs. You have to slide the discs against the cardboard to get them out, there is no way around this. I know Blu-rays have a protective coating, but still cosmetically they still scratch. I will say this though the cardboard is high quality, I just hate this kind of packaging! (See The Simpsons Seasons 11-13/20 for reviews on this type of packaging) Stay tuned for more updates. I am off to watch Phantom Menace now.<br /><br />EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE<br /><br />The Phantom Menace Blu-ray is extremely well done, the picture is the best I've seen on any Blu-ray In my collection. I hope this picture quality is reflected throughout the saga. The sound was also excellent, even on my elderly 5.1 system. The A/V earns my over all rating a star back. Yay! We are back to five stars.<br /><br />The new CGI Yoda is a vast improvement over the horrible puppet they used originally. That being said, I did observe that the clarity of the picture tends to make the CGI more noticeable, especially in scenes with CGI & live action. Not a complaint so much as just an observation, as I realize CGI was still in it's juvenile phase in 1999.<br /><br />Over all The Phantom Menace Blu-ray gets an A+! On to Attack of the Clones! (My personal favorite of the prequels, just because we get to see Yoda break bad!)<br /><br />EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES<br /><br />Attack of the Clones doesn't benefit from Blu-ray treatment like The Phantom Menace does. I blame this on early HD digital cameras that were used to film it. Most everything is less focused than TPM, and I noticed quite a bit of pixels in darker scenes and shadows. Based on the fact that the cameras were inferior, I'd say this is the best AotC will ever be. It gains no extra stars, but it doesn't lose any ether, for my overall score of the saga.<br /><br />EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH<br /><br />Revenge of the Sith suffers from the same thing that Attack of the Clones does. It was filmed with digital cameras instead of actual film, and it shows. There is a great deal of pixelation, mostly in the backgrounds, but there is some noticeable pixels in much of the foreground also. Don't get me wrong it looks good, but nowhere near the clarity of The Phantom Menace. Based on the fact that AotC & RotS both suffer this way I have removed a star from my overall rating of the saga. Sad that Mr. Lucas didn't have the foresight to realize that digital cameras were/are far from perfect. On to A New Hope...<br /><br />EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE<br /><br />A New Hope. The first Star Wars movie ever. The picture is impressive for a 34 year old film. There is a bit of noise in the picture, but it's more than acceptable.<br /><br />Han & Greedo pretty much shoot at the same time now, and the scene looks more natural. The added in rocks in front of R2D2 are well done. I probably wouldn't have even notice if I wasn't looking for them. As for Obi-wan's Krayt Dragon call, it is very noticeable, and pretty goofy (I actually burst out laughing). All in all these new additions don't do anything to really harm the movie, but they don't do anything to help it ether.<br /><br />My one real complaint comes from the Lightsaber effects... How is it that Mr. Lucas feels the need to adjust things that were okay to begin with, but the Lightsaber effects in this movie keep getting neglected? All through my childhood I hated the way the Lightsaber effects looked in this movie, particularly when being powered on/off. There are severe frame jumps and inconsistencies, that with modern technology should be an easy fix. Why does this keep getting overlooked? Also, I was under the impression that the Lightsaber colors were going to be repaired in this set. Well Luke's saber color is still way off particularly in the remote scene on the Millennium Falcon. This is supposed to be the same Lightsaber Anakin had at the end of Revenge of the Sith, it is supposed to be bright blue. In the remote scene it is a washed out aqua color that at times is mostly white. How is this acceptable? I see amateur YouTube fan videos all the time with better Lightsaber effect than this. The fail on the Lightsaber effects makes me remove another star for my overall rating of the saga. On to the Empire Strikes Back. Shouldn't be anything to disappoint there. *knocks on wood*<br /><br />EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK<br /><br />The Empire Strikes Back looks pretty good, again there is a bit of noise, but it is to be expected with a 30 year old movie. I will say this however, many of the space effects had a quite obvious square around them where they were edited in. I don't know if it was because my TV settings are too bright or what, but it was quite distracting at times.<br /><br />The Lightsabers, while not as bad as ANH are still a little off as far as color, Vader's saber is more hot pink than the red it should be. Also something I noticed that I hadn't before, is when Luke is climbing out of the Wampa's cave, you hear the sound effect for the Lightsaber turning off, but it clearly doesn't. Seems like a really easy fix would be to just remove the sound effect. I'll let it slide because I missed it for 30 years so I guess it's easy to miss. All in all TESB doesn't lose any stars but it doesn't earn any ether. On to Return of the Jedi... May the Force be with it...<br /><br />EPISODE VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI<br /><br />Return of the Jedi suffers from the same squares around the ships/Death Star that I noticed in TESB. Again it could be that my TV settings are too bright, but it's where I like it for video games and I don't feel like readjusting from movie to game every time. Odd that they are so obvious with just a brightness adjustment, though.<br /><br />As for effects the Lightsabers look decent enough, for a brief moment durring the final duel Vader's saber is almost a purple color, but overall the Lightsabers look good. Jabba's Palace door is bigger but you wouldn't really notice if you didn't know to look for it. The added in Dug is negligible and is on screen for maybe a whole second. The Ewoks blink, and I'm pretty sure the whole eye has been updated for Wicket. Now for the \\"NOOOOOOO\\" well I came into it expecting the worst, but all in all it's nowhere near as bad as everyone has made it out to be. It was unnecessary, but doesn't destroy the scene. I think the Obi-wan Krayt Dragon call was way worse. So final verdict on the saga, 3 stars, average... On to the special features discs, which are really the selling point with this set anyway. I have high hopes.<br /><br />UPDATE TO SAGA REVIEWS: ATTACK OF THE SQUARES<br /><br />I originally chalked up me being able to see the editing squares to me having my brightness up to high. Well I posted a discussion about it and come to find out I'm not the only one seeing them. Seems to me like more time should have gone into making sure things like this were fixed for the Blu-ray HD release of these films, instead of adding unnecessary rocks, howls, Dugs, eyelids, and NOOOOs! Since I am not the only person to see these squares, and they stuck out like a sore thumb to me, I am removing a star for both Empire & Jedi. Overlooking this, after all the \\"improvements\\" that have been made over the years, is a slap in the face. I hate to be the one to say this, but if he truly wants both trilogies to match up, ALL of the space scenes in the original trilogy need to be redone. They look awful compared to the prequels.<br /><br />THE BONUS DISCS:<br /><br />The bonus discs are jammed packed with tons on material. Enough to earn the set 2 stars. Nearly all on the deleted scenes I would love to see finished and placed back into the saga (aside from anything that would destroy continuity, or promote insest! lol!) The discs are overflowing with stills of models, costumes, paintings, etc. all in very high resolution. The documentaries are informative, and entertaining. While the spoof special was a hoot!<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT:<br /><br />The set gets a 3 star rating from me, due to the fact that I think the original trilogy could have been cleaned up a great deal more for this HD presentation. All in all for what you get, the current price of $80 (although I've heard the price is going up in the next couple of weeks), is well worth it. Hopefully the OT will get the real HD clean up it deserves for the 3D versions beginning in 2012. I shall wait & see...od.

B004U52VPS|5.0|Bought this for my son's 6th birthday last week and it has been a HUGE hit!  He brings it on every playdate and plays it at home every day for the past 8 days.  My son and his friends sometimes play the game according to the rules, but they mostly enjoy building their own structures and just knocking them down.  Every mom who has seen it has asked where I found it because their kids love it too.  My only concern is that the slingshot may break from overuse!  But so far so good.  Even if it breaks, I would still like the game since it has entertained my son for so long.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I've enjoyed AUX MP3 now for about six weeks, and I think it's a great product overall.  The sound quality is awesome when using a flash drive or SD card (haven't tried an MP3 player as the source though).  I have had no issues with interference from FM radio stations and I really like the AUX's ability to use any FM frequency rather than being limited to a pre-selected few.  The remote controls are relatively easy to use once I became used to the setup.      My only issue is how the AUX3 reads and manages the music folders on my flash drive.  As other reviews have pointed out, this unit seems to order the folders by creation date on the source drive (in my case, this is the computer from which I downloaded the music to the flash drive).  I found this arrangement to be awkward and makes it difficult to locate folders.  It would be easier for me to have the ability to order those folders by alpha rather than by creation date.  Hopefully, Satachi will create and distribute firmware that will correct this issue.      Other than this one annoyance, I enjoy this gadget!  I would purchase it again, would recommend to friends, and was very pleased with the purchase and shipping process.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|The movie was spectacular and beautifully \\"drawn\\". Another world is completely created. The story draws you in from the very beginning and doesn't let you go. You will never guess the ending. Loved it and will watch it again and again.
B0055S348W|5.0|Got this as the free app of the day. In one word: AWESOME. It takes a little effort to set it up for your network, but once done, you don't ever have to fiddle with it again. If there were any cons to this item, it is only that you have to fire up the program first, then navigate to whatever document/email/text message/photo you wish to print. Indeed, the first time I tried to print, it told me it needed to d/l drivers for my specific printer (4 MB) but ever since, it has been flawless. Oh, and QUICK also! Even if I had not got this for free, I would pay for it. It IS that good. If you want the convenience of being able to print out something without having to retrieve it off your laptop or PC and then print it conventionally, then this is definitely the ticket.
0143117009|5.0|Required reading for every member of Congress and Corporate CEO. You too. Collapse is an extension of Guns, Germs and Steel. There the focus was on what physical, biological and cultural factors promote the buildup of civilizations across the world, and how resource-poor and less organized societies tend to be overwhelmed by contact with groups with more metal, more animals and especially iron, cold iron.  Here, Diamond examines the internal workings of societies as they face Collapse-the disintegration of their culture and the way the make their lives.  Using examples from Montana to Easter Island, and presented in a personal style, the book walks us through the choices made and being made by societies facing natural and man-made calamities.  His analysis of the disappearance of Norge from Greenland is especially telling, being contrasted with the successful outcomes in Iceland.  In his point of view, many times societies disappear because they deny the changes taking place and choose not to adapt and replace practices that had been previously successful.     Many years ago John Brunner wrote \\"The Sheep Look Up\\", a novel about the environmental collapse of the United States.  As I recall, the title refers to the slaughtering of sheep.  Most sheep respond to the herd instinct and follow their leader from the pen into the chute where one by one their throats are cut by men standing over them.  Occasionally, one looks up to see the knife-but his panicked attempts to escape are overcome by the relentless press of the ones behind.  Brunner's work was an intuitive, fictional projection from 1970 America to today.  Diamond's clinical dissection of past and current responses to societal Collapse seems unfortunately to be turning science fiction into science fact.     Baaa! Baaa! Baaa!

0375758992|5.0|I just finished this most astonishing book!  And I started crying.  It ends with a tribute to one of the author's siblings, three of whom die in infancy or early childhood.  I read Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight because my book group is reading Alexandra Fuller's latest book, Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness; what a great title!  And I wanted to read this book to explore Fuller's childhood first. That's Alexandra Fuller, called Bobo, on the cover of Don't Let's Go to the Dogs.  The photograph was taken in England, but soon the family returns to Africa, where her mother was born, and a life that was rough in England becomes life-threatening in Rhodesia.  They trade one haardscrabble farm for another. But life in Africa is much, much harsher and more dangerous.  After reading the book, I'm surprised that any of the family survived.  Don't Let's Go frequently reminded of another hair-raising tale of Anglos in Africa, The Poisonwood Bible, by Barbara Kingsolver.  While reading both books, I kept thinking, \\"What were those parents thinking?  This is child abuse.  Go home.\\"  But the family in Kingsolver's book is from the U.S. and could go \\"home.\\"  The Fullers are \\"home.\\"  They are not going back to England.  They move from farm to farm in Central Africa, often barely scratching out a living.  This is home.  And Bobo Fuller loves it.<br /><br />The worst parts were during the time the family lived in war-torn Zimbabwe.  Everyone's life was in danger all of the time.  Plus, they were hungry and worm-infested to boot.  And the parents are raging alcoholics. But Fuller tells the story so dispassionately that the reader has the realization that like most kids who live in unimaginably horrible conditions, this was her life.  She loved her family and she wanted to be with them, whereever they were.  She rarely glimpsed a different kind of life; most of the people they knew lived the same way.  But not everyone.  Occasionally, she visited relatives who lived a more middle-class \\"English\\" kind of life, and she enjoyed it, but she was also an outsider.  Bobo didn't really fit into that world.<br /><br />Fuller's parents called this book \\"that Awful Book.\\"  With caps.  But its publication did not lead to some blow-up in the family.  They are all still speaking to one another.  Why?  Because no matter how shocking and horrible, Bobo survived and thrived in Central Africa.  The book in infused with her love for Africa and for her family.  Her deep understanding of her mother's mental illness.  Her acceptance -- or maybe forgiveness -- of her parents' drinking and neglect.  They all lived a very hard life; her parents are still in Zambia.  Although by the end of Don't Let's Go their lives seem to be a little more financially secure, they are still living at the very edge of the very edge of civilization in Zambia.  No place I would want to be.  But for Tim and Nicola Fuller, it's home.ddle-class \\"English\\" kind of life, and she enjoyed it, but she was also an outsider.

B004CGJ9UU|5.0|This book amazed me for its depth, clarity, and pathos.  Until recently, my extended family had not experienced cancer in our direct bloodline.  So I was especially engaged because a loved one was recently diagnosed with a particularly dangerous form of cancer that has central focus in this book.      A broad variety of cancers are covered in detail, however, and I cannot imagine anyone that invests time in this work not being repaid handsomely.  Messages throughout this book were memorable, heart-warming, chilling, and nuanced . . . often at the same time.  The final message is powerful in its simplicity, yet somehow reassuring for those of us that have made the transition (e.g., the \\"new normal\\").

B003DO13OC|5.0|\\"Tubular Bells\\" hooked me. I'm a fan of Mike Oldfield's music. His music tells stories and paints musical pictures. \\"Ommadawn\\" is no exception. It's like a Celtic tone poem. The haunting melodies are bound to pull you in and make you \\"see\\" what Mike is trying to convey.<br /><br />My first experience with this piece was with an SQ Quadraphonic LP. The ethereal effect that was created with the quad mix gave it an almost mystical sound. This new CD/DVD, with the discrete 5.1 mix, added to that effect, but with greater separation of sounds. The difference between a discrete surround mix, compared to the SQ matrixed version, is night and day. Discrete separation is absolute. It can more accurately convey what the artist's intent was. This discrete version, when played back in surround on any DVD player and Dolby Digital system (too bad it wasn't DTS), will reveal this to you.<br /><br />The new surround mix sounds less cluttered than the original quad version. Many of the textures in the music that were merely hinted at in the quad LP are clearer and more revealing. The chant in part 1, which is my favorite part of the piece, gives Clodagh Simonds's voice a more ethereal effect, while the locations of the different instrumentals as the chant builds up, are more pinpoint and more enveloping. My only criticism is that they cut the drums at the end of part one just a bit too abruptly. I was glad they shortened it, but a more gradual fade would have been better.<br /><br />The original mix of \\"Ommadawn\\", which was conceived to present the piece to the record company for their approval, was almost unrecognizable. The instrumentations were very different on many parts, but as you continued with it, you could hear some familiar elements. Interesting, indeed. As for the new stereo mix, it's also less cluttered, but there are some subtleties not heard here that were heard clearly in the 5.1 version.<br /><br />My only objection here is that, as was stated earlier, Mercury should have used DTS for the surround encoding of this DVD. Since DTS uses less compression, it sounds much better than Dolby Digital for music. Still, this was very much a worthwhile purchase, and I highly recommend it.nd encoding of this DVD.

B005H5H3LW|5.0|This version of the film isn't perfect, but it's good enough for now.  Pans often display a bit of the shimmering effect which can be seen in certain on-demand transfers. It doesn't look like there will be a domestic R1 DVD release of the film coming out at any time in the near future, so this version is definitely adequate.<br /><br />I wanted to clarify the situation of the incomplete subtitles that was mentioned in Kenneth Siller's review. There are no instances of an entire scene with missing subtitles, but there are various instances where a specific line of dialogue is not subtitled, or is subtitled incompletely; however, most of them are negligible or leave no room for doubt because the viewer knows precisely what was said. The only significant subtitle omission is in the briefing toward the beginning; from context we can tell that the line was something like \\"we have to travel to planet Iscandar to get it\\", so it's not too confusing. Shima's brief response to Kodai's order to evade is not subtitled, but it's clear he's not refusing the order; similarly, Kodai's order to fire upon an incoming Gamilas missile is not subtitled; in some of the countdowns the numbers 3-2-1 are not subtitled; Kodai says \\"Black Tiger Ace\\" where the subtitles just say \\"Ace\\"; Sanada's quizzical repetition of Dessler's \\"Alpha and Omega\\" is not subtitled, etc. Finally, one of the unsubbed lines was in English already. Thus, there's really only one substantial line that actually feels missing.<br /><br />In reference to R.K.'s review, the story of the film is not a retelling of \\"Final Yamato\\". It is primarily a retelling of the Quest for Iscandar plotline as seen in the original Space Battleship Yamato  ( the first season of the series ), with elements borrowed from the second season and the second Japanese theatrical release.

B0052WSX32|5.0|At the outset, let me first say I love Doris Day's music. Her voice gives you the feeling of a loving, caring person, baring her soul for all to hear. There are some wonderful songs here, and Doris's voice has never been better. But there's something about this compilation that makes me feel a bit deceived. The songs on this CD are previously unreleased tracks, recorded during her later recording years. But neither the liner notes, nor the cover, give any hint as to when these cuts were recorded. Also, many articles I had read about this album, as well as a news report heard on the radio, hinted that Doris had gone into the studio and that these were newly recorded tracks. Doris is 87 now, but for all we know, she could still be in great voice. But I guess we'll never know. While I enjoy this CD, this deception, or at least as I perceive it, had me tempted to give less than 5 stars. In fact, I did. But on further listening, I had to revise it.    But to the good things... there are some standout tracks that made me take notice. Doris did a really wonderful version of \\"Disney Girls\\", probably the best rendition of this song that I've ever heard. I was also moved by \\"My Buddy\\", which segued into a song which was co-written by Terry Melcher, her son who passed away in 2004 from cancer. The song, \\"Happy Endings\\", was written for Doris, but at her insistence, he recorded it instead. Doris included that song here, with a newly recorded spoken introduction. It's an emotional tribute to the son she called her buddy.     I'm certainly not going to say not to buy this CD. It belongs in every Doris Day fan's collection. But keep in mind this is not newly recorded material, rather unreleased songs recorded for previous albums. Keep that in mind, and you'll fall in love with Doris Day all over again.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This product does not include the original star wars trilogy, but is rather an accumumlation of unforgivable changes from 1997, 2004, and 2011 that serve to ruin classic films.    From what I have read and clips I have watched, Greedo still shoots first, terrible looking cgi aliens are jammed in or replace classic characters, boba fett has a different voice, vader looks like episode III anakin without a helmet and as a ghost...  Before you do something silly and buy this set, please check out Obi-Wan's new krayt dragon call and Vader's new line of \\"No... NOOOOOOOOOOO\\" at the climax of episode VI... Think long and hard about whether George Lucas deserves any of your money.        I will be happy to buy the star wars films of the 1970's and 1980's if they are ever released, but I will not spend money on this garbage.    I encourage all real star wars fans to avoid this product and give it a one star review.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Well I ordered this headset despite some of the reviews that I saw for it. I was fully prepared to return it if it desplayed any of the defects that was said. Well I got it yesterdaay and so far so good! I love the style, the range is good but I have to be careful of walls lol. Only issue is that it hurts my ears slightly when I wear it. Truth be told I have a big head (full of brains) and that was a cause of discomfort. However, after some adjusting it felt much better though I have taken to wearing it around my neck and blasting it! All in all it seems like it was worth the purchase! After a few weeks I will update its progress.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Let me just say that I saw a trailer for this film several months ago, and ever since then I have been trying to track this film down or at least ascertain when it would be coming out on either DVD or BluRay. Well, that time finally came and while it may NOT be a Domestic US release of the film I think for the time being this is the best we will be able to hope for.     The film is well above the stereotypical Toho fair of Godzilla, Mothra, or King Gidora and I was actually quite surprised when I saw the Toho logo pop up on the opening title cards for the film. This is a well thought out, executed, acted script and film and I don't think that I can extend it praises high enough to describe how well this film actually does. The effects are quite well executed, the acting is well above board, the soundtrack is orchestral and moving and the characters, at least in my experience, are ones that you can connect and care about and actually worry as to what will happen to them. The only issue that I can possibly have with this film is this: the plot of this film strongly mirrors/ if not completely retells the story of the animated film \\"Final Yamato\\" from 1983, with a few plot points changed here and there so as to make the film more dramatic.     As far as the DVD print goes, the film is very good quality, I would certainly have liked to purchase this film on BluRay, but being able to find a reasonably priced copy (at anything less than $50) at this time is not possible. The transfer is good, there are some issues I noticed where you can see where they went in to add the subtitles to the film you'll see the brief pause in the frame then it will jump back to play after the subtitles have been added. There are also issues at a couple points in the film where there will be characters talking but no subtitles to understand what is being said, but in some cases you can just guess what the character is saying and fill in the necessary dialogue yourself. These are really minor cosmetic issues in my opinion and as I said at this time it does not seem that there will be a domestic US release of this film, though I could be wrong, so for the time being we will have to settle for this reasonably priced foreign release that is an ALL region DVD.    So to break it down:  Acting=Excellent  Effects=Excellent  Soundtrack/Audio Effects=Excellent  DVD Transfer=Good (Subtitle Frame Problems Aside as well as missing Subtitles when characters are talking)  Plot=Good (As I said this is an almost direct retell/rework of the 1983 animated film \\"Final Yamato\\" but it does do a good job despite that and if you're not familiar with the source material i.e. the animated series and the films you can work around that)  Price Point=Excellent (As I said a FAIR price for this is $20 WITH S&H, while I would have liked to see it on BluRay the only ones available at time of this purchase are roughly $50 including S&H)    If you're a fan of science fiction, and a fan of Toho, a fan of anime, or a fan of Space Battleship Yamato, then I strongly recommend this film. It was an overall wonderful experience that I found myself drawn into to the point that at several points I cried while watching this film.    Once again Yamato has sailed into my heart and I couldn't be happier.     HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is an amazing calendar application, and has pretty well replaced the stock application in android. The widget is amazing and used every day.   However, I just looked at the android market, and noticed that it has had a few updates. Why have those not been updated on the Amazon market as well?
B00003CX95|5.0|Touching, epic tale. Beautiful scenery+Betrayel+Lust+Romance+Deceit+War+Sarcastic humor=Fantastic movie. I got my order from the seller quickly and watched the movie as soon as I pulled it from my mailbox. LOVE IT!
B002N8A14M|2.0|The case itself is nice and would protect an ipod well.  However, I use Klipsch headphones and the input doesn't not fit into the ipod while the case is on.  The opening on the bottom of the case is not wide enough on the end to allow the headphone jack to fit which renders the case all but useless for me.  As long as the jack for the head phones is no bigger than the cord itself would not be a problem.  If you have any type of custom head phones chances are they won't work with this case.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This product does not include the original star wars trilogy, but is rather an accumumlation of unforgivable changes from 1997, 2004, and 2011 that serve to ruin classic films.    From what I have read and clips I have watched, Greedo still shoots first, terrible looking cgi aliens are jammed in or replace classic characters, boba fett has a different voice, vader looks like episode III anakin without a helmet and as a ghost...  Before you do something silly and buy this set, please check out Obi-Wan's new krayt dragon call and Vader's new line of \\"No... NOOOOOOOOOOO\\" at the climax of episode VI... Think long and hard about whether George Lucas deserves any of your money.        I will be happy to buy the star wars films of the 1970's and 1980's if they are ever released, but I will not spend money on this garbage.    I encourage all real star wars fans to avoid this product and give it a one star review.

Colleen Patrick-Goudreau continues to lead the way in compassionate living, and I so appreciate her intention to educate us on how easy and abundant a vegan lifestyle can be with this dedicated book on baking.  I am really excited to bake some yummy vegan treats for my loved ones, friends and colleagues!
0756405890|1.0|It could have been so good. the plot is good. The character Kowte the magician is good but it could have been grand.<br /><br />I just dont understand why The hero and his two friends and a girl friend keeps talking everyday endlessly for no reason, plot goes no where and still they meet everyday and talk,talk, talk and just keep talking all day long, and on without any conclusions just keep talking, talking and more talking.<br /><br />MORALE : There was a Magician called Kwote and he keeps talking with everyone he meets. so sad.
B0047HOXGY|5.0|Although Helloween has been a band with many peaks and valleys, this is a surprising high point. Rock solid melodic Speed metal from the band that defines the genre, if not introduced it to the masses.    It is not odd to see a band tie some newer material (\\"Who IS Mr. Madman\\"), to older beloved material (\\"The perfect Gentleman\\").  But to see a new song (\\"Where the Sinners Go\\"), linked to material condemned as some as it's worst (\\"When the Sinner\\" from the critically and commercially panned 1993 disc \\"Chameleon\\"), takes a level of self mocking that has kept Helloween free to stretch it's creative legs for almost 3 decades now.    This disc is just incredibly solid from beginning to end. While the hardest track \\"Are You Metal?\\", may not be as great as \\"Paint A New World\\" from 2007's \\"Gambling with the Devil\\", there is no weak links to be found in all 13 tracks.  Even the power ballad (and groan inducing titled) \\"The Smile of the Sun\\", comes off as insightful and surprisingly strong.    For those looking for a comparison, I would have to say it compares favorably to \\"The Time of the Oath\\" in both scope and success.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I almost gave up on this book around the 20% mark, which would have been a real shame because there's one hell of a good story here. The reason I almost set it aside is because this book is too perfectly aligned with my interests and it assumes the reader doesn't know what a lot of the things referenced will be. For most people, I'm sure the detailed descriptions of things like the Tomb Of Horrors, interactive fiction and obscure Atari cartridge promotions will be welcome. For an uber-nerd such as myself with a habit of frequently mining Wikipedia for trivia on the most arcane of topics, it was tough to slog through. For the most part though those descriptive passages are done by the midway point, and the book's story shines through.    And it is a great story. It's a futuristic Willy Wonka with the greatest scavenger hunt ever conceived, crossed with D&D, Anime, Cyberpunk and references to all manner of marvelous things from the 80's. The majority of the story takes place inside a massive virtual reality MMO called the OASIS, where anything is possible. Outside the OASIS the story isn't so pretty - Cline details an all too possible future where the majority of humanity is hungry, poor and constantly in danger. The portions of the novel that dealt with goings on in the OASIS and particularly the contest that forms the central story of the book were what really drove the plot and with certain key exceptions, outshone what happened in reality.    The one major complaint I had with the book, and what kept it out of five star territory, was the story's main villain. He's completely and totally evil, in a way that I found to be completely unbelievable. Cline doesn't manage to provide any insight into any sort of actual human motivation for his actions and we're never given any indication that he's anything but a soulless corporate operative. On top of that, he also takes actions that are the complete opposite of what a truly smart adversary would do in some of the situations presented in the book. A black hat who is only there to get in the main character's way? That I can live with. But a stupid villain is just unforgivable.    Don't let that stop you from trying this out though - the book is a lot of fun, and the main characters are people you'll really enjoy reading about. This book is a special treat for anyone who grew up during the 80's as I did, as there are all kinds of references to things both large and small you're sure to remember.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I found this to be an excellent account of what it was like for the average GI fighting in WWII.  It is no wonder so many of our veterans do not what to discuss their battle experiences.  EB Sledge is to be commended for being able to go back into his painful past and give us this outstandig account.  My own father fought in the Pacific, 3 purple hearts and 3 bronze stars.  He only talked once about his experiences to me, and that very briefly. He was an infantry 1st Lt.  25 years after the end of the war, he said he keeps seeing pictures of the men in his company who died and he keeps thinking what he could have done to save them.  There are tens of thousands of our veteran like this.  Sledge's book is a tribute to them all.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This is exactly what I needed to connect the digital audio out of my PS3 to the analog input of my old integrated amp/receiver.<br /><br />There's not too much to say... it just works, like you'd expect it to.<br /><br />However, I had originally tried connecting the digital output of my TV (a Toshiba 40 inch 1080p) to this unit, and it worked fine most of the time, but every once in a while (while switching sources) there would be some persistent digital noise (loud clicking), which would only go away if I turned the TV off and on again.<br /><br />I can't say for sure if this is an issue with the Toshiba TVs digital out, or an issue with this converter, but it's something to think about if you were planning on using this specific combination. Since my cable box is my only other source, and it has an analog out, I just plugged that into the receiver directly and plugged the PS3 into this converter directly, and I haven't heard any clicking since. Now I just leave it on and I never have to think about it anymore - it's as if the PS3 had an actual analog out.

0007250916|5.0|This is an incrediably well-written medical mystery tale that also happens to be true!  There is a great cast of characters that humanize the research portions of the book.

At the end I really hoped that the \\"who done it\\" portion could have been solved...
B000000OAN|5.0|...doesn't really matter. There's a lot of variety and value in this album. First off, you have the opening track \\"Death On Two Legs\\". It is pretty much a Post-Punk song, but before that genre was imagined. \\"You're My Best Friend\\" is a good old-fashioned piano dance song. \\"39\\" is probably best described as Brian May, the guitarist for this band said in the 2005 special, \\"Queen And The Making Of A Night At The Opera\\". I quote: \\"Well it started out like \\"Oh, we like science fiction, let's make a science fiction song\\" and then we started playing the instruments and it came out Folk Rock\\". \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\" sounds like a Def Leppard Nascar jam. And of course, there's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". What needs to be said about that song??? Nothing. And then, there's 7 more good songs. This is the kind of album that is epic when it tries to be and also, just plain great when it's not trying to be anything in particular. Queen were-I mean are-the greatest experimental Rock group ever and one of the best Rock groups, period.
B005HNMPBM|4.0|Having not followed the various forms of the Marvel Comics X MEN series except for a glance at Wolverine can be beneficial in watching this Prequel.  The fantasy is explained rather coherently - mutants have developed and must be undercover for their own safety until leaders emerge, young lads from the year 1944 struggling with their peculiar identity until something pushes them to the point of taking advantage of their supernatural powers and they become committed to gathering all the other mutants together as a positive force by the time they reach adulthood. Or as the PR piece states it 'Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.'<br /><br />James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lensherr and the mutants the gather around them include Jennifer Lawrence, Lucas Till, Nicholas Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones, Edi Gathegi, &Aacute;lex Gonz&aacute;lez, and even a quick peek at Hugh Jackman.  The year switches to 1962 when Russia and the USA were coming close to nuclear war so of course the mutants fight for the end of the attempt while another set of bad mutants under the leadership of Kevin Bacon and January Jones and Jason Flemyng et al face off battling powers of telecommunication and various forms of super human acts an by the end of the film the 'together boys' - Charles and Erik have become Professor X and Magneto.  Doting the over two hour long landscape are appearances by Rose Byrne playing the love interest and Oliver Platt simply called the Man in Black.  it is a game of subterfuge as well as a gradually coming to terms with being a mutant that keeps the ball rolling to a rather spectacularly staged battle scene as the Russian missiles are making their way toward Cuba and the United States.<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn directs the screenplay written by no fewer than 6 writers ad there are some impressive special effects demonstrated as the characteristics of each of the mutants.  Entertaining, yes, and it stands alone well enough so that those of us who have not seen the other installments in the series  can enjoy it as a 'beginning'.

B000002WPI|5.0|Not sure how some of these retard reviewers can give this album less than 5 stars. It's a five star album period. Most of these guys probably only heard this album within the last year or something. This was the GOLDEN ERA of hip hop and WU-TANG was on everyone's list with the new songs they created and the samples they were using. Add those beats with great lyrics and that's why this album is a pure classic. These were the days when every rap artist was unique and sounded different.

0240815807|5.0|I've read this book three times now, and I keep getting more and more out of it. I had already set up my home recording studio before I read the book. I had done some things right - but there were a number of things wrong, poorly or not done at all.  This book filled in the gaps for me.<br /><br />What made this book useful to me is it takes you though everything from the physical prep of the recording space to the final mix. It does it in a logical order, and is careful to \\"connect the dots\\" from one topic to another. I think a book like this is needed; even though there are lots of web articles and you tube videos about home recording, they are disconnected.  This book helped pull that together for me.
B004132HZS|5.0|Its a great new series.  Everything you love about Sherlock Holms set in present day London.  Its witty, fun and full of intregue and adventure. The acting is fanstatic and the stories have great twists and turns.

B003R0LBVW|2.0|By the half-way mark I found myself only interested in continuing to read the novel in order to find out whether the main characters would all commit adultery...as the author sets up the story.  For the author human freedom apparently unleashes only moral depravity, chaos, and major life disappoints. Is he damning American's cultural belief in freedom? Blah blah blah. Eventually, I just gave up on reading. The novel really just rambles for its length and one isn't particularly interested in any of the characters, mostly just repulsed by them. REALLY repulsed by ALL of the them. It sort of makes you want to be a misanthrope.    The novel starts out similar to The Corrections--the exploration of a dysfunctional Midwestern family. Several of the character archetypes in The Corrections are also present here, although in some instances they are changed from major characters to minor characters.
B005KWL2IW|3.0|I've waited a long time for some new Anthrax. While I was always a fan of the band I was never much into Joey Belladonna's style, and much preferred John Bush. But I have to say that Joey's vocal performance on this album was a pleasant surprise; lot's of lower register and little of the weak falsetto he used to do. That said I find the music doesn't cover a lot of new ground here. Like a few of the reviews I've read, I have to agree that most of the material sounds like left over tracks from Persistence of Time and State of Euphoria, and there's not much here that stands out as being one of the great Anthrax songs. A solid effort for sure, but I don't think I'll be listening to this one all that much.

It's great when youre on the go or waiting for an appointment and just want to read a little instead of staring outside and getting bored. I love it.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Can't see the floor?...are you serious. Tons of reviews from reputable sources only to find they were all in on this scam.

B005HG4C4C|2.0|I have been rooting for these very talented and capable guys to return with a strong effort as good as SFAM, I&W, or side 2 of SDOIT (the piece beginning with an orchestral flair)for a long time.  Those albums were GREAT, because the songs were terrific, for the most part, AND the virtuosity was simply icing on the cake.  It seemed each successive release up to and including SDOIT saw this band steadily delivering the goods, with a few exceptions.  NOT THE CASE HERE.  On this one, the players' performances are all great, including newly anointed drummer Mike Mangini, but there is an overwhelming absence of good songs.  Throughout this release there are many familiar and expected riffs and themes harkening back to prior releases, but this makes things really boring, and there are a few real duds here too.      The Special Edition with DVD of the drummer tryouts was a real treat for the fans and well done.  Great glimpse into the band we all love.    Bottom line, this release lacks good songs, songs that drive and inspire, and for me that is a show-stopper, regardless of the chops no doubt displayed here.  This band needs a fresh start, a different direction, perhaps a producer who can get involved early on in the creative process and lead them to new horizons.    Sorry guys, I know you can do better.......
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Ok. I just want to say that I am writing this for my love of the movies. I know there has been a big debate over the (new versions) of these films. These were my favorite films as a kid growing up, and still are today. But I am torn as individual watching them. I agree with those who want there kids to see the original release of these films, because thats what they are original and they are the reason sci-fi and film history has been changed. But to note that (special edition) of these films released in 1997 were improving certain aspects of the films they were a different cut. Therefore this complete saga contains the prequel trilogy with modifications and the special edition trilogy with modifications. Just wanted to clarify for those who have had a mental debate over to buy it or not. Now for the pluses: A. its blu ray and hi def so picture and sound are great. B. 40+ hours of special features unseen. C. All 6 films together for the first time. So I have said what I have been feeling and I hope this helps at least one person to hear the truth rather than a bad review for someone who didn't buy it.
B003L77GRO|5.0|As always another great season. The writers of this show keep surprising me with the development of Dexter's character. With every season he seems more and more \\"normal\\" somehow, making it a great internal dilemma to be on a serial killer's side.

I see that it looks easy to overclock, however I will wait.
B0055B0MIO|2.0|They were good on their first 2 albums, Ascendancy was a good album but it sounded like a generic metalcore band.<br />After that they changed into something much better and were moving forward, their music was improving.<br />Crusade was great, they don't have to scream the entire time to make a good album.<br />I thought Shogun was amazing and it's still their best album to date because it had a good mix of screaming and clean vocals.<br />They could be making something more original and better than another metalcore band but they have to be generic to sell more records and get played on the radio.
B004EPZ070|5.0|This is a great movie!! Its hilarious and moves pretty quickly. It may be wrong to love it but I do!!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I will start by telling anyone looking to these reviews as a decision maker to buy or not buy this set needs, at this point, to read them from 'Newest First'.  You will note that 90% or better of the reviews written since we have had this product ACTUALLY in hand are 4 or 5 star reviews and for Very Good reason.  The HD upgrades these movies have gotten (especially IV, V, VI) are INCREDIBLE.  It is like watching the film for the first time or better.  The resolution has not only been enhanced but the colors and sound bring the films to life like never before in home viewing.  All the people who have been complaining based mostly on the \\"Noooooooo\\" in ROTJ are missing out on seeing their favorite movie in stunning HD.  I give this set 4 stars only because as an \\"ultimate\\" set(which to be fair, it is not billed as such) I wish they would have included more the the past \\"making of\\" docs and the original theatrical versions cleaned up for blu-ray also.  I also thought the parody feature is lacking some of the best and early parodies like \\"Hardware Wars\\" and others I have seen over the years, but it is still very funny.  While I agree changing some of the dialog (like the \\"Noooooo) and changing the Obi-Wan's dragon call at the sand people are not 'improvements' I think that a lot of the effect changes are cool and certainly don't effect the movie watching experience.  I will never forget the originals but I am so happy I did not let it stop me from buying this Awesome set, and you should not let it stop you either!

B001N26GFM|5.0|By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com<br /><br />This emotionally wrenching film deserves 10 Stars. Changed my life forever and a major part of my life was spent in motion pictures. The movie will change your life everlastingly too if you open your heart to a simple fictional story of a little German boy who befriends a Jewish boy through the barbed wire fence of a concentration camp.<br /><br />My heart was ripped out, but I will be a more loving, gracious, forgiving person for having seen this sensitive and also horrifying motion picture. YES, as the reviewers have said: It is &#34;historically inaccurate to the extreme.&#34; &#34;It is total fiction.&#34; It is &#34;ridiculously contrived.&#34; It is &#34;all too absurd.&#34; It is &#34;hard to swallow.&#34; It is &#34;forced and artificial,&#34; and &#34;The actors have British accents instead of German.&#34;<br /><br />One critic posed the question, &#34;Did Bruno's father in the end get what he deserved?&#34; Such moralizing and such criticisms of the film make me wonder if those viewers of the film missed the unanswered questions of the Holocaust. How could it happen? How could so many good people allow it to happen?<br /><br />The most insightful reviewer said, &#34;What is appalling to me is reading all of the one-star reviews. I now see how the holocaust (shoah) could have taken place. All that is necessary is for a nation to be composed of and ruled by people with no feelings, bereft of human compassion and sensitivity, just like several of the reviewers here.&#34;<br /><br />Great Art (even fiction) reveals to us &#34;things as they really are&#34;. Through Bruno and his mother, we see through the eyes of Germans who were totally innocent until they came face to face with with the horrors of the &#34;final solution.&#34; Most Europeans accepted the deportation of Jews, some not knowing what would be their fate and others even accepting the fate of Jews because it was so easy to blame Jewish Merchants and Jewish Bankers for World War 1 and for the collapse of the German economy. Savings were totally wiped out. It took 22 million German Marks to buy a loaf of bread. Though not the same, we can understand today how easy it would be to blame all Muslims for 9/11.<br /><br />Through Bruno's sister we see how easy it was to indoctrinate an entire nation of German youth. A notable exception was the 17 year old Mormon boy, Helmuth Hubener, that resisted the 3rd Reich and was sentenced by a German Court for treason and beheaded by guillotine on October 27, 1942 at Pl&ouml;tzensee Prison in Berlin. (See his true story on Wikipedia!)<br /><br />In this motion picture we see and learn how good men, good fathers, and good soldiers, putting military obedience ahead of even their mothers, wives and children, directed and became the executioners of millions of Jews. Even still photos of all the corpses, and eye witness accounts of the Holocaust do not give us that understanding.<br /><br />Last, by identifying and seeing through the eyes of an innocent child, we learn from the film what it was like to be ordered into the gas chambers. No other motion picture, book, or document has ever, or ever will, capture that experience or the depth of those feelings like the film &#34;Boy in the Stripped Pajamas.&#34;<br /><br />Would that each viewer could become as a little child (Matthew 18:3), like Bruno, not judgmental, and not critical.  The Holocaust (like the film) is hard to believe but the gas chambers to kill and the ovens to burn bodies were real. I've seen them with my own eyes. I've been in the house made sacred by Anne Frank. My next door neighbor was one of the first U.S. soldiers into the Dachau Prison Camp, and my neighbor across the street served in the Danish Underground.<br /><br />Let us resolve, NEVER AGAIN, not just in five languages, but in all the languages of the world. There were those in Germany that truly did not know what was happening to the Jews, butno other film answers for me how an entire nation could be led by one man to kill, or accept the killing, of so many. I will be forever haunted by the words, &#34;If he had been your Fuehrer, you would have followed him too.&#34;  Although it is fiction, &#34;Boy In the Striped Pajamas&#34; reveals not the historical truth, but the TRUTH of Nazi Germany as it was.<br /><br />FOOTNOTE: What follows regarding man's inhumanity to man is presented because HISTORY WILL REPEAT ITSELF IF WE DO NOT KNOW AND UNDERSTAND IT!<br /><br />People today need to know that Hitler did not invent anti-semitism. It began with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and has never ceased. It is mind boggling to learn that throughout history there have been innumerable and hundreds of attempts in many countries to kill all of the Jews. (See &#34;Pogroms&#34; on Google, then read the Wikipedia account.)<br /><br />I was shocked beyond belief to read Martin Luther's anti Jewish sentiments published in 1543 (See &#34;On the Jews and Their Lies - Wikipedia&#34;  Luther's feelings about the Jews and what should be done to them were as vile and reprehensible, as any words spoken in Nazi Germany. Indeed, Luther's document may have been the blueprint for the Nazi Holocaust.<br /><br />Seeing history repeat itself so many times makes us wonder if there is hope to save the Jews and the world from so much hate and killing. Pope John VI in 1965 issued his historic &#34;Nostra Aetate&#34; that expresses understanding, forgiveness and love for the Jews and for all religions.  Pope John Paul VI states in this history changing document that the death of Christ, &#34;cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today.&#34; The age old doctrine behind all of the Pogroms which stated that &#34;all Jews, past, present, and future were collectively guilty of the Crucifixion of Jesus,&#34; was officially revoked by a Catholic Pope! EVERYONE should read entirely the &#34;Nostra Aetate&#34; which is one of the most important documents in the history of mankind (It takes just a few minutes to read and can be found on Google)! The current Pope Benedict XVI who was forced to join the Hitler Youth as a child in Nazi Germany (in two books) has made a sweeping exoneration of the Jewish people for the death of Jesus Christ. There is hope for the world! These are history changing actions by two Catholic Popes. It would be well for everyone who wants the world to be a better place to thank Catholics for Pope John VI and Pope Benedict XVI.<br /><br />We must be ever vigilant against condemning another. &#34;Therefore thou art inexcusable, Oh man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself: for thou that judgest doest the same things.&#34; (Romans 2:1). Jews who migrated to Israel after World War 11, themselves committed a Holocaust of the Palestinian people. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed and nearly one million were forced into refugee camps. &#34;This is my Land. God gave this Land to me,&#34; was not justification for killing the Palestinians!<br /><br />There is one notable voice in the Middle East that documents the atrocities by all three sides and seeks to reconcile Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Elias Chacour, a Palestinian Melkite Christian Priest has established a school in Ibillon near Galilee where Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Druze study side by side. More important than their secular studies, students learn to love their enemies. To bring peace to the Holy Land, Elias Chacour's book &#34;BLOOD BROTHERS&#34; SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR EVERYONE.<br /><br />Two unsung and less known heroes of the Holocaust are Irena Sendler and Raoul Wallenberg. Their stories should be told along with the stories of Oskar Schindler, Corrie Ten Boom, and Anne Frank. Irena Sendler was a Polish Catholic Social worker who saved more than 2500 Jewish Children from the Warsaw Ghetto. If you have any interest in the Holocaust, YOU MUST READ the inspiring story &#34;Life in A Jar - The Irena Sendler Story&#34; on Google. In 2007 when Sendler was still alive, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Al Gore received the prize that year instead.<br /><br />Raoul Wallenberg is credited with saving near 100,000 Hungarian Jews. At the peril of his life he defied the Nazis innumerable times.

EVERY reviewer gave the book 5 stars! Unlike Schindler, Wallenberg had only his humanity and no ulterior motive in saving Jews; and he probably saved more Jews than Schindler.<br /><br />Few Motion pictures can compare to the book.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|Let me first say I don't care about the additions they've made, I don't care if Darth Vader yells No!  I'm a Hollywood colorist and after watching A Phantom Menace, all I can say is Yetch!. It's painfully obvious this movie wasn't re-color timed for the Blu Ray release. So many of the scenes had a very disturbing magenta hue in the blacks and were otherwise so off that I found the movie almost unwatchable. In one cut the colors were great and then the next scene people's skin and hair color was suddenly different.  I'm going to have to find a previous version of this movie to see if the same issues are there also.  I'll watch episode 2 tonight and see if that's as bad. If so I'll see if I can return it and if not probably throw it away.

1898929246|5.0|I bought this to help me plan out our London trip. I wanted to see where we'd be visiting, and where it made the most sense to stay. For example, is it worth the extra money to stay in the more expensive areas? For me, that's a yes if you are within walking distance of most of the places you want to see. This guide helped me plan our trip in advance. Plus, compact enough to fit in my purse while traveling.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|I love Star Wars.  I don't dig all the changes.  Like many, there are some that just make me cringe.  Yes, Han shot first. That said, there were things about the unaltered original trilogy that made (and make) me cringe also, like those dang Ewoks.  Never bought that the Empire was taken down by a bunch of walking stuffed animals.  And just how the heck did they get those giant logs hoisted into the trees? Yes, I would give anything to make stormtroopers as fast, accurate and deadly as their Prequel trilogy counterparts.  And to have the Ewoks (since there's no getting rid of them now) supplemented by an Endorian tribe of Wookies.  Now there's your epic battle.  I can just hear Chewie letting out a roar to signal his people to attack.  That would've been awesome.  But I digress.  Like I said, I'm a fan.  I will always love Star Wars, and just like any true love relationship, you have to take the warts and all.    That said, the Blu-ray edition of the complete films is a mixed bag.  For me, the biggest surprise is how unbelievably fake the prequel trilogy looks now in high definition, particularly Revenge of the Sith.  Don't get me wrong, the CG creatures and backdrops are truly jaw-dropping.  And live actors and set pieces look great too.  But it's the combining of the two that is painfully obvious.  It looks like really bad compositing now.  As if the whole film were just somehow unfinished.  Did you ever watch the new 'V' before it was cancelled on ABC?  You know when they were on the ship, and how obvious it was they were just standing in front of a green-screen?  Yeah, this is worse.  It looked great in theaters, and even on DVD, but sometimes I think high-definition can take away from a film.      Still, I love the set as a whole.  Because when you're a fan, you're a fan.  Love the extras, love the fact that the OT trilogy has NEVER looked this good before.

B0055S348W|5.0|Great app. worth every penny. easy to set up and use. highly recommend. I have an EVO touch it works perfectly on. a must have.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|The build of the actual device seems kinda shoddy.  It certainly could have been constructed better.  The biggest reason I purchased it was for the UV light, which by the way is awesome.  Sure it's only one LED and it's somewhat dim for a torch but it works great for it's intended purposes of revealing phosphorescent materials at a close range.  You have to be about 8 centimeters away to get a good image of what you wrote from the UV nib but it's acceptable.<br /><br />If you are a Doctor Who fan I'd certainly recommend this because it is actually fun and useful...  Wanna see a scorpion in your yard glow so you can evade it?  Pull out the sonic screwdriver.  Curious about the illegitimate conditions of your sheets at the hotel? Again, it's sonic screwdriver time.  Going to a rave?  Make it a sonic one.  I can't seem to stop myself from using it spontaneously when it is available at arms reach despite having no adequate reason to do so.  Again, another plus.<br /><br />The sound is great just like in the show.  I even used the sound on one occasion to partially awaken my snoring roommate to subside the dreadful sounds.  Not that this is guaranteed to work all the time...<br /><br />converting it to it's two modes is a bit lame though.  The sliding switch cover tends to come off too easily and when settled in it's final position the lock tends to slip around impeding the use of the light's activation button.  The nibs seem to fall out occasionally if they are bumped.  They should have been screwed in as opposed to snugly seated.  This makes removing the cap without taking the nib with it a bit arduous but doable.  Also, pen nib?  who really cares about that?  It's all about the UV ink.<br /><br />Practical Utility: 90%<br />Design: 85%<br />Quality: 70%<br />Collector's Value: 90%<br /><br />Biggest pro: It has an ultraviolet LED!!! Though, it is not true UV so some things might not glow as expected.<br />Biggest con: It's not a real working sonic screwdriver... Just teasing. Actually, it's the semi-shoddy construction

B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is the first Star Wars set I've decided I can't buy. With movies like Blade Runner and Apocalypse Now offer both versions (5 in Blade Runners case) to appease fans, it seems beyond ridiculous (in fact...quite literally SAD) that the original versions of these films can't be provided for this release. Providing \\"Special Edition\\" versions is interesting and maybe even kind of fun, but only if you can view the original unaltered version. I'll buy Star Wars on Blu-Ray whenever they actually release Star Wars on Blu-Ray.
B015AJOKFG|5.0|The films on blu-ray look great.  We get it.  These aren't the &quot;original&quot; versions.  They'll probably never be released.  George Lucas himself refused to give up an unaltered film print of the 1977 movie when it was elected by congress to be preserved forever in the National Film Registry.  He offered them a digital film print of the 1997 special edition, which they rightfully refused.  Go search for a torrent of the Harmy remastered versions online.  I am a massive Star Wars fan, yet I have an open mind.  Many people are upset that George Lucas &quot;tampers&quot; with his films.  While that's obviously true, here's a serious question that all the non-nitpickers are dying to have answered...  How do any of the changes that have been made, big or small, actually negatively affect the actual storyline of the 3 original movies?  I'm talking physical complete scene alterations.  There aren't any because none occur.  Okay, we see Jabba The Hutt early.  So what!!!  Greedo gets a shot in.  So what!!!  Darth Vader says NOOOOO!!!  Oh my, the world is coming to an end.  So what!!!

B004CLYKLI|3.0|I just finished reading the kindle edition of Amy Chua's \\"Battle Hymn of a Tiger Mother\\" book.  I was not surprised to read the many painful scenes of an overambitious mother parenting her daughters to become overachievers at all costs.  I already read the press describing the book, specifically the WSJ article.  No, what surprised me was the understanding I felt for the author, not that I agree with her methods.  Her own strict upbringing contributed a great deal to her parenting ideas.  I do get the sense she means well for her children and family.  Most of all I think she realizes her methods had a deadly price to pay that was not worth paying, and she admits her mistake. When her youngest daughter showed signs of cracking under the intense pressure to become the perfect concert violinist, the author realized her parenting methods were producing bad results.  Namely she was driving her children crazy.  They probably would have had nervous breakdowns if she continued the way she did.  It was only when things got really bad that she realized she had to pull back, that she was killing her children's spirits.  I wish she had realized it sooner.  I mean, c'mon.  Children are not robots. You can't make them practice music for 5-6 hours every day, include schoolwork with the expectation of all A's, deny them sleepovers at friends homes, and constantly tell them whatever they do is not good enough unless they are top of their class without some backlash. If anything, this book serves to show that even when your intentions are good and your aim is noble, it's just wrong to treat kids with such single-minded inflexible pressure to be the best, not their best, but the best in their class regardless of anything else.

B003Y5H5AG|3.0|The big screen version of \\"The Smurfs,\\" creation of Pierre Culliford, otherwise known as Peyo, centers on the adventures of the six Smurfs, who are sucked into a vortex while being chased by the evil wizard Gargamel (Hank Azaria). The Smurfs - Brainy, Clumsy, Grouchy, Gutsy, Papa Smurf and Smurfette - find themselves in modern-day New York City, where they start to live with a married couple Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and Grace (Jayma Mays).     But maybe summering the thin plot is pointless. All you have to know is 1) the film is helmed by Raja Gosnell, director of two \\"Scooby-Doo\\" films and \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\"; 2) Hank Azaria as a real-life actor plays a bumbling sorcerer Gargamel, overacting with a heavy make-up. He is very funny - or very annoying, depending on the viewer's mood; 3) Gargamel's cat Azrael steals every scene even from Smurfs.    Having seen two \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" movies and two \\"Garfield\\" movies, we are no longer impressed with the combination of CG/live-action characters. Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation did a decent job, but some use of CGI (especially on the cat) is a bit conspicuous.    \\"The Smurfs\\" is a mindless family film that is farcical and silly. Jokes are obvious, sometimes low-brow and even self-aware, just like the \\"Scooby-Doo\\" film I saw ten years ago. Not exactly a bad thing, though the film needs something more.
1451629184|5.0|This book is a very fast read.  It is 3/4 the size of a normal sheet of paper in dimension.  It has 273 pages, was published this year - shortly after Jaycee Dugard was rescued.  I only encourage those who have regard for their neighbors to read it.  Those who only care about being entertained and live in an unrealistic \\"blob\\" should not read it.      Jaycee allows this book to speak from her inner child - many notes which she had written as a child were actually the factual basis of this book.  It brings awareness to the public in general, as well as just allows the reader to simply read a true story.  I personally prefer nonfiction over fiction.  It is written in a way that allows for fast reading - I finished it in just a few days' time, reading it at night.      The introduction provides the reader the opportunity to understand the writer's homesetting just before her life was stolen - when she was abducted.  For professionals, the thoughts she shares are invaluable as far as assessing what a child thinks during those times - in terms of treatment, prevention,and enforcement.  I think this book should be read by all those who are in related professions that deal with child abductions.      There are some areas which are graphically depicted in a descriptive way.  For those of you who would not want to learn what an innocent, loving child has gone through (only in part, for I am very sure it was toned-down), I say simply, this book is not for you.  Don't read it and complain about it - that it didn't entertain you enough.  For those of you who want to find out what a little girl has lived through (and many victims like this do not survive through this), then I say, join me as one who truly feels that in a short time I have made myself a better person by reading it.     This book is a snapshot of what abducted children go through - many of whom die.  This is a snapshot of the mind of a rapist - the mind of a child molester - the behavior of someone who uses tricksupon tricks to get his own way - the complacency of probation which, at times, cares nothing but serving the world of crime and getting their paycheck at times - the complacency of the general public (from which, at times)who simply do not pay attention to what is going on around them.    She points no fingers, yet she of all people has the innate right to - she chooses not to, for she instinctively lives as a child who was born to love - that we learn to hate.  And this very fact brings tears to me as I read her book - and as I think of her.  That trait alone indeed makes her - her best therapist.  I am not discounting her need to have one, as long as the therapist does not manipulate her, but I am saying this young woman survived a most painful 18 years - and she did it with \\"the right stuff\\".      As she is recovering, she also deserves to re-process what she has gone through and I hope she continues to journal - for the sake of professionals and for her own sake - so she can heal from these 18 years without scarring her beautiful children.  Well, indeed they are scarred - yet they have a mom who is convicted with purpose in life.      I finished this book with more purpose in mine. Thank you, Jaycee.  You are a good girl.  You are a good mom.  Your real life has just begun.

B001ER4CNY|4.0|Fue, de nina, mi serie favorita y tenerla es revivir mi infancia.  Aunque la primera temporada es colorizada eso no altera su contenido.   Toda la serie es MARAVILLOSA.  La recomiendo.  La estrella que no les di es porque el empaque de los DVDs es impráctico  (viene en una \\"sinfonía\\" de cartón que se abre y se caen los DVDs al piso, eso me sucedió).  Hay que cambiarlos a cajas plásticas para preservarlos.  La botella debería ser, al menos, de plástico (viene de cartón).

0897502027|5.0|Well I have to say that the publishers once again did a very fine job on updating another and perhaps the definitive work by the late Bruce Lee. However, unlike their update of [[ASIN:0897501705 Bruce Lee's Fighting Method: The Complete Edition]], this edition is not in hardback, but in trade paperback. Not that it is necessarily a bad thing, but it would have been nice to see it in hardback.<br /><br />Now you are probably asking yourself, \\"Do I really need to spend the money purchasing an updated and expanded edition since I already have the original?\\" And for that I would have to definitely say YES, and don't wait BUY IT NOW! Now I am not going to go into a review of the contents of this book as that has been done quite thoroughly in the reviews of the original version. Instead I am going to point out the reasons why you should own this updated and expanded edition. And here are the reasons why:<br /><br />1. The organization and layout of the material, although almost identical to the original, is much better and more clearly defined.<br /><br />2. The illustrations are much clearer and larger than the original version<br /><br />3. The added commentaries by Linda Lee Caldwell and Bruce's daughter Shannon, as well as, a number of noted martial artists are quite interesting and add insight to Bruce's work.<br /><br />4. If you look at an original version and this one, you can see material that has been added throughout.<br /><br />5. The translations from Chinese to English is much more accurate.<br /><br />I highly recommend this updated and expanded edition along with [[ASIN:0897501705 Bruce Lee's Fighting Method: The Complete Edition]] and the following three books by Teri Tom, who is a devoted practitioner of Jeet Kune Do and very, very intelligent which can clearly be seen in her three books.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0804836302 The Straight Lead: The Core of Bruce Lee's Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0804839328 Jeet Kune Do: The Arsenal of Self-Expression]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:080483931X Martial Arts Nutrition: A Precision Guide to Fueling Your Fighting Edge]]<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVDs.]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:080483931X Martial Arts Nutrition: A Precision Guide to Fueling Your Fighting Edge]]<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVDs.

B003PBB4ME|1.0|Update nov-dec  Do not buy this. Customer service lied to me, said they recalled all defective units from amazon, with wrong tripod screws. Flat out lie. I told them to read recent reviews, and they can see that is not true. Then they quit responding to me.  I see that they also would not respond to others. Intentional deceptive company!,  Update oct 5,  I see by current reviews that Amazon is STILL shipping defective units, with NO tripod screw. I would actually order another one if these, if they would fix it.  ------------------------------------------------------------  This is a nice handle, but it still has the same manufactor defect as mentioned by other reviewers, that being they installed the incorrect mount on bottom of unit. This mount does not contain a threaded nut, so you can NOT mount the unit on a tripod. And the nut is non-removable, so it can't be fixed. I have read where ALL current stock is incorrect and manufacturer is trying to replace. But currently, Amazon just keeps shipping defective stock. I returned mine. I will reorder another when good stock arrives.  This will be a great product when new stock arrives, I will adjust my review to 5 star at that time.
B005HNMPBM|1.0|Too many characters muddle this lame attempt at a prequel.  There is hardly any action, but lots of scenes of teenage mutants being teens, which is boring unless you are a teen. Providing a back story (if you can call it a story) for so many of the characters makes the movie lose any focus. It follows in the vein of most movies these days, which have no plot and just jump around ADHD style from one pointless scene to another.  The movie has no focus, and therefore is completely boring.  Many flaws abound  - for example, the Professor X as a child is the same age as the blue chick, but then when they grow up, he's in his 30's and she looks 16.  The main flaw is NOTHING HAPPENS.  Why don't movies ever have a plot anymore?  The acting is pretty bad too.  Magneto is the most interesting of the kids, but he's an awful actor.  When displaying intense rage, he looks the same as every other scene.  I only watched this movie since Wolverine was such a great film, but it is truly awful.  Painfully boring!
0688152023|1.0|This book is OK if you are not very active. If your routine includes Pilates, power or Bikram yoga, and perhaps free weight exercises then this book is a complete waste of your money. I was expecting to see the deep stretches that ballet dancers do but this book is a commercial venture target to the general public. The \\"NYC Ballet\\" in the title is just to enhance the marketing appeal of the product. Do not be fooled by it. For example: I was very disappointed in discovering that the stretch pictured in the front cover is _never_ described, it is just an image they use in the cover and also in the introduction. Do not get me wrong, the routine in the book is good but if you are an athlete or a serious dancer you (like I did) are just wasting money buying this product

Mine at least had no Prologue or Page 1 and when opened, it begins on Page 57.! !  I hope this was a flaw just in one box or a lot of buyers will have to  SEND back to Amazon.    Usually Amazon is perfect.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The three prequel movies looks at times like the muppet show. And the final prequel, in which Anakin finally turns to the dark side, is completely unconvincing. The original movies are, well, not the true originals. Not bad, but I would rather see the unaltered versions.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Having seen Star Wars on the big screen and on the most recent DVD release this version on BD is really a nice 'upgrade' to the series.    The older episodes are still clearly old with significant film grain to be seen (as would be expected) but the HD conversion brings new life to the films.  I think they did a very good job of balancing the use of new special effects with preserving the original look and feel of the work.    I know a lot of people are unhappy about some of the editing choices based on what I read here but for me this is an amazing update to a childhood classic.  And, a good value at less than $15 per episode not including the bonus material.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Es So COOl With thwe stuff and look...... Dey blink! NOOOOOO!!!   give him an academy award for best screw up in film history.
B004HWT6DO|4.0|It's probably not the best side of Mark but it definitely gives you a unique perspective of him. I know someone that went to school with him in Ardsley and they said he is definitely as arrogant as shown in the film, but I'm sure he's somewhat in the Asperger/autistic zone. But hey he used that trait and made himslef a billionaire so kudos to Mark!
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I'm tired of buying these same movies over and over. Videotape, DVD, Special Edition DVD, Blu Ray . . . how long will George Lucas continue milking this cow? I would prefer he leave the classics alone without fiddling with them, but he can feel free to completely alter the horrendously bad prequel movies. These original movies, in my mind, are the only true Star Wars movies. They're not perfect--Lucas tended to get carried away with the creatures, many of which looked cartoonish--but the basic story that is woven through these originals is perfectly laid out. What's interesting is that Lucas keeps altering these movies because he said the technology didn't exist when the originals were made, but that's not really why people love the movies. If that were the case, the prequels, which featured many special effects, would have a greater following.
0307279189|2.0|I couldn't agree more with another reviewer (Ultrunner). The portrayal of the runners and by extension, the running world, seems to me to be almost unbelievable. One minute someone's a hero. The next minute they're a jerk for some reason. Every time they open their mouth, it's a quip; a cuss; a smart-aleck response to something. It seems like every view expressed or situation described is extreme, one end or the other. There's no middle-of-the-road views given or situations described. Nothing normal about anybody or anything in this book. Is this the way these folks all are? Or is this some sort of supposedly \\"catchy\\" writing style? From memory, Zatopek is about the only person in the book who isn't full of one-liners, blurting out ultra-negative comments about somebody or something. One minute they're gorging themselves on food, the next they're nearly dead. I would hate to be in this author's world (in the extreme way he portrays it) or his mind.
B0055S348W|5.0|I wanted to print pictures from me phone for a while... This app let's me so it to a network printer, a wifi printer, google docs, or any computer with a printer using their software.   Yes its even worth 12.95.
B0050PYNN0|1.0|Considering Natalie Portman was in this film I really expected quite a bit more.  I am more than a little concervative in my views, but I can still enjoy a little levity and some offcolor humor.  This film had nothing to redeem it.  Incredibly vulgar and no values to impart at all.
0061367036|5.0|I was very happy with this purchase. It was in excellent condition and arrived on time. I had been looking for a cheap version of this book and I am very happy with what I found.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What more can really be said?  A fantastic page turner, all the characters are flawed, their motivations are understandable (even if you don't agree with them), hence making them feel \\"real\\".    No one in this book is innocent, things have to be done when your life is on the line, but how do you do that without becoming that which you hate?    Read on...
B003ZSJ212|5.0|800 1-star reviews and counting for the fanboys.  And it is true, Lucas is a tinkerer with no understanding of what makes his own movies appealing.  But seriously, once you watch this for 5 minutes, you'll forget all of that.  These blu-rays make your whole home theater investment worth the money.  They look and sound amazing.  This is what blu ray home entertainment is all about, you won't be disappointed.  See a complete review at blu-ray.com.  The negativity in these Amazon reviews are blowing this way out of proportion.  You haven't seen HD until you've seen Star Wars in HD.
B0009NSDCK|4.0|This film is so much action from beginning to an end i'll recommend this for all who loved watching action adventure film . The way how they did the shooting is so realistic
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Item was received just as described. Great condition, arrived early. I love this show and could not wait to get it; I was very pleased to receive it before the expected date.
0321701763|5.0|I have been attempting to teach myself Photoshop for about a year with little success.  I decided to take an online course through the local college and this book is the required text book.  It's only the third week but I've already learned a lot.  Besides the lessons in the book, there are also video lessons on the included cd.  These lessons are interesting, informative and fun.     One nice feature of these video lessons is the \\"Watch and Work\\" feature.  This feature allows you to follow along in Photoshop with what is going on in the video.  It reduces the size of the video window and keeps it in the forefront as you work in Photoshop.    Please be aware that you need Photoshop CS5 to do the lessons in the book and on the video.
B003Y5H542|1.0|I am really not quite sure what the writers of Rango were trying to accomplish - perhaps to introduce children to the seedier side of life through animated animals characters? This was not only a badly scripted movie but a movie not suited for children of any age.    The \\"jokes\\" - if one could call them that - were just plain raunchy.    <spoiler alert>   Here are two examples:    The naked, headless torso of a Barbie doll is seated next to Rango - he looks down and asks her/it, \\"Are those real?\\"    A mean and nasty gila-monster named Bad Bill comments, \\"I'm going to slice your face off and use it to wipe my unmentionables!\\"     Add to those gems the fact that the movie has a very wanton violent bent.    Add to that the fact that the story went absolutely no where - it was pointless.    Save your time and money and stay away from Rango.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I just recieved the blu rays today and after watching ROTS and New Hope - I wanted to throw my review out there. I poured over the reviews on here and actually thought about canceling my pre-order due to all the negative reaction so I wanted to put out what I think is a level headed review    Visually and sound wise the blu rays are great, especially ROTS, all huge improvement over the Standard Def DVDs. I would say the set is well worth the money. As someone who was born in 1972 and watched these movies for the first time when they came out - they blew me away. It was the reason I built a home theatre in my house and shelled out the money for a 1080p projector and these movies on blu ray on a wall size picture was worth all of it, I have been waiting for these on blu ray since blu ray came out-  probably like most people..these were the movies I wanted to see more than any other. Im not a fanboy or freaked out by the changes made to the original versions - while I think they absolutely suuuck, they dont ruin Star Wars for me. After listening to the commentary on ROTS by Lucas and others that worked on the prequels - you can tell why the prequels mostly sucked, Lucas and others on the prequels definitely fell in love with thier own believed self importance and infalibility as opposed to the originals where they did not know they were as smart and they now \\"know\\" they are and that probably explains why the originals weren't included  I agree that it would great to see the originals that I saw as a kid on blu ray and someday they probably will but I believe this set is well worth the money...I respect the people who refuse to buy this set due to the changes but I am happy I did and am loving seeing them on blu ray, im noticing things I never noticed before in the movies...
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I was very pleased with this item. I was in the middle of a Supernatural marathon and needed season 3; it showed up just in time for me to continue uninterrupted! Great condition, arrived early. Very happy.
B0016MJ6HY|2.0|This movie was both depressing and boring.  I love Norah Jones' music, but this has nothing to do with the music.  The characters are not very engaging, and all of them sad.
0307887960|5.0|This book is very well written, easy to understand and easy to follow. It works!  The author refers to actual cases that he's worked with and lays out in great detail just exactly what to expect at each phase.  I recomment this to anyone who is tired of dieting and getting no results or hates the food that is required by other plans to lose weight. This plan works with normal food purchases and recipes...nothing exotic or expensive and you don't starve yourself during the process, which ultimately leads to failure.  Thank you Dr. Dukan!
B0042SSO1I|5.0|CLASSIC INTERPRETATION, BEATIFUL SCENERY AND AS ALWAYS BBC IS THE VERY BEST IN QUALITY. IF YOU LIKE MAGIC AND TALES,THIS IS THE ONE
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This is a great a movie.  The quality is fantastic on blu Ray.  It's just like going to a movie theater.  Package has 2 discs.  1 disc is the movie, and the other is extras. I love this movie so I enjoyed the extras as well.  Very happy with the purchase.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|I originally watched this anime when it was on Anime on Demand earlier this year, and I watched it through both runs: the first in Japanese sub, and then in English dubbed. You have to buy this anime if you love zombies and science fiction/horror! The art style just pops off of the screen when you watch it in HD! I was impressed by the story, gore, and sexy body shots! (with some nice booby shots in the bathroom scene) It has something for everyone one to love! I do however feel as if the anime was cut short...hopefully this gets picked up for a second season once the manga goes on a bit further...here's to hoping for more! I am addicted! :)
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Purchased this as a birthday gift.  Warmly received and has already provided hours of laughter.  John Cleese at his finest!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|Wow ! this movie is awesome. I don`t normally watch romantic movies but this one for some reason i wanted to give it a try and Oh my God ! i really enjoyed watching it, i even watched it several times. It is very romantic, funny and realistic and i absolutely love the main actor, He was perfect in his role and he has those seductive and sexy glances. I wonder how he could manage to give the look or the glance of someone deeply in love when he`s looking at Rachel. And what i also learned about this movie is that something that`s really yours or belongs to you will always come back to you and that love is always stronger than anything.  Anyway I just love it. It is something worth watching.
0307477479|2.0|This book started out interestingly enough.  Enjoyed the descriptions of places I've been to in San Francisco.  then it just seemed to fall apart.  I read the whole thing, skimming some of the parts that were so boring, like the power point thing.  I absolutely do not understand the praise for this book.  Did I not 'get it'?  I don't know but I consider it a waste of time and wouldn't recommend to anyone.
B004LWZW42|1.0|Hmmm...  \\"Comics aren't necessarily for children.\\"  That's what the comic book industry is saying nowadays.  They were for kids though when we were kids.  The comic industry has decided though that they aren't that way anymore.  Therefore, nowadays, the Man of Steel isn't a pure hero anymore...he's a super strong guy who fathers a child out of wedlock.  Green Lantern has one night stands that we get to take glimpses of.  Wolverine drops F-bombs.  The Human Torch's girlfriend gets to tell the world about her fireproof lingerie.  Iron man gets to have a menage-a-quatre.  Hmmm...    Comics might not be for kids anymore...but these movies are movies that, honestly speaking, kids should be protected from.    What happens when you don't?  What happens when you teach all of the children to abandon morality?  London comes to mind.    Ladies and gentlemen.  Please grow up.
B002VPE1PW|1.0|Bought these to protect my HP Touchpad.  Mistake!  This product is generic and (obviously) made to fit 10 to 1000 different flat, portable, slim, smallish, computer, tablet-like devices and I can't see it as providing much protection from anything aside from dust.  It is flimsy, floppy and would not protect from any impact whatsoever.  Returned.
0553381695|5.0|Loving the series, can't put them down. He's woven some known history and fabulously thought out fiction together in this and each of his books.
030788743X|4.0|Fantastic fun for anybody who can remember the 80s geek subculture. The writing isn't going to win any literary awards and could have used a few more doses of \\"show don't tell\\" advice from the author's editor but that's only a marginal distraction. Near future sci-fi is one of the hardest genres to write for yet Ernest hits a home run with Ready Player One.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Star Wars - The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) Blu-ray Review    As someone who sat through these movies at the theater as a teenager more than a few times  and having a blast there were a few things I felt could have been added or changed so seeing changes  now does not bother me as the Star Wars Original Trilogy is still great.    To all those purists if you can see the story through the tears buy   them and enjoy yourself.    PQ gets 5 stars.  Auido gets 4  Extras: 1 Star**      **As for the extras keep it in mind that you will not get much with this trilogy set.   If you are like me and care only for the movies this set is perfect.
B005974CNA|4.0|There are so many different ways to look at this album. Before we say anything about the music itself; we knew for a fact that coming into this, people were already going to have biased opinions. From my point of view, I understand where Portnoy and the rest of the band were coming from. I understand how Portnoy wanted to take a break because things were feeling \\"stale.\\" But, he couldn't expect the remaining members, who are still full of creative energy and will to record/tour, to stop doing what they love just because he wants to take a break. I feel like on both \\"Systematic Chaos\\" and \\"BCASL,\\" Portnoy got too much creative control. His wannabe hardcore vocals on songs like \\"A Nightmare to Remember\\" were downright embarrassing. His lyrics were, for a lack of a better word, whack! And I think he was right, DT was getting a little stale. I think the one making it stale was him!    That being said, Mangini's drums on here are just incredible. I'm saying that now, and I wish they had picked Marco Minneman, so I wasn't really pro-Mangini from the get go. However, his work on this album makes me want to shut my mouth about it, because his drums are incredible in every facet, both technical and feel-wise. The drums are fresh, and the songs are just as fresh. I feel like this is exactly what they needed, however I don't think the chemistry is up to perfection yet. I feel like Mangini just needs to be a little more cemented in this band to develop a very accurate opinion about him, and I think that will be possible when we hear the next album.    As far as the songs are concerned, I think this is one of their albums that contain the most technical prowess. However, technicality doesn't ever necessarily make a good song in and of itself. I feel like within the balance of musicianship and song writing, that this is their best album since \\"Train of Thought.\\" Although the track \\"Octavarium\\" was outstanding, the album wasn't.     The reason I give this album 4 stars and not 5,is because as good as these songs sound, and as musically inclined as they are, some of them tend to lack cohesiveness. One thing I loved about \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" is that the lyrics and the music kinda fit together and made sense. The music represented the lyrics appropriately. I feel like I pretty much love just about 75-80 percent of all the epic songs on here, but on every one of them, there are some parts that make me feel they're being technical for the sake of being technical, and the notes, alternating time signatures, and effects they use in a given phrase simply doesn't fit the song. Out of all of them, \\"Lost not Forgotten\\" probably achieves the best balance on this album. There are also stupendous parts scattered all over the rest of this album, but once again, not very cohesive.     I read on one review that someone said \\"Build me Up, Break Me Down\\" is a horrible song, and I'm going to have to agree with that person. I also felt the same way about the song \\"A Rite of Passage,\\" just didn't do it for me AT ALL. Other than that, I don't think I could say that any of these songs are bad, a lot of them could be considered \\"really good,\\" but other than \\"Lost not Forgotten,\\" I don't think I can say any of these songs are AMAZING.     \\"Breaking all Illusions\\" is another example of a song that has great melodies in it, and the only thing that could really make it better is if it flowed a little more THROUGHOUT the whole song. It goes from this nice flowing melody that makes me feel like I'm flying through the sky, and it stays that way for a bit. Then, it gets crazy seemingly for the sake of being crazy, and it doesn't even really build up to it like a crescendo, it kinda just comes out of nowhere.    However, who could complain that much? This album reflects true, inspired musicianship, great melodies, a fresh sound in pretty much every facet INCLUDING vocals. This is Labrie's best vocal performance on an album since \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" I'd say.He sounds like he belongs and the vocals just flow when he's singing the smooth melodies that his voice was built for, rather than trying to sound metal! As far as everyone else, Rudess experimented a lot more with his effects rather than just sticking to that synth sound he loves so much, Myung/Petrucci are as solid as ever, and Mangini's drums are nothing short of incredible. Overall, 4 out of 5 stars seems appropriate.
B0027Z7COS|1.0|Weird sultry erotica movie about cheating and sneaking around on your significant other.  Unfortunately it is a depiction of todays relationships.  Good actors, and acting.  Very slow developing plot, and poorly concluded.  I wouldn't recommend it.
0062060554|3.0|The beginning of this book grabbed me immediately and I was hooked for the first half of the book.  After a while, though, it moved at a slower pace, and I found myself not caring quite as much about how it would all end up. I even stopped reading it for a week and never thought too much about it, then picked it up one rainy day and started reading again. There were plenty of twists, and I admit the ending was a big surprise to me, but even that was a bit of a letdown because there was so little written about it.  Overall, I enjoyed the book and I certainly recommend it, but I don't see it as a big-time thriller.
B0036S4CTS|2.0|I thought this would be a good book since they made a movie of it, but now that I've read the book I have a hard time thinking that anyone would consider this story movie material!  It was funny and cute at times, but overall it was rather depressing. The only thing that made me finish it was the hope it would have a happy ending.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Kenneth Branagh does the court thing well, so really, after Thor was banished to earth, the film should have remained in Asgard and documented the local politics, like a period piece.<br /><br />Asgard, with its starry backdrops, was a happening place. Idris Elba was cool. My daughter put it well: &#34;I want to go back there!&#34; But no, sweetie, I had to explain, Kenneth wants us to return to the earth, the boring place with two dimensional characters that made us rent this video in the first place, so we could listen to Thor, God of Thunder, ask &#34;Deal?&#34; and then wait an aeon to hear Natalie Portman reply, &#34;Deal!&#34; No shortage of painful nonsense sapping the life out of this film faster than a Yodenheim frost jacket.<br /><br />I agree with the other viewer that the opportunity to show Loki's mischievous side was lost. All we saw was hurt, spoiled & vengeful.<br /><br />Maybe Ken's a busy guy... but c'mon, he did Henry V! I keep expecting more from him.

B004021HUG|5.0|I purchased these shoes for my daughter since she was growing out of her original Mary Janes crocs.  I think these Mary Janes are so much cuter and they look nicer with skirts/ dresses.  I do think they run a little slimmer in width, which works out nicely for my daughter's narrow feet.  It did take her a couple days to break them in; she had a small red mark from the inside corner of the strap.  But, she has no problems now, and she says they are very comfortable.  These shoes are definitely worth the money spent and I got a great deal ordering them through Amazon.
B0018LMKIK|5.0|This collection is more diverse and has more songs on it than the previous greatest hits collection, \\"CCR Chronicle Vol. 1.\\" The sound is also newly remastered and is crystal clear. This CD also has informative liner notes, which \\"Chronicle\\" does not. \\"Chronicle Vol. 1\\" seemed incomplete; if you were looking for a better sampling of CCR, you needed to buy \\"Chronicle Vol. 2\\" to have a more complete overview of CCR's best. A few great tracks were missing from Vol. 1, such as \\"Born on the Bayou,\\" \\"Cottonfields,\\" \\"The Midnight Special\\" and more. As of 2011, this is the best single CD overview of CCR's best.
B004S82OAE|2.0|This book has good information, however, it is not well written. Random statements and not put together well. I have several other books concerning ccna which are easier to read and understand. Overall this book is not recommended for learning ccna. I would say it is not written on the user friendly side. I prefer the Cengage style of writing for these books.

0061474355|3.0|I know several people that absolutely love this book.  I wasn't one of them.  This is not to say that Sabriel is a bad book, far from it.  The book is well-written, with an interesting (if slightly unbelievable) world, and a reasonable quality of characterization.  However, Sabriel is also an excellent example of a very cliched character and story.  If you love coming of age stories, then you will probably like Sabriel.  If you haven't read much fantasy, but are trying to get into it, then Sabriel is probably a good book for you. However, I found the plot, and the character herself, intensely boring.  While I liked the premise of magic in the world, this was the ONLY part of the book that kept my attention.  I made it about 2/3 of the way through before I finally set the book down, and picked up something that I liked better - The Craft of Research: 3rd Edition.  Which probably says something about both me, and Sabriel.<br /><br />Overall: 6.0/10<br /><br />Let me stress again that Sabriel is not a technically weak book.  It just happened to hit all of my major cliches at one time.  The story is about a young woman, Sabriel, who lives on the technology side of a world split between magic and technology (cliche 1).  Early in the book Sabriel discovers that her father, the Abhorsen (good necromancer who fights the evil necromancers), has disappeared and she must find him, or take his place (cliche 2).  Thus she travels to the magic side of the world, a very medieval fantasy world (cliche 3), to rescue her lost father and defeat the villains who threaten the world in his absence (cliche 4).  Like I said, if you are new to fantasy, this is probably a good book for you.  If this sounds like the kind of story you love, then this is probably good for you.  It was not good for me.<br /><br />Writing: 8.0/10<br /><br />This is one of Nix's earliest novels and it shows.  While the writing is very good, there are a few slips in various places.  Still, all in all, the writing is easy to follow, and not dense.<br /><br />Characters: 3/10<br /><br />I hate young, coming of age characters with very clever pets.  If this sounds like your kind of character, then you should probably raise this to a 7.  Personally, I found Sabriel to be dull and annoying at the same time.  Her pet, Mogget, is a conflicted creature at best. When contained by his magic collar, he is kind, helpful, and clever.  When not contained by his magic collar, he does his best to kill Sabriel...and everyone else..<br /><br />World: 5/10<br /><br />The world of Ancelstierre is split between the north, a medieval European culture in which magic reigns, and the south, a turn of the 20th century style English setting where technology reigns.  Obviously technology does not work in the north, and magic does not work in the south (an artificial dichotomy that I have never been comfortable with).  The setting is pretty much what you would expect from this description, with one interesting difference. Necromancers use bells to actually enter the world of the dead (a river apparently based on Lethe, from Greek mythology, with multiple gates), and guide creatures out of it.  The Abhorsen, on the other hand, helps creatures move on through the gates, and forces along those evil creatures that are trying to make their way back to the world of the living.  Again, if Ancelstierre sounds like your favorite kind of world, then you should probably add two or three points to this score.<br /><br />Plot: 3/10<br /><br />Coming of age plots bore me to tears.  I cannot sufficiently explain how tired I am of them.  Sabriel fits very comfortably into this description.  Sabriel discovers, at the beginning of the book, that her father has disappeared and she must replace him, and spends the rest of the novel trying to deal with that fact.  Again, if this plot sounds appealing - up the rating by at least three points.  For what it is, the plot is fairly well done.<br /><br />Pacing: 9.0/10<br /><br />The pacing of Sabriel is quite good.  While I was bored through the entirety of the novel, this was not because of its progression.  If you like the story, then you won't get bored.<br /><br />Commentary: 5/10<br /><br />While social commentary is not the apparent intention of Sabriel - it does have very strong themes about the necessity of death, and the necessity of individuals to accept death.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I didn't like Sabriel, not because it was a bad book, but because it managed to hit all of my biggest cliche pet peeves.  If these don't sound like cliches to you, or if they are cliches that you like, then give the novel a try.was not because of its progression.  If you like the story, then you won't get bored.    Commentary: 5/10    While social commentary is not the apparent intention of Sabriel - it does have very strong themes about the necessity of death, and the necessity of individuals to accept death.

B004LWZW42|4.0|One of the many things I enjoy about the X-Men films is their ability to hook you with the opening scenes, and FIRST CLASS was no different. After the (still enjoyable) duds that were THE LAST STAND and ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, I think the series is back on track. The friendship between the Professor and Mystique was certainly a shock for me, but it really worked out well and his on-and-off friendship with Magneto was brilliant as always. While a lot of the characters in the film are far from my fav X-Men characters, they really made me like them a little bit more than I had.    Despite how much I enjoyed the film, I still couldnt help but feel that some of the heroes/villains had a lot of wasted potential. Azazel, Darwin, and Riptide might as well have been left out since they were barely used (and arent that interesting to begin with). Banshee, Havok, and Angel Savatore had a little more to do and pretty much did it well. I really enjoyed Mystique and Emma Frost...I just wish they had participated in more of the action than what they did (I really missed the agile battle savvy Mystique of the older films). Although there was some animosity towards January Jones and her alleged wooden portrayal of Emma (as well as her character being useless in the later part of the film), I thought she did well and played the character as the cold, condescending, and bitchy woman she is. It was made perfectly clear that Emma couldve easily broken out of custody to aid Sebastian Shaw but I think she purposely did NOT. If Shaw goes down, then that technically makes his 2nd in command, (her) the head of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club.    Since the film was billed as both a prequel to the original trilogy and a reboot, I was confused as to how certain characters are present in this time frame at this particular age. If it is indeed a prequel, then chronologically, things just didnt add up. If its a reboot, thats fine, but if not, one would think the writers wouldve done a little better at weaving the stories and timelines together.     Overall, while not as brilliant as my fav, X2: X-MEN UNITED, this was a wonderful movie, with cool characters and a pretty great story. I, for one cant wait to see a sequel and what can be done to repair the damage done to the original series (I have read that a X4 and X5 are in active development).
B005KCZRI8|5.0|The lead review on here sums the album up very well.  It's an immaculately produced, diverse collection of songs that show off the songwriting talents of Christopher Owens (apparent on their quality debut, Album) and newfound chops and power as a band.  This is one of those albums that is solid all the way through, and many of the songs reveal new highlights with repeated listens.  The Floyd-ian \\"Vomit,\\" \\"Forgiveness,\\" and \\"My Ma\\" are probably the album's highlights, but it also features a handful of great songs on the undercard (the perfect indie rock of \\"Alex,\\" the crunching guitars on \\"Die,\\" the jazzy swing of \\"Love Like a River\\").  If you like this, check out the band's other releases - Album and Broken Dreams Club are both worthwhile purchases.    This has jumped into the lead of my \\"album of the year\\" race after heavy rotation over the past two weeks.  I keep going back to it - it's addicting.
030746363X|2.0|I did not read the entire book because I will not be buying it, I just tried a sample and glad I did.  Too much cussing, not necessary for this type of book.  Choose not to spend my money on that type of print.
0670022411|2.0|I read this book for our book club, a chapter or two at a time on vacation.     Diana Bishop is a witch trying to deny her self and origins and Matthew Clairmont is a vampire who is .. well, a vampire. It is hard to tell if this is a self-indulgent love story, a sci-fi historical fantasy, a vampire thriller or all of the above blended for popular consumption. The story begins when the former discovers an ancient manuscript (Ashmole-782 on alchemy / magic) in Oxford's library stacks, which triggers a series of ho hum events and interactions between witches and vampires. Humans or daemons (the other species) appear minimally, and the plot moves at a snail's pace -- with episodic tidbits and desultory meanderings on things like the knights of Lazarus, and various specialty wines. While I found the book enjoyable in places, and reasonably fast reading, I found the writer's introduction of topics and characters at random (time travel toward the end -- whoa!) a tad annoying. And we never get to find out what's in Ashmole's book or why it is interesting. Could have been more enjoyable and sweeter at 200 pages with tighter editing and a better ending. Not recommended.     Spoiler alert: The book does not have a satisfying ending and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Perhaps the author has a sequel in the works -- if you read it and know what ends up happening, drop me a note since I won't be reading it.

B000BYA5G4|5.0|Lord of War is a good cinematic take on the realities, morality and dilemmas of the world's arms trade. Nicholas Cage fits the role to a T and Lord of War is one of his better recent roles. You watch Cages character develop from an immigrant New Yorker into a suave arms dealer to the world's nastiest rulers and wanubie dictators. Plenty of action, love interest, wealth and world politic reality on display to suit the most jaded palette. Think the movie `Wall street' on the arms trade for a similar insider trading expose. The movie grips you from the memorable opening credits onwards and the tight direction, cinematography and acting makes repeat viewing no chore.

1582432678|5.0|The packaging, as usual, is very well done and undamaged. I open it up and start to read. I had just started school, and I didn't mind. I had heard GOOD things about this book, and I had to READ it. Well, first off, be warned. You may be utterly bored at the beginning. It does start ominous and mysterious throughout, since the author is not direct, but it sure as hell can be descriptive! It is very boring in the beginning. But, as the story progresses, so does the interesting stuff. Mind you, the boring stuff in the beginning passes very quickly in comparison with how LONG the book is. There are 400 pages and about 368 interesting ones that make up for the slow beginning. Some great things take patience and this written blockbuster narrative BUILDS up. It gets very descriptively interesting and horrid. The titular character, we learn, really is a character of pure, unrelenting evil. The terror is splattered across the pages, the look into the very depths of people's soul and morality fully examined. This is one SICK son of a bitch. And, needless to say, with the BBC film adaption coming out very soon, I wouldn't be surprised if EVERYbody's talking about Kevin.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Every other reviewer tells you everything you need to know.  I loved the first book, and I loved this one as well.  The third one, on the other hand...
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|Before I get into my review, let me just say I would have preferred the title to be: A Real Mind #### Of A Movie. Substitute a four-letter word beginning w/ F for Twister and you get a better idea of what this movie is like. If you like a movie that is well crafted, beautifully written, exquisitely acted and sharply directed, then this movie is for you. The first time I saw this I was on the edge of the seat wondering what was going to happen next. Upon further viewings I am awed by the multitude of subtleties throughout that make this such a wonderful film. Alfred Hitchcock would love this stuff!     Melissa George is an actress that I just adore, so it may be that my partiality is showing through, but her performance here is demanding and she delivers a top-notch effort. For those that haven't seen it, I won't give anything away but I will say this; don't watch this movie once and then walk away. Watch it... and then watch it again. Then watch it again. The more you see this, the more the subtleties will surface and the more you will take away from this. Some movies require you to work... to use your brain and dissect certain scenes. This is one of those movies. It is brilliant and it should remain w/ you after the credits roll.    It pains me that more movies like this don't find their way to the big screen and ultimately, DVD. It is just such a fun and at times, terrifying, ride. Even after numerous viewings it never gets old. In fact, it gets better. Get this movie and prepare yourself for a journey...
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book.  I absolutely LOVED the first two in the series - they were well-written, had great characters, and the story was fantastic.  I think I smiled the whole way through them and could not put them down until I was done (I read the trilogy in less than a week.)  Then I got to this one.  Ugh, I don't know what to say.  This is a completely different book from the first two.  She took this one in a totally different direction.  This book pretty much destroyed my will to live for like two weeks, and for that I am very disappointed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a cry-baby and a happy ending may have been cliched, but I was shocked by the turn of events.  And the book seems to just end, and you're like \\"What just happened?\\"  I could have used a slightly happier ending.  I really want to re-read the first two but am worried that it will bring up memories of the third.  I am being a little melodramatic, but read it for yourself and see if you agree.

B004EPZ070|3.0|I've seen a few good romantic comedies in my life. I've seen a few great ones as well. I even saw a couple especially good ones this year. However, I can't quite say that for \\"Something Borrowed\\". It's not that this was a bad movie, because it wasn't. Everybody gave a good performance, and the characters were welcomingly flawed and damaged, yet, \\"Something Borrowed\\" has a fondness for formula and cliches that ultimately hurts the end result.    The story follows Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin), a woman who's never gotten what she's wanted. She had a big crush on Dex (Colin Eggelesfield), ever since law school. One night, on a semi-date with him, he meets Darcy (Kate Hudson), who he falls in love with immediately. Fast forward some time, Dex and Darcy are engaged, and Rachel is turning thirty. Due to drunken behavior, and not-quite-healed wounds, Rachel and Dex have a fling, and the film is about the downfall from that.    Ginnifer Goodwin isn't a particularly good actress, yet I like her. She has a kind of cutesy flawed type-A personality that brings this kind of character to life. I liked her in \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\", an ensemble romantic comedy which I felt that she kind of held together. In this one, she's the heroine you're supposed to root for, and yet it isn't easy to. She sacrifices so much of her potential happiness on her jackass of a best friend. She lies, cheats and betrays everyone, yet, in the end, she owns up to her own issues, which I liked.    Kate Hudson was the best thing in this one, for me. Her antagonist Darcy was much better thought-out and realized than the rest of the characters. She plays the bitch awfully well in this one. Soap opera alum Colin Egglesfield is a welcome addition to this soap opera of a story. He does a nice job, he's pretty to look at, and...that's all he really has to be. \\"The Office\\"`s John Krasinski was very good, being the voice of reason among all of the mess going on.    What kills this one for me is that it ended almost exactly the way I expected it to. A lot of the characters are reduced to stereotypes, and they never quite come to life. If these characters had more room to work with, and with a better writer, this could have been a fantastic movie. It feels chaotic, yet at the same time, it has a slow pace. It has soap-opera feel, with sitcom-y jokes thrown in. It has a few good moments that almost make it a good movie, but in the end, it falls flat.    Apparently, this was a best-selling novel by someone named Emily Giffin. Also, there was apparently a follow-up novel, telling this same story from Darcy's perspective. I can't help but think that would have made a better movie.    Grade: C
B0056BMK6K|3.0|I liked the author, but most people who can sell the Golden Gate bridge to anyone are very likable.  The book was equivalent to an infomercial but an enjoyable read.  He's a nice guy.  I'm not buying anything from him again, even if he wrote a biography, because I think I already read his biography.  The book is worth buying though, not because of what he said, but what he didn't say.  He's an excellent salesman.  We can learn from his personality that comes shining through in his book.  And not to say I wouldn't buy his books because I think he's a bad writer.  He writes fiction and why bother with that when truth is stranger than fiction.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|Like others, when this product was attached to the Kinect, the sensor couldn't determine where the floor was, so it would settle pointing upward.  I have my Kinect positioned under the TV as recommended, but the Zoom simply did not work even after I did all of the recommendations I could find on the Net about making this thing function as designed.  I dropped it off at the post office to be sent back to Amazon less than an hour after it was delivered.  Really good idea...just didn't work.
0385534639|5.0|I have two words for this book: simply enchanting! A beautiful tale full of magic and wonder. Plus I loved the love story between Marco and Celia. The book is a nice long read, which was great. This author has a great mind and a wonderful imagination. The whole book was a bit confusing, but it all comes together in the end. But one of the greatest parts was how you weren't told everything. Is the magic inherent or something you can learn? What exactly happened to the two lovers? I absolutely adored it! A must read!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Fans of the movie Star Wars should not be complicit in Lucas's delusion that he is a better film-maker now than in 1977. He isn't. Neither is he a better film-maker  than Kershner was in 1980.    What Lucas has done here is insulting. It insults the other directors of the early films. It insults audiences who supported the original films. It insults the younger George Lucas who publicly defended the ideals of film preservation and artistic integrity.

B004EPZ070|5.0|The whole purpose, for me, to watch a movie is to be entertained.  This one does that.  Yes, it's predictable - the previews \\"give it all away\\" but it's fun to watch the characters and the actors porTRAYing those characters.  Did anyone else think that \\"Dex\\" looked like a young (1980's) Tom Cruise at times??    Audiences these days are too jaded.  Watch \\"The Holiday\\" where a screen writer from \\"back in the day\\" talks about today's movies:  \\"reviews are posted like box scores in baseball.....  It used to be one movie a season and NOW it's a handful of movies A WEEK.\\"    If you are like me & just seeking entertainment, you'll enjoy this.
1400069181|5.0|I work in the shoe sales industry and LOVE this book! After selling over 1000 TOMS per month, it is awsome to know the history of the company, hear about Blake's passion for giving and learn about other start-ups that are joining the giving back trend.  This is an awesome book for TOMS fans, business owners, college students and anyone looking for an inspiring book.  It was a very fast and fun read and it made me smile from the inside out!  :)
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All you people bitching and talking crap about star wars blu-ray get a life. the movie will never be perfect so get over it. Who really cares if he doesn't make it perfect. be glad he made the movies. All you people giving it bad reviews need to grow up.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Just received the blu-rays today and watched sections of each of the movies to check out the quality of the HD video.  I had no problems, even with the \\"pink\\" light saber light.  (The pink is on the fringes, and the \\"red\\" light saber light is actually white with pink edges.  Looked realistic to me.)      The first movie historically, episode IV, is outstanding in terms of improved clarity of the picture and the color.  I have the original DVD versions, and this blu-ray not only improves the resolution but also the depth and color.  They clearly did a lot of work on this.  I got pulled in and watched the whole thing.   They did an outstanding job on upgrading the picture, and to be frank, I really didnt notice the new inserts.      While I wish George Lucas had simply packaged the original theatrical versions (which I loved), these revisions/additions are just as good from my standpoint.  The picture quality makes these classic movies come alive and the depth of the picture is great.  Blacks are solid and the colors look true.  The death star is something to behold in high definition.   The sound is great as well.    I think for most buyers, this blu-ray series will be well worth the investment and appreciated.  Although the packaging is minimal, it wont take up much space and the disks are protected (but just barely).  I gave it 5 stars for the quality of the picture and sound, not the packaging.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This 5th season of Dexter did not disappoint!  It was as suspenseful and well written as ever.  Loved \\"Lumen\\" and the way the season progressed.  I am looking forward to seeing who is the next guest, and the next villian.  The only complaint........just too short!
B0055S348W|5.0|This app is amazing. The ability to print to my home printer directly from my Droid is extremely useful. All those times I've needed to print a PDF or document from an email and had to turn the computer on for one page... those days are gone.   The only thing I knock the app for is the amount of time you have to spend downloading the add-ons for each file type. Once that was done it ran incredibly smoothly.
B00000IQW3|5.0|This movie brought back memories from the 80's, where the internet as we know it didn't exist and you had to play arcade games for 25 cents at the corner convenience store with humming fluorscent lights or at some out of the way diner with a flickering reddish/orange neon \\"open\\" sign.        I only saw this movie one time about 25 years ago on a distant TV station with grainy and snowy reception on a black and white TV set with rabbit ears.  Sure the movie is corny, the CGI is cheesy and the acting is thin but you end up caring about what happens to the characters.   It's one of those B movies where you applaud at the end, like the theme song as the credits roll and feel pumped up afterwards.
B001N26GFM|5.0|Very good movie. Very somber at times and brings a person to tears. A picture that you keep in your memory for a long, long time!!!

B005974CDU|5.0|Wow, was't expecting this...  My journey to Dream Theater has been via the Genesis / Yes / Kansas / Rush / Iron Maiden  path. I was lucky enough to have a friend who also liked a lot of the music I liked and recommended \\"Images and Words\\" to me back in 1992, from that day I was hooked. Great rock  with a metal edge with well thought out compositions, incredible musicianship AND great melodies.   With this latest album, Dream Theater, have all of these qualities, in abundance.  I guess I'm more into the Classical Rock / Melodic side of Dream Theater, although I really enjoy elements of \\"Heaviness\\" within their music. Both \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Scenes from a memory\\" were both in this style and both classic albums in my view.  With ADTOE there appears , to me, to be a return to \\"Images and Words\\" combined with \\"Scenes from a memory\\" in terms of style.   I rank this latest effort up with the two previously mentioned classics (yes, I enjoy it that much).  In essence, if any of this sounds like you in terms of, yeah, I like that style as well, I really think you'll love this latest album as much as I do. It really sounds fresh, inspired, emotional... 5 Stars.  PS... New drummer Mike Mangini does a brilliant job on this album. I was watching the  Dream Theater DVD \\"Live Scenes from New York\\" (2000) a couple of days ago and seeing Mike Portnoy's performance on \\"Finally Free\\" reminded me of what a tremendous talent he is and why I enjoy listening to him so much, he has a tremendous style. In Mike Mangini the band have managed to find a superb replacement - Well done!
B0034G4P94|5.0|Except for the lack of a SPOILER note at the beginning of the first reviewer, I think these first two reviews pretty much cover the story and hit some high points of the film. I do want to disagree with some of the remarks, though.     First, I would not call this a sports movie. It is not Rocky, Raging Bull, The Wrestler, or The Fighter. Warrior, according to many professional critics, is better than all of them, and I agree. There is the suspense factor of who will win the championship fight, for sure, and the stand-up-and-cheer factor as the opponents are picked off one by one, and there is the heartwarming factor as the school teacher tries to save his home from foreclosure. These cliches somehow are not relevant to this film and I salute O'Connor and the other writers for telling a story that glosses over them.      As some reviewers have pointed out, this film is not really about MMA (mixed martial arts) winners and losers. Like others, I had never heard of MMA and don't like either boxing or wrestling (for me the former is just brutal beating and the second relies on a series of moves that I don't understand). But in this film MMA is choreographed so that you see the intensity and bruises on the fighters faces, the strain and pain on their arms, legs, and shoulders, but are not cringing at any blood and gore. There is no blood and gore in the cage (and probably that is what accounts for its PG-13 rating). As for the cinematography, the periodically trembling camera follows the fighters in close-ups, so you actually feel like you are standing in the ref's shoes. The score, which includes Ode to Joy and The National's About Today, is perfect.     I think what really puts the gold on the five stars, though, is the caliber of acting. When the movie was made,over two years ago, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton were barely known to American audiences. O'Connor said he didn't want the performers to overshadow the characters, and with the anonymity of the actors, he wouldachieve that. He shouldn't have worried. The brothers, especially Hardy, completely disappear in the characters. Nolte not so much. His real life and his persona as Paddy Conlon are not so far apart, but I can't think of any other actor who could redeem this character with such pathos.     As story-telling goes, Warrior is both a movie and a film. Nobody doesn't love Warrior. Teens will love it, the parent-sibling-sibling conflicts relatable. And the cage fighting will thrill them. In fact, the whole family will enjoy this, sitting on the edge of the seats, cheering, and tearing up sometimes simultaneously. By the way, it wasn't only the ladies tearing up a time or two. After the screening I attended, no one, man or woman, moved from their seats, the lights remained down, only some muted sniffling and discreet blowing of noses.     For the arthouse crowd, there is profound metaphor embedded in the film. There are actually three warriors (fighters) in Warrior, and not one of them actually wins the war (the big fight). The brothers have not seen each other in 14 years, each of them feeling betrayed by the other at a crucial point in the life of the family. The one thing they have in common is hatred for their father, a former drunk and wife-beater. Brendan, the older son, has moved his own family as far away from Paddy as possible and still be in the same state. Communication must be had only by phone or mail. Tommy, an ex-Marine, shows up at his father's house, again after 14 years --but with zero communication-- and wants Paddy to train him for a big tournament. Why in the world, some would say, does Tommy go to his father for this. He hates him. Well, Paddy, also an ex-Marine and pro boxer, trained both Tommy and Brendan as boys. Tommy in wrestling, Brenden in boxing. But Tommy was a champion. Parallels permitted to be drawn. And so, because his motivation is so strong (and so poignant as we find out later), Tommy wants to be trained by the man who made him champion. Paddy hopes to revive this relationship, but Tommy is having none of it. Hardy absolutely seethes in his scenes with Nolte; every comment is a stab wound, every look a gunshot. Nolte takes it like a dog after he's been kicked. Coming back for the pat on the head. Scenes between these two are Oscar material, hands down.     As the story develops, slowly, but with tantalizing bits of mystery in the plot, a lot of gaps are filled in. At the point where the two finalists, Tommy Riordan and Brendan Conlon (\\"They are brothers!\\" the announcer shouts), enter the cage, we are so conflicted we want to cry (and we do). Then the script throws us a screwball(another shock, another jerk of a tear). Who the hell to cheer for?! There are no bad guys to fight! Just two alienated brothers who need to beat the crap out of each other in order to win the prize they need so desperately. And when the fight is over, it isn't really over. The end of the cage fight is gut-wrenching. No one wins. Not Tommy, not Brendan, not Paddy. A lot of people say the \\"ending\\" of the movie is predictable. Which ending is that? The knockout? The takedown? The tapout? And what exactly do each of those signify? Is there redemption for Paddy? Are there resolutions to the conflicts among the father and brothers?  What happens to Tommy, to Brendan, to Paddy, after the tournament ends?     Warrior will run your emotions ragged. High, low, and very few in-betweens. I think the movie will make the Best Films list, and it better get its nominations for Hardy and Nolte. I think Edgerton's quietly powerful performance is award worthy, too, but not in contention with the other two.  I hope audiences don't pass this film by because they think it's a violent fight movie or, for UFC fans, too tame. This is a jewel that should be treasured by everyone.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|Great to view a classic on bluray. The bluray format does wonders to this movie.This edition proves that an old B&W movie can still look spectacular.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I just discovered this band and I am utterly thrilled...they don't remind me of any other band and they provide enlighteningly honest and poetic lyrics that offer deep understanding of life and the chances we take if we're bold enough. I am drawn to the folkie singer/song writers of our time who have an awareness beyond cookie-cutter genres. Well done!     Little Lion Man and White Blank Page are beautiful...but all are noteworthy... can't wait to listen to previously released albums!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Best version of Star Wars on the market! Watched them all in a row in a super marathon! Loved the bonus features and new scenes are great! Ps in episode 4 A New Hope, during trash compacter scene when stormtropper hits his head there is a huge thud noise! Great movies, great fun, full HD! a must have for a true Star Wars fan!
B0042JTDXK|3.0|3.5/5 stars  Even though I was late to the Josh Groban crowd (late 2007 and onward), he quickly became my favorite artist of all time (granted, I'm rather narrow-minded in my musical tastes, but I'm venturing out a bit more). I listened to him all the time when driving. When I heard that a new Josh Groban album was going to come out in late 2010, I was overjoyed. I was even more thrilled when a video of his WIP \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\" came out, and I listened to it over and over because I was eager to hear new material from Groban. Finally, the time drew near for Illuminatons' release, and the singles started coming out.   \\"Hidden Away\\" was our first full-blown glimpse into what was to become Illuminations. I liked the song, but I was a bit perplexed by it. It was short (a little less than four minutes), the tune was very simplistic (two verses and two choruses that sounded the same, no key-change or bridge, really simple chords, etc), and something was different about Josh Groban's voice. He went off-pitch quite a bit, and he didn't hit a single note above E-natural in full voice - all the high notes were in falsetto. Sure, it was pretty, but I'm used to him being a baritone with an upper extension and letting the high notes soar. What's the deal with not hitting the high A in full voice? And why the pitch problems? As much as I enjoyed the new piece, it seemed to me like it should be a WIP, not a final cut. I was a bit sad that it didn't seem as developed as some previous ones.  Then, out came Voce Existe Em Mim. Finally, the Brazilian song had been released! I was so enchanted by the song that - no joke - it was the only song I listened to for two days straight. Going to school, going to work, driving home, I always listened to it. Hearing Josh Groban sing in Portuguese while being accompanied by hauntingly-beautiful strings and epic-sound drums was captivating, and I still listen to the song to this day.   After that came Higher Window. It was a pretty song, but atleast there was more to it than Hidden Away. It still seemed a bit simplistic and toned-down for an epic voice like Josh Groban. It was a good song overall, however.  Finally came L'Ora Dell'Addio. I liked it, and I was glad to hear Josh singing in Italian again, but it suffered from a similar problem to Hidden Away and Higher Window - too simplistic, too short, and at the end I found myself thinking, \\"That's it?\\" I began to feel a bit anxious about the album - were all the songs going to be this short and toned down?  A few days before the album was actually released, Josh Groban's Facebook page allowed people to stream the various songs, so I listened to the album all the way through (though I tended to skip the singles, which I had played to death). I enjoyed the pieces, and my impressions are below.  The Wandering Kind - a very pleasant and magical-sounding piece of music by Josh Groban. I think so much of it that I have even taught myself to play it by ear on the piano. It's certainly a nice intro, but... it's so short. Why couldn't Josh Groban have at least made it three-and-a-half to four minutes long? 2 minutes 30-something seconds isn't bad for a \\"prelude,\\" but when it's a 13-track CD, I don't want a bunch of less-than-three-minute pieces! Not to mention, I would have liked to hear more playing from Josh and his team.  Bells of New York City - a chilling and atmospheric song which I very much enjoy, though it is also rather simplistic. Still, it's nice listening for when I'm close to home and don't have time for Voce Existe Em Mim.  Galileo - this song, I enjoyed, but I don't listen to it much. I'm not really too fond of the lyrics, as they are rather cheesy. The first verse is decent (although how is Galileo a \\"Galileian\\" boy? He's not from Galilee in the Holy Land!), but the second one sounds like it was written by some amateur. Maybe I'll give this one another twirl.  Now skipping L'Ora Dell'Addio and Hidden Away, we get to...  Au Jardin des Sans-Pourquoi - although I liked this piece, the tune was rather... lacking. It sounded like Josh Groban was just singing in an up-and-down fashion in his range, and it doesn't evolve much. Plus, I'm not too fond of French, so that doesn't help much either.  Skipping Higher Window, we come to...  If I Walk Away - although I like this song, it is also too simplistic for my tastes. It might have to do with the \\"stripping away\\" that Rick Rubin and Josh Groban have done. I can't really say much, except that I like this piece, but I don't go back to it very often.  Love Only Knows - now this one, I was simply enchanted by. Even though it's rather strange for Josh Groban to start in falsetto on the first notes of the verses, I was captured by the beauty of this song and its lyrics. I listened to it quite often at the beginning, and I still enjoy it whenever I play it from time to time.  I've already talked about Voce Existe Em Mim, so I'll just talk about...  War at Home - I thought this was a weird song at first, but now I love it, and I find its lyrics very meaningful. If I had a better voice, I would definitely cover it and set it to some photos/footage of our soldiers, but right now that's just a dream. Even though I don't listen to this one as often as Voce Existe Em Mim, I still think of it quite often.  London Hymn - this one was sort of bittersweet. My main complaint is similar to The Wandering Kind - even though I like the little bite-size they gave us, they should have expanded on it. Now I know that you're thinking, \\"But this flows into the last track!\\" Well, that's true, I still think they should have done something more with this song. Having a full-length Josh Groban song with a melancholic tune and a choir in the background would have been a great step in a different direction. Instead, they just gave us less than two minutes of listening time. I like the song, but it was an afterthought - even when Josh Groban talks about it, he mentions how he asked the producers if\\"there would be room on the album for...\\" a little extra thing, which turned out to be London Hymn. I hope they do something like this in the next album, but more developed.  Straight To You - the final track in the album, and probably the only cover (unless you got the special edition). It's a swell piece overall, but it's just the same melody repeating over and over, and Josh Groban doesn't even explore his high range much. I wouldn't say this piece was half-baked or anything, but it just didn't resonate with me so much.  Overall, I liked the album, but it just wasn't 5-star material. The songs themselves weren't all phenomenal, and Josh Groban himself... well, I'll be frank. I think his voice is slowly deteriorating. This is probably where many of the readers will start attacking me, but I really don't care about having a mud-slinging contest with crazed fans. If your opinion differs from mine, then please state your thoughts intelligently and clearly without giving me any of this \\"Josh is amazing\\" or \\"I'd like to hear YOU sing\\" rubbish. Anyway, back to the subject. While listening to the album and to Josh Groban singing in a live setting, I have noticed some vocal problems that are hampering him and making him sound worse over time. His voice doesn't have the clear, silky quality it used to have. You could say that he has gotten older and maybe his voice has deepened, but I think the problem is technical, not physiological. His high notes sound very strained (especially above F#), his larynx position is unstable, he sings many notes in falsetto which he used to sing in full-voice, and sometimes he sounds just plain bad. I have to respectfully disagree with the people who say that Josh Groban has \\"gotten better.\\" He may sound better to you because you like the newer sound, but I can just hear that he's using improper technique, and it's definitely encumbering him.   Pop singers don't always have to worry about using optimal vocal technique, and many of them getaway with it and sound great. The problem here is that while Josh Groban isn't a classical singer who has to sing over an orchestra (without a microphone) several times a week, the style he sings requires an easy high range, a full-sounding-yet-silky voice, and a pleasant tone overall. Unfortunately, he doesn't sound as \\"perfect\\" as he once did. I hope that he gets on the right track and sounds better than ever in his next release (whenever it may come about).  So to sum it up, I like the album, but the direction the songs have taken doesn't always work, and Josh Groban himself isn't singing as phenomenally as he once did. I hope his next album is better. Meanwhile, I'm gonna keep on listening to this and other Josh Groban albums while speculating on what he's going to put out next.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|There was a mishap in the order of my DVD's with Sams Store 247, that he is a man that stands behind his word.  He correct the matter in a orderly manner of time.  So, the only thing will say that in the near future.  That if I have any of product (DVD, CD, etc) I will not hesitate to put an order to his store.  Because he have display a highly performance what a man will do that stand behind his name and word.  Thank you I will continue to do business with you anytime.  If you ever need anyone to stand in your corner for anything feel free and text.  I will stand with you.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Easily the most daring show I have ever seen. If I had to sum up Spartacus in one word it would have to be, \\"Gripping.\\" If you don't like blood, violence, and everything that is primal...don't watch. If you do, this could be the best series you ever watch. Great prequel to \\"Blood and Sand\\"...can't wait for the new season to start in January.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was very adamant on buying these blu rays from all the fanatical reviews. Always trust your instincts and don't always let others ruin a possible great experience for you. This set is awesome. People were relying too much on the trailers for their visual quality review on this saga set, but seeing the actual product it is most impressive. The audio is even better! Now I grew up in the 90's and only saw the originals on recorded VHS off paper-view and remember it quite well. But the new Cgi and added dialogue I saw at the re-releases in the theaters wasn't a game-breaker for me. Don't take my word for it. Experience it yourself, it's a good deal for $80.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This product is great.  I love all of the state of the art additions that Lucas made to make the movies even better than the originals!
B0055S348W|4.0|I downloaded the pc app over at cnet instead of printershares website. Instant download their instead of the 91 bits per second at the other.  The only complaint I have is the web page printing option. You can't log on to an account through the app. It just types in the Apps search bar. Would be helpful when trying to print a wishlist at Newegg.
1932735410|5.0|Great book... It is not too much different from 6th edition but worked nice for me. Came nicely wraped up. Pm fastrack included. Well...time to study for pmp exam.
B004J1DBJI|2.0|As an initial point, I have to note that this app's keyboard stinks when compared to swype and I hate that I can't switch them out. I docked a star for that.   Ok, so this is an app for finding out information. So my first search was for &quot;qwerty&quot;. Yeah, I know, not very original. I was figuring I'd get statistics on qwerty keyboards and the like. Instead, it turns out that there's a star by that name and I got tons of info on that, instead. Unfortunately, I wasn't interested, but had no way of telling the app that it had the wrong qwerty. It should offer choices, like wikipedia offers the disambiguation pages.   So, my second search was more specialized. &quot;texas adult protective services&quot; should give some information, any information, about that department. But according to this app, no such combination of words exists.   I've done other searches with this engine in the past with similar results. Like the title of my review says, this app just isn't very useful for finding things.
1452101248|1.0|I love Ottolenghi. I love Nopi. Perfect restaurants in London. However, when I got this book, I was truly disappointed. I tried over 40 recipes, of which only 5 were delicious. I kept trying more and more recipes thinking that it's not be possible, because he is so genius. And in the meanwhile upset family and friends with strange experiments. The book is not like the food currently at his restaurants, so please don't expect it.
0545268850|5.0|Excellent book second only to Anna Sewell's \\"Black Beauty\\" with it's narration by the books lead character Joey the horse.  Numeous heart wrenching incident's Joey must endure with equine friend's.  Can only hope the movie version lives up to the book.
B000093OU8|5.0|CD in perfect condition when it arrived and it arrived early. The music brought back many memories from along time past
0307346617|3.0|my first max brooks book..was looking on something more descriptive of the horror side of a zombie war..this is more about logistics,procedural,and governmental responsibilities(or lack thereof)..was hoping for something more personal,and descriptive...maybe i should have started with his first zombie book instead...
B005IF5H2S|3.0|The album is ok.  I can sit and listen to it without having to skip songs or dislike any of them.  However I don't really find any of the songs as stand outs.  I expected a better album.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I admit that I wanted to see the originals with the set but it is okay because I still have the originals and the only real hate for the special editions was Greedo shooting first.  After seeing Episode 4 in HD all I could think was \\"time for the haters to eat crow\\".  Nothing that you could hate about George Lucas and his modifications could account for the quality.  This was how Star Wars was always supposed to be.  (minus the whole Greedo thing)
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This sharpener is exactly as described and shipped very quick.  I could not believe how sharp my knives got.  I am definitely gonna buy another one.
B000000993|5.0|This album is awesome.  Some of my favorite Tool tracks on Undertow are \\"Prison Sex\\", \\"Flood\\", \\"Bottom\\", \\"Crawl Away\\",\\"Swamp Song\\", and \\"Sober\\".  \\"Aenima\\" and \\"Undertow\\" are Tool's best albums by far.  They are both brilliant and very deep.  Lateralus and 10,000 Days are way overrated IMO.  I'll stick with Tool's 90's stuff.  This is a definite must have.
B0040YFR1Y|2.0|I really liked the original Predator and thought after seeing the preview that this version would at least be interesting.     Its not very and the acting was poor.  Brody looked great but his tough guy drawl just didn't work.  This homage to the original just failed on too many levels to be entertaining.  A rental.
B0055S348W|5.0|Got the app with the FAOTD promo. I absolutely love it. I had the free version at one point, which wad ok, even with its restrictions. However this version is absolutely awesome and a must have whether free or not. Thanks Amazon.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|tried HTC, spb, and a few others. got rid of them all after using this for treetop days.<br />the good: super informative. more info per pixel than other apps. completely worry it if the you works for you.<br />the bad: it's not super intuitive and the screens can look confusing at first. unclear what you can click for more info..<br />final: look at the screens, push on things, see what happens, you'll either love it or think it's too confusing. I love it.<br />suggestion: show a short video of how to use it, it will shallow out the learning curve.
0439023521|5.0|OK! I get it! I finally get what all the hype is about! Why did it take me so long to read The Hunger Games? Something all readers have experienced: Too many books, too little time! But I finally started this book, and I couldn't put it down! I've never read anything like it, that's for sure. I'm sure I don't have to describe the plot, because I'll bet everybody has heard of it in one form or another. There's the book and the movie being made, so that info is readily available. I will just talk about what a wonderful writer Suzanne Collins is and how much I loved this book!    I envy writers. I envy them their ability to take an idea, something totally out of the blue, and create a whole new world out of that one idea. People and places that you feel you know when they are described to you. That is a true gift, and one that Suzanne Collins has in spades! The world she created in The Hunger Games is desolate and terrible, with starvation and death an everyday occurrence. Yet, because she is so gifted, she also creates moments of sweetness, affection, and hope in the direst of circumstances. She makes you truly care about the characters and what they are going through, and she makes you want to keep reading even when the subject matter is horrendous. You want to take that little spark of hope and watch it grow into something greater than the whole. You feel everything that Katniss and Peeta feel. Their situation is impossible, but they do the best they can with what they have.     If this book were all about how awful the world is that the characters live in, then it wouldn't be worth reading. It's the hope that it could possibly get better that makes this book a keeper.     In summary, in case you can't tell, I loved this book! I highly recommend it to all YA and dystopian lovers alike :)
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I had to write something now, but I will update it after I saw them all.     I got it today and I was going to hold off because of the changes. I had a gift card so I did not pay full price. I like the Special Editions so I did not really HAVE to have the originals, although he should have put them in this package just because those were the theatrical releases. The SE's were good minus the Bob Fett in ANH and the Jedi changes. I understand that he had to update SW because they started to look dated, particularly after Terminator 2 came out! For the longest time they were the state of the art in film.     He also updated them because he knew that he was coming with new films, wanted to increase box office rankings for his films AND he used those SE box office receipts to help fund the prequels, just as the 3D version might finally fund the sequels! Updating the films to keep them cutting edge was OK because once they started looking old, they would be viewed as old films which they are, but old like Planet of the Apes or Omega Man old! I am all for update to special effects, but JUST NOT THE STORY and characters! Han shooting first is changing the movie. Vader saying \\"noooo\\" is changing the character to fit after the fact film prequels. That stupid musical in Jedi should be cut as well as anything not needed. It was almost as if he was able to change things and then purposely tried hard to think about what else he could change. Less is more which is why ANH worked so well! They had less money, so they worked more on things that did not require as much money, such as ACTING and STORY. He should stop trying to make the originals fit the prequels when he should have made the prequels better fit the originals!     Now the review: I'll start with the first disc that I popped in - the deleted scenes. The discs take a while to load and I have a high-end Sony player. The discs do have resume which is great! This disc was in some forme of HD formatting, but I can tell that some scenes were taken from a video tape source and the film sprockets had to be fake. I know that that footage cannot be as good as it gets for Star Wars cutting room floor! I think that the scenes were presented in such a way as to avoid anyone from putting together a definitive version of the films!     ANH: These scenes were basically all of the ones that you may have seen on websites but complete with sound and clearer of course. They claim that these were unfinished with the assumption that that is as good as they can get. Some are even in black and white. Hand Solo had a girl, but they cut her out. They could have left that in as it would not have made much of a difference. 99% of these cuts I agree with. You would think that you would like to see the whole scenes film within the movie, but those scenes did nothing more than distract from the main film. It also introduced other characters (Luke's friends) that Lucas would have to explain or keep track of later. These scenes also look less \\"Star Warsy\\" and more terrestrial. Luke had a Kangol and his buddies looked and acted like earthlings. Good cuts, but I would not mind seeing the scenes added with seamless branching!     Empire: This film's deleted scenes were scenes that could be useful to the film, but not really needed. I like the Wampa scenes where the creatures were in the rebel base and even appeared to have an encounter with Darth Vader and his troopers. That added to the fact that they were both on a system that they both did not fully know. They said it was cut due to the Wampa not looking real. I agree, buuut, Lucas COULD have CGI'd a Wampa! I recalled reading about these scenes in an Empire novel/comic book that came out during the release.     There was also a scene right after Luke fought Vader and landed in the Falcon. He and Leia had an extended discussion and Boba Fett was brought up. This should have been kept as we have seen Boba Fett on film and we know he is a bounty hunter. It added moremeat to the plot and the upcoming \\"Jedi.\\" There was also a scene with Lobot getting captured by Storm troopers. It should have been kept. I do not know why they took that out as it was a small, non-distracting scene which explained his fate. I always assume that he took control of the city after Lando left. There were more, but they were mainly extended dialog. Not much was left out of this film as it was close to perfect!     Jedi: THIS film is known for being the worst of the originals. The deleted scenes on this film SHOULD have been added to the actual film! It would have GREATLY filled in plot holes and transitioned certain scenes better. If the deleted scenes were added back, Jedi could easily stand next to ANH and Empire! The main scenes, which I always wondered about all of these years, was where did the gang go right after the sail barge scene? They actually met up in a sand storm and talked about what happened and where they were going. Makes sense to leave that in there!     There was another where Darth talks to Luke with the force and asks him to \\"come to him.\\" Luke is seen building a new light saber! I always asked: \\"where did he get the new green saber from since they do not sell them and he lost his other one?\\" Darth later in the films also says:\\"...I see that you have CONSTRUCTED a new light saber.\\" Would have been nice to put that little scene in the film, it could have made the movie MUCH better! Who decided to cut these is a fool! They SHOULD cut the musical number instead of adding MORE!     There was also a scene with a commander (?) Jejerrod at the Emperor's chambers. He tells Darth Vader that he cannot come in and Vader begins to choke him. He then says that it is on orders of the Emperor and Vader releases him! Also, the red Emperor's Royal Guards are in the back ready for action! This was the only time we could see them doing something other than standing there! They REALLY should have kept this as well! These deleted scenes could have made Return of the Jedi a very great film is they had left the scenes there and it would not have seemed handicapped by plot holes and Ewoks! I would LOOOOOVE to see this \\"special edition\\" with seamless branching! Now THESE are the originals that I want!     Menace: I did not finish this yet, but I did watch and hour and skimmed through to see the digital Yoda. I like the digital Yoda as the puppet seemed scary and looked older than the Empire Yoda. The picture quality is the worst of the series (I did not see another as of yet, but I know from experience) and it originally had a lot of grain. I do not know if the grain and look was to simulate the old days in Star Wars time, but that was the way it was. He cleaned it up - a little too much! Yeah, take some grain out, but not to the point where you lose detail. He tried to make these looked like the last to prequels. He should have known that the last two would look newer than all because they were digital. They should have looked older since they were prequels. I like the grain in Phantom.     I did not finish because I fell asleep! It is still hard to get over Jar-Jar and the picture quality overall looks no better than an upconverted DVD, no lie! There are times when you can easily tell that they are in front of a blue screen and not on location as certain background have no depth to them. I also notice some things that I did not like about this film - Jedis moving fast! When they are burning a hole through the door, they encounter shielded robots and then they both turned into the Flash and dash! Not needed. When they are going into the water where Jar-Jar lives, they are moving then they disappear! I also never liked their Batman styled. Confronted with water? They just happen to have breathing apparatus with them!     When I am done, I will give more. I just give the four stars until then.  UPDATE: 9/19/11    I just finished watching the prequels.  The Phantom Menace seemed to be faster paced this time.  In casepeople do not get what they are about, they are about the Emperor MAKING Anakin and having him infiltrate and take down the Jedi from within while he handles the political side of things.    Professional reviews rave about the prequel picture quality, but I think that they were paid off!  Truthfully, the picture quality is no better than an upconverted DVD on a GREAT Blu-ray player.  The digital film was a bad idea and I think that the only reason he went with it was to better match the CGI with the digital action.  He should have stuck with analog film as it is virtually limitless for the future.      The sound is not as great as they say either (JBL mid-level speakers, 5.1 no sub, Onkyo 2nd from the top of the line receiver and high quality synergistic speaker wire!).  It is good, but not deserving of a 5!  Most reviews gave the sound a 5 while the picture got a 4!  The picture on the prequels deserve more in the range of a 3 - and I am being generous.  It is not bad, but I did not feel the jump to Blu-Ray (60\\" 1080P, 10-bit panel, semi-professionally calibrated) was there.  I did manage to see threading in clothes, but nothing popped off the screen like film titles do.  I suspect that the originals will look a lot better.  So far, I only like the deleted scenes disc!  I usually could care less (but still care about) deleted scenes discs, but this one was special.  I will update on the sequels...
B00005221M|5.0|Interesting plot and story line. An Excellent action adventure Movie but it only despicts a very little of the massive prejudice heaped on the Native population by the white European settlers. The Abenaki Indians of VT, NH and MA really got a RAW DEAL which carries on even to this day. The Federal Govt. refused to acknowledge the Abenaki Nation because the prejudice was sooo bad that the majority of them fled to Canada. There was even a program of sterilazation practiced on the Abenaki by the Goverment of Vermont!!!!!!!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This review is from: Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)<br /><br />I am so sadden by this release it makes me sick as a 38 year old who grew up with the whole Star Wars Series.<br /><br />Keep your old discs because after seeing the new changes I am bummed...<br /><br />skip it and don't waste your hard earned money in this recession.
0439023521|5.0|All I can say is wow! After struggling through Narnia, I needed something that was a bit of a quicker read, and wasn't disappointed with The Hunger Games. I tore through it in about a day and a half. It also kept me awake long after I put it down last night. It has moments of terrible death and murder, along with sweet moments and acts of heroism. I struggle a bit with it being called a kid's book. Collins didn't pull many punches when it came to killing off little kids, but she sure kept me glued to the pages. And of course this is the first in a series, so I have to immediately jump into the next one because she left an awful lot of questions unanswered. The Hunger Games easily stands as one of my top reads for the past six months.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I had to listen to the album about 5 times before I decided I liked it. It wasn't an immediate love like I had for The Fame or The Fame Monster. It's not terrible, and there are a few real good songs on here, but she can do MUCH better. Her lyrics were unbearably corny at times, and the sound was all over the place. She tried to branch out too much and she lost herself in the process. Plus, there really aren't that many songs on here that were single material, and I don't know how she didn't realize that. I saw Gaga live and it was amazing. She's smart and she's really talented and hard-working. I hope she gets her stuff together, and fast.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|After reading most of the reviews I decided to conduct my own test on my Samsung LED 55\\" HDTV. I have the box version with the Portrait of Darth Vader SE, widescreen. After viewing the new Blu-ray version then viewing the older SE version I could see a hugh improvement given to the film quality of being much brighter and clearer but unfortunately I should have not purchased this blu version. Blu-ray technology is great when it comes to newer films being filmed in HD. Lots of the charm of the VHS or older DVD would<br />hide the tape, painted diodes on Vader's suit. I'm a hugh fan and grew up watching the theater release back in 1977. I won't get into the Lucas add-ons (I feel as most others do) I recommend purchasing the box set with Vader and Luke fighting on the box with lots of blue<br />light around them. Another reviewer suggested this and I agree. This gives you both the SE version and the original theater un-altered version. But lots of folks who have these know this and are asking lots of money for a new copy $185. Its too bad that Lucas (control freak) didn't include the original theater version which would have made for a nice contrast. But then again its pretty confusing how many versions Lucas has out there. Too bad he only gets the money, ego and not the emotional tie we all have.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|OK. I was born 1971 and watched the 1st Star Wars movie with 5 1/2. People were giving standing ovations, and our mother had to take me and my older brother the next day again. Needless to say, I love the first three movies. Also needless to say, the three new ones suck (OK, the last one is not bad). Living in Germany at the time, some 15 years ago I bought a VHS THX collectors box of the first three movies in England. My son is now 7 and he loves the Clone Wars, Lego Star Wars etc., so I would really start watching the old movies with him.  I have seen some reviews on the blue rays here, so I was hesitant buying them because of the new additions on top of the old ones. So instead, I searched for the old VHS tapes, connected the old VHS player, and.... oh my God, the quality was really bad.  So I just ordered the three old movies on blue ray, also for these reasons:  (1) Yes, I hate the additions to the old movies, too. Totally unnecessary. But then again, I have to agree with another reviewer, that these additions make up ca. 0.05% of the movies, so who cares?  (2) I guess George Lucas is having a bad conscience selling us the same stuff over and over again. I say, let him do his little additions so he can sleep at night. I had to think about an intro by Matt Groening in the Season 1 DVD box of the Simpsons. He wrote: \\"You bought all the VHS tapes, and now I am selling you the same thing on DVD. And in a few years, when we have a new fancy format, I will sell them to you again\\". He was probably right.  (3) Watching the same movies over and over again may get boring at some point. Trying to find Lucas' modifications actually sounds like fun, and then raging about them even more. By the way: Who shot first: Han or the other guy? C'mon...  May the force be with you, and find all the additions, you may...  ****************************  UPDATE 9-29-11  I have seen The Empire Strikes Back now, and must say that the quality is awesome. Frankly, I did not even notice any differences relative to the original version, but I haven't seen them in a while...
0767817478|1.0|Warning: I spoil the movie!  This movie was not a Godzilla movie at all!  1. Godzilla ran a hid most of the time!  2. Godzilla is suppost to be indestructable!  3. Since when does Godzilla lay eggs?!  4. Matthew Broderick looked like he was just saying his lines half the time!  5. Maria Patillo was such a fake crier!  6. Harry Shearer was annoying with all his news reports!  7. Give the fat mayor thing / gag a rest, please!  8. Kevin Dunn was too hard headed to his co-stars!  9. Vikki Lewis was a great character but seriously under used!  10. Come on, Godzilla needs to have his atomic radioactive fire breath!  11. Godzilla was suppost to knock down buildings not jump on or through them!  12. The whole movie was focused on the human characters and how they coped with the disaster with a giant creature!  13. Sargent O'Neil was not much of a sargent cause he didn't know how to handle a bad situation!  14. The movie had little to no plot!  15. The whole baby zilla thing was too Jurassic Park- ish!  16. How could they possibly loose sight of something that big!  17. Was all that rain really necessary?!    Overall, I did not like this movie! While the action, special effects, set designs, and filming were all good, all the things I mentioned above make this movie very forgettable! Hopefully the next 2012 movie will be better! One can hope...  My grade: D+ or a-star-and-a-half!
0375842209|4.0|All eight or so people in my book club enjoyed The Book Thief, which is a first for anything we've read so far. While not the most complex novel (being written for the young adult market), it's a beautifully written one, with appealing characters and a perspective on World War Two that's not the usual one. For one thing, the story's set in Germany, with German characters. If your literary experience of WWII is centered around British or American viewpoints, this one humanizes the people on the other side of the war.    The other unusual thing about the Book Thief is its narrator, Death himself. It's a strange device, but one that works wonderfully, adding a much-needed layer of poetic remove to circumstances that are normally hard to read about. In this instance, the angel of finality could have been a Bob Dylan character. He has a wry sense of humor and a certain fixation on the facts and statistics of his work, and -- by the way -- doesn't carry a sickle. He's neither cruel nor pitying. He meets everyone eventually, and keeps records. He feels overworked in times of war, and has little more insight into God than we do. He's obsessed with color and skies. And he finds a fascination with a few of the living people he encounters as he makes his rounds, hence the story.    Other protagonists have similar lyrical qualities. There's an impulsive German boy whose hero is Jesse Owens, the black American athlete. There's a profane-mouthed washer woman, whose abusive manner hides a decent heart. There's the book thief herself, whose stealing involves several ironies, not the least of which is that she starts out not being able to read. And there's the matter of a promise from a long time ago, leading to a Jew in a certain basement. While the plot follows somewhat well-worn lines, Zusak's poetic prose and his reconstruction of daily life's small but meaningful moments kept me absorbed.    Death describes it all, in amiable but unsentimental terms. His superhuman perspectivekeeps the sheer awfulness of events in that time and place from overwhelming the story, while allowing the reader to experience the joys and sorrows of several human lives in familiar motion in a darkening world. Perhaps this is a tale for our own troubled moment in history.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The original three Star Wars movies are easily some of the best movies ever made. George Lucas has changed that with his incessant, pointless editing. Instead of Han starting out as a cut-throat, which he was, Lucas tries to paint a prettier picture by having him shoot second. Then the ridiculous scene with the CGI Jabba, which stands out worse than anything, continues the downhill slide. The original trilogy is now full of edited scenes, CGI bits that look awful, and changes that make no sense. George Lucas should know that while people love Star Wars, they love the original Star Wars. There's a reason that he made the prequels, because the originals (which you can only buy on DVD in one release (2008) which is twice the price of the whole 6 Blu-Ray movies) were awesome.   Just like Darth Vader now says \\"NOOOO\\" to the Emperor, everyone needs to say no to George Lucas and not buy this \\"Star Wars\\" release.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has already been exhaustively reviewed by readers so I won't spend much time on it except to say that I thoroughly and totally enjoyed it.  The writing is great: who doesn't enjoy a coming of age, battling evil and getting the girl kind of story?  Cline knows his stuff, from the 80s trivia to networks to gaming.  The only drawback to some might be that he dives deep into the geek ocean and might create a bit of confusion.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I understand all the fustration out there (with all the one star ratings). However, you must admit, this is an awesome box set! The sound and video are top notch, you cannot ask for anything better. Be realistic, does it really matter (in a scene from ESB) if Lando said, \\"attention\\" once or twice?, OR, the color of R2D2's panel is blue or black?, OR, (in a scene from ROTJ), Luke is shown hugging Antilles?  These are relevent only to the perfectionist. It doesn't matter if all the \\"I's\\" are not dotted or all the \\"J's\\" are not hooked up the the left. This is not LOTRs where 30 - 50 minutes are not included - these are minor issues.  Just enjoy the movies because they are that good!
B004LUS390|3.0|This really is the best sketch app out there. from what I've seen on YouTube, it isn't nearly as responsive as the iPhone version. Sometimes you have to swipe multiple times to get it to draw, and I've still het to get the &quot;two-hold&quot; for color selector to work. overall, a good app worth the dollar. HTC Thunderbolt.
1573229725|4.0|I heard about the movie first before I knew it was an adaptation of this book. However like a good book lover I read this before I watched the movie. I loved that it was from both of the main character's point of view and loved seeing the wheels turning in there heads. I loved the attention to detail. This is definitely a book I will read more than once.

B0050G3NWG|2.0|Citizen Kane is quite rightly praised as one of the best American movies of all time.  That's not the problem; the problem is this Blu Ray print which I find to be overly contrast-y.  So much so that there is little detail in the blacks.  This is not the way I remember seeing it previously, and I don't believe that the brilliant cinematographer Gregg Toland would approve of this transfer.  I also A-B compared it to a previous DVD special edition, and I don't find the resolution of the film much improved in the Blu Ray version.  Indeed, I think I prefer the contrast ratio of the DVD version, which in itself I find also is problematic as far as contrast ratio and overall view-ability.  Very disappointed.

I think it actually could have been a good idea, but any good feelings I had about the movie were spoiled by the sick feeling I had in my stomach after it was over.

B0055V6EZE|1.0|I listened to this load three times and reached the same conclusion all three times...this is the most boring compilation i have heard in a long, long time. i mean i was looking forward to the news and i hate Brian Williams.<br />the only song worth a diddly is the next to last one but then Tom Jones is singing it and he must have had his own group of players with him. i was looking forward to old tunes with a new twist. this collection is a group of old tunes done with no twist. (if rocking out to \\"swannee river\\" is your beat, then, by all means, rock on!)<br />this guy needs to eat some grits, crop a share or hoe a row (read the insert) and get some soul! that is if he wants to do southern american music or maybe a shot or twelve of homebrew might have loosened up his tight arse and he could have put out some hotter sounds.<br />anyway i paid too much for too little.
B001IF252M|5.0|I could have gotten the cheaper knock off's for $10 or $15 but I didn't want to deal w/ having my new computer arrive, then not being able to use it w/ my old D-sub input only monitor and having to ship back the generic adapter.  I figured since I already spent the money to buy a new Mac, why not spend the $30 and get the genuine Apple Mini Display port to VGA adapter.  It hooked right up to the Mini Display Port on my mac and the VGA cable to my monitor.  Booted up, saw the start up screen and everything has worked flawless for months.    I have since gotten a new monitor with HDMI input so don't use the MDP to VGA adapater anymore but it worked flawlessly.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This movie is incredible. When i walked out of the Cinema I literally had goosebumps all down my back. This is not normal for me, most films i appreciate for their plot and direction but this movie made me wonder about the role of human life and if we are here for a reason, or if we are just a fluke.     Mallick directs this film masterfully. Mallick puts together a huge variety of images that generate sensations that together form a unifying theory of life and what it means to be human. The acting is phenomenal with Brad Pitt doing an excellent job representing nature that seems to not care very much for humanity, and Jessica Chastain representing the way of grace and kindness that we all see in each other to some degree or another. the character played by Sean Penn and Hunter McCracken represents what happens when one is conflicted between the two ideologies represented by his/her parents. The film shows that these questions and insecurities go beyond childhood and can plague a person into their adult life. Words cannot describe this movie, just as sometimes they cannot describe a feeling.    This movie is not for everyone however. If you are the type who doesn't care for films that move along at a slow pace and don't have a concrete plot that can be understood on the first watching, you will be bored. If you however enjoy cerebral movies that leave you thinking, you will love this film.
0679805273|1.0|Having received 3 copies of this book on high school graduation and 2 more following college, I implore others to refrain from purchasing this book.  A student headed to college or their first job would get so much more from either (1) useful items for their dorm room or apartment or (2) books geared towards personal finance, leadership or other professional/executive training - years later, topics I wish I knew more about when I was young.
B001O54NL2|5.0|Gosh, this is one beautiful CD.  It sounds as heavenly to me now as it did then.  It was re-issued with all of it's music resonating exactly where it's supposed to.  Ah...sailing...takes me away to where I've always heard it could be...just a dream and the wind to carry...and soon I will be free. I'm happy!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars has never looked better. Of course there are some changes that I don't agree with but I certainly won't make remarks like \\"Lucas raped my childhood\\". For goodness sake just throw on your old VHS copy. Star Wars was made to be viewed in high definition. Movies are meant for entertainment purposes & I'm entertained....

B0050SYS5A|1.0|I'm one of the many that can't get this to work at all.  Hugely disappointing.  Above the TV, below the TV, doesn't matter.  Won't even see me when I try to recalibrate.  Hand gestures all over the map, stuttering and random.  Wasted 45 minutes on this, but it's garbage.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I am so happy to finally see the pilot episode included with this edition. My sister and I were in high school when Twin Peaks came out. It was such an awesome show and we couldn't get enough. I loved loved loved Audrey's character. And everyone wanted to know just who killed Laura Palmer??<br /><br />I have to admit Season Two wasn't quite as awesome as Season One but I still loved it. I was sad to see the series end at only two seasons. It felt like in a blink of an eye, gone. I was glad to see that a prequel movie Fire Walk With Me was made to explain( and some confusing) things about...well pretty much everything but especially Laura's involvement.<br /><br />If you like odd but unique & quirky shows, Twin Peaks is a must see. This collection is a must have for the fans.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Received my BluRay edition of The Star War Trilogy today and have already watched the first 3 movies. The quality is excellent. It is everything I hoped it would be. Sorry all you complainers but I think it is fantastic and it couldn't be any better. Already own the originals and that's good enough for me.

B003L77GRO|4.0|With Rita gone Dexter is free to resume his passion, and he does it with typical aplomb.  Rita's character had grown annoying, although the actress who played her did an excellent job.  Enter Julia Stiles.  It took a few episodes for her to grow on me, but her expressive face conveyed the trauma she had experienced, and she was a formidable partner for Dexter.  I don't know that her departure was very well explained, but I am reasonably sure that Michael C. Hall's actress wife was glad to see her go.  Was it my imagination or dod she ooze anger in her role as Dexter's sister--anger that had little to do with the story line?
0553801473|1.0|I was late coming to this series and have read all five books one after another. Books 1,2 and 3 were brilliant and held so much promise. Book 4 seemed to wander around as if the author was struggling to find a coherent story to tell. Book 5 is no more than a continuance of that lack of cohesion, although the level of brutality is incomprehensively raised to a new and excessive level, and the reach-backs to explain things stated as fact in Book 4 were annoying and unnecessary. All in all, the series has lost all of its steam. It seems Martin has no idea where to take all of this next or how to end it. If there is a Book 6, I'll probably read it, though I expect no more than more disjointed and pointless minor episodes that have little or no connective tissue between them. Put simply, Martin can, and probably should, just put a fork in it, it's done.<br /><br />As to the HBO series, there is a Season 2 on the way, and maybe a Season 3, but I doubt it will go much beyond that. There is no cohesive story that could be dramatized in Books 4 and 5. Maybe if Martin moves quickly and manages to complete a Book 6 that actually brings an end to the ramblings, some producer might see some value in combining Books 4,5 and 6 into one final season, but I doubt it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|You have got to be kidding me, thats it after all these years and with the advancments in digital technology this is the best you could come up with? some fake rocks a few pointless extras and brighter colors. no extended footage added to the films, no digital make ups and damnit greedo did not shoot first!.....george lucas...i hate you...i officially hate you, if i were you i wouldnt even bother releasing these in 3D next year. on a side note you dont get to all the extra stuff unless you buy the complete saga package and even with that they have composed 3 count'em 3 special features discs full of stuff that you can see on youtube. dont waste your money like i did.
1594744769|4.0|A very creative and intriguing story. It appears to be the first in a series, and if it's not it should be. The use of old \\"found\\" photographs (the real thing) is an especially interesting touch since the photos are strange in ways that totally support the story. A fast and enjoyable reading experience.

Where's the stuff from the photo? Did I completely misundestand what I was ordering? I feel like I was ripped off.
B0058A119G|5.0|Al over again I'm amazed, I love the combination of Barbra and the Bergmans. Alan ans Marylin Bergman have a way with words and music, and Barbra can translate them so beautiful that you can feel them. (like the song I'll never say goodbye; 'If I can barely say goodnight, how could I ever say goodbye' , isn't that beautiful?)  This is one of the albums you can listen too over and over again and get goosebumps every time.
1612130585|5.0|I loved it. It was a different experience than the first one; the pace is much slower, even though there are a lot of outside forces and complications when there weren't in the previous one. The chemistry is as sizzling as ever though (whew! *fan please!*), the romance is sweeter, and there is lovely humor. Biggest criticism: Ana got on my nerves as she did not in the previous book.<br /><br />THE ROMANCE:<br />Yes, Fifty can actually be quite romantic, ladies! The relationship between Ana and Christian is as hot and sweet - actually, much sweeter - as ever. We get to see the soft, vulnerable, and romantic side of Christian, which I found absolutely lovely. The chemistry was very much still there though. *sizzle* There's one seen in the library on the billiard table ... need I say more? I would play pool with Fifty any day. Oh. My. Lord! *desperately fans self* I would also go with him to the following places ... hmm, let's see: elevator, catamaran, piano, another elevator, desk in the home office, shower, bathtub, apartment entryway, Red Room, family boathouse, childhood bedroom, regular bed (of course) - and would request a repeat of the first elevator, billiard table, piano, and childhood bedroom. *wink* *wink*<br /><br />CHRISTIAN GREY, aka FIFTY SHADES, aka ONE OF THE BEST \\"ROMANCE\\" HEROES EVER:<br />We see much more of Christian's boyishness and sweet side that we started to see at the end of the last book. He also has this wonderfully adorable new \\"shy\\" smile that he starts to show more and more to Ana as he begins to believe in her love for him. We really start to see his needier side, as well as his utter self-abhorrence and profound (if ignored) desire for unconditional love. Never became unsexy though, which I feel like it could easily have become, so James pulled that off well.<br /><br />I did start to question his beyond-anything desire for and dependence on Ana. That may have something to do with the fact that she was annoying me in the first half of the book of course (see below). His need, love, and - let's be honest - downright obsession with her is such that the reader has to love Ana as well in order to accept it as authentic.<br /><br />We find out the Thing that he was convinced in part 1 would send her running and ... I don't know. Didn't find it as shocking as Ana did and as I think we were supposed to. We find out why he did what he did / does what he does / needs what he needs and how that has been changed by Ana. I'm not sure how people will feel about the change. Christian still has his rough side; he's still a dominant personality; he's still as controlling as unbelievably-ever.<br /><br />SOME CRITICISMS:<br />A lot of things that some of my GR friends had mentioned annoyed them in the first one and that I hadn't noticed or hadn't bothered me now did in this one. Not everything, but the inner goddess is one example.<br /><br />The main one was Ana. I really loved Ana in Part 1 and I know some people didn't, but I did and I'm sticking to it. Here, I had problems with her in the first half or so. Her fan club continued to grow, which doesn't fit with the type of girl she's set up to be. More importantly, she was petulant and immature, in some ways just as mercurial and moody as Fifty, but while he's sexy and mysterious in his personality disorder, she was annoying. Ana shaped up in the second half, being much more consistent and mature, and by the end she was stepping up to the plate and back in my good graces.<br /><br />NOTE ON FIFTY SHADE SERIES AND BOOK ENDINGS:<br />No spoilers! These cannot and should not be read on their own. It's basically one long story broken up into three parts, so start with the first Fifty Shades book, [[ASIN:1612130283 Fifty Shades of Grey]]. For those who hated the \\"cliffhanger\\" ending of part 1, this is part 2, so again not everything is resolved, however we are not left with a cliffhanger regarding Ana and Christian's relationship, so I think most will find it completely acceptable (i.e. bearable).<br /><br />PROGRESSION OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP:<br />Part 1 was all about the newness of their connection. That part of the story has all of the excitement of a new crush: it's fun, dangerous, makes you giddy, and holy crap was the tension unbelievable! Here, Ana and Christian seemed to have found their stride and really started to work on their issues. At the beginning, it seemed a little too convenient for me and I wasn't sure I fully accepted what Christian was saying and offering. However it wasn't as much of a 180 as I thought it would be, so by the end I was completely convinced and found the change believable.<br /><br />I predict that Part 3 will be more about the settling in of their relationship: the smaller details and the really getting comfortable with one another. I'm looking forward to reading it, because hey: how could I not want to read another book with Fifty Shades in it? There are going to be some evil doers who come back to add some excitement to the mix and I am interested in seeing how it all plays out ... But yeah, I'll mostly be back for Fifty. Okay, fiiiiine. Truth: I'll solely be back for Fifty. ;-)as all about the newness of their connection.

140053271X|4.0|During hollidays, spent under the bright sun with my iPad as a reading device, I was jealously looking at the people using proper e-book readers. Searching for the best matching one, I've found 2 interesting: Barnes & Noble Nook Touch and Kobo Touch. My decision was based on the page-turning knobs implemented in the shell, which were lacking in Kobo device. I'm quite happy with Nook Touch, allthough don't really understand the politics behind the sale of the electronic books outside of North America. It's simply impossible to buy smething from NB, not having an adress in States or Canada. DRM coded books can be readed, but without the cover image - probably software issue. Few times, while pressing over the word, which of course highlighted the marking (without choosing any options) it went out of response from the touch screen. The only solution was, either to plug the USB cable, or wait until the device can be accessed - meaning at least one hour.   Well, as a gift for my doughter, Nook Touch is perfect, small, light and stylish. For me, I'm gonna wait for an Amazon Kindle Touch device with a Pearl e-ink matrix.

I read a few pages then put it down. Once I did finally allow myself to read it, it went very quickly. There are some slow points to the story when I couldn't help but think \\"come on guys, you don't have much time\\" since that bastard Tom Culpepper was on the hunt again. But other than a few slow moments, the story arc continued, giving Grace and Sam a sort of happy ending.<br /><br />Sam is holding on, barely. He's lost without Grace and he doesn't know when he'll see her again, if he'll see her again. Their positions have shifted with Grace the wolf and Sam the possibly cured human. Sam is questioning his position in life. He no longer has the pack to give him that sense of place but being human without Grace has left him adrift. I liked that Sam didn't slide easily into his human role but struggles with it. If he had made the adjustment easily, it would have lessened the importance of his wolf. Sam's wolf is still with him, under the surface, dormant until the right trigger occurs.<br /><br />Grace is not the girl we first met in Shiver. She still has some of the same characteristics but she has also made some changes, and not just the fury kind. She's becoming less concerned with what her parents think of her and with trying to please them. She's always been portrayed as being mature for her age but now she's taken that maturity and used it to help herself and the people closest to her. I like how she's become the adult Grace and left the insecure Grace behind.<br /><br />Cole is playing mad scientist, turning Beck's house into his chaotic lab. Cole's experiments are dangerous with possible fatal outcomes. Cole uses himself as the guinea pig with his usual recklessness. He's not this pampered rock star anymore but has morphed into a man driven by desperation to find the cause of the werewolf virus. I loved when Cole was on the page. He could be harsh and impulsive but it didn't come from being self-centered but rather from his need to know and to prove to his father that he could do this, could be more than a irresponsible rock star. Cole definitely brought a much needed edge to the story.<br /><br />Isabel is the only one of the main four characters that is not a werewolf. That doesn't mean that she doesn't play an important role in the lives of Sam, Grace and Cole. She's still has an odd relationship with Cole. In another world where things were normal, they might have dated but in the world of Mercy Falls there is not room for normal. Still, I liked Isabel's role and how she finally stopped worrying about the consequences of her actions, how it would affect her, and did the right thing.<br /><br />We learn more about Cole and Sam's backgrounds and what got them to this point in their lives. We also learn more of both of their relationships with Beck and how each saw Beck. There is something similar to sibling rivalry between these two when it comes to Beck. I found the dynamics of the four (Sam, Grace, Cole & Isabel) interesting in how they worked together towards a single purpose, setting aside any distrust or hurt they might have felt. It made the story far more interesting than having them cheerfully working together towards that goal.<br /><br />As this is the final book in the trilogy, it didn't have that feeling of finality. It felt more like the end of a season, with a long wait until the return. I hope there are more books about these characters, there are certainly more stories to be told about them. I would say Forever gave us a for now ending with the potential for more.he cause of the werewolf virus. I loved when Cole was on the page.

B0046MVVOW|4.0|I have to start with some background on how I got this: I absolutely love Britney's \\"Femme Fatal\\" album, and of course Ke$ha co-wrote the smash-hit \\"Till the World Ends\\" from that album. My daughter kept telling me this sumemr \\"you gotta check out Ke$ha, you'll love it\\", but I never gave it much thought (nor do I listen to mainstream commercial radio). Last month I was visiting Edinburgh, Scotland and there I saw this 2 CD set on sale at a large CD store for such a ridiculously low amount (5 British pounds for the set) that I just had to pick it up, sound unheard. Came home and my daughter suggested I start with the Cannibal CD, and so I did.<br /><br />\\"Animal + Cannibal\\" (2 CDs; 26 tracks; 90 min., plus 3 videos) is the combo \\"special deluxe edition\\" of Ke$ha's 2 albums from last year. \\"Cannibal\\" (10 tracks; 36 min.) is an incredibly strong collection, with hardly any filler on it. The first 4 tracks \\"Cannibal\\", \\"We R Who We R\\", \\"Sleazy\\" and \\"Blow\\" are (along with some of Britney's new stuff) some of the most enjoyable and infectuous mainstream stuff that I've heard in a long time. After a so-so \\"The Harold Song\\", it immediately picks up again with great stuff like \\"Crazy Beautiful Life\\" and \\"C U Next Tuesday\\". The final track \\"The Sleazy Remix\\" is not much of a remix, to be honest. This \\"deluxe\\" edition also contains 3 music videos (Stephen; Animal; Take It Off). I rate \\"Cannibal\\" 4.5 stars.<br /><br />\\"Animal\\" (16 tracks, including 2 bonus tracks; 54 min.) is not nearly as strong for me compared to \\"Cannibal\\". Sure, there are several great tracks such as opener \\"Your Love Is My Drug\\", \\"Take It Off\\", \\"Blah Blah Blah\\", and a few others. Knowing how big a hit \\"Tik Tok\\" had been, I couldn't help but be disappointed when I heard it, as it certainly isn't the strongest song on here. This \\"deluxe\\" edition comes with two bonus tracks: the excellent \\"VIP\\" and the okay \\"Dirty Picture\\". I rate \\"Animal\\" 3.5 stars.<br /><br />In all, quite the collection, and for what I paid for it in Scotland, an absolute steal!absolute steal!
B003F3NEBG|4.0|of course the movie is wonderful - but i wondered about buying the blu ray.  i am SO glad i did!  it is a completely different experience of viewing.  we noticed so many things we had never noticed or seen before; i couldn't even list them all.  the blu ray lights it up and the colors are rich and the textures and wallpapers....amazing.  you see the textures of the costumes that you never noticed at all previously.  you see people and their reactions - sitting behind the main characters - you never noticed them even being there before.<br /><br />this would have been my only criticism of the movie in the past - the whole pallette was a bit washed out and dull.  it is neither washed out nor dull any more.  anyone who enjoys this movie will LOVE it in blu ray.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I read some of the other reviews where people weren't happy with the storyline or the characters... I have no idea why someone would be unhappy with this season of Dexter! I love this show because there's always an unexpected twist that keeps you guessing until the very end, and this season does not disappoint!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|love this book too. arya's new found skills. dany's new power. the greenseer found. can't wait for knowing what bran can do. ah.. mr martin i hope your health is good and finish this series before anything happens to you!
B0054N73EY|3.0|Wahhhh! If Y'all want their old sound....guess what...buy their old albums!! This isnt their best, but it isnt their worst. Just glad to know they're still around. Artists constantly evolve and experiment. Especially outfits who's been around as long as they have. The album is slightly above average to me..
1594744475|5.0|I have learned alot about bento's from this book. So glad that I bought it. The kids now love opening their lunches to find out what I put in then.
030788743X|5.0|An amazing novel for both our current generation and those to come. For the Generation Xers who have children and for those children (like mine) who have never known a time when we didn't have computers and the Internet. It is one of those books you never forget. I will carry it with me in that virtual inventory like the egg that it is. Cudos to Ernie. Great job.
1423124960|5.0|Great book! My 2 1/2 year old makes me read it every night before bed! Stories are a good length! =] Recommended for all princess lovers!
B004WCTLNY|4.0|It is not very often that you will encounter such a movie genre mix like this one. The last such mixture that I stumbled upon was: [[ASIN:B000HEWEE4 The Lake House (Widescreen Edition)]]. If you enjoyed the Lake House, you will also like this one.<br /><br />This movie is loosely based on the concept of 'angelic intervention', however, these beings come across more like the agents in the Matrix, but with hats.<br /><br />Although the plot was pretty well written, you get the feeling that more should have been done to raise the level of suspence. A big let down for me was that you never got to see the 'chairman'.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|First of all, it's sad that so many people still believe in this garbage bull crap. There is no being in this universe or multiverse that created what we are. It's a natural process that only our known planet does. You need to go watch 'Curiosity' on the Discovery Channel, an episode called 'Did god create the Universe', &amp; even the smartest man dying, Steven Hawking, will tell you &quot;No, there is no possible way any being could have created our universe&quot;. Not exactly a quote, now go learn more about science you brainwashed morons.
B0058A119G|5.0|Love this new CD from Babs!  You have to get it, listen to it and enjoy!  Still an amazing voice and great songs!
B0034G4P8A|2.0|Thor is weak. Too much fake and bad visual effects and ridiculos actions. What is the main actor, a Brad Pitt mixed with a ...??? And Natalie Portman is completely lost. Bad movie and I saw in Blu-ray.
B005DZMODI|2.0|I will keep it simple. If Clapton's name wasn't on the sleeve you wouldn't know he was a perfrormer. This should have been titled The Wynton Marsalis Jazz Orchestra at Lincoln Center. Don't waste your money,folks.
0061997811|5.0|Este libro ha sido una de mis mejores adquisiones en material de Harry Potter, en este se puede ver realmente como ocurre la magia escrita por J.K. Rowling, espero con ansias el otro
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I originally overlooked this thing because it's made specifically for gaming and I didn't realize how flexible it is. I was looking for something to replace my Logitech Nulooq, a customizable peripheral for design work which is no longer supported by Logitech and doesn't work in OS X Lion. The G13 does work in Lion and it allows you to create a massive amount of shortcuts and macros for any program on your computer. It's changed the way I use all of my design software like Photoshop, Flash, InDesign, etc..     With 29 customizable keys (programmable joystick included) and the ability assign up to 3 functions to each key, its tough to run out of buttons to fill. For example, if I'm doing a lot of color correction in Photoshop, I can create one level (M1 Button) of shortcuts that has the main tools at easy access for that. Then if I'm doing a lot of masking, I can have another level (M2) that holds a completely different configuration that is more practical for that task. And again with the M3 button for yet another configuration, all very quickly accessible.    It takes a little while to get fully set up and accustomed to your key setup, but once you get used to it you'll find it hard to function without it. A nice thing about the software is that it's incredibly quick and easy to add to or modify the key assignments to suit your working style.    I have even used it for gaming (go figure) as well and it does a damn good job of that too. Worth every penny.
B0034G4P8A|3.0|I thought this movie was ok. Way better than Captain America though. The effects were top notch, and you can expect nothing less from a Marvel movie these days. Substance not so much though. Any way, could have saved myself $24 and just rented it. As a movie collector I like to buy movies that I can watch over and over again. This is probably going to collect dust on my rack.
B0015RFCZ0|1.0|This movie is toxic to gray matter. My brain is in ICU - my family is praying for its recovery. Seriously, though this movie was a bad acid trip, replete with scattered characters, hazy plot, robotic acting, and a script you so banal it couldn't pass as a Microsoft Word template on which to build a real story. Oh, my head.
B004EPZ070|1.0|Awful plot, terrible script, totally unsympathetic/unbelievable characters. I hated this movie!  The whole thing is about cheating and dishonesty.  I am a sucker for a romance comedy or chick flick, but this movie is trash.  In my opinion it is terrible, a complete waste of time. Definitely one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.
B0000041Q3|5.0|I don't profess to add much to the multitude of well written reviews already existing on this recording, but I thought a personal perspective may be useful, having performed Turandot and seen it live.     What grabs me about Mehta's Turandot is the sense of vulnerability you feel for the singers, particularly Sutherland. It doesn't feel like it is the 50th take in the studio in an attempt to attain technical perfection, rather, it feels like it is one of those incredibly special live concerts where you hang on every single note, hoping that you will be rewarded with perfection. In this case, you most certainly are! This to me is the basis for the amazing sense of excitement this recording conveys. Bravo!
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I am still amazed how Chris O'Donell still looks hot with his age and 5 kids later. LL Cool J is still suave and smooth. I love this show much much better than the original. It's very entertaining and I never was once bored watching an episode. So hope more seasons to come.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I didn't think that Pink Floyd would come back well, until I heard this album. The instrumentals are amazing. Many of the songs have impressive harmonies, complimenting the Floyd style guitar to sooth your very soul. I listen to this while surfing, and playing video games like Halo and Star Wars: Battlefront. It's also great ambient music. The consistently slow beat is easy to listen to, soft enough to talk over, and doesn't annoy passers-by. Highly recommended for any person needing some good, relaxing tunes.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|IMAGINE JASON BORNE MEETS ALICE IN WONDERLAND - Expect quirky European film with the thrills of a Borne, but with overtones of Narnia and Alice In Wonderland. Not your typical Hollywood film. If you want mindless violence this movie is not for you. If you want beauty and a slower paced film you will love this.
B0055S348W|4.0|According to the printershare website this is the mobile Android version with unlimited printing. Other reviewers have suggested that you will only get 20 pages and then charged a monthly rate which is incorrect. The one thing that I do not like is it only prints gmail and not k9 or other email.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have just watched the first hour of New Hope and Phantom Menance as a representation of the newer movies and older ones. They are both breathtakingly good in this set, exceeding every expectation I had. New Hope has a clarity, crispness, and detail that has to be seen to believe. Almost every second reveals never before depth and details.<br /><br />Phantom so far is breathtakingly colorful, rich, lush, and detailed. The sound is also amazing. I haven't had a problem with scrathing from the packaging. And the packaging is superbly artistcally done. Each disc has its own sleeve and a fine painting from a classic scene/ or characters from each movie. I haven't had time to enjoy the extras but there are a lot. Finally from a value standpoint. At the time of release the price comes to $13.33 per movie. An unbelivable deal for what you are getting.<br /><br />In the end for all the haters what I feel most toward them is pity. I wonder how many of the one star pre-release reviews, not basing those review on the actual product in hand of course, are actually not going to get the set. Talk about spiting in your own face. And their reaction to me is the very definition of not seeing the forest for the trees. So Lucas makes a few changes. Totally what? 0.005% of the overall movie scenes? And for that all the venome and hate? Especially when Lucas could have charged A LOT more for this and done a vastly inferior job. My sincere thanks George. While I might not agree with everything he does, and I certainly was not enthralled with everything about the first three movies, these Blu-Rays deliver everything you could hope for from a Blu-ray<br /><br />This Blu-ray set takes home movie watching to a new level. And I have the LOTR Blu-rays as well. If someone reading this is a 'fan' and also a 'hater' can take a deep breath, read the reviews of people who have seen these and then decide what you want to do. Hold on to the hate and stew? Or release the hate and treat yourself to the most amazing Star Wars experience you can have to date. If you are a Star Wars fans and you want to enjoy the 6 movies warts and all from a story telling perspective (not Blu ray quality perspective), then you deserve to treat yourself to this set. Do not let anger lead to hate. Especially as that anger is misplaced. George gave a lot to fans this time, one hell of a lot. Do not let the haters steer you to the Dark Side. Their anger is misplaced and they are only hurting themselves. Pass on this if you wish, but you are missing out on a truly stunning piece of home movie watching. By far the most beautiful set of Star Wars movies ever.experience you can have to date.

0553801473|1.0|Waited forever for this book to come out to continue the fantastic story line.<br /><br />Guess what<br /><br />Nothing happens to actually advance the story or plot.  Waited how many years for this garbage?
B001L51RQE|5.0|Awesome.  Tremendous buy for any Police fan.  You cannot go wrong purchasing this CD DVD set.  Everything you want to hear.
0751517089|4.0|This is a truly captivating book for all who have an interest in financial markets. As an insight into how large financial institutions operate, it is a must read for auditors, students and managers in how not to run a business. The pace is fast with the onsetting panic of Leeson being palpable as he races towards the inevitable crash. The Ewan McGregor movie obviously stuck close to the book, but if you have already seen the film it will not distract from the book which adds more layers of complexity to the story. Well written, amazing insights and some thoughtful life lessons given.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Compared to the desktop, iPhone, iPad, and Windows Phone 7 versions, the Android version has much, much less content. It's not a small difference. The Android version has less than half the content as what any other platform has. And there's no social gaming, unlike iOS (Gamecenter) and WP7 (Xbox Live). It's still PvZ, but it's not the whole PvZ.<br /><br />There's also some weird graphical bugs on my Samsung Galaxy S II and the PopCap logo doesn't even display as a circle like it's supposed to. I would recommend waiting until it's much more polished than it is now.
B005ISQEF4|5.0|Dark movie I could not what to see what he would do next.I just wonder who's house Hesher will be visiting next. I watch alot of movies I would say this one is in my top five this year.

1847392148|4.0|I bought this item because of the way it's written; it's for sure a nice experimental book. I thought it had more textures in it and stuff but it's just printed. Anyway it's a great item for any Indiana Jones fan, contains funny facts and info regarding every movie! Updated, it includes the last movie as well.  I would recommend it to any Indy Jones fan.
B0055S348W|5.0|worked seamlessly with Droid X and HP printer.  don't think I would have paid 12$ but free as app of the?  hell yes.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|How do you beat the Z map on normal? Ive tried it for days and still fun. But how do you beat it?
B0055S348W|5.0|I never review apps, this one is great. Uploaded easily, prints perfectly, Amazon Appstore works for me. Good apps every day.
0439023521|5.0|Came across this book while looking for a new series for my 13 year old.  The premise....sounds absolutely awful, however this book is in my top 5 all time favorites!  Suzanne Collins had me riveted, I could not put it down until I was finished and was upset I didn't have the 2nd book in hand immediately. I have suggested this series to at least 30 people, ranging in age from 12-65, not a single person has been disappointed.  Many of the readers have thanked me profusely for the suggestion!  The characters are facinating, lovable, hateful and painted exquisitely!  Fantastic read for all!
B0055S348W|5.0|If I would have known this worked so easy I would have got it earlier. My droid might as well be a laptop now! there are a lot of apps like this but this is the first I've seen work completely
0439023491|5.0|This book holds it's own as a follow up to The Hunger Games.  Amazing story for any age.  Fantastic characters old and new!  I have yet to meet a person who doesn't love it.  My daughter (14) & I have read it multiple times and love it.  I have suggested this series to over 30 people from 12-65 years old and have never heard anything but rave reviews.  Leaves you on pins & needles for the 3rd book!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|What a performamce !! Matt plays the slick Lincoln Lawyer perfectly.                Hope there is a Lincoln Lawyer 2 !!    Don't miss this !!
0439023513|5.0|I am completely shocked there are anything but 5 star reviews for this book and the entire series!  The only negative comment I have is that I want a 4th, 5th, & 6th book!  I want to continue reading about the characters and learn more about their lives.  I am an avid reader, have read thousands of books, many series and this series in particular rates in the top 3 favorites of all time.  I read this with my teenage daughter and we were both glued to the book until done.  I was only disappointed when it ended.  Only because...it ended and we wanted more!  No matter the age, this series is near impossible to put down and not love.  Must read for everyone out there.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|After removing the plastic and taking out the 9 disc collection I was in total shock of how beautiful the package was.  Each disc is contained in a very nice thick stock and opens likes a book. There really isn't a point to get into too many details because it is by far some of the best material that I have bought on Blu-Ray.  If you are a \\"True\\" Star Wars fan and love Blu-Ray then you must buy this set. This is sent out to all of the \\"haters\\" for the new changes, like George Lucas says, \\"Grow up\\" and enjoy the films for what they are.  Truly a masterpiece that can never be duplicated.
B0055S348W|5.0|thanks Amazon! this app is great. installed and printing in minutes. a definite keeper.  lg optimus m with wireless canon.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The game looks and plays just like it does in every other form I've ever played (pc, ps3 and 360) most of the time I think people just have to bitch about something cause they have nothing better to do with their time. Great game...works great! People quit bitching about everything!
B00000FC5H|5.0|There are more extensive collections out there: the three disc \\"The Eternal Dance\\", the two disc \\"The Essential Earth Wind & Fire\\", but this single disc cuts right to the chase and delivers an entire CD's worth of the group's best and most beloved material.<br /><br />You can put this on at a party, let it play in its entirety, and not hear one complaint about any of the music, not only since EWF are one of the best groups ever, but they had so many hits that even someone who says they're not a fan is familiar with at least half of these tracks, and they upheld the quality along the way.<br /><br />An indispensable CD if EVER there was one.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is the second book in The Hunger Games trilogy, a dystopian fiction young adult book which has crossed over to be enjoyed by adults, and a movie based on The Hunger Games is to be released in 2012.<br /><br />My review will not contain spoilers so it will be shorter than I would typically write. At the end of The Hunger Games we are left knowing the Capitol hates Katniss Everdeen and we wonder if they may seek revenge or how the rest of her life may turn out. What happens, the way the Capitol seeks to get revenge on Katniss is horrifying and was surprising to me, so I'll not spoil it for you either. Catching Fire takes place the year after Katniss participated in The Hunger Games, and the 75th Hunger Games are to be held that year.<br /><br />Catching Fire is just as exciting and action filled as The Hunger Games. It is a fast read, engaging and a real page turner. As the book goes on we see a darker side of the Capitol and we see revolution spreading among the districts.<br /><br />The book has a great ending and it left me wondering what was in store for the third and last book in the trilogy. I was so happy with the first two books I could not wait to get my hands on the third book, titled Mockingjay.<br /><br />Although the main character of the book is female that does not prevent male teenaged readers from enjoying this series. (My thirteen year old son loves the trilogy.) This is not a girlie book. This book is excellent for reluctant readers and any reader who likes exciting, fast paced reads. This series continues to be an excellent hero's journey tale. I am so happy that Catching Fire lived up to The Hunger Games.<br /><br />I rate this book 5 stars = I Love It.
0670022411|1.0|[[ASIN:B004DI7HZ6 A Discovery of Witches: A Novel]]<br /><br />I bought this book because of the review...\\"A Discovery of Witches is [a] heady mix of history and magic, mythology....\\"  I expected to find that because the Author is a history professor. Her characters are imaginative and creative. The book over all is well written, but it is boring, drags with very little history.<br /><br />The last one third of the book has life, it moves. There is a semblance of a story. I didn't realize until the last few chapters that there wasn't going to be enough pages left to complete the story. But, alas, the book is about 400 pages too long and is very, very boring.
1442419814|4.0|I am a homeschooling mother teaching a dystopian literature class to my grade 9 son and this is one of the young adult selections we are both reading. We both enjoy reading dystopian stories.<br /><br />I liked UGLIES for its fast action and how it serves as a great \\"escape read\\" that pulls you in and carries you away. It is an easy fast read. You feel like you are in the action. The action dominates the story rather than character development though, which is a disappointment for me.<br /><br />I liked the book, I didn't love it, thus I give it 4 stars. The problem with the book in my opinion is that Westerfeld jumped too fast into the action without having done that magic thing that some writers can do where they inform us about who the character is, who they are as a person, while also making us really care about them.<br /><br />Tally, the main character is turning 16 but we don't know a lot about her, what we know is she is a superficial non-thinking person who has been brainwashed. She doesn't question the status quo and is a blind follower. When the book starts off she is an unquestioning drone, happy to finally have approached the day when she will turn from an \\"uglie\\" to a \\"pretty\\" with cosmetic surgery, which is what the government does to everyone when they turn 16.<br /><br />This is a hero's journey tale so I was disappointed that when Tally was forced with a moral dilemma to turn in a former friend in order to gain access to the surgery to become a \\"pretty\\" she quickly agrees (thus making me not like her so much). Furthermore, Tally's lack of common sense and her inability to always think logically to piece together what is really going on shows she is not as bright as I like hero book characters to be. Although her character evolves as the story goes on, and she eventually starts doing more of the right and best thing and to grow into being a non-conformist and a rebel, I would have liked Tally better if she showed those traits from page one. Her stupidity gets people hurt or killed, which was a turn-off. I kept wishing that Tally would just stop and think and put the pieces together but she often did not.<br /><br />What I liked about the book's story is the issue of a society who has decided that its number one priority is external appearance and has gone to extremes to perform many cosmetic surgeries in people over the course of their lifetimes to keep them looking pretty and good looking and thin and perpetually young. I couldn't help but think about how we are partially there already in America and how even in the USA people are starting to look at the fake created body parts and thinking those are the normal way to look then feeling self-disgust at their natural and normal bodies, and the same for changes in appearance due to natural aging. Thus this book brings up important topics to think about and to hopefully discuss.<br /><br />Of secondary importance is the issue of eternal partying and pleasure at being drunk for fun which seems to provide total personal fulfillment to the new pretties. Again this is good food for thought for teens.<br /><br />I enjoyed the aspect of some rebels having left \\"civilization\\" in order to live the old-fashioned way and to live off the land. I liked that the others who are called \\"Smokies\\" have leared the value of hard work and have developed a strong work ethic.<br /><br />The book is full of action which is the type that puts it into my category of \\"this will make a great movie\\". That also makes it good for reluctant readers or those who desire that their reading be fast paced action stories. However, due to lacking a deeper character development it made me put it in the category of \\"this may make a better movie than the book is\\".<br /><br />My last issue with the book is that I felt that Uglies didn't truly wrap up as a \\"full book\\" by the end because I suspect the author's plan from the beginning was to make this a series. At the time I am writing this review, there are five books in the series.<br /><br />I rate this book 4 stars = I Like It.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is the third and final book in The Hunger Games trilogy. I loved the first two books and while I love the third book it has a different feel and pace than its predecessors. The story needs to wrap up and we need more backstory and information so this probably can't be helped.<br /><br />Mockingjay is more serious and more political in that we learn more about the Capitol and how horrid they are, even toward the citizens of the Capitol (not just toward the districts)! We see more destruction and cruelty toward everyone. While the former books had death and murder this book is even worse with war zone injury and suffering and prisoner torture, so it is darker and even more gory than the other two books. The central action in this book is that the districts are in a revolution against the Capitol: who will win this war and what does the future hold? What will become of Katniss? If she survives this revolutionary war, and if Peeta and Gale do, who will she wind up with?<br /><br />There are also new characters in the group heading the rebellion that introduces a whole bunch of people who seek power and control. At some points in the story, even I, an adult, got a little confused about who was who, who was deceiving others, who was to be trusted and who the real enemy was. That level of interpersonal politics gave the book a different feel. Rather than the book having just a focus on action and adventure there was a higher level of analysis that the reader must process in order to \\"get\\" the story. This might turn off some readers, bore them, or cause them to feel this is their least favorite of the three books. (My fourteen year old son complained that the book got boring and he put it down for a couple of months then picked it up again and wound up getting sucked into it.)<br /><br />The ending happened so fast and I am still torn about if that ending is what I'd wanted for Katniss...<br /><br />I am a fan of The Hunger Games trilogy and thoroughly enjoyed reading all the books which I found to be great escape read page-turner books.<br /><br />It seems there are more and more dystopian young adult books being published but they all have a higher bar to live up to thanks to Suzanne Collins who has created a true hero in her characer, Katniss Everdeen, a strong female character who readers can't help but root for. Kudos to Collins for doing a great job combining excellent character development, believable characters and situations with action that keeps readers engaged and on the edge of their seats.nd to be great escape read page-turner books.

B005I19TYY|5.0|I missed this episode on regular TV programing, and USA Network doesn't post full episodes for viewing on-line [free] until a couple-few weeks later, so Amazon's &lt;$2 per episode was well worth it to keep me up to date.
0316098329|2.0|While I can appreciate the surprising premise of this book it is deeply flawed on many levels.<br /><br />Choosing to use a captive 5-year old boy as the narrator forces the reader to read out of pity, and the Terrible Tale that is behind the book. I don't like having my feelings manipulated so overtly, and in such simple terms, to entice me to finish a book.<br /><br />Also, I don't feel like I learned anything new by reading this book. With millions of great books in the world, Room is a book I never needed to read.<br /><br />The only thing good about this book is that it is easy to read and doesn't take a lot of time, 2 days tops.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This movie really surprised me because it didn't follow the story in the comic. It improved on the source material. The settings of the 1960's were clearly influenced by the James Bond and Our Man Flint set designs.  It looked like a modern version of a 1960's spy movie.  Kevin Bacon was superb as the former Nazi who becomes Magneto's nemesis.  You can almost under stand why Magneto took the direction he did through the scenes in this film. While I am not familiar with X-Men history; I have to say it's a better story that will appeal to those who aren't fans. You don't have see the prior films to understand the movie.  Al the characters appear to be intelligent and well thought out. I was glad to see Bryan Singer had a role in producing this film. I'd like to think he had a choice in who scripted this fantastic tale.<br /><br />Prequels are not always the best. However with this film I'd have to say this is an exception to the rule. If you have an appreciation of the genre, you'll enjoy this film.
0307454894|5.0|The story of The Reader is fascinating. A 15 year old boy has an affair (or, is he taken advantage of?) with an older woman. Years later, the same woman is on trial as a Nazi prison guard.<br /><br />The best part of The Reader is the passion the narrator retains for the woman. Later, his passion turns to empathy. I know it sounds weird to say, but this book helped me understand how people could have perpetrated such horrible war crimes in Nazi Germany. The Reader explains the role that ignorance can play in cruelty.<br /><br />The prose of Schlink is beautiful and sensual, even in translation. Like all good books, The Reader will stick in your psyche long after you have finished reading it.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I was glad to see the creators and the director Kenneth Branagh decided to drop Thor's secret identity.  The entire Doctor Don Blake as Thor gimmick would have been too much for audiences. The modern version has Odin (Thor's dad, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins) casting out Thor to Earth.  His brother Loki has other plans to take over the kingdom called Asguard.  If you can suspend your disbelief in such a concept, you'll enjoy this take of the character. Thor was a take on the mytholgical character in Marvel comics style.  Without giving anything away; the villian at the end of the film called the Destroyer, made this movie worth watching. I liked the fact that the producers decided to keep Jack Kirby's design of the character. In fact, all of Jack's designs inpired this film. If your a comic book fan, this movie is a must buy.  It's a movie I'd gladly see again.  It has enough depth of character to draw viewers in, that aren't comic fans.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Well, I have not bought the Bluray set.  I'm still debating whether to get it or not.  I have the Trilogy set that came out on DVD in 2004 plus I have Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith.  George Lucas adding stuff to the originals doesn't bother me but I do understand those who don't like it.  My question is, why didn't Lucas include both the original versions & the updated versions of the movies on the Blurays?  Let the customer choose which one to watch.  You can make both parties happy.
0307887898|3.0|In the tech boom of the '90s, so-called \\"startups\\" would burn through millions of dollars of investor cash before seeing any revenue. They'd hire PR firms and launch national ad campaigns; they'd bring on big-name C-level executives; and they'd train an army of support staff--all before they had any customers. Webvan, Pets.com, eToys, and countless others whose names are now forgotten went down this path, only to find that the massive demand they'd anticipated for their services never materialized.<br /><br />Investors have wised up since. Validation is the name of the game: Your concept may look good on paper, your demo may look great, but you're never going to raise more than six figures without traction--enthusiastic beta testers, active users, or best of all, revenue. Today, the word \\"startup\\" suggests a handful of people working on a small product, collecting feedback, and iterating on that feedback. Rather than launching when everything is perfect, they launch when they have a \\"minimal viable product\\" (MVP). It's an approach that's been advocated for years by startup accelerator programs like Y Combinator and TechStars. And now Eric Ries has a name for it: \\"The Lean Startup.\\" He's built a whole brand around the name--including a video series, a conference, and now this book--and attracted press coverage that's described it as a \\"radical new theory\\" (Wired).<br /><br />So is it new? That depends on who you are. If you're already in the startup world, most of this book will sound familiar. That's not to say that Ries' writings are useless--the book contains some solid anecdotes (though not as many as I would've liked), and many entrepreneurs are aware that they're not iterating on feedback as quickly as they could be--but it does make the repetition of the theme tedious. Small feature set, gauge customer interest, repeat as fast as possible; got it.<br /><br />To avoid limiting his audience, Ries has broadened his definition of \\"startup\\" to encompass virtually any human endeavor. So if you work at a large corporation, a government agency, or a non-profit: Good news! You, too, can apply lean startup principles! Unfortunately, the book offers few tangible lessons in that arena. Yes, all else being equal, having customer validation is a good thing. But what to make of Ries' aside that the iPod rested on assumptions validated by the success of the Walkman? By that same reckoning, Apple should have looked at the web-capable smartphone market in 2005--a small niche comprised of geeky professionals--and concluded that few people would want an iPhone. Or they might have looked at tablet computers in 2007--an even smaller niche--and reckoned that no one wanted an iPad. Apple is the antithesis of the lean startup. They have the resources to make big bets and shrug when they don't pay off. Startups can't.<br /><br />It's a dichotomy Ries never really gets at: When should you be lean, constantly listening to feedback and reevaluating your direction, and when should you just keep moving toward your vision? That's the fundamental question of entrepreneurship. There's no one-size-fits-all answer.you work at a large corporation, a government agency, or a non-profit: Good news!

B004LWZW4C|3.0|This is probably the best X-Men film so far. Unfortunately, the disc can have some internet connectivity issues when viewed on the PS3.    When I first purchased this film, it was very frustrating to watch. The picture would frequently freeze, while the audio continued, and then jump forward- almost like there was some kind of buffering problem. Turns out, the internet-enabled features of the disc were hampering playback. This was during the film itself, mind you, when there shouldn't have been any internet activity at all.     The problem can be solved by deleting the \\"X-Men: First Class\\" folder- located in the BD Data folder in the video menu- and disabling your internet connection whilst watching the movie. Not a huge hassle, but it's pretty pathetic for a major release to have such a serious flaw.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This set of 42 DVDs contains all six seasons of this wonderful series, plus two feature films.  Each season's DVDs come in a sturdy case, and within the case is a foam piece for extra support of the DVDs.  I was quite surprised at the excellent packaging, since many DVD cases are made with holes (in order to save money I suppose), and are quite flimsy.  All 7 cases slip into the cardboard box, which is covered with several still shots of Sully & Dr. Mike.  I am very pleased with this set, and every fan of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman should own one too!
B004SRWW0C|5.0|This handy app really gets to the Root of the issue especially if you have bloated apps that take up valuable resource and space. Bear in mind you do need to be Root to benefit from this app!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Let's start off with the most important problem first, the packaging. Fox has adopted this stance that their best movie collections must be treated like crap and pulled out of cardboard cases. I can only assume that this is to force you to buy new copies when you scratch the hell out of your discs. This problem seems to only be in the US version, I cannot fathom what would make them want to do this.<br />  George, I get it, you're an artist, and your works are never completed, but part of being an artist is knowing when to stop. Please bring out the original theatrical cuts of the films in high definition, from the original master prints of the movies, that's what most of us really want to see. I'd buy them day one I can promise you that. Too much has been changed from the original trilogy, and even though you're still tinkering with the IV-VI you've started messing with the prequels as well. Some of the fixes I can understand such as the Wampa arm issue, the interior shots of the rebel ships fighting the walkers on Hoth.<br />  Honestly though, does anyone care if the ewoks eyes blink? Does it matter that R2 is a little bit more hidden behind those CGI rocks? That you finally covered up the Vaseline that you originally put on the camera to cover up the wheels on the landspeeder? No, not really. I'm not even going into the pink lightsaber that never got fixed, the green lightsaber in A New Hope that got fixed for a few frames then goes right back from blue to green, or the yelling that was added in Jedi.<br />  At some point you have to realize, these movies are no longer yours, they are your fan's. They belong to us. And what we want is exactly what we remember, in the highest quality we can possibly see. Hopefully you'll see things from our point of view sometime before you make the inevitable sequels, because we all know they are coming.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|As anyone knows 90% of the movies we see the previews for we have high hopes of something super spectacular. The movies normally turn out alright just not as expected. It was a very good movie and Ryan Reynolds is a genius and just too funny. I haven't seen a movie he played in yet that wasn't good. He can make any movie entertaining. It's a definite watch don't list to the negative comments about the movie. If you haven't seen it be sure to do so!

Its the perfect size to fit in your backpack or BOB and costs only $8.<br /><br />Sure some will say \\"well i already know most of that\\". i guarantee someone in your party will not, or in a time of stress your mind will go blank and this book will remind you how to identify snakes and wild plants (with color pictures), multiple ways to start a fire, trap animals, find water...all in the size of a stack of index cards. If its too thick for you, the pages a glossy and sturdy enough to tear out what you feel is important and laminate them to make a small set of guide cards.<br /><br />This book has so much valuable info in such a small space I am going to buy one for every bag that goes with me when SHTF.

0786886811|5.0|I recently ordered four of Nigella Lawson's books from amazon and after a long wait they arrived. This is my favorite of the lot. The first cool day of September came begging for some baking and I made two of her cakes and both turned out very well. I even adapted one to fit into a low-carb eating plan and it worked with the flavors balanced and interesting. Others have written about her interesting writing style so I won't go into it but will just say that I enjoy reading her descriptions and find the writing quite intelligent. If you are going to order one of her books, I think this would be it. If you can manage a second book try her Christmas book, for a third I would suggest Nigella Feasts, but as for me I think I'll return the Nigella bites.
B000002L7R|4.0|I was all of 10 years old when this album was released, but I made sure I was at the record store the day it came out--and when I got it home and put it on the turntable, I thought there was something literally defective in the pressing; What on earth was making that sound, or rather, what was making it *sound* so weird? Then with a familiar Princely whoop, I was whisked into a strange sound world--several different ones, actually---that bewildered me with their unfamiliar sounds and textures even as they captured me with plenty of hooks and the comfortably familiar lite-funk rhythms of The Revolution. The combination kept me coming back for more--and he in fact confused me in a fresh and wonderful way for the next 3 or 4 albums. Anyway, \\"Around the World In A Day\\" (the album) doesn't sound nearly as shocking now as it did then, to my 10-year-old-child ears, but it is still a wonderfully peculiar little record in its way. (I've heard on a bootleg an alternate early mix of the title track that shows it to have been a much more \\"conventionally\\" arranged pop- song before apparently being made \\"eccentric\\" in the final mixing process.) Aside from the immaculate hit \\"Raspberry Beret,\\" the album's best moments are those when Prince sheds his backing band and just plays all the instruments himself: The fluttering, gentle rapture of \\"Condition of the Heart\\" and the tight, minimal, Joni-Mitchell-mating-with-Sly-Stone funk toss-off (no pun) of \\"Tambourine.\\" These highlights comprise the bulk of the original Side One; Side Two is a much less engaging sequence of relatively dull band workouts. \\"America\\" is basically a minor-key take on the previous album's \\"Baby I'm a Star\\" vamp (and which, in its incarnation on 12\\" vinyl, went on for a torturous 23 minutes); \\"Pop Life\\" strides along amiably enough, \\"The Ladder\\" is just a dragging bore which seems to exist only to make the labored lasciviousness of the closing \\"Temptation\\" seem more impressive, instead of just silly, as it closes with Prince screaming like a white lady while presumably being raked over coals of Hell-fire. Because Prince didn't tour to support this album, its success on the charts didn't have the legs it might've had, but a record this self-indulgent can only be made by an artist who already feels he's Arrived--which by 1985 Prince certainly had--and it would be another five or six years before he would emerge from this inner world to engage the larger pop/hip-hop cultures on its own terms again. If you have the patience to indulge a record made by an artist intentionally sealing himself up in a semi-autistic inner world, you'll probably dig it. 3-1/2 stars, really.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I loved this movie!!  I know that movies are a personal preference, so it is hard to rate for others.  I loved the chemistry between Ryan and Sandra in this movie.  I would recommend it
B0040YR546|1.0|I like super hero movies, so the trailer for this one totally hooked me.  The first ten minutes, setting up the premise, continued to hook me.  Then came wave after wave of senseless dismemberment and murder, often at the hands of a disturbed 11 year old girl.  In the end, I'd say the movie was tasteless, it had plenty of shock-and-awe-via-violence-and-gunfire-and-decapitation, but lacked an actually inspiring character, an actually moving story-line, or anything else that balances such portrayal of violence to actually uplift you, the way you often feel uplifted and emboldened at the end of a super hero movie. Nothing like that here. I was just left disturbed.  If you have kids or a conscience, or a love of good movies and inspiring human stories, stay away from this one.

My mother-in-law is pretty advanced and now she has borrowed this book and really enjoys it as well.  It is very good for visual learners and the glossary in the back of stitches with the specific instructions for each stitch is very, very helpful.  The book is also pleasingly designed (in my opinion) and has a great introduction for beginners.  The only thing I wish it had is an example of a project you could use the certain motifs for after you are done.  As in, some of the designs are really pretty, but kind of impractical?  But I guess that is just me not being creative.<br /><br />Overall, would recommend.

1452101248|5.0|Vegetables are the stars in Plenty. The approach to their presentation is different both in the organization of the cookbook and in the flavor combinations used to prepare them. The cookbook is organized by categories; eggplants, peppers, grains, and green things as an example. The recipes use global flavors. Influences from Asia and the Mediterranean are prominant. What really works, for an average cook like I am, are the techniques and inspiring spice combinations. The recipes are well written and easy to execute.   I have made twenty of the recipes in the last six weeks. Soba noodles with Mango and eggplant, Kisir, and the sweet potatoe cake recipes are exceptional. I live in a beautiful bucolic location where polenta is called grits and sweet potatoes are a staple. That may influence why I find these recipes \\"a breath of fresh air\\" compared to our traditional recipes. Don't misunderstand, I wouldn't consider replacing our culinary workhorses but this book offers a chance to put on the fancy culinary shoes and dance in the kitchen.

B002ZG98C8|1.0|I am so glad that I didn't pay to see this movie.  I remember seeing the trailer and thinking that it looked interesting, but this movie was pure garbage.  There were some good lines, some good action scenes, and more than little female nudity.  A lot of the action scenes were terribly unrealistic, but I can live with that if the acting and the story are good.  That was not the case with this movie.  Despite having some talented people in this movie the acting was terrible, but it's the story that really ticked me off.  I am not a bible-thumping conservative redneck from the south, I am politically moderate, I have a white collar job, and I was born and raised in the Midwest.  That being said I cannot believe that they would have a character in the movie, who is an obvious caricature of John McCain, be one of the biggest villains.  There are plenty of politicians who lie, steal, and cheat, but I can't envision any senator doing a fraction of what De Niro's character did.  Regardless of what your political views and whether or not you like John McCain, he volunteered to go to war even though his father had the ability to make sure that he never had to.  He was a POW, and he has given more for this country than most people have, and I think it was insulting to portray a character based off of him as someone evil.  Another thing is that all of the white people in the movie were portrayed as being extremely stupid.  If the heroes in this movie had been white instead of Mexican, and all of the white villains that were killed had instead been black there would be accusations that it was a blatantly racist movie and they would be correct.  I am generally not going to be interested in a movie where the heroes are illegal aliens, but if that is what you are looking for I would have to strongly recommend the comedy: [[ASIN:B000YIGNC2 Ladron Que Roba A Ladron (Widescreen Edition)]].  All of the heroes in that movie are illegal aliens, but story is more or less believable, the acting is superb, I didn't find it to be racist at all.acting is superb, I didn't find it to be racist at all.
B0055S348W|5.0|Probably the most invaluable free application to date... Thanks Amazon! It surprisingly had my printer's drivers but that download (processing...) took painfully long. I was even on wifi. No biggy though...
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I bought the Zoom after reading raving reviews from several \\"respectable\\" gaming websites.  Boy, was I dissapointed.  Like a lot of the other amazon user reviews have mentioned, the hand tracking goes to crap when you attach this device to Kinect.  Even though I did everything I could to make the device work, it would still inconsistantly track my movements.  Yes... I made sure the lenses snapped into place.  Yes... I tried calibration after calibration.  Nonetheless, the device would prevent Kinect from following my hand movements - especially through Kinect game menus.  It seems like it got worse if you put your hand across the front of your body.  I can't explain why that would be.    I'm so dissapointed.  I thought this was the device that would finally let me enjoy Kinect comfortably with two players in my small living room, but it is most definetly not.    Bottom line - DO NOT BUY THIS ACCESSORY.  YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED.
0393338827|5.0|I can summarize my review very simply - As someone who knows more than a little about this book's subject, I was amazed how well Michael Lewis tells this very complex story. He did a great job with the facts, and the story itself is just as entertaining, just as gripping, as his masterpiece in the same space, Liar's Poker.
0691152640|5.0|Thanks to the authors, academics both, who produced a volume of very approachable history of one otherwise esoteric part of the \\"dismal science.\\"  Not for the numerically challenged, though.  Clean, well-paced, with lots of graphs, virtually all refreshingly multi-dimensional and at least as valuable as the narrative.  The authors make important and rarely admitted points.  All in all, very hard to put down!  One quibble, though, and it's with those figures:  occasionally there are no explicit units on one axis, leaving the non-specialist to wonder whether the \\"ratio\\" is indeed a ratio or a percentage, for example. Scientists and former academics tend to be anal retentive about units, though, so I cut the authors some slack.  Finally, many thanks to Ezra Klein for calling this book to my attention.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a very addictive puzzle game.  My seven year old also loves it and I'm guessing it will be good for his brain. Stupid Amazon allows it to be downloaded onto tablets even though it's not yet supported (according to their Facebook page tablet support is coming soon) . It can be played on my Xoom but it's a bit small and there are interface glitches.  I hope Amazon won't hold up the upgrades too much. Five stars for a great game, Amazon gets three stars for not honoring the allowed platform list (or whatever it's called).
B003UESJH4|5.0|It seems like forever since I have seen a movie that is intelligently written, perhaps since The Queen, or There Will Be Blood.  This is splendidly done, and Colin Firth is absolutely perfect.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|Ya know, it grows on ya. I was disappointed the first coupla rounds, but I kept with it. It's true, Hugh Laurie's vocals are not really up to the weight of these tunes. The musicianship is stellar and the production is full and round, but gotta give the guy credit for putting his heart and soul into this project and for luring such amazing talents to play along. St. James' Infirmary is memorable, gotta say. The album does have a tribute feel, and the liner notes are defiantly unapologetic, but still...it has its moments and is worth the ten bucks. For a recent duo that fills in a lot of empty spaces (and as other reviewers have mentioned), check out the other Brit genius who's made inroads in New Orleans blues/jazz--[[ASIN:1423420071 Elvis Costello and Allen Toussaint - The River in Reverse]].\\" Still...this one grows on ya....
B00393SFU2|4.0|Some critics/historians believe \\"M\\" to be an early look at film noir.  It really doesn't lend itself to that genre.  There is no detective in the formative lead.  The primary focus is on Peter Lorre as Franz Becker, a pedophile in Berlin.  Young girls are disappearing and the police have few clues.  The movie takes great pains to show the effort the police are taking; following up on leads, checking finger prints, finding candy stores from scraps of paper found in a park.  The great Fritz Lang directed and co-wrote along with his wife Thea von Harbou.  The story isn't really a who-done-it as we learn the identity of culprit early on, but focuses on the capture and the why is he committing such horrible crimes.  As the cops put on their full court press to flush out the killer, they begin to interfere with the lives of the petty criminals.  The pimps, prostitutes, thieves, pick-pockets and other scallywags are put upon.  The mob boss concludes they must find the killer themselves to remove the police pressure.  They are successful thanks to a blind balloon salesmen and a creative young street urchin.  The young man manages to identify the pervert by chalking his overcoat with the letter \\"M\\" for murderer.  After capturing Becker, the mobster chief, Schraenker heads a kangaroo court to try him for his crimes.  Lorre puts on a believable if over-the-top performance to express his mental instability.  That is, he can't help himself.  There is an inner force that changes his personality.  This is an early film look at an insanity defense.  As he is about to be sentenced, the film jumps quickly to a real court as the gavel comes down.  The mob has turned Becker over to the cops.  Technically the film is well made and Criterion has done a superb job of restoration including displaying the unusual 1:19 to 1 aspect ratio.
B005DZMODI|3.0|Any combo with Clapton is worth getting...period.... Wish I'd been a fly on the wall of Lincoln Center for this! The liner notes read like a music appreciation lecture (I've spent too long in academia, perhaps) but that's okay--despite using words like \\"contextualizing\\" (arrrgh!), there is also heartfelt recognition, respect, and appreciation in the, erm, brief essay. Now to the music. Others have commented that sound quality overall could be better on some tracks--true. Nevertheless, it's a fun and carefully selected jaunt through jazz/blues classics by highly respected and popular musicians. And coming back to those pesky liner notes, it's true that the famous have a greater burden to be original and creative and not fall back on their laurels--these guys do all right! Well worth the ten bucks to hear them having such a good time on these tunes!
B0051T47NQ|3.0|This droll troll story takes place in Norway which I guess is the only country, small though it is, that contains trolls.  Like intergalactic aliens, the Norwegian government wants to keep their presence under wraps, so as not to distress the populace.  Three film students from a local college begin to investigate what they believe to be an illegal bear killer.  Illegal because bear killers must be licensed by the state.  The film is shot in a style began in earnest with \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" in 1999 and seen many times since, usually in films involving sinister plots.  This first person style always has challenges.  For example, the cameraman has to keep the lens focused on the action while at the same time running for his life.  They actually pull it off pretty well.  It turns out the hunter isn't looking for bears but is the lone authorized government hunter of trolls.  Now trolls come in many different sizes ranging from very large to ginormous.  While trolls are very dangerous (they really like to eat Christians), they can be killed, primarily by the sun ala vampires or bright flashing artificial light.  Some turn to stone and some just explode.  After being chased for days by the students, Hans the trollhunter finally agrees to let the students come along on the hunt.  He's fed up with the government continually keeping the public in the dark, not to mention the fact he is underpaid, overworked and has had his benefits cut.  He's ready to go public.  This silliness works.  The movie shows off Norway beautifully in spite of a near constant rain.  All the drama and action is played with a straight face and I suspect we're missing some inside Nordic humor.  I would have liked to have seen more scariness but the filmmakers are pretty up front with showing the troll and monstrous as they can be, they don't appear to be very scary to the audience.  The ending of course is given to us in the opening written documentation, so we just try to figure out how the film got back to the people making this movie.got back to the people making this movie.
B004EPYZQ2|1.0|First of all I've never written a review on Amazon before but I felt compelled to do so simply because of the number of 5 star reviews for this film. A person who's on the fence about purchasing this movie might be swayed simply by all of the reviews without renting it and I just had to offer an objective counterpoint after having finally seen the movie. People may genuinely like this movie, hey more power to them and this is just my opinion.    I went into the movie pretty stoked because of the initial previews for it. I then read some of the professional reviews and they were pretty positive. So I knew going in that this was essentially a 2-hour love letter to all things Spielberg-ian, much less classic Spielberg when he could do no wrong, so I was even more psyched! And then I watched the film.    The biggest two films that this movie borrows/steals heavily from are Close Encounters and E.T. And those two movies had one thing in common right off the bat - they hooked the audiences in. Immediately. Everyone's seen them so I won't rehash why their hooks worked. This film had no such hook - or at least not the hook you'd suspect in a movie heavily advertised as a summer action/sci-fi film. I knew something was off when they focused on the main character Joe, a roughly 15 year old kid, and then proceeded to drag out the opening. I was still psyched mind you, just less enthusiastic about the movie. And the opening was thoughtful and emotional but just not what I expected. I thought we were going to hit the ground running with the kids filming their Super 8 movie, establish quick backgrounds, and then the train derailment would hit and all hell would break loose. It didn't. We're introduced to Joe and all of his buddies and the I-couldn't-see-that-coming-1000-miles-away love interest and we eventually get to where the previews had me hyped. And then that crapped out.     It seems that the movie's sideplot of Joe's relationship with his friends, potential girlfriend, and his father took up roughly 75% of the movie and the \\"other\\" plot with the alien was about 25%. Keep in mind these numbers are based on my first viewing and could be off, it's simply what it felt like to me as it unfolded. You get a quick scene with the alien and then back to the much longer friends scenes. Repeat that formula a few times and there's the movie. It just wasn't properly focused. You'd get the action going and then dial it all the way back down to zero.     And then I was just amazed at the homage scenes to Spielberg. They were pretty blatant. The airforce guys who rush out of NOWHERE with flashlights at the derailment was a rip-off of E.T. as was a couple of city shots at dusk. All of the dysfunctional family scenes with Joe's buddy, the budding director, were completely ripped-off from Close Encounters as was a town evacuation scene. There was even a quick utility truck scene driving through the countryside that I would've sworn was from Close Encounters. In fact all of Joe's buddy's are simply knock-off versions of the kids in Stand By Me and, to a lesser extent, Goonies. And I won't ruin the ending but even a certain element of that basically copied E.T.    And I won't even get into actual plot holes with the government agents and the biology teacher as that'd ruin the movie with potential spoilers because if you see it I'd rather you not know everything. But I will say this to all of the 5-star reviewers - after watching this did the kids in any way forward the plot with the alien? IMO they did not - events would've unfolded without them anyways except for one single rescue scene. The main character's(the kids) that were focused on in no way helped or hindered the alien plotline. We could've essentially replaced the kids with a group of rogue monkeys that escaped from a zoo and accidentally recorded the alien. Can't go wrong with monkeys for comedic relief.    Anyways there you go. Sorry for the length of the review - I just wanted to explain whythis just didn't work for me and warn you if you're expecting a whimsical, tightly knit action-filled sci-fi film you'll be in for a surprise as that's definitely not what this is. It's a tale of friendship and a coming of age story. With an alien. And that would be fine but it wasn't in any way promoted as such.    Please rent this first before just blindly buying it. And to everyone who loves it, great. I'm not full of hate for this movie, just massive disappointment for what it could have been, based on the previews. My one star rating will be considered harsh as the acting overall was decent and the effects worked, but the overall stuttering plot just didn't do it for me. To me a 5-star film is pretty flawless with the storyline and plot, that's why I'm amazed at all of the 5-stars out there. You truly think this is a perfect film? A masterpiece? You'll return to this over and over again throughout the years like you would with a true, much less original, 5-star film?  I'll just stick with the far superior source material(s) instead of this.    Peace
0671042858|3.0|I wonder if Mr. King was publishing this today (2011) if it might not be tougher, scarier, more troubling. I wonder if the last 11 years of \\"young adult\\" books might not have changed the overall tenor of this story.  Maybe not. As it is, \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" feels flat. I was never too concerned for Trisha McFarland. Good story. Interesting premise. Fairly tame. Fairly? Check that: very.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I may not be a star wars purist but for me, all the bad rep given to these movies in Amazon is just unjustifiable.  I know the same dvd changes made before were kept (so, they are not exactly as we saw them back then in theaters) but I think these changes and retouches are in line with our HD world (and also, is George Lucas vision, deal with).  I still think that replacing the actor who played Darth Vader with the new Anakin from the later movies was (still is) wrong but that does not mean these movies are not awesome! The quality is just great and having watching them already, I can attest that it is true.  Besides, the price is just a bargain and the extras (I have not watch them all) are pretty good.  In conclusion, buy the movies if you want these movies in good HD quality and listen to the experts so you will not miss out.
0385737955|4.0|After having read the Hunger Games Trilogy, a fellow teacher of mine offered this book to me based on a student recommendation.  Thank goodness I took it! I couldn't put the book down for a second.  It has a bittersweet ending where you must be ready to have unanswered questions and deal with uncertain/untrustworthy characters that will keep you chomping on the bit for more.  I don't see this as a negative, but as the reader, you'll want to move right to the second book in the series.  I was not disappointed with this book at all, in fact as soon as I was finished with The Maze Runner, I ordered The Scorch Trials.  I am eagerly awaiting the release of The Death Cure in October.  When describing the plot, conflict, and specific names given to creatures in this book to others, I've been told that it sounds confusing and complicated.  James Dashner will not confuse you throughout the course of the book. I felt that every element he placed in the story made logical sense for the setting.     I am not typically interested in this genre, but I am planning on reading this book aloud to my students as I did the Hunger Games (which they loved).  You won't be disappointed (until they make it into a movie, which is being released in 2013).
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Even though I am from the U.K. and have already purchased the U.K. release,I just had to get this version.    Why? I prefer the packaging on U.S. releases and they don't have HUGE age certification all over the packaging. Anyway, less rambling more reviewing.    Sucker Punch is a movie that is broken down into some gorgeous action scenes featuring beautiful women with a 'thinner than a thin thing on thin day' plot trying to hold it all together.    It's almost as if Zack Snyder made cut scenes for a video game that was never released and stuck them all together. Visually stimulating and a treat for the eyes, if you like no brains-required action movies then this is for you.    I'm not gonna waste time trying to describe the plot, as I said before it's wafer thin.    Watch the trailer, if you like the look of it, buy the movie. It won't dissapoint.
B001QWB1IG|4.0|I've owned 6 or 7 pairs of Newport sandals. I still have 4 of them, and each serves a different function (inside the house, yard work etc.) The ones I just received were, like the others, sturdy and well-made, but they aren't as comfortable. The soles of the new ones are more rigid, and the inner soles are not as flexible and soft. They've gotten better as I've broken them in, but they will never reach the comfort level of the older ones.
B004OEIL5O|5.0|SCREAM 3 is lots of fun and finishes the original trilogy smartly.  As a film it is not as good as the original SCREAM but far surpasses the somewhat disappointing second film.  Back again is an intelligent script that provides the perfect mix of scares, suspense and quick wit all mixed together.  And Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox Arquette and David Arquette are back shining brightly not missing a step in their well crafted roles.  Supporting cast is also real fun.  Parker Posey is a hoot and Patrick Dempsey turns in a great dramatic turn fitting into the horror movie fold perfectly with his usual class and charm.  Was I reviewing the film alone I would be giving it 4 stars for only the original is a true 5 star film but the blu ray transfer ups the viewing experience and makes it a winning 5 stars and then some.<br /><br />The video transfer is very good.  It is not as crisp as some but certainly an upgrade over the dvd.  Colors are bright, close ups are clean with great detail. Black/white ratio is excellent.  Both day and night scenes are well done.  This all adds to a dramatic viewing experience.  But the true star here is the audio. The DTS HD 5.1 track is amazing.  Dialogue is always crisp and strong and your entire surround sound system will be put to great use throughout.  Back speakers which are often not utilized well are definitely strong here. You will be jumping out of your skin as every effective scare is made that much stronger by the superb audio.  It honestly was like watching the film for the first time.  The blu ray transfer here turns a very well done film into something even better.  It uses all blu ray has to offer in video and audio to make the viewing experience an amazing horror delight.  Be prepared to shiver and shake and have your heart pumping fast.  Highly recommended.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|This 1995 A&E/BBC version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is considered a classic and surprisingly I had never seen it.  And I am a huge fan of BBC dramas from that era.  This version is 6 hours.  Back then they always did shows in longer versions where they could really show a story to its full effect.  These days they are often done in short 2 hour versions where much of the true subtleties in the story are totally lost.  I am a huge Colin Firth fan and wanted all his work on blu ray so of course PRIDE AND PREJUDICE popped up.  Not only is this an excellent mini-series but it is the defining role that made Colin Firth a true star.  He embodies the character of Darcy so fully and expertly that no other actor could come close.  And Jennifer Ehle also shines as the spirited and independent Elizabeth Bennet.  Career making performance for her as well.  The entire production is top notch from scenery, costume, script, directing and most of all acting.  All characters are cast perfectly.  The story comes across as a superb period piece and a love story for all times.<br /><br />I also learned that since its airing all dvd versions had terrible video and ruined the viewing experience.  Much expectation was put on this blu ray transfer.  I am seeing it fresh and not comparing it to the dvd and must say the blu ray is a true vision.  It is a truly lush viewing experience.  The video is crisp with strong clarity.  Detail in scenery, costume and facial close-ups is superb.  Colors pop and flesh tones are very realistic.  You can see each line on the faces and each blade of grass.  Black/white ratio is excellent as well.  I found this blu ray transfer to be truly lovely and an excellent vehicle with which to view such an amazing story.  The audio here though only PCM 2.0 stereo is still remarkably strong.  The dialogue and beautiful orchestration both are strong and present.  This is honestly a superb viewing experience all around.  There is also a detailed bonus documentary on how they made this glorious restoration.  If you are a fan of this story, the stars involved, period pieces or truly magical love stories this blu ray comes highly recommended.this glorious restoration.

0609603086|3.0|As others have said in their reviews, this is a rather formulaic contribution to the modern thriller genre by author Ken Follett and certainly not in a class with his universally acclaimed \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" or any of his WWII historical fiction novels. But compared to the works of many less talented writers in the category, it's compelling enough to spend an afternoon reading, providing you approach it as more of a light foray into science fiction fantasy and not a thoughtful work with any real depth.<br /><br />The plot, like much of what is commercially produced for the screen these days is rather contrived and hence, unconvincing. It calls to mind Anna Russell's comedic telling of the plot to Wagner's \\"The Ring\\" when she pauses to comment \\"I'm not making this up!\\" (Laughter and applause from her audience.) The idea that an earthquake of enough amplitude to cause major damage through triggering a slip in a large fault line with a seismic vibrator mounted on a truck is beyond ridiculous, though at the time of Follett's writing this scenario pre 9/11, perhaps it seemed vaguely plausible to the scientists he consulted at the time.<br /><br />Though Follett is brilliant at writing fictional story lines with wonderfully defined characters that take place in an historical context where the real world future is already known to the reader, his attempt here to write about the present, and include current seismic technology (as of 1998) as a threat to create a \\"possible\\" scenario for mayhem isn't as successful. He seems keenly aware of this and by incorporating the unbelievability of it into the opinions of his characters, he cleverly attempts to convince the reader that perhaps these events are actually possible in the real world. I didn't buy it and from reading other reviews, neither did many of his other readers.<br /><br />Having been a resident of San Francisco for three decades as a member of the hippy generation (though not one myself), and having experienced numerous earthquakes including the 1989 Loma Prieta temblor, I found much of his characterizations somewhat laughable. Such as the panicked exodus of millions from areas near the San Andreas because of a possible seismic/terrorist threat. People living in the California fault zones take pride (perhaps foolishly) in daily living under the threat of seismic disaster. After the 1989 quake, SF residents were out partying in the streets with Champagne, mooning passersby and waving signs trumpeting that they had survived the \\"Big One.\\" The tragedy of the freeway collapse in Oakland and the shut down of the Bay Bridge was sobering, but it didn't drive the populace away. People still throng to the Bay Area in droves and are only mildly concerned about the threat, real as it may be.<br /><br />His portrayal of the hippy eco-terrorists themselves also borders on the absurd though he gets some if it right. I can only assume that because Follett is Welsh/English and never actually experienced the California hippy culture of the era, he is creating characters from supposition and literary perception, much as he does in his historical novels. No one today really knows what it was like to live in 11th century Europe, but there are pleny of us still around who know intimately the world of 1970s California. The explanation of Priest, the main antagonist/villain is that he is a criminal sociopath who has been hiding in a commune for 25 years with charismatic power over his followers a la James Jones, and for some reason which adds nothing important to the story is completely illiterate. His sexy 50 year old female companion and mother of his children hates authority so much that she participates in a murderous plan with him that can't possibly succeed, and his new well educated scientist co-conspirator lover is mad at the academic world and her estranged husband for paying more attention to their son than to her, but is willing to kill millions to protect her new home in the communeso her son won't suffer from allergies. I'm not making this up.<br /><br />In less capable and established hands than Follett, this would never have made it to the presses. But with that said, the writing itself is good and it was a fun, if not illuminating read. Better to check it out from the local branch of your public library and save your money for better Follett offerings.allergies. I'm not making this up.

B0011Z5IVE|5.0|Throughout the 80's KGB FM (101.5, San Diego) used to play a top 500 songs of all time each year. I remember thinking, year after year, will Stairway be #1 again? We all know the answer. Of course. Yeah, the Beatles and AC/DC tunes were always up there- I remember VH breaking into the top 5 a couple years- but this song, this powerful, supreme masterpiece of rock and roll-- could not be toppled. For that song alone this album should be owned by everyone who has ever aspired to pick up a guitar and play.     But one song does not a 5-star album make. Every single track on this album is unforgettable. Start humming any one of them, and the people around you will pick it up, whether they know Led Zeppelin or not. THAT is what makes a 5-star album.     I've revisited this album many times. It was one of the first 3 vinyl albums I ever owned. I have owned it on tape, on CD, as part of box sets, and now I'm finally giving in and purchasing it digitally. (Kudos to Amazon here for not giving in to the whole DRM thing, btw.) The album has been stuck in more than one tape deck, or CD player, in more than one car I've owned. Its longevity plays out on the airwaves every single day: I'd be willing to bet at least one of the tracks from this album is played somewhere across the US on every \\"classic rock\\" station there is.       Hype? Not applicable. Nostalgia? OK maybe, but not necessary. This is definitely one of the true masterpieces of Rock n' Roll. The Kings are Dead. Long live the Kings.

B00328G4V6|5.0|I don't even NEED to tell you that Jimi Hendrix is a phenomenal guitar player.  You've been hearing that for at least 40 years now!  Yes that's right- even for those of you who weren't around in the 60's, in some way or another, you were hearing it then too!     Valleys of Neptune is a bit hit or miss as far as properly providing listeners with a consistent display of Jimi's guitar soloing skills.  Like always, some of this stuff is simply superb, while other moments are sort of forgettable.  This is sort of unforgiveable when you realize just how extraordinary Jimi Hendrix can be.     \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" is a minor disappointment.  It starts off with a fast riff and some decent guitar soloing but then... it dissolves into distortion which lasts entirely too long if you ask me.  Now some people love the distorted side of Hendrix's electric guitar- while revolutionary and ahead of its time, well to be honest, that stuff doesn't really sound *that* impressive in this day and age.  That being my biggest complaint with it.      This is why I love it most when Hendrix simply jams and comes up with memorable and creative guitar licks.  Luckily Valleys of Nepture features that side of Hendrix in addition to more.  To be fair, this isn't really *bad* distortion.  It's just... not my preference.       Look no further than \\"Red House\\".  At 8 minutes it's the longest song here by far, and it's also the BEST song on the album by far.  Not only the best song on the album, but perhaps the best version of \\"Red House\\" the man ever performed.  This is some of the deepest and most exciting blues I've ever heard- the guitar solos are constantly active and evolving and digging DEEP into your emotional state of mind.  It reminds me of Eric Clapton's version of \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" from his EC Was Here live album.  Obviously \\"Red House\\" came out before the Clapton song, but that's definitely the kind of blues that's flat out awesome.  Throw Zeppelin's \\"Since I've Been LovingYou\\" into that category as well.     \\"Hear My Train a Comin'\\" honestly can't compete with the version from Blues which is the ULTIMATE version (trust me on this one- I'm referring to the lengthy electric version of course; the one over 12 minutes long).  This one is a mighty disappointment in comparison.  It's a mid tempo, vocal melody-dominated, significantly less aggressive and impactful version compared to the one from Blues.   The chorus in particular repeats too many times for my liking but hey, I'm just being picky.  Had the Blues version never existed, I wouldn't be so darn persistent and determined to convince you that *that* version smears this one into the mud!  I guess to give a compliment, this version would fit in perfectly somewhere on the Band of Gypsys live album.       Also... let's be honest.  This song is still awesome to some extent no matter WHICH version I might prefer the most.  I love the song regardless.  It's just that my first impression was \\"Meh... hear the Blues version instead\\".     \\"Ships Passing Through the Night\\" is a different take on the blues with the drums playing a crucial part in the way they follow along to the guitar riff and vocals.  That's not exactly how I listen to most blues, so it's an interesting take on a different approach.  The song overall feels cleverly written and made with the purpose of combining funk with blues.  The results are that it's appealingly unique.  \\"Crying Blue Rain\\" feels undeveloped for the most part- like a rehearsel of blues and fiddling with an electric guitar to throw down any ol' thing.  Perhaps it's just another attempt at Hendrix being diverse and creative with the blues, who knows?  I admit I love when it speeds up near the end, though.     \\"Bleeding Heart\\" is mostly about a funky rhythm driving forward a pretty good vocal melody with only scattered moments of passable guitar soloing.  It's a pretty decent song overall but not a high point for me personally.  The song definitely feels overlong by a couple minutes.    It surely shouldn't have been 6 minutes long.  The speedy rhythm section of \\"Mr. Bad Luck\\" -along with the vocal melody- is fairly solid and almost danceable.  I don't know what to think about this song to be perfectly honest.  3 minutes is barely enough to come to any kind of definitive conclusion.  If you enjoy the vocals... well that's the songs most noticeable aspect.       \\"Lover Man\\" is Jimi's version of a standard blues song.   Of course this is Jimi Hendrix we're talking about here- \\"standard\\" being outrageously inventive, memorable and slightly different from other blues singers/guitarists.  The bluesy guitar work during the first minute is spectacular.  The vocals take away from what would have been better as strictly an instrumental piece.  There should have been absolutely NOTHING interfering with that guitar solo!  The title song has that updated early 70's sound to it, so I imagine it was recorded shortly before Jimi passed away.  It's sort of funky, rocking and vocal melody-focused all wrapped in one.  Some people find spiritual energy in the lyrics, and perhaps there is a little bit.   I can't really explain its biggest appeal.  It's really just a nice song.     Overall, it's another solid album by the legendary Jimi Hendrix.  It's no Blues (his BEST album ever!) but it's pretty darn good and highly recommended as well.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I just finished all six movies and a bunch (but not all) of the special features and I have to say I LOVE this set.  The PQ on all the movies is outstanding.  I think The Phantom Menace is the most noticeable upgrade (the DVD PQ was just awful for this one). I did notice some DNR, but overall the picture is very sharp and vivid.  Attack of the Clones was very good looking and I did NOT notice the supposed green tint everyone has been talking about.  Revenge of the Sith was perfect quality.  Episodes IV,V, and VI have never looked sharper or as colorful as they do now.  Being that they are old films, the PQ isnt as good as I-III, but that was to be expected.  The Audio on all the movies is fantastic.  I noticed subtle background noises I have never heard before. The sound mix really gives your system a workout.  The Changes made to this release turned out to not be so bad when watching the whole thing.  I understand why this bothers many people, but for me personally it didnt bother me.  The Special features I have watched so far were pretty interesting.  I think the collection of \\"Spoofs\\" could have been better, but still had many funny moments.  The Packaging for this set is alot nicer than I thought it was going to be when I first saw pictures of it online. The outside Box is very sturdy, as is the book and pages inside. The pages are designed to hold the discs securely and it is very easy to remove/replace the discs without scratching them.  The artwork through the set is very good, although it would have been nice to see the original poster artwork for each movie in the set, but no big loss. I highly recommend this Complete Saga release for Star Wars fans new and old, hardcore or casual, and for blu ray enthusiasts in general. I honestly believe this is the last release of Star Wars I will buy at least until the original unaltered trilogy gets released, which may or may not happen.  I know I am more than satisfied with this set.
B004BSFC46|3.0|I must say that this is good but just that I introduced it too late to my baby when she was 3 months old.  She was not very interested in it but this could be just her - am sure this is more useful for newborns.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I'll put it this way. This will probably be the best adaption of a big budget Thor film for quite some time. I don't see this being topped any time soon. Chris Hemsworth plays a fantastic Thor, and the remaining cast was great too. The only con about this movie is that the 3D isn't that good (the end credit sequence with cosmic fly-bys was great though). And the main \\"town\\" used on Earth. It was obviously (by the look of the buildings, and the wide camera shots)... a movie set town. Which ruined it a bit for me. Why go to Asgard when Natalie Portman is on Earth? =] I understand the studio not wanting to show Thor's full out power potential in the first movie, but I hope this explored in The Avengers movie, or in a potential Thor 2. He is capable of walking on a sun, planetary-level destruction with Mjolnir, etc. Overall, this is a great film that even your girlfriend will love.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Just as advertised.  Worked flawlessly with every bluetooth device I have.  I connected it to my ipod nano 6g, paired it with my bluetooth headphones, and let it play until my ipod battery died.  I got three hours of music. One of the other reviews says they got just an hour.  Maybe their ipod wasnt fully charged or their battery needed to be cycled.  Since I'm only using this with my wireless headphones when I work out, this is perfect.  I typically dont work out for more than 1 1/2 hours, so a 3 hour lifespan is perfect.

0553582038|3.0|I have to say I am a big fan of Martin's series, but with huge reservations at this point. I am in the middle of the 5th book in the series and at this point have to admit that I have skimmed much of book 4 and 5. The problem started in book 4. Up to that point his series was a masterpiece. Then he started to expand the plot to the point that no one would be able to manage the development of the plot line. He would leave plot lines in the middle of a cliff hanger (he practically always does that which gets quite annoying after a while), and then not return for what seems like ever. He even apologizes for this at the end of book 4. Adding so many new characters requires page after page of background information about characters. He also has a habit of leaving the scene in the middle and then instead of returning to it, he will have another character explain what happened robbing the reader of the pleasure of experiencing the events.<br /><br />I was hoping this ever expanding plot would end in book 5 when he clearly has to wind up many lose ends, but he is still expanding the plot in the last book. We have headed off in about 50 different directions at this point, and he thinks we need more instead of dealing with what we have. He also goes back to characters and instead of developing a suspenseful action packed set of events, he will bore the reader to death with page after page of background or insipid empty character history or uninteresting events.<br /><br />I am sure I sound angry and annoyed. This is only true because the series had so very much potential. And he does do extremely well in parts. The series is really unsurpassed in plot creativity and suspense from time to time. Too bad he does not fulfill that promise by developing the plot in a realistic doable manner and providing more consistent plot action.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a great game.  I let my kids play with it and they got through the first few levels, and then it got them to really think ahead. Starts to get challenging for adults around level 16.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Has anyone noticed or does anyone care that every one of the over 1300 reviews written for this box set were submitted weeks, even months before the set was actually released? Reviews written by people that have not seen the DVD's. Reviews written by people that have collected mis-information and half truths from internet blogs and from other rabid fans.    This is my opinion after watching the entire set:    No, this is not the complete end all be all definitive everything Star Wars that was ever made all in one place set (which it was never advertised as or even teased as)    Yes, it is a fantastic collection of Star Wars bonus and extra material and all of the films on BR presented beautifully. Wonderful picture and wonderful sound. Really nice, simple packaging and a good solid retail price with some nice retail extras depending on where you bought your set.    As for the re-tooling, tweaking and other changes:    This material is George Lucas vision, his property. He can change it as much as he wants based on his changing taste, modern technology or even on his mood on a particular day. It's his to do with as he pleases and he clearly pleases to ignore (in general) fan outbursts and distaste and to continue to \\"improve\\" his vision of what his property should be, it's his prerogative. I personally do not agree with it but as a business person, I understand it.    Will there ever be a COMPLETE box set? Probably. Will it have ALL versions of the films? Probably. Will it have the holiday special, SW toy commercials, Muppets and ALL of the features & featurette's ever made? probably. Will it include the complete Ewoks & Droids? Probably. Will it include bloopers and out takes? Probably. Will it cost $79.99? Probably not.     The kind of box set people want (myself included) will be a twelve (or more) disc set and will cost more like $199.00    Will it be made, why not? Lucas Film is a money making machine, an empire that employs thousands. It should be made, I believe it will be made and I do not believe that releasing this BR box set was a bad thing. It's a business and in order to run a business you need to release new product. 300 Different Boba Fett action figures, release and re release of EVERY playset and vehicle ever made, re releases of all of the vintage items (which essentially killed the secondary market) and on, and on, AND ON and people are complaining about the first Star Wars BR release?! JUST SILLY!    Stop whining and either buy it or don't, you all know that you already have the VHS collection(s), the DVD collection(s), the Laser Disc collection(s), and all of the bootleg VCD's & DVD's sitting in your collections (in my own collection too!). What is another $79.99 going to hurt to have the series in stunning BR?    Get over it and start saving your paper route money for the next \\"COMPLETE\\" BR box set! (Just like i'm doing and I can tell you that the news paper bag is killing my shoulder!)    In the mean time, enjoy your new BR box set because you know that you, me and every person that complained still ran out and bought it.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I actually enjoyed watching this movie! After reading the negative reviews, I took a chance on seeing this, & I'm glad I did. I got exactly what I was seeking--a tender and earnest story about 2 personalities connecting without the distortion of lust, a story that made me feel warm and hopeful.  Some people have complained that this movie wasn't realistic, but that wasn't a problem for me because I know that some movies are meant to be an escape from some of the harsh or boring realities of everyday life. I think 'Beastly' provided that temporary escape and seclusion with it's slightly surreal and whimsical backdrop placed in contrast to the gritty, detached, and self-absorbed city life.  I admit that the movie is not perfect--I liked the characters, but they could have been written with a little more dimension, and the ending could have used more substance. For instance, key scenes that were glossed over with a montage or time lapse could have been done as full dialogue scenes to really see them build the foundation of the relationship between Beauty and her Beast.  Also, after the \\"happily ever after\\" moment, I personally would have liked more of a glimpse at how the leading man went about life and society differently as a permanently \\"changed man\\". We know he got the girl, but I want to see what his new attitude and outlook inspired him to do with is life.  Despite its minor imperfections, I would definitely watch this film again and recommend it to my friends, because even though I'm in my late 20s, I know that I'll never outgrow transforming love and happy endings.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Reading the other reviews here, I can only conclude that this is a tremendously hit-or-miss product; in my case, it was a complete miss. It made the Kinect work worse than it did without it.    The Kinect sits on top of the TV, about 5 feet high, and the furthest I can move away from it, with my calves digging into the couch, is around 6 feet. As we're all aware, the Kinect doesn't work very well at this distance -- in my case it's kinda playable, but very borderline (losing track of the player enough to be annoying, and somewhat inaccurate even when it's locked on). I'd characterize the experience as being 70% playable -- not awful, and we can still have some fun with it, but not great. As such, a product like this seemed like it would be a godsend. Pull the field of play in just a bit, maybe a couple feet at most, that's all I need to be golden. And according to the specs, this is precisely what it should do -- Kinect recommends 6-10 feet to play with, the Zoom claims to reduce that by 40%, moving the play area to about 3-6 feet. That's perfect.    Unfortunately, there's nothing really more complicated to say than that it didn't work as advertised. At all. It appears to pull the play area in WAY too far, and even when you get into it, the Kinect can't track you properly.    With the lens on, and even after calibrating/tuning it, it completely lost sight of me at 6'. It started to pick me up as I moved past 5', but not enough that the Kinect was able to recognize my hands/head or create a wireframe. At 4' I started to get flickers of recognition, but nothing consistent. Moving up to 2-3' or so, too close to be usable anyway, it now recognized me, but without any semblance of accuracy; standing totally still, it registered my hands and head as jumping all over the place. For kicks, I tried playing a bit of Child of Eden and Kinect Adventures like this; it was laughable.    So again, it does seem to work for some people here, and maybe you'll be one of those, but I'dnever recommend this to anyone unless they could try it before buying it. My one completely unfounded theory, which I have no good way to test, is that the Zoom's lens may not be letting enough light through. The room I'm using it in is far from dark, but the light is on the softer side. If you're using it in an exceptionally bright room, you may have better luck than I did.

B002VHI8FE|5.0|I can scarcely believe that \\"The Blade Itself\\" is Joe Abercrombie's first novel. The characters are interesting and well fleshed-out, each with their distinctive voice and the story is captivating. As it is the first book of a trilogy, we are introduced to the different forces at play and start to see them test each other out. But unlike so many other fantasy books where our characters start as humble shepherds to become the most powerful muckey muck through a sweeping quest that will change the world, our characters start off older, sometimes bitter or cynical, and destined for...? I get the feeling that life is cheap in this world, that little good will come and we'll see events through the eyes of people that are merely caught up in the ride rather than guiding it. As his characters say, they go back to the mud leaving the ground richer and us poorer.    But while they live, they really live. Glokta is a wonderfully bitter person who was tortured in a battle and is now crippled, sent to work as a torturer himself. He is often cynical yet still shows traces of trust and almost loyalty while struggling to keep himself useful and alive. Logen is a battle-weary fighter who has been betrayed by his former allies and now has turned away from them and into an almost nihilism, trying to sacrifice himself to help others, asking only that they direct him. He turns to an enigmatic magi Bayaz who is now almost legendary in parts of the world (fitting since Logen himself has a near legendary reputation that he's trying to ignore). Other characters join in, each with their own voice and beliefs, all flawed but more real because of it.    The book starts by building the characters and the situation, slowly building the tension. Sword fighting and conflict is sprinkled throughout, keeping us on our toes and at the end we get a big climactic confrontation as several forces collide. But, fitting for book one of three, the results are inconclusive and it closes with threats, and ill omens.    I only give out five stars when the book is fun, interesting, well paced, as well as being well written and with solid characters. \\"The Blade Itself\\" has it all. As much as I see people raving about authors like GRR Martin, I think Abercrombie is one of the best of the fantasy writers I've read in a long time. He has the panache, politics and intrigue not to mention the characters but he also knows how to tell a tight, cohesive story that moves along and keeps the readers engaged right from the beginning (Steven Erikson, I'm glaring at you). Highly recommended.
B001UE27X8|5.0|I love the songs chosen on this CD.  Bill's playing is incredible and Tony's singing Divine.  Great addition to my collection of Bill Evans study.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|In a nut shell--this controller is very similar to an Xbox 360 controller.  Personally, that worked out well for me because we have owned an XBOX 360 console much longer than we have had the PS3...so this controller feels comfortable to me and I prefer the style.<br /><br />The controller it's self is made by PowerA and is the same size and weight as an Xbox 360 controller. It comes with an internal rechargeable battery, and vibrates...just like the XBox 360 rumble. It is motion compatible and has custom made L2 and R2 buttons.  It also has the glowing buttons, which you can turn on and off if you don't like them.<br /><br />The packaging also includes a USB controller adapter/receiver and charging cable.  I found out that this means the PS3 won't pick up the controller itself without the aid of the adapter to find its signal.  A normal USB cable for a wireless controller can be used to charge it and setting it up was fairly easy.  The only fault that I've heard others mention and I agree with is that when you turn the machine off, you turn the receiver off at the same time--so you can't turn on the console by pushing the center button.  Kind of annoying since I'm use to that!<br /><br />I also had my brother in law try it out.  He shares that he likes the size of this controller for his hands compared to the normal PS3 controller.  He also said that even though he likes this controller, he expects it to be as nice as the Xbox and thinks it's not up to par.  He also felt that the sensitivity was off and that he experienced a lag time as compared to the original PS3 controller.
1594744769|4.0|I have never written a review for a book - but I wanted to for this one to spread the word about this fabulous book!    Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is not a book that I would normally read.  Authors I usually read are James Patterson, Janet Evanovich, Patricia Cornwell, Jodi Picoult, among others.  However my book club at work was looking for suggestions for our next book and one of my co-workers suggested this book.  She then sent us a link to the trailer that the author did for the book.  That's what sold me!  It intrigued me - I loved seeing a trailer for a book!  I had no idea that people did that!    So I ordered the book from Amazon.  I usually use my Kindle for books but had read some reviews saying the picture quality was not that great and that the photos were important as part of the story.  (On a side note: I did see the book on someone else's Kindle and the pictures looked just fine to me).      I won't go into rehashing the story line - you have probably read it already elsewhere.  What I just wanted to say is that this book is well worth the read.  It got me from the very beginning and I didn't want to put it down.  The sign of a great book!  So if you are contemplating whether or not to read this book - I say you should.  Whether you buy it hard copy or on your Kindle, you will not be disappointed!

0143038583|5.0|This was a big book full of intensity and good detail.  In parts it was almost poetic.  I found I could not do it justice by summarizing the author's ideas in my own words, so I am going to do a lot of quoting.  Believe me, there is much more, and you should read the book.<br /><br />The author contends that not only excess corn--and all the unnecessary products from it--and the introduction of GMO seed have wrecked havoc with our farm system as well as, perhaps, our body's health system.  \\"By the 1980s the diversified family farm was history in Iowa, and corn was king\\" (p. 39).  A lack of diversification meant more plagues of insects and crop diseases.  Amazingly, the author states that \\"the farmers in Iowa...don't respect corn [but] will tell you in disgust that the plant has become a `welfare queen'.\\"  Hybrid flowers and tomatoes sound great, but hybrid corn consumes more polluting fertilizer than any crop (p 41).  Iowa, which was once our breadbasket, now imports 80 percent of its food--and this was in 2006.<br /><br />The world would be much less populated had a scientist not figured out how to \\"make\\" nitrogen apart from nature doing so.  About 60 percent of American commodity corn is fed to livestock which in times past spent most of their lives grazing on grasses (p 66).  \\"The urbanization of America's animal population [in feed lots] would never have taken place if not for the advent of cheap, federally- subsidized corn\\" (67).  Even farm salmon are now being fed on excess biomass corn (p 67).  E-coli bacteria thrives in the feedlot cattle--40 percent carry it in their gut; they produce a toxin that destroys human kidneys.<br /><br />Concentrated feed lots take the youngish cows off their natural diet of grass and force feed them corn, which they would not otherwise eat.  Corn just does not work with their stomachs and they are prone to illnesses for which antibiotics are used.<br />Producers believe price is the overriding issue when it comes to food purchasing, so producing a \\"product\\" as cheaply as possible is what guides most of our feed lots.  For healthy products to healthy people you must buy locally:  fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy.  \\"Artificial manures [synthetic fertilizers] lead inevitably to artificial nutrition, artificial food, artificial animals, and finally to artificial men and women\\" (pp 128, 148).<br /><br />\\"The simplist way to capture the sun's energy in a form animals can use is by growing grass\\" (p 189).  \\"For example, if the 16 million acres now being used to grow corn to feed cows,...became well-managed pasture, that would remove 14 billion pounds of carbon from the atmosphere each year, the equivalent of taking four million cars off the road\\" (p 198).<br /><br />\\"The government writes no subsidy checks to grass farmers.  Grass farmers, who buy little...pesticides and fertilizers, do little to support agribusiness or the pharmaceutical industry or big oil\\" (p 201).<br /><br />The best thing for our health and our animal's is \\"relationship marketing,\\" buying directly from farmers or co-ops.  You must become a non-Barcode person as much as possible when it comes to food.  You have to decide if you want to buy honestly priced food or irresponsibly priced (and polluted) food (p. 240, 241).  \\"Our food system depends on consumers not knowing much about [their food] beyond the price disclosed by the checkout scanner.  Cheapness and ignorance are mutually reinforcing\\" (p 245).<br /><br />If the American Joe and Jane don't push for change, America's chefs may \\"be leading a movement to save small farmers and reform America's food system\\" (p 245).  This is going to be a real MOVEMENT, perhaps along with the following:<br /><br />1.  anti-globalization (\\"globalization [or global capitalization] proposes to<br />  sacrifice [our ability to feed ourselves] in the name of efficiency and<br />  economic growth\\" [p 256])<br />2.  anti-genetically modified crops<br />3.  anti-patented seeds pushed by the WTO(the World Trade Organization)<br />4.  Slow Food, which defends traditional food cultures against the global tide of<br />  homogenization<br /><br />\\"A successful local food economy implies not only a new kind of food producer, but a new kind of eater, one who regards finding, preparing and preserving food as one of the pleasures of life rather than a chore\\" (p 259).<br /><br />\\"A growing body of scientific research indicates that pasture substantially changes the nutritional profile of chicken and eggs, as well as beef and milk.  ...  [Also] as it turns out, the fats in the flesh of grass eaters are the best kind for us to eat\\" (p 267).<br /><br />I only enjoyed Chapters 1-14 (Sections I and II); the final Chapters of 15-20 (Section III) I found somewhat off point to the previous sections.  You can ignore it and get the point/s of the author quite powerfully, even though this final section accounts for one-third of the book.od cultures against the global tide of       homogenization     \\"A successful local food economy implies not only a new kind of food producer, but a new kind of eater, one who regards finding, preparing and preserving food as one of the pleasures of life rather than a chore\\" (p 259).    \\"A growing body of scientific research indicates that pasture substantially changes the nutritional profile of chicken and eggs, as well as beef and milk.  ...

B001V7R09A|5.0|When Emil Gilels was hailed by his excel pianism over there, in the early fifties, he coined for posterity a concise but brilliant phrase that exalts him as a human being for his prodigious nobility and unlimited honesty : \\"Wait for Richter\\", he replied: \\"He is one hundred times better pianist than me.\\"<br /><br />About Richter has been published on rivers of ink and countless favorable reviews around the world.<br /><br />What I'd want to emphasize in this brief space, is above all, the prodigious capacity to venture Richter to the very heart of the score. Thus, Richter was able to bridge the gap between each score and the listener making a particular sound according to the composer and further with the work that was running. The second thing I want to highlight is the awesome power of concentration, such as a laser, which allowed him to scrutinize and interpret each work with an accent, dynamics, intonation, brightness, elegance and full range of emotions as a giant tuning fork, which somehow put the listener into a multifaceted scenario according to the program to run. It is therefore difficult to talk about a particular Richter sound.<br /><br />This magnificent set spans from 1957 to 1962 where smartly and wisely Deutsche Gramophone was well aware about his overpowering gifts as pianist, and the kaleidoscopic repertoire included here seems to prove itself.<br /><br />For many people, his Rach 2 conducted by Wisloski, is the maxim pinnacle about this score ever played and until this date never equalled. On the other hand, his Debussy was provided by other contours and profiles. His Tchaikovsky 1 with Karajan is unique by its own in what concerns its newful approach.<br /><br />Suffice it to add that this set is a must for any serious lover of great music, it contains an essential stage in the existence of the grand master (the Richter recordings ranging from their 42 to 47 years).<br /><br />Recommended without restrictions.
B002SSBD6W|4.0|As a vegetarian for almost 20 years this book didn't tell me many things I didn't already know, or hadn't already read. However, the content was provided in a new way. I think this book is useful and a must read for anyone who eats. If one decided to consume meat as part of their diet they should still know the process of cow evolving onto their dinner plate. The book inspired me and reminded me of all the reasons why I chose to omit food from my diet in the first place.<br /><br />Eating Animals is also an easy read, Safran Foer has a lovely narrative voice that makes the book appealing to a variety of ages and reading levels.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|A sturdy well made stand. I wish it was 2 inches taller so I could store more items such as headphones, mouse etc. but it is as described and a good value.
0385534639|5.0|I tend to try not to overpraise the books I love, but I can't remember the last time I read a book I loved as much as The Night Circus.  Everything about it was perfect and wonderful.  The prose had exactly the right balance of intricacy and accessibility, the characters were fascinating, the plot absorbing.  It clips along at an even pace, and I couldn't put it down!    The centerpiece of the book is the titular Night Circus, which is more or less the circus I always wished that I could visit -- beautiful, mysterious, and immersive.  The book is just as immersive as the circus is to its patrons.  As I read, I could taste the caramel, smell the smoke of the bonfire, feel the chill of the Ice Garden.      Morgenstern's imagination is boundless, and I was constantly surprised by her creativity and the sheer wonder of the things described.      I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the beautiful and fantastical.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|My 12-year-old son is a Star Wars fanatic (50+ books, multiple LEGO models, series of bobble head dolls, etc).  He knows the lore inside and out.  My wife remembers the films from High School and loves the story.  Our other two children are younger but still like the movies.  We own all 6 films on DVD and have been watching them on a 110\\" screen, upscaled by a Playstation 3.  We read about the changes to the films and debated cancelling our order, but decided to wait and see.    The Blu Ray version of Episode 4 was an enjoyable experience for all of us.    Film clarity and detail far surpass even the upscaled DVD.  The space ships, the Death Star, even Darth Vader's mask look so much different in this version that my wife said, \\"Wow.\\"  Warning for parents of young children:  you can definitely see the burned skeleton of Uncle Owen after the Storm Troopers finish with his home.  What was a vague outline of a human form before is now definitely a burned body, with some bone visible, but you will probably need a large screen to notice it.  The sound was excellent, including small background details in Mos Eisley and other scenes that really add to the atmosphere.    The changes to the film actually added to the entertainment value.  We all watched more intently to see if we could notice them, and my son the expert filled us in on the backstory associated with each change.  Obi Wan's dragon call imitation is different, but still caused my kids to chuckle...it is no more scary than before, just different.  The rocks in front of R2-D2 appear for a couple of seconds in one scene.  The family didn't care.     Overall, we were entertained by the new blu ray version.  We saw things we have never seen before.  We heard things more clearly than we have heard before.  We had a good time as a family looking for and discussing the changes.  We will watch it again.    And, for some final perspective on the changes, my 12-year-old son said this, \\"Directors are always adding deletedscenes to or removing original scenes from a 'Director's Cut' version or an 'Extended Version'.  What's the difference with Star Wars?  We already know the story.\\"        Watch these movies for what they are, entertainment, and you will not be disappointed.
B002KKCVX2|5.0|I recommend these sandals as they are very comfortable and easy to use. You can wear them anywhere and anytime. I even wear them to work, they look respectable. Excellent!
B001GWK2MC|5.0|All the reviews I read were negative, so I was slow to purchase this product. I got it for my daughter's first birthday.  She and my 4 year old love this jumper.  It has held up well.  My only problem with it is we leave it outside and it has filled up with rain several times and takes a while to dry out.
B004SBX112|2.0|I purchased the Ad-Free version.  To my disappointment, it has advertisements.  They are the most annoying types of advertisements.  Full video ads with sound.  The advertisements are annoying and disrupt the gameplay.  Very disappointing.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|fun game some challenging puzzles def recommend if u like puzzle games like burn the rope or cut the rope
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Should you get this set if you want all the Star Wars movies with the best picture and sound yet, Yes! Want nifty stuff not released before like the other deleted scenes, yes. But shoud you also hold on to the past dvds, sadly, yes. The deleted scenes from the prequels that were in finished form on the 2 disc dvds are not on this set... Nor is the excellent Empire of Dreams documentary. That said the extras that are here are quite good. I can also confirm that the animated short from the Holiday Special with Boba Fett is indeed on this set as an easter egg. Lastly, the changes. Did they bother me, honestly , no. In 1997 and 2004, thought some of the changes I had heard about would bother me and they did'nt. Will Lucas release the original cuts at some point, yeah I think he will. But for now this is very well done set worth getting if you want the films in Blu Ray Format.
0385534639|5.0|This is one book a reader should buy a ticket too.  The main characters, Celia and Marco, have been girded for battle for a very long time.  However, when they are finally put in the arena, they find that they do not know what they are fighting for or what they want the outcome to be.  Instead, they choose to construct elaborate tents...they end up impressing each other and are unconcerned about the judges.  Their romance builds slowly, but steadily in the novel.<br /><br />The reader will love getting to know the individual characters as well.  In a circus, there are many odd characters and the author remains true to this theme.  The secondary characters are intriguing and often know much more than they tell...the reader will have fun guessing about the plot of this story and the perfect ending.  The main characters complement each other perfectly, it seems perfectly natural that they would fall in love.<br /><br />The events are fast-paced and structured so as not to overwhelm the reader with the awesome that is in this book.  The reader won't be confused by the sub-plots or the much larger plot that has many hidden secrets tucked away.  The author writes very concisely, leaving just enough details to keep the reader on his/her toes.  The ending is both perfect and surprising.  This book is perfect for teens/young adults/adults.<br /><br />*complimentary review copy provided, this does not affect my opinion in any way*
B000RJO578|4.0|Fresh from making the classic Zombie comedy [[ASIN:B0025VLEM0 Shaun of the Dead [Blu-ray]]] Pegg and Frost presumably had offers of significant funds to make a more mainstream comedy (after all, Zombies are not exactly family viewing). The result is Hot Fuzz which in spite of its broader market retains the trademark Pegg and Forst comedic appeal.     Mixing off-beat comedy with elements of spoof Hot Fuzz mixes Hollywood with rural England to excellent effect. Recommended.
0385732554|5.0|It was weird in the begeining of the book but it got better toward the end its probably the best book ive read at the end is thrilling and they leave you thinking it kinda made me mad but i still like it.Its for more around young adult and kids probably 10 n older.  it really good.
030788743X|5.0|I really, really enjoyed this book. Even though other people gave it a great review, I thought that it might be a little corny, but was the complete opposite. Not to ruin any of the story line, but some of the things mentioned in the book brought back great memories. But what I like about the whole thing is that it is not un-realistic at all, and you can picture yourself in the main characters place. It's the perfect amount of humor, flirting, love story, and action. I actually lol'd (laughed out loud) at certain parts of the book, so for me, when that happens, I really like it. I finished the book in about two days (I read very fast), but I will for sure be reading it again in the near future. So buy it already and get ready for a great time.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|On the Droid bionic, this app will take up maybe an eighth of the screen, which does not even let me see the entire game. If the developer fixes this, it seems like a great concept.  EDIT: after a few tries, app used full screen size.  Leaving original review so the dev can see the bug.
1451629184|4.0|This book was heart-wrenching and at times difficult to read. After reading for an hour or so, I'd have to put it down for a while to absorb and process the horrors this little girl suffered for so many years. Jaycee is to be commended for keeping love in her heart despite being abused and separated from her family all those years.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great picture and audio sorry to the die hard fans but this is one solid blu-ray set. If you want to see Star Wars in the BEST picture and audio at the moment get this you will not be disappointed unless you care for some minor details like rocks being deleted or added and Vader's bubble gum color lightsaber???? and so many other minor BS loyalist are crying about. Which you will not notice unless your life revolves around Star Wars. Great job 20th Century Fox awesome Blu-ray release.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|It's a good little puzzle game among the lines of Cut the Rope. Graphics are great, animation is smooth, gameplay is addictive... whar more could you want out of a puzzle game?

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I really liked this movie. I couldn't hardly put the book down! Really glad to see it being made into a movie. Glad to see they kept most of the scenes true to the book. The cast was what I pictured from the book. The acting was awesome. Being a southern I thought the movie was very southern and seem true to what was happening in the 1960s. The only part I think they rewrote from the book was the scene between Skeeter's maid and her mom. I think the scene was different from the book. Other than this the movie was worth every penny of my movie ticket. Glad it was good to wach!

B004UG7RQ0|5.0|This little gizmo nicely solved a problem I was having with an iSimple aftermarket iPod dock in my Ford F-150.  The problem:  It was not possible for my kids to watch the iPad in the truck but pump the sound through the truck sound system.  With the iPad plugged into the dock,  it says that it is connected to a TV and is trying to send the video to my stereo system :(  I needed a way to keep the picture on the iPad, but send the sound to my speakers.  My truck stereo has neither an aux in or tape deck.    Plugged this dockBoss in, all fixed.  I also got a little better control on my sound now,  since the iPod dock does not allow control of volume levels on the phone while plugged in.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is big leagues mind bender. Prepare to be challenged obsessed to the point where you will be begging for a hint. But you can only get one hint every 24 hours.<br /><br />Nearly all paths lead to a juicy bug and it's your mission to keep the spider(s) hungry and help the bugs fly free.<br /><br />You take your time in this turn-based race to cut off all paths allowing the spider to get to any of the bugs stuck in the web. You cut one rope, then the spider makes its move until you either free all the bugs all the spider eats one. And it's easy, in the beginning. Then the webs get increasingly complex and there are more and more bugs to be rescued, translating into more opportunities for the spider and and demanding more planning ahead and precise execution by the web-cutter.<br /><br />While the maker warn that the game is not optimized for all tablets, it plays well on my XOOM once I get past the opening sequence.<br /><br />I find little fault to this game so five-stars it is.
6305176299|5.0|it was a great delivery with no problems at all.  i found nothing wrong with this particular object.  Sandra Bullock is also one of the most beautiful women I see, let alone a great person.
B000002L7Y|5.0|Bought this after watching the video for \\"Take On Me\\", my absolute favorite video ever made.  Rediscovered this super synth pop CD, and got interested in exploring a-ha's other works, since in fact they are NOT the one-hit-wonders most Americans think they are.  They've been making great music appreciated all over the world for the last 25 years. (Just get the \\"25\\" compilation!) A-Ha ended their run last year with a final phenomenal world tour. The 80's never sounded better!!!!And the solo projects of Morten, Mags and Pal are worth a listen.  It all started with this collection in 1985.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Peaceful little time killer that works well and runs great. Nice variation on a theme. Worth .99 without a doubt.  HTC EVO 4G.
B003U0I9U0|5.0|This double cd compilation contains all the great a-ha songs of their 25 year career.  Of course a few may have been missed, but that would entail a much bigger cd set.  A-ha went out \\"Ending on a High Note\\" and I still love the band, will forever.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|I've been an a-ha \\"fan\\" for over 20 years. And I say a \\"fan\\" because what I've heard from them was 3 or 4 songs. I bought this disc because a) is a bluray, and b) it has The Sun Always Shines on TV (my favorite). The whole show is amazing, the voices, although not the same as 20 years ago, are great also. This is a must-have for any 80's fan. 100% recommended.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The title says it all. Stop changing these movies. Remaster them properly, and release the original versions.     George Lucas is just doing this for the money. There's no reason to give him more for crap.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|People sure seem to like to whine, don't they? This game is fun, looks good, and has an admittedly cute storyline. More fun than I thought. Not sure about longevity, but definitely worth a look. Runs great on my Droid Incredible.
B00005QFE5|5.0|In devouring the films of Zhang Yimou lately, I finally got around to The Road Home. I find it amazing that some of the most profound, gorgeous, and unforgettable films are ones I'd scarcely heard of before watching them.<br />Please don't be fooled by the brevity of this review. I've chewed up full pages with reviews of movies I hardly remember let alone enjoyed. But to be fair to my middling skills, there is little I can say about this movie except that it is quite possibly the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.<br />If you're reading reviews of this film, you might already be aware that Yimou makes breathtakingly beautiful and emotionally evocative films. Rarely have I watched one of his films without marveling at the tremendous colors as well as happily giving in and shedding a tear or twenty. Beyond that, however, it is what this movie accomplishes using stunning simplicity that truly makes it noteworthy. How many romantic tales can you recall without the slightest physical interaction? When was the last (or first!) time you saw a movie where love was expressed solely in exquisitely simple tasks such as making a meal, cleaning a chalkboard, weaving a banner, or waiting for your love to walk down the road just so you can steal a heartbreakingly brief look into each other's eyes?  From the very moment that Di and Luo's eyes meet, I was hooked. By the time Luo walks out of the school to see Di, I was a hopelessly blubbering fool in a way that The Notebook to the 10th power could never hope to elicit.<br />But I've said enough. True love is real, true love is forever, and true love is pure and simple. If you believe that, you will absolutely cherish this movie as the rarest of jewels that it most assuredly is.
B003EYVXTQ|4.0|I purchased this because this movie received excellent reviews from just about every critic.  I liked it but did not love it, so I was a little disappointed.  I'll have to watch it again.  The two lead actors Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes ARE excellent as are all the other actors in this film.  Really good performances.  I guess what I didn't care for is it's pace is slightly slow but does come up with some interesting twists and turns.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Finally an original movie idea that could have a hint of truth behind it. I loved Limitless fast paced, good action, and get this a good story. I'm looking forward to watching it all over.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|I bought the red and blue albums on cassette when they were first released back in 1973.  They have always been my go to albums for the Beatles and have been so sad that I could never get the on CD.  For Christmas my boys bought them for me on CD and they enjoy them with me often in the car.  I really like the way they are split into 62-66 and 67-70 since the Beatles were very different in those eras.  Also, the insert with a lot of the Beatles history and lyrics make these a Beatles Must Have.

B005LY4B0A|3.0|Seems like you have to dance all over the screen to hit the web you need to cut. Either the game doesn't respond to touching, or the active area is incredibly tiny. fix that and explain the rules (no idea how to get 3 stars vs 1 star) and it will be a great game.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Bought this Heatsink to replace a Zalman CNPS-7700Cu that I had from 2006 to cool my new i5-2500k build.  I knew this heatsink was big, but I wasn't expecting it to be as big as it was, which is a good thing as you'll know it'll cool down your CPU without issues.     Installation was a pretty big hassle, as others have mentioned already.  Since I Have a CoolerMaster HAF 912 case, I didn't have to remove the mobo to install the back plate, so that was a positive. Getting the heatsink on the CPU is not an issue either; the biggest hassle was getting the \\"X\\" figured retention plate screwed in place.  You have to line it up underneath the heatsink with the 4 nuts you screw in when installing the back plate, but it is nearly impossible to screw the retention plate without an extra pair of hands.  I tried doing it alone but the heatsink kept sliding back and forth (due to the applied thermal paste) when I tried to line it up to screw it in. Once I got some extra hands, I got it screwed in, though I did have to force it in (thought I was going to break it).    I did not use the fan that came included with the Hyper 212 as I already had 2 Noctua 120mm fans, which are quieter and push more air. I set up a horizontal push-pull on my HAF 912 case with another Noctua 120mm fan blowing air out through the back. Let me just say that even running at 1200RPM, these fans are ultra quiet! (The fans I am using are these:[...]  One added bonus is that CoolerMaster gives you a sticky rubber material that you can attach to the fan when you screw the fan holders in.  This prevents any vibration noises when the fan is hitting on the heatsink. I found that to be a very good touch.    Now, lets go to the results:    My i5-2500k OC'ed to 4.4ghz idles at 27-30 degrees and maxes out at 63 degrees when running Prime for over 12 hours.    When playing BF:BC2 and MoH at ultra high settings with a Radeon 6950, the CPU does not get past 55 degrees (in comparison to my Zalman, which was average 64 degrees when I was playing those games).    P.S. Forget the instructions, go to youtube and search for this heatsink and you'll see an installation video from CoolerMaster with a walk-through on how to install it.       Conclusion: Buy this heatsink! I cannot believe this monster is <$30. If you check benchmarks online, you will see that the Hyper 212 performs almost the same as the $80-100 Zalman's but for a big fraction of the cost. The fact that this can keep an i5-2500k Oc'ed to 4.4ghz below 65 degrees when running Prime is outstanding.

1558908382|4.0|Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a former CIA operative who became a freelance hit man, making good money killing people he doesn't know. However, he's no longer happy in his work and seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin). Martin accepts an assignment in Detroit near his old home town (Grosse Point) at a time that coincides with his 10th high school reunion. It also offers an opportunity to see his old high school sweetheart, Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver).<br /><br />She still has a flame for him, they attend the reunion together, and Minnie learns that Martin is a professional killer. Turns out the hit job he was hired to do is her dad. Meanwhile, others are on the job (duplicate contracts), there's lots of shooting, and in the end she accepts and forgets about his past, and they go off to live together as he renounces his old profession.<br /><br />Some of the pieces don't fit together, but its still reasonably credible, and definitely funny.

B005NUFU9S|5.0|This was an amazing episode.  It was really creepy scary.  It was really creepy and very tension filled.  The monsters were creepy.  The actors and actresses were AWESOME!  Many had to act alone showing extreme emotion despite nothing being there.  They were fantastic.  The monster was both frightening and sad.      I wanted to cry at the end and in fact still feel choked up.      I think this is one of my favorite episodes.  Scary and emotional.  Huge emotional payback.      Awesome imagery, especially the moving hallways.  That ultimate monster was seriously ugly!        ======SPOILER THOUGHTS=====          I wonder who was in the Doctor's room?  I bet he saw himself . . . the one thing he fears above all else.  Either that or all of his prior dead or damaged companions.      I hate to see Rory and Amy end the way it did, but he is such a danger to them that there really is no other way out.  Both have already \\"died\\" multiple times under his \\"care\\" or been damaged in awful ways.  Yet, he remains reckless.    I can't wait to see what is next.  Given his recklessness, the only companion for him is River Song or Captain Jack.  Somebody who enjoys the danger, does not injure so easily, fights, and does not have ultimate worshipful faith in the doctor.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Saw this movie the 2nd week it was @ the theatre. I took my ex-boyfriend in honor of the amazing woman who raised him, who was a maid for the wealthy in the 50's and 60's. This story is beautiful and so true to life. The unfortunate thing is the superior mentality still exists in my own culture of people and it is sad. I totally related to \\"Skeeter\\" and could see myself being motivated to bring the maids stories to life. There is humor in this movie but the message is very powerful. Good job to all the cast!!

B003Y5H5AG|1.0|This is the 1987 film:Masters of the Universe all over again. They both have the same stupid storyline. The only difference is that Master of the Universe was made at the height of the shows popularity. This film was not. The acting is not that good. The subplot is ponitless. It doesn't know which age group they trying to appeal too. Neil Patrick Harris and Hank Azaria were wasted in this film. It's not funny at all. The Smurfs song is annoying. The only good thing about this film is the CGI. AND YOU THOUGHT THE LAST AIRBENDER WAS A BAD FILM!!!! I give this film 1 out of 10.

B005974CNA|5.0|Mike Mangini was a great addition to the legacy of Dream Theater. He fits in very well with the crew in his musical style. As expected, this album's content continued to push the progressive nature of melodic/epic  rock/metal, I know people often don't even know where to put DT as a band. As all of their previous albums do, this album continues the tradition of having an underlying story to it.<br /><br />A Dramatic Turn of Events contains songs of both metallic origin and their soft progressive rock side; totaling over an hour of track time, it is worth far more than you pay. This is MUSIC, in the truest sense of what music is. These are pieces, true musical compositions, not just \\"songs from a band\\".
1401223176|5.0|If I had to give an epithet to Batman Hush it would be: perfect. For me the graphic novel made by the team Jeph Loeb, Jim Lee and Scott Williams is a work of art that all Batman fans must have. The introduction made by Jeph Loeb in the graphic novel shows the dedication these three men had when doing it, and how they realized how important this story was going to be.<br /><br />The story begins with Batman on a mission to rescue a boy that has been kidnapped by Killer Croc, during the operation Batman realizes that this kind of things is something that Killer Croc wouldn't have made, so he thinks who's behind the operation. Who's the real brain of all this. At the beginning it seems that Catwoman is behind all this but his investigations will take to somebody that is moving the strings, somebody we have never seen before, but is someone who knows Batman very well and won't stop until defeat him.<br /><br />This story isn't that dark, the hero doesn't move in the scum of Gotham as much as in other comics we have seen, here we have a romance between Batman a Catwoman that brings some emotional stability to the hero in some stages of the story. She even helps inside the Batcave and in the investigation. We have some flashbacks in the past of Bruce Wayne and his friend Thomas Elliot when they were children, some allies like Lois Lane, Clark Kent, Huntress, Oracle or Dick Grayson and Tim Drake.<br /><br />And we have a good selection selection of villains in this graphic novel like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Clayface, Harley Quinn, Joker or even Lex Luthor as President of USA.<br /><br />The script made by Jeph Loeb makes this story very attractive and interesting maybe he gave a clue of who was that new enemy very soon, something that makes him lose a lot of attractive. An easy story to read and you don't need to go to other arcs to know what's going on. Jim Lee's art it's perfect for this kind of story full of details and a lot of good techniques we normally don't see in comics very often. I also emphasize the Alex Sinclair's good job in the right use of the colors to not wrinkle all the work of Jim Lee. My recommendation is that you have to pick this graphic novel if you want to have one of the best stories of Batman ever made.size the Alex Sinclair's good job in the right use of the colors to not wrinkle all the work of Jim Lee.

B0016Q2D5M|5.0|This movie has saved me some money on therepy.  My depression lifts every time I watch this film.  It is not going to win an Oscar but those fillms never make me laugh.  If you need a frivolous film with 9th grade humor this is the perfect movie.
B003JXUXPW|5.0|CHeck him out on YouTube and you will realize this guy is the complete package of a jazz singer. And if you're in New York, he is appearing at Smoke (105 & Broadway) every Thursday -- no cover!!
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This movie transcends all religions. The acting by the characters was excellent. Definitely requires Kleenex on the side. The songs were so beautiful and moving. I would rate it as one of the best movies I have ever seen.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This movie is mainly about Charles Xavier and Eric or Magneto. It's about their lives before the Original X-Men movies. How they met, whether or not they were ever really friends and how everything went wrong between them. It shows us a lot that we couldn't have known without this movie. The back story to Mystic \\"the blue girl\\" that is Magneto's right hand girl. She has a very good story. Everyone should give it a chance. It's not dumb like I have heard people say. Some people just don't like prequels. But I don't think of it that way. I think of it as the first movie. Then the rest were made. Whereas X-men Origins is a prequel. I love that movie too. I'm just saying. So anyway great movie! Even if you haven't seen it, you should buy it! Amazingg!
B005LY4B0A|2.0|the game plays great on my galaxy tab but for some reason on the 4th stage of world 1 I can't get more then 1 star, all the instructions say is to save all the bugs. I save both bugs on level 4 and I get 1 star every time. if there is more then just to save all the bugs then the instructions should say so. I got 3 stars on the first 3 levels doing the same thing I did on level 4 but I can't get more then 1 star on level 4. this is so stupid for not explaining why I'm not getting all 3 stars.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because I have NO doubt what-so-ever that this boxed set is amazing looking on blu-ray. Lucas always does a great job of taking care of his movies but I will not be buying this or any SW set for one reason.....this is just the first of many, many, many, many, many releases and the content of each release will be different from the other and none of them will have everything on it requiring the fans to buy several different movie sets if they want all of the additional content. George has been doing this since the videotape era. One set comes out and it is great then later on down the road another set is released with additional content but lacking content of previous sets then another variation is released and so on. I have no desire to jump on that never ending 'candy trail' of a roller coaster. One does not have to watch these on bluray to understand what has been going on since the videotape era regarding these releases to make this decision.<br />Like I said, I believe this set will look FANTASTIC on blu-ray and the additional content will be very enjoyable and I think people that do buy this will not be disappointed at all but don't get upset when, in a year or so, another blu-ray boxed set or individual releases are released with more or less on it cause it WILL happen.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|this game is fine, but not great. I don't want to be one of the haters but it is just okay. B you really can't complain too much given that its free.
B00004XONN|5.0|I had a quick skim through the reviews of the album, let's just say I'm more than disappointed with the childish and ignorant one star reviews that have been written about this album.   From one person essentially claiming that this isn't music to others saying the band just put together a random bunch of crap and called it an album. I'm sorry but if you're not open minded enough to enjoy what's on the album can you at least be grown up enough to not have a cry about it and write over opinionated hate reviews. I barely found anything constructive in them, no one stated why they disliked some of the songs and those who did are hardly the type you would want to rely upon when making an informed buying choice, 'techno dribble' is the term these people brand it.     To the open minded and non closed in person. Skip the one star reviews as they will sadly not be of any assistance with you unless you yourself are an ignorant purist.   This is a stunning album, a foray into the power of electronic and traditional music styles. This has as much meaning as Ok Computer and The Bends-make no mistake about that.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Blytescom for making such a fun, simple game! Up there with angry birds and plants vs zombies. I am very grateful!
1936594390|5.0|Oscar Wilde truly had a way with words. The flow of the book is like poetry. Whilst some may claim the characters lack depth I would argue that one doesn't read a book like this for the depth of characters or plot; It's more about feelings, descriptions and passions.
B0036TGT3E|1.0|Who doesn't love this movie? Despite it not matching the 1995 original because of new edits and sequences, it's still an awesome movie.  That said, WHY IS THERE NO DIGITAL COPY INCLUDED?  Not everyone watches 100% of their media at home on the TV.  Therefore, I'll download it instead.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Found the item, placed the order, received the product in a reasonable amount of time. All is good. I'm happy.
1594202710|5.0|In his formidable 500-page-plus book, equally formidable scholar-diplomat Henry Kissinger writes about the nation with which he is inextricably linked: China. Kissinger infuses his text with impressive personal recollections based on more than 50 visits to China over 40 years, working either officially as national security adviser and secretary of state, or unofficially as a foreign policy expert. In that time, he has seen China's evolution through four generations of its leaders. His insights on foreign policy and his personal rapport with top officials enable him to embellish this diplomatic history with extraordinary detail and discernment. getAbstract highly recommends the book's vast scope to anyone seriously interested in examining China's current and future role in world politics and economics, and that should be just about everyone.     However, the electronic version of this book can be found for a much better price in ebay.com

B005CMSDKA|5.0|This isn't a movie where the plot is completely laid out for you.  It gets the juices flowing, if you know what I mean.  This is not your typical action movie.  It's thought-provoking.  How often does anyone refer to anything that Hollywood pumps out as, \\"Thought-provoking?\\"<br /><br />The cinematography and editing choices are completely unique (that's a good thing).  It works well with the Chemical Brother's soundtrack.  Very cool to watch the successful collaboration between both director and artists.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Viewed this 3d video the day it came in the door. Very happy with plot and quality 3d sceens. In the world of 3D movies I think is a close second to Avatar. Waiting on the sequel.
0545259088|2.0|I should have left this one alone.  For me, Shiver was good as a stand alone.  But, I read Linger and while I wasn't overly found of the 4 viewpoints, I liked it overall.  I didn't think this one would be such a huge let down.  I will try not to be to negative during this review, because a lot of people really liked it.<br /><br />The storyline felt incredibly slow.  It seemed like a lot of the book was waiting for something to happen.  We waited for Grace to become human and then we waited for the hunt.  The story didn't seem to really pick up pace until the hunt was moved and then it was over.<br /><br />I liked Same and how he obsessed over Grace when she was gone.  And the torment he must have gone through when everyone thought he had something to do with her disappearance.  I liked Isobel and Cole's relationship.  Since we see so little of them actually together, their relationship seems particularly volatile and intense.  I wasn't overly found of Grace.  She seems really selfish.  The attitude that she has drove me a little crazy.  To think she can be missing for so long and waltz back in with no explanation and expect privileges was a little audacious of her.<br /><br />Besides the incredibly slow pace, the book had two major drawbacks for me.  First one is completely personal.  The first time the hunt was mentioned in conjunction with Idaho, the wolves, and killing sheep, I really should have just put the book down.  Because in the end, it felt like an agenda to me, and one that I really didn't like.  And second, the ending was... well it wasn't all that great.  I felt like it answered nothing.  There was no closure.
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|A fun film, Thor balances its action and Shakespearean, stylized dialogue well. Though I was skeptical of the value of the 3-D when I saw it in theaters, it is well worth it in the home video format, adding substantially to the overall fun of the experience.     One other note: each of the deleted scenes, with the possible exception of a small moment involving a dog, adds critical character introductions and depth which were palpably lacking when I first watched the theatrical cut. They should never have been cut from the film. It is a tragedy that the producers did not feel it worth polishing the special effects in these scenes for the BD, nor adding a branching option to watch a longer cut.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Just like new. Why pay full price when you can just get it used And it plays just like a brand new dvd. it only took 3 days to get it and it was a great movie
B0050PYNO4|3.0|Two British amateur ufologists Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) visit COMICON in the US. Then they are off to the UFO sites in the US. They have a close encounter with a maniac driver. Little did they know they were going to encounter Paul an, an area 51 escapee who just wants to go home.  We go along for the ride. There we encounter several cultures on the journey.<br /><br />I first saw the trailer for this movie on TV; the one where Paul brings the bird back to life and then does what comes naturally.  That set the tone for the whole film. The film does offend prudes of all types with it British style of humor (however Universal City, CA) if not it would have let someone down.  For me it was the excessive potty mouth. However being part of the aggregate it was probably necessary.<br /><br />A nice side part of the film is that they make fun of or incorporate a tad of quit a few of the major sci-fi movies. Watching the extras we learn that they went out of the way to also incorporate filming stiles of some great movies.<br /><br />For some sort on inexplicable reason I really enjoyed the film and it made me think of a lesser known film named Out There [VHS] (1995), of which I am still waiting for an official DVR transfer.<br /><br />[[ASIN:6303965954 Out There [VHS]]]

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Like someone addicted to plastic surgery - all the fans have ever wanted was the natural beauty of the original films.  Video looks good. Audio is amazing.  Shame it is all the better to see the nips and tucks that Lucas brings to his greatest creation.  Stop botoxing, lip-enhancing, and \\"enhancing\\" these movies to death.  They are starting to only faintly resemble the beautiful creation they once were....

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is very well built, and I love that it is customizable on the inside! You can move the different section dividers and velcro straps around to fit the equipment you have. The pads are very sturdy and I feel like my camera is very safe in the backpack. There are also a lot of different pockets for extra batteries/memory cards/charger/etc. It's pretty big, so if you don't have a ton of lenses or other equipment you might want something a little smaller to start with, but other than that it's great!
0312370849|5.0|You will not hardly be able to put this book down.  It is filled with so much emotion of a war time that tore a country and its families.    Sarah's Key was well written and educational into a time when fear was at its magnitude.    You may even find yourself praying, and a few tears for the characters, as you move forward in this drama.    A Great read!

030788743X|3.0|I was sucked in by the hype on this one, I have to admit.  The plot sounded like a cheesy framing device for a bunch of fan service, but the AV Club gave it an A, so how bad could it be?  The answer: surprisingly so.  While the first two thirds of the book are charming and the story moves quickly, the writing is so simplistic and shallow that it really felt like it was written for pre-teens.  It really falls apart at the end, where a whole bunch of things that are clearly supposed to be touching character moments instead fall utterly flat, and the final battle reads like someone piled up all of their toys on top of a box of M-80s and then lit the suckers up.  This all happens via a couple of magic items that make the book's ending obvious the second they are introduced.  The \\"it's OK\\" description that goes with a three star rating has never been more apt.  I didn't hate the book, but I wasn't all that impressed either.
B004LWZW42|1.0|I found that the movie does not follow these characters very well. It is a pitty that the movies have moved so far away from the comic books. I was most annoyed with the theft of Angel, and making Angel a girl with fairy wings. In the end the way they play this is comes across that Magnito is right and Professor X is wrong. Didn't like it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas further debauches his original classics with filth. After hearing Lucas changed more, I was HOPING that he would have just changed the few things he did this time around on the theatrical versions, like starting from scratch. Obviously even that was too optimistic. These are just BluRay rereleases which have been further destroyed. Don't waste your time or money with these. Yea, the picture quality is amazing in all 6 films, but then again the first 3 films aren't worth watching anyway. Save your money, buy the Bonus Disc DVD version and watch the theatrical films as they were originally meant to be viewed.
B004GIV0QK|5.0|I really enjoy watching this movie and never tire of it. It's really dated, especially looking at the giant computers. But, that doesn't take away from the story line. I would have loved for them to make a sequal with Karen Allen and Charles Martin Smith raising the human/alien child.
B0052WSX32|5.0|I love this album.  It feels like she is in the same room with you singing.   Thank you Doris for all the years of entertainment.  As usual, she makes me smile and her voice is beautiful.  I will be buying this as Christmas presents for people.
1594744769|5.0|This was a delightful read! Just how this book managed to create so much magic in my grown up mind is a mystery to me.

B001PPLIFU|1.0|From making a Bond movie in the top 5 best ever to making the worst Bond film ever. Poor Daniel Craig still does a good job but the plot sucks. The man with a Golden Gun and Moonraker look like pure genius next to this disaster.
B00005JMUA|2.0|Too long. Could easily cut 45 minutes off this movie.  The vol 1 was entertaining, not this one.  At least, I know now how this story end.  Was happy to rent it and not to spend 15$ at the theater for this movie.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|From someone who actually owns and has seen the Blu ray set here is review...    1.Video quality 4.5 out of 5. - Definitely the best these movies have ever looked. In Empire Strikes Back, you can vividly see the fur on the tauntaun. The special edition additions were blended in much better then with the previous DVD set. I'm not a fan of the Special editions, this set makes it more bare able. The prequels look on par with the original trilogy, however episode 3 is the show stopper. By far the best picture quality of the set.      2. Audio 7 out of 5. - The sound on this set is amazing. I couldn't believe my ears as the Tie's were buzzing past my ears from my home theater.     The only reason I am giving this set 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't include the original theatrical versions. If you're a star wars fan and are on the fence about this set, its definitely an upgrade from the DVD's.

0060853972|5.0|I have very high standards for books. I have been known to spend half an hour stomping through a bookstore, having concluded that I have already read every good book in existence and will never read another good book. On the other hand, it used to be that when someone asked me what my favorite book was, I would hem and haw for a few minutes listing authors and subgenres and philosophies that interested me and avoid a straight answer.    This is my favorite book.    It's clever. It's witty. The characters are well-developed and interesting, the dialogue is snappy, and (SLIGHT SPOILER) you won't realize how much you missed books with happy endings until you finish this one. It's filled with the very best kind of pop culture references and the sort of very British humor you can find in Douglas Adams (and, of course, anything Terry Pratchett has ever written). If you enjoy the works of either author, you will love this book. Pratchett and Gaiman's writing styles are surprisingly complementary of each other and both of them can write in each other's style with a bit of personal twist.    May your copy be as worn and well-loved as mine.
0553801473|1.0|The first 3 books were great, the 4 th and especially this last book is a dissapointment. Martin throws in new characters and new story lines at fast pace and these new characters and storylines are just not interesting. I have read all great fantasy writers but never had the feeling before that i want to skip chapters because nothing important happens in them anyway. Even the main characters are less interesting in this last book as the storyline is always the same: character x sets out to y, but oh something happens so x does not succeed in y so x is doing z and oh, someting happens ..... Etc. The inpredictability becomes predictable, almost no character in the book succeeds at a goal set out. All in all: too many characters, too many storylines that are not interesting, too little develpment of the main story. Editors have been sleeping...
B004GCKRWY|1.0|WOW   This movie starts in the dark with the exception of a lighter being flicked on   and off----there is no background of how this man was buried alive. If you want to   watch a hour and a half of a terrified man on a cell phone (which is unbelievable  that it works underground)calling anyone to help him and their stupid answers you  should watch this one. I feel like I wasted my time and money----and you will to.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|\\"Free\\" means you didn't pay for it and therefore lost nothing. \\"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth\\" and all that. If Amazon wisely cancels FAOTD as per your complaints, then you'll complain about that. When a supermarket gives out free samples of Soy Chips, do you berate the store for not having offered free Triple-Cream Brie? And if the Soy Chips happen to be a new product which you've not yet tasted, do you say they're disgusting for the sole reason that they are new?   If the FREE apps do not please you, then go buy one that does, but don't jeopardize the developer's credibility or Amazon's good graces by making selfish, irrelevant critiques.   Remember, there is a cost in 'acCOST', and you didn't pay one.
B0050N85IQ|5.0|when \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" was first being promoted, I was torn. I still mourn the loss of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" because that was such a great, great show. But I've seen enough bad vampire movies and shows (I am NOT a Twilight lover at all) and read enough bad vampire novels that I've gotten sick of all the low quality stuff out there (and I would throw Anne Rice's last several vampire novels into the \\"low quality\\" category, although I still think her first novel \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" was brilliant).     Also, many of these shows start out and then get canceled. So I was afraid to watch it and start to like it, only to have it whisked away from me like Moonlight was (with Alex O'Loughlin, now on the remade \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" show). (Not that Moonlight was a great show; gag, the first ep was TERRIBLE -- totally cliche writing, utterly predictable story. But it did get better as it went along, largely due to the actors playing the roles.)    So I watched \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" first episode (pilot) and thought, \\"Yawn, another broody vampire who hates being a vampire, and falling in love with a mortal. Seen it.\\"     But then I kept watching it and, damn it, the show reeled me in. I'm not even in the target demographic (I'll be 44 this fall), and I couldn't stop watching.     This is largely because of Ian Somerhalder's portrayal of Damon Salvatore, I admit. He's just fantastic in this role. (I never watched him on \\"Lost\\" though I may go back and watch it now that I know he's in it.)    He plays Damon initially (early in Season 1) as the brother who is the \\"bad boy\\" -- but later proves himself to be the brother who is most capable of doing what needs to be done, no matter how distasteful. More importantly, he's the one who SEES what needs to be done.     His wrestling with the human side of him, trying to push it away and keep it at arm's length, and his gradual, grudging willingness to let it surface -- along with the inherent conflict it presents to his largely vampire self -- is the most fascinating aspect to TVD, in my opinion. Ian Somerhalder started out playing Damon kind of over the top, in my opinion, but he has developed a bit more economy in how he uses his expressiveness (although I feel his frequent scowling and brow-scrunching is a bit overdone... nevertheless it's also pretty effin' hot, so I can tolerate it, though it gets campy at times).     Then, too, Nina Dobrev's portrayal of Katherine Pierce in the flashbacks makes her a young actress worth watching. I didn't initially find Elena very compelling, but she grew on me after the first episode. She also grew a spine, which helped. But most impressive has been Dobrev's ability to play both the good-hearted and somewhat naive Elena (you'd think, with all she's been through, she'd be more doomy/gloomy) and the calculating, manipulative Katherine. She really does a terrific job, including lampooning her own portrayal of Elena when Katherine impersonates Elena at the costume ball in the second season.     Because of my work schedule (hospital RN), I was going to miss the last few episodes of TVD, and I wanted to be guaranteed to get the episode \\"As I Lay Dying.\\" I'd had good luck with Amazon Unbox video before, so I chose to get it that way.     The quality of the video is very good. It's not quite DVD quality, but almost (but it's definitely NOT Blu-Ray quality).     Although this episode starts tying up loose ends, the main cliffhanger from the previous episode that is resolved in this one is Damon Salvatore's fatal werewolf bite.     I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but I will say this: the Elena/Damon chemistry grows, and you get hints of what COULD BE... \\"if only.\\" Poor Damon. Wanting Elena and loving her bring out his humanness, which is of course terribly hard for him.     A really good, necessary episode to watch. Actually I would say the last 5 episodes of Season 2 of TVD are necessary. But then, I ended up buying both Seasons on DVD... so I paid for \\"As I Lay Dying\\" twice, darn it! Couldn't help myself. It was pretty much worth it for the way it takes me away from my mundane life and problems.

B005CMSDLE|5.0|There is some great acting here. Saoirse Ronan couldn't be better. This is a great thriller. There is mystery and suspense from beginning to end. There are touching and funny and tender scenes. Saoirse is wonderful as a good kid coming of age. But someone is determined to kill her. To eliminate this evil she has been training all her life.<br />Initially I didn't rate the film very highly. The plot seemed a little psycho and outlandish and I couldn't quite get a handle on it. But then it all came into focus: the movie grabs because it is an allegory for abortion. Hannah was the one that somehow escaped being terminated and the job had to be finished. The movie presents her as some kind of dangerous experiment that was called off but in real life the kid's always treated as the threat. Very well done.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is the best Star Wars (all 6 of them) has ever looked.  Do yourself a favor -- ignore the 1-star \\"reviews\\" from people who clearly haven't even seen it, and pick it up -- you won't regret it!
030788743X|5.0|I loved this book and raced through it. Its description of a dystopian future and an engrossing virtual world and a search for its hidden easter eggs was engrossing.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Not one of Kings best attempts..title is great and it sounds like a good read..but it drops off right away with a a poor story line..and the ending is not satisfying... reads like he wrote in one dreary afternoon..if you like King as I do this is a loser don't bother with it..
B0001WTVUW|4.0|At first I considered leading off this review with a pun like THE DAY AFTER was a \\"blast\\", but in all seriousness, I think the film warrants little humor. A powerful and devastating made-for-TV movie via the 80s, THE DAY AFTER depicts global thermonuclear war like it had never been seen before (or since). I first watched the picture sitting in my junior-high history class when I was 12 years old, and while I didn't remember any specifics of the film, I do remember it terrified me. The movie may be nearly 30 years old, but it's still very intense and carries a powerful punch. While I do not believe that this event will ever become a reality, I do think the film is a very good tool to get people to thinking about the future and where they'll spend their eternity (Heaven or Hell). THE DAY AFTER is a powerful, sobering picture of global destruction - not recommended for children 12 and under.
1609611543|4.0|This book starts off rather heavy handed in its premise--that wheat is largely respnsible for our nation's epidemics of diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, among other maladies.  While I agree that wheat plays a large role, I'm not convinced it's as large as purported by the author.  The explanations provided by the author as to how wheat exerts its nefarious influences are sound and logical to a scientifically oriented person like myself, also an MD, and I much appreciated the physiological and biochemical details (though these were presented in a way that I feel would be accessible and interesting to the reader without a science background).      After the introduction, the author does give some more credence to other factors such as reduced physical activity, and the ready availability and heavy use of carbohydrates in the diet in the past century as playing a large role in the above problems and others, coming away a bit from the near \\"wheat is the only villian\\" assertion.  However, the premise still remains that wheat is the biggest baddie, and I'm just not so sure.  I do agree, as I've said, that it plays a much misunderstood and enormous role, but there are others players here.       Finally, I appreciated the organization of the chapters into various systems/disease processes affected by wheat.  Also, the inclusion, at the end of the book, of guidelines for eating without wheat, as well as recipes that highlight his other reccommedations such as incorporating more nuts, cheese, eggs, some meats and fruits, and vegetables into one's diet are helpful, if one wants to put his recommendations into practice but needs some concrete ideas to begin.  The recipes that feature bread like foods made with wheat alternatives, such as coconut or almond flours, instead of other possibly insulin raising wheat alternatives, are also a smart addition.  Most people would probably have a very difficult time not eating bread like foods and making these types of foods is not straightforward when you are used to the methods and results that baking with gluten entails.  All in all, a very interesting premise that could use closer examination in our own lives as well as further research by the scientific and medical communities.
1582701709|5.0|I found this book to have outstanding information.  The Bible tells us to have faith but what exactly does that look like?  The Secret explains it.  They give many ways to reach a place of total belief inside yourself.   I'm now practicing it everyday.  I finally get it.
B000008GHW|5.0|Always captivated by Jimi's music, the summer that he, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison all died just crushed the music world. Back then, there was no immediate info chain like the internet. No one knew what was happening until it happened. Released a few months after his passing,when the album \\"Cry Of Love\\" came out, It was like Jimi came back to life. It's one of his most insightful and musical albums and a MUST HAVE for any Hendrix fan.Just listen to \\"Easy Rider\\" and \\"Angel\\"- and then wait for the goosebumps to go away. A treat for the ears.   Geoff Jones
B005KR6OBM|5.0|What the...  in uk it costs only 32£ why here 180$?  ok it's a great series and all but wth?
B000SQARMW|2.0|This movie has a lot to recommend about it. It has a good cast, beautiful sets and imagery, a budget, and an unusual setting. I don't really know any Spanish actors outside of Javier Barden and Antonio Banderas neither of whom are in this, but all of the performances are quite good. Particularly good is Viggo Mortenson who can apparently speak Spanish fluently. Who knew? The budget is really on display here. There are some pretty impressive action scenes. I particularly love the little details like how the Spanish soldiers have to keep their fuses lit since they have to use them to fire their guns. The best part of the movie is undoubtedly the cinematography. The composition and layout of the shots imitate paintings from the period which makes for some beautiful still images.<br /><br />Despite that it's not really a film I can recommend. While it seems to have all the right parts they never really come together properly. For example despite the good performances the characters are utterly undeveloped and change completely without any reason or motivation. I understand that this film is several books combined together and it shows. You can tell exactly when one book ends and another begins. This also means that there's no overarching plot throughout the movie but only a series of smaller incidents. For example, near the beginning of the film Alatriste is hired to kill two men who turn out to be the prince of England and his friend. Once he discovers this they never mention it again. Trying to keep up with what's going on is a constant effort and even when paying attention it is impossible to know why it's happening. What they should have done is pick one of these stories (they cover at least half a dozen) and spend the entire movie on it. By forcing them all together with no links they ruin any dramatic potential inherent in them. Because of this you never really care for (or understand) any of the main characters and you never really get a feel for the important events happening around them. So why I'd really like to give it a higher rating I cannot because it isn't really one coherent movie so much as several smaller ones. The second star is for the cinematography alone.pening around them.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|After reading all the negativity on here i had to chime in about this box set. I have watched all 6 movies and I have to say the changes are not that big of deal and absolutely does not ruin the experience at all. The only thing that I thought was odd and out of place was the new Krayton call in Episode IV. Now picture quality Episode I, ok. Episode II, great. Episode III, outstanding. Episode IV, excellent. Episode V, great. Episode VI, great. Now soundwise, all across the board is nothing short of stunning. Special features were really neat, some stuff I definitely never seen before. Not even on Youtube. I really wouldn't be surprised if all the people on here saying they canceled their order and to boycott this set actually did buy it and just want to bitch about it. Because let's face it, most of them are diehard Star Wars nerds and they wouldn't care if George took a crap and put it into a tin box and put Star Wars bluray they would still buy it because it is Star Wars related. I really don't care if the original trilogy sees the light of day because to me it seemed old, outdated and doesn't fit.    So, in a nutshell I just want everyone not to be swayed by the reviews on here.  Watch it for yourself and then you can make your own decisions about it.  But I was personally blown away by it.excellent!
034552554X|4.0|The Language of Flowers is Vanessa Diffenbaugh's first novel. I admit that there are some plotting issues in it; and that is logical to expect because it is a first novel!  Too much happens in too short a time, and the reader may not accept every last thought or action of Victoria Jones, the lead character, a young woman who ages out of the foster care system at 18 and is forced to make her way in a world that has only given her love in one brief portion of her life.     The bottom line here is that Diffenbaugh is a competent writer who takes risks, most of which pan out. Most importantly, she writes about what she knows (she has a adopted a son out of the foster care system to go along with her three biological kids) and she writes very honestly and from the heart. It's not perfect, but it is quite good. In places (especially the portion in which Victoria struggles to care for her newborn daughter without coming to terms with her own need for love) very emotionally intense. It gets 4 stars from me. I would far prefer to read this kind of novel than a cookie cutter book that refuses to take risks.
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Great version and as many have mentioned in the past.  Best of all iterations so far.  If there is a sequel hope to see more of this fine quality.
1451629184|5.0|Excellent reading.  Jaycee is an amazing person and I am so impressed with her attitude and desire to move beyond the horrible things that were done to her and the 18 years of her life that truly were stolen.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|this game gets 5 stars all the way the gameplay is fun and challenging, also when moved to SD only 1mb left on phone storage
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The box of the Saga set is worth the price.  It's a very cool book with thick hard pages that have a slot for each of the 9 discs with beautiful artwork covering the book inside and out.  As far as those hardcore fanatics who criticize this BR release, their criticisms are only something Star War nerds will care about.  Don't let their nit- picking ruin it for the millions who don't care if Vader's light saber is more pink than red.  For me, the Extras discs are great since I haven't spent the better part of my life searching for and watching every bit of Star Wars video that's ever been posted on the Web.  It's all new for me.  On the Extras Disc #3, the Spoofs had me laughing hard.  Also, did the critics expect Lucas to completely re-do Star Wars just for the BR release?  Wasn't going to happen.  Heck, why not just request that Lucas re-shoot Star Wars from scratch?  After all, new film and digital cinematography would make for a better film, right?  Anyways, if you love Star Wars for the sheer fun that it was meant to be, buy the set.  My suggestion is to buy the Complete Saga just for the box.  Yes, the new Episodes 1, 2 and 3 aren't as good as the original films, but they are what they are, and you will regret not owning them all.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|It's a good game. Looking through the reviews, I actually get aggravated with how stupid some people can be. Rating an app 1 star cuz its 16 mb, and no other reason. Download the game, play the game, then review it.
0452289963|5.0|Will you use this book for good or evil? I suggest empower yourself with the information as it will help you body, mind, and spirit. I keep it next to my bed and conciously keep it in the fore front of my thoughts as stressful economic times, relationship issues, work day problems begin to creep up on me. This is the simplest form of understanding human behavior I have ever read. I have my masters in human behavior and I wish this information was integrated into my family life growing up. When things get rough...tune out the \\"fear jubilee\\" that is going on, open the book and just breathe in the words. Far cheaper than medical assistance for stress related illness!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Of all the movies I have seen on Blu-ray, these are the best looking. Each movie is on a 50GB disc, rather than the usual 25GB. A properly calibrated TV will show you stunning color and detail unparalleled by anything else out there. The 6.1 Audio is beautiful. These make the DVD releases seem like they were covered in fuzzy scotch tape.  The special features alone merit a purchase. After spending 5 hours on them, I have barely scratched the surface. It features amazing turnarounds of props with detailed pictures of various areas of each one. The documentaries on the 9th disc are all very interesting. Anyone who has a Blu-ray player and an HDTV needs these, and those without need to upgrade for this.  Quit fussing over minor changes that are far less impactful than the low quality of your DVDs and VHSs. I had very high expectations for their quality, and they easily exceeded those.  For 90 bucks, this is a steal and easily worth the money at full price as well.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|fun game if you like angry birds you should try this game. I can't wait to get into the higher boards.
B005LY4B0A|2.0|Looks to be a good game, along the lines of Cut the Rope, but unfortunately its only a tiny screen on my Xoom. Really, in this day and age for a new app, no. tablet screen optimization???n
B005BW0TO4|5.0|This album is fantastic.  An amazing work from 3 Doors Down, they kept their style without getting stale, while at the same time experimenting slightly (see the opening track for an example of this).  I highly recommend it as it runs the gamut of emotion, of which 3DD is known for.  I listened to it straight through about 3 and a half times on a road trip and never tired of it.  If you consider yourself a 3DD fan in any sense of the term, you owe it to yourself to get this album.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Unlike nearly all of the 1-star ratings, I'm actually posting this (1) after the product was actually released, (2) after actually purchasing the product and (3) after WATCHING it.    Haters'll hate, it's too bad Amazon has done such a terrible job at eliminating reviews that were submitted prior to anyone possibly having or seeing the release in question.    I'd love to get the original versions too, I'm sure it'll happen someday.    BUT - if you love Star Wars you'll be thrilled with these nine discs.  They look WAY BETTER than anything ever released before.  I'm watching them at 65\\" and they're BEAUTIFUL.    And this is a TON of Star Wars content - so not only is it by far the best quality ever available, it's a HUGE quantity.    Don't let the fanboy haters get you down - if you love Star Wars you'll be in heaven with this release.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|I have been disappointed by so many lesbian movies. This one was a nice surprise. The acting was good and it almost seemed like a mainstream well written love story. Highly recomended.
B001QWBM62|2.0|#1. The playback quality is awful.  #2. The battery door is junk! It doesnot fit tightly and keeps popping off.  #3. Am not happy the way menu is laid out.  In my opinion this thing should not cost more than $129.00. I regret not buying a Roland or perhaps a Krog.  In any event it just is not worth the money charged.
B005HEXQN2|5.0|So, some Hollywood writers really must of sat down and hammered some coffee for this one -- best finale ever. It helps to end a show when your audience still cares about the characters.     Still, I am deeply saddened that there is no Star Treck. First few seasons of BSG almost nursed me back to life but nothing comes close on TV today. 362 reality shows. 10 CSIs. Can't we have one Star Trek. Please! Ill buy somthing in every commercial they show for the whole season, I promise.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Fun game glad I downloaded it.  You won't be disappointed if you get this game.  I've had hours of fun and not even close to finishing it.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|... Anyone who thinks that Angry Birds is 'a game of luck' does not know how to play Angry Birds.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I  never bother to write reviews, but just had to say that this is a great little game. I played the free version for a while this summer even though it runs poorly on my OG Droid, and was pleased to see this as the FAOTD. I expect to enjoy it more come November when the Samsung Prime (hopefully) arrives and I have a better phone to run it.   Thanks, Amazon.
B004AKCME8|4.0|This is a breath taking film.  I saw the preview for it in the theatre in 3D, but (much to my disappointment) did not get to see it in 3D in the theatre.  I was not certain if watching it on my television would be a let down or not because of this.  I was very impressed with the visual presentation, and would highly recommend this movie if you're looking for something that \\"stands out\\" from other animations like Shrek, etc.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|This CD turned me into a jazz lover. I heard the song \\"pretty\\" on NPR. All songs are good! You won't regret buying this.
0440237688|5.0|I read a lot of young adult books growing up, and I couldn't tell you the names to more than half of them any longer, but The Giver is one of those books that I distinctly and vividly remember to this day.  It was one of the first exposures I had to a dystopian society, and made a lasting impression on me.  Some of the situations are disturbing - I remember getting nauseous when learning about the main character's father's real job within the society.  But this was a wonderful book that shocked me and made me think critically, whereas most of the other books in the genre were merely mind fluff, or TV in writing.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Although, I own a backup generic that works as well, you need one of these, even on a heave tripod. They are much more reliable than the wireless remote, which, on most cameras only works with a front sensor.  This is one of those simple tools that will set your work apart in terms of quality!
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Hands down, amazing film.  Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker should go down in history and become a case study in character development for upcoming actors.
0767821629|5.0|This is a great film which is often overlooked, which is very sad.<br /><br />Set in the late 90s, this film has a very different take on the \\"our world isn't real\\" plot line.  The characters have depth, are well developed, and intriguing.  The period scenes are shot with a different lighting which makes for a unique visceral perspective.<br /><br />If you like the concept of the Matrix, and if you like well-developed characters, this is a fantastic movie you should consider.  Plus, it has a great ending before surprise twists became the fad and norm.<br /><br />Ever since I saw it originally in the theatre, this has been one of my favorites.  I'll throw it in on a random week night, and I'm always pleased with the decision.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I want to like this set I really, really do. I looked forward to it and had it on pre-order for months. I heard about the questionable changes but still kept my order. There is a lot of great extra content, but ultimately it is about the films. They all look very good, but not quite as amazing as they should have for being Star Wars. Part of the fault lies in the 7 year old transfers that were used for the classic films. HD mastering has come a long ways in that time, and new 4k or 8k scans should have been created. This is standard practice and I'm at a loss for why it was not done. Still, they look better than they ever have on home video. The sound on all six films is excellent across the board.<br /><br />But the real letdown here are the additional changes to the films. Calling these films Star Wars is false advertising. They should be called Star Wars 2011, or Star Wars v. 4.0. These are not the films people grew up with. They aren't even the versions from the DVD. As many reviewers have noted, there are yet more ridiculous changes. And yet many of the mistakes from past releases are still not fixed.<br /><br />By far the worst is Vader yelling \\"noooooo\\" at the end of Return of the Jedi. I watched the whole film and tried to see this in context. But it just flat out doesn't work on any level. It sounds comical and out of place. It truly takes you out of a great dramatic scene and ruins it. It's just heartbreaking and I can't begin to fathom why it was done or who could possibly have thought it was a good idea.<br /><br />I won't go on about how Lucas is destroying his legacy and alienating the fans who made him what he is. Many other have done that. But I do want to say that the people upset about this are not haters. On the contrary, we are the people that love the films the most and it is painful to see them altered and destroyed by endless, needless tinkering. These are not the films that won awards and the hearts of billions of people around the world.<br/><br />The most frustrating thing is that all of this would be a moot point if the original versions were included on the blu rays. All would be forgiven and everyone would be happy. I can only hope that some day Lucas comes to his senses. He has always been a vocal supporter of film preservation. I don't understand why he refuses to preserve his own films.<br /><br />Until then I can't give these discs more than 2 stars as much as I wanted to like them.

0307946711|3.0|Well i just read the book because I didn't feel like driving an hour to go see the movie, so anyway i was really into the book and then BAM she got hit, and i was like what the ... So then i still had hope like it was going to be like the movie Sliding Doors, which basically means i thought they where going to take it back to the beginning when they first met and instead of going through 20  years they where going to  build on their relationship from the beginning, you know get married to each other , and have kids. Or even if she had to die like that, they could have at least have had a child, for him to still have a piece of her with him every day. But needless to say after reading this book, i will never every read the book again, and i will not go and see the movie    I'm just glad that i borrowed this book and not purchase it.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I purchased this calculator for the CFA examinations. The reason I went with the HP was because I liked the layout of the keys better than the TI. ALso, the fact that it is the most widely used financial calculator helped me make up my mind. So far I have been using it for more than a week and I am very happy. It has most of the functions required by the CFA exams and it is not very difficult to use once you read the manual . The build quality is not too bad. Btw - I tried out the calculation mentioned by a reviewer for the TI BAII Plus. It took just a sec on the HP and NOT 30 sec as mentioned in the review.  A note though - This calculator from Amazon doesn't include a printed manual ( user's guide).  I ordered a used one from Amazon. I strongly recommend ordering a printed copy since it is difficult to learn using the PDF. It is also worth mentioning that the manual ( also called user's guide ) is  very well written. I would also recommend downloading the SOlutions handbook from the HP site.
B0024FAG6M|4.0|interesting to see after last viewing in 1969. wonderful music. and great to see jack in one of his first appearances! did not remember phil spector doing cameo as the pusher! and it this movie where i first heard THE BAND - amazing music enhanced by the sun setting over the desert scenery.
B003L77GGK|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Supernatural, and although the sixth season had a rocky start, I think it ended with a bang like every other season. Love the brothers more than ever and can't wait til the 7th season begins next week :)    The only problem I have is with the DVDs themselves. The scene selections are all screwed up. When you select one scene to watch for an episode, it brings you to a previous scene instead. My brother's Supernatural Season 6 DVDs have the same issue so I don't think it's an isolated problem. There are worse problems to have with the DVDs and all the shows run fine as far as I can tell. The scene selection issues are just annoying when you are just looking to watch your favorite parts of an episode.    Despite the issues, I still very much enjoy this season set, especially with the traditional gag reel and behind the scenes look at Jensen Ackles directorial debut.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great way to spend down time. Runs great on my atrix. well worth themoney. Plays just like the pc version
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Battle Los Angeles is worth the money, I saw it in theatre and then bought the dvd.  This is a pretty good sci-fi movie with good special effects and good actors, the aliens aren't anything new but the story moves and I wasn't disappointed.  If you like sci-fi Battle Los Angeles and Skyline are well worth the money.  P.S. THE MARINES GET HIT HARD BUT KICK BUTT AND NEVER BACK DOWN IN THIS MOVIE, \\"Retreat, HELL!!!!!

0553807919|4.0|What fascinated me most about this book was the new research on the brain function, my biggest complaint is the times when it dives into the parent as pseydo-psychologist.  Why four stars?  I did really love it more than the few occasions it went off into tangents.<br /><br />Daniel J. Siegel, MD and Tina Payne Bryson, Ph.D, write in one voice (you can't tell who writes the majority of the book and they seem to share the same perspectives), giving examples in 3rd person - saying either Dan's experience or Tina's experience as well as other parents' experiences.  It's easy to digest this fairly short book and there are limited doses of humor from time to time.  The tone in the beginning chapters of the book is different than the second half of the book - it really switches gears when they get into memory and felt less scientific for a brief stint and more psychological mixed with opinions and experience perspective.  What held my attention is that they're both authorities on the subject and have a passion about parenting, neurotypical development, and whole brain integration.<br /><br />The begining focuses primarily on the right brain, left brain and using this knowledge while parenting.  It really makes you step back and understand your child on a scientific level and then be able to apply this information instead of making irrational parenting choices.  The authors encourage getting both sides of the brain to work together and tell you how to do this through examples and then illustrations (didn't care for the artwork at all).  They explain how the brain is always being re-wired and that as parents it's our responsibility to guide that re-wiring, which is both positive but also a bit intimidating.  Do I really have that much power over my child?  Do I want that much power over my child?  But with this information, I will do what I can.  They then switch to lower brain and higher brain - but this is slightly more complex and a bit harder to detect.  What I gathered was that the left rain and lower brain are more alike, and the right brain and higher brain are similar.  The authors do explain why you want to try and get all these brain parts working together - sort of like how your organs work together; heart, lungs, brain, to make a healthy human.<br /><br />It's helpful that the authors list parenting mistakes and then provide parenting solutions in their place.  I, myself, am guilty of a few parenting nos without even realizing it.  For example, dismiss and deny - I didn't even know I was doing that to my child, so I'm thankful to this book for learning better ways of dealing with my child's emotions and situations.  I thought I was being a good mom, but this book has given me tools to be better.<br /><br />Another plus was father involvment in this book.  Its rare in parenting books for such active fathers to be depicted and it was refreshing.  Now, if only I could get my husband to be this thoughtful and active in my son's life.<br /><br />The authors encourage a lot of talking.  And story re-hashing.  At first I found this annoying - hey, I'm being honest, but then when it was explained scientifically as to why including whole brain integration and memory as well as into we concepts, I was hooked.<br /><br />My favorite chapter was on teaching your kids to have better relationships and empathy.  The new research on \\"emotional contagion\\" was riviting for me as I'm interested in this topic.  Having a child with an autism diagnosis, friendships and empathy have been a huge issue in our house.  This book gave many tools and ideas to try with my son and many scientific facts and research on the topic.  I could have read an entire book on this information alone.  Something I have stuggled with is teaching my son to be more \\"we\\" without losing the \\"me\\" and I was happy that the authors addressed this.<br /><br />Another thing that really stuck with me was that the authors explain that the relationship you provide for your children will affect generations.  This is the way I think as well, so again, I gravitate to this type of book and this type of author(s).  If you don't think this way, you're probably not going to get much from this book or you'll have resistance to their theories.<br /><br />There is a chart towards the back that lists real age with strategies and brain development.  There is also a refrigerator cheat sheet - that needs to be cut down considerably.  No one has time to read a book in the middle of a parenting crises or situation.<br /><br />Dr. Siegel's wheel of awareness can be a helpful tool and is something that would work with my child; however not in the middle of a crises, but during a weekend or time where we could really go over a particular situation that my child was struggling with.  Again, my son is on the spectrum, so we do a lot of work on his feelings and how to control his emtotions, so this is right up my alley.<br /><br />Like any parenting book - it doesn't have all the answers, but it does provide ideas and tips on what to do in certain situations to encourge your child's brain to have a healthy mental state as well as tools to be able to make good decisions as they get older.

If you don't think this way, you're probably not going to get much from this book or you'll have resistance to their theories.      There is a chart towards the back that lists real age with strategies and brain development.  There is also a refrigerator cheat sheet - that needs to be cut down considerably.  No one has time to read a book in the middle of a parenting crises or situation.      Dr. Siegel's wheel of awareness can be a helpful tool and is something that would work with my child; however not in the middle of a crises, but during a weekend or time where we could really go over a particular situation that my child was struggling with.  Again, my son is on the spectrum, so we do a lot of work on his feelings and how to control his emtotions, so this is right up my alley.      Like any parenting book - it doesn't have all the answers, but it does provide ideas and tips on what to do in certain situations to encourge your child's brain to have a healthy mental state as well as tools to be able to make good decisions as they get older.  It's complimentary to Dr. Sears books and other great parenting books on my shelves.  I will look to this one again in the future.         Positives:  Encouraging connecting and re-directing (big fan of this approach!)  Brain function - our childrens and ours and how to integrate  Lots of useful parenting tips, made me more aware of my behaviors and actions as well  Mindsight - similar to cognitive therapy, changing what you focus on    Negatives:  Abusive parenting - I wish the author would have recommened couseling rather than only learning to cool down.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|[HTC Evo 3D] Begins very easy so that you can figure out the controls. And then it becomes increasingly more difficult. A game where you want to keep retrying each failed level because you just know that you can get it.
0393338959|5.0|All you need to know about this book - and its author - is there is no mention of the role FANNIE MAE and FREDDIE MAC played in the mortgage disaster.  But certainly read it!  You have to understand the religious fervor that stands behind the effort to expand the role of government into our lives, and this book will give you a good idea how Stiglitz' mind works.      Don't forget, he was awarded a Nobel prize.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|As many other reviewers have stated, this product does not work as advertized. I tried it today and could not get it to work even after calibration. I recommend prospective buyers to keep their packaging in good ahspe in case it does not work so they can return it.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I downloaded this game at 0300 when it became free and began playing it immediately.  It's currently 0515 and it seems like I just started playing. This game seems easy at first but as it progresses it becomes more challenging just to beat the level, let alone get 3 stars.  The graphics are very well done and are comparable to Angry Birds in their style. I also have not had any issues dealing with force closing, freezing and glitching (Samsung Epic 4g), so kudos to the programmers.  This is a game, I believe, that will give Angry Birds a run for its money.  Warning: If you do not like playing games that require a decent amount of thought and strategy (think chess), then this game might not be for you.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|This is a fun and challenging game that works great on my EVO 4G. Unfortunately, it isn't really compatible with my Iconia A500. It works but doesn't fill the whole screen. If the developer wants 5 stars, we need a Honecomb version or at least stretch to fill the screen.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I used to love Star Wars, the original trilogy was awesome. WAS being operative word here. Lucas has changed them so much, that they're not even the same movies anymore. I wouldn't mind all these changes if they made the movies better, but that's not the case at all. It's like every change is designed to make the original trilogy just as bad as the prequels, so that it will seem more like they are part of a single story. A very bad, poorly written, single story. Well, congratulations, Lucas, you've managed to take something awesome (the original trilogy), and make it into a long single story that I have zero interest in. All of the changes you've made to these movies are the single reason I still own a VHS Player, So I can watch the original three movies as they once were, perfect.    Remember the scene in Star Wars, (back when it was just called 'Star Wars', before they added the 'new hope' to the title), remember when Obi Wan talks about how Vader was a great jedi once, and a good freind, before he turned to the darkside, 'more machine, than man, now'? That's what Star Wars: The original trilogy is like, once was a great film, beloved, and respected, now a mere shadow of itself, more a smorgasbord of digital animations and add-ons now, than the film I once loved.....As the new Vader would say, 'NOOOOOOOO......!'
1594481938|4.0|Nick Hornby doesn't have the answers to life's great questions but he isn't afraid to tackle them and that's a pretty cool thing in itself.     In this one, we have four distinct points of view from four very different people with nothing whatsoever in common other than the fact that they all happened to go to the same spot, at the same time, to try to kill themselves.  This gives them a bond that goes beyond the usual criteria for a band of friends. As they begin making a sort of blind leading the blind stab at helping each other out of despair, they learn a bit about a few things and, most importantly, well, time passes.    I always learn a bit from Nick Hornby's books and time passes in a most enjoyable way.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|This was better than i expected, very impressed.<br />Would have been better if wolverine was in it, but still worth watching.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Actually I did enjoyed the movie, the story of Loki was my favorite part. I like the characters and the actor for THOR did a good job, it was very decent. Only comment, I see no chemistry between Chris and Natalie Portman. I just didn't like her in that role, there was nothing on her that was that appealing for Thor to remember her, even her cry when he was supposedly dead was just so awfully act.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|One of the better shows on tv.  A must for any one into urban legends and creatures of the night.

0307477479|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a while. If you're into literary fiction, it's a must. It is a magnificent piece of work, an experience that no lover of good stories should miss.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|The picture Quality of the movies was pretty good. I was unimpressed with the audio quality. Most of the characters whispered throughout the movie and the audio was not enhanced for the blu ray collection.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|oh boy, another custom app made for Amazon free app of day. i'm sure all the rave reviews will soon appear for this app, released sept 13.
B000OJFV3S|2.0|Historical drama for viewers who need sex and violence to make it more interesting and watchable.  Myself, I don't need that edge.  Yes, the times had both, in abundance, but it doesn't need to be shown on a tv show in abundance.  But then I remembered this was \\"Showtime\\" not \\"Masterpiece Theater\\"  I'll take Masterpiece every time.  Glad I got the first episode free, because I certainly won't pay to watch this.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|works great.  I found out why it kept needing to get re-initiated after a restart.  Don't try and move the app to SD card.  Thanks<br /><br />Update 4/11/2012<br /><br />I find myself coming back to this keyboard app after trying out others.  Like most things in life, it's all about personal preference so go try them out to see how you like them.  There is SwiftKey 3 Beta out now. I've been using it for a few days and it's awesome.  Hope we can upgrade for free through Amazon.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Pretty decent game and I think it's pretty original, is I've never played anything like it. Even without directions on how to get rated three stars on a level, I figured it out pretty quick on level four.  Think more on trapping the spider in a corner rather than cutting all the webs for each insect, they'll all be set free once the spider's route is cut off to it. I know I'm not the only one to discover this, but trying to help the few reviewers who couldn't figure out how to get a three star rating.
B0058A119G|5.0|Someday, there will be a last Streisand recording. She will repair to her home on the ocean and while away her hours doing other things. Those of us who have known her mostly through her recordings will stop for a moment or two or three and reconsider what she meant to us. We do this everytime she releases something new. We are a family in that way, taking our child and mother to task for what we disapprove of, and for what we find thrilling. Do you suppose she considered retiring when her instrument first showed signs of wear? Do you suppose she has found the artistry still left in the crows-feet that now surround her voice? Once again, she has shown us what is beautiful instead. That face, that face . . . how we have always adored it. I am among those fans who have not always liked her output (I found her last collection of songs masterful but dreary). Here, again, we have the tingle-inducing instrument that Glenn Gould wrote about. The instrument is most apparent in the final cut \\"What Matters Most\\" where her cello-like voice plays against and with the piano and strings. Thanks again Ms. Streisand for teaching us what beauty is, and where the lyrics reside (in the heart).
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Instead of listening to just about EVERYONE Lucas has decided to ruin these movies even more.  If you buy this then you are telling him it's okay for him to do this.  Just find some sap that actually bought this and borrow the extras.  Join the movement!  Wait for the original unaltered movies!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I downloaded this app, but I had to uninstall it because it takes up too much memory even after moving it to the SD card. I have an LG Optimus V and the internal memory is very limited.    UPDATE: I decided to reinstall it and this time I was able to move the entire app to the SD card. It's actually a pretty fun game. I changed the rating from 1 star out of 5 to 4 stars out of 5.
B000PMG16U|1.0|I can't believe that people are actually buying this.  These movies were a freaking travesty.  Even more so on blu ray.  Don't support Lucas!
0971855110|5.0|This is such a good book.  Online website is outstanding, but sometimes a book in hand is what is needed to get us out of CHAOS.  I have loaned copies of this before and they are so loved they do not get returned to me.  Dang, but I was so happy to get this one online at Amazon.com, and thank you very much.  It arrived with the speed of light and keeps me FLYING.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Please DO NOT buy this.  George Lucas continues to ruin these movies and destroy what started out as a masterpiece.  If you buy this you will only be supporting his madness.  If you already have them on DVD then don't waste your money.
0783222955|3.0|While attending a a film class at a San Diego community college back in the 80's, the instructor told is how badly Hitchcock's classic horror film, PSYCHO, was structured. His chief complaint is how the film spends twenty to twenty-five minutes on a character which we never see again and how everything is wrapped up so neatly by another character, the psychologist, who appears only in the last two or three minutes! Well. if the screenplay of PSYCHO has a bad structure--TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD takes the cake! I haven't read the prize-winning Harper Lee semiautobiographical novel, but if my nephew had written a similarly-structured script for his Walter screenwriting class at UCLA, it would have been thrown out!     First of all, the film is divided in two parts. Sorry, but this is a film--not a two act play. The first half concentrates on Scout and really builds up her character. The second half is sedentary court-room drama. So, Mr. Foote, Ms Lee, WHO'S STORY IS IT???     Boo Radley's father is a peripheral character and could have easily been omitted. If I recall, and I just watched the film the other day after over twenty-five years, he doesn't even have a line of dialogue!     Worse still, and equal to the first point I mention above, is the visual introduction of the Boo charcter after two hours of light on a screen! It's almost like a thankless role, and yet he is the symbolic \\"mockingbird\\" of the tale. He's not just Simon Oakland wrapping things up and making all ends meet as he does in the final minutes of PSYCHO.     Don't get me wrong, it is a most well intentioned film and well-timed as far as the socio-political events unfolding in the country at the time, but in addition to Foote's poor structure, Robert Mulligan was just the wrong director for this heavy theme.    I saw it on VHS and I can't remember if it was the late producer Alan Pakula or not, who says in a short interview segment following the film, that no film had ever been made at that time whichwas from a child's POV. Err, excuse me, Mr. Pakula, ever heard of Rene' Clement's JEUX INTERDITS (Forbidden Games, 1952)? Also, the original trailer is shown at the beginning before the movie. One of the the film critic quotes says to \\"take the whole family.\\" LOL A film that deals partially with a man unjustly accused of rape!!!??? LOL
B000PMLFRA|5.0|The explosion of the Death Star was spectacular, and In the empire strikes back when in the asteroid belt each asteroid would be a differnt color when hit by the ships lasers.  The picture Is truely flawless.  I also see noe how they most likely put Into the plot of Luke getting struck down by an white Ice creature. Because he was still healing from plastic sugery from a car accident.  The acting cheesy and I believe supposed to be that way by lucas.  But this was a truely fresh view.   I only bought this set on Blu Ray as I have episode 1, 2 and 3 already.  I highly reccoment this for fans and maybe a Christmas gift. All 3 movies being $39.99.  Besides Han shooting first In movie 4.  I see no real changes for the worse. Only better.  This In Blu Ray does get 5 stars easy. One of the best Blu Ray copies I've seen.  I never realized how big into the story the 2 droids were.   Lots to see for the first time. I highly reccomend if at all a fan.
0792107683|3.0|Fast delivery but when I played it, got stuck in the player and broke the tape when I had to pull it out of the player.
B003L77GRY|5.0|It seems each season so far although all seasons run on a theme. This season was as good as It get's still.  The new character \\"Lumin\\" breathes new blood and new life into the story.  And yet Dexter's own narrative shows you the thoughts of someone like that. Wow. One the more creative characters to come to TV In a long time.  Thank You Michael Anthony Hall
B003L20IJM|4.0|Great family film.  The story has great characterizations in the children and can provide your children with a lesson, while still being enjoyable for the adults.
B004EPZ070|1.0|The book was much better.  The emotion and depth of the characters didn't translate well on the big screen.  The movie was corny the book was not.
B001AQO3XS|3.0|I love this movie, one of my all time favorites, but the blu-ray transfer is horrid!<br />why is it I can watch  2001 on blu-ray and it looks fabulous, yet this looks like a bad VHS tape?<br />it's some scenes look ok, while others are extremely grainy.<br />they should have done a better job<br /><br />if you love this movie, you're probably going to buy it anyway.. just don't expect great video quality.
B004DK49DW|5.0|Great band. Being an old guy, I really appreciate songs when I can understand the lyrics. Mr. Ness, what a talented guy.  Keep them coming.
B0058A119G|5.0|From \\"Windmills of My Mind\\" to \\"That Face\\", every song is a delight and a discovery. Streisand is in top voice on the album and interprets each note with style! I discover something fresh and new each time I listen to \\"What Matters Most\\". What matters is you will love listening to every note! It doesn't hurt, either, that the Bergmans have written some of the most moving, memorable movie music of our time!
0307474275|1.0|I know this is an extremely popular book, but I really, really did not like it. This is the sort of book that you're supposed to sit down and be able to finish in a day -- I get that. However, I can't stand it when a novel with adult content is written at a second-grade level. To top it off, it's written in an extremely condescending manner and is full of sexism and antiforeignism. I'm actually surprised it sold at all internationally, especially in France. I wonder if they took out those comments in translation. (Does anybody know?)<br /><br />The symbolic and religious stuff would have been interesting if they were presented differently. A lot of the novel is Langdon going on and on about some sort of detail they found with someone on the sidelines going, \\"Interesting. Tell me more.\\" Had it been worked in better, or had it just been described in narration instead of Langdon talking page after page, it probably would have been more interesting to read.<br /><br />This just wasn't the book for me. A lot of people enjoyed it and consider it one of their favorite books, but I just couldn't get past the writing and the stereotypical comments against anything not American.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is great.  Not sure why but I like it alot more than regular Angry Birds.  The regular content updates is nice too.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Received the entire saga on the release day (Sept 16 2011) and I'm very impressed. I was questioning my purchase after reading all the reviews by avid fans who are disappointed, but decided to stick with it. My son and I have recently watching episodes IV, V, VI and now we were ready for episode I so it was either:  a) rent it  b) buy it on dvd  c) buy on the first three episodes on blu-ray  d) buy the entire saga on blu-ray    I'm very happy I bought the whole saga on blu-ray. Since I had just watched Return of the Jedi on DVD recently that was the first disc I popped in for comparison. I was really impressed with the quality of the picture and vibrancy / depth of the colors and sound. Any concerns about \\"pink\\" light sabers were washed away by the superior picture provided by blu-ray. Yes, the color transfer could be questioned for some scenes, but if you think about the process of converting film to HD capture, there are always trade-offs and you start with a baseline to give the best overall results and depth - do you then go back to every scene and set a new baseline? probably not... it looks plenty good enough!    The thing I was most \\"concerned\\" about was the addition of Vader saying \\"No..\\". I really thought this would bother me a lot, but upon watching I thought it was natural enough in the context of the film. Should Lucas have made this change? Well, he's been tweaking these movies now for several iterations... and I think it really was up to him as to how to package the entire saga. Might it be nice to eventually see the original features undisturbed? sure... but I can also appreciate the perfectionist approach that produced this end to end packaged saga which fits all 6 episodes together nicely.     I'm happy with my purchase and I consider it a great deal for the price. If I could pick only one version to own on blu-ray (e.g. undoctored original vs. latest attempt at perfection) it would be a hard decision, but I'm happy with the \\"finely tuned\\" version Lucas has provided and I probably won't be giving away my old DVD's so I'll have something a bit closer to the original. Thinking of it this way it means your old DVD's are not irrelevant, and may still be worth something to you...    Great to see Star Wars in HD!

1402238843|4.0|Venetia Lanyon has grown up in isolation on her family's  remote estate.  She doesn't feel as though she has missed out on much, after all, she has had the run of the property,  has visited with her friends in the local area and been allowed to ride her hearts content.  At twenty five she has accepted that it is most likely that she will not marry, but that she will set up a household with her younger brother Audrey, a scholar who is crippled in his hip.  For the past few years she has been running the estate for her elder brother Conway while he has been in France as a soldier.<br /><br />All would have proceeded as planned had not Audrey fallen from his horse and been rescued by Lord Dameral, an absentee  neighbour he has never met.  Venetia quickly becomes intrigued by this mysterious man.  She has heard of him, that he is a rake and a womanizer of the worst kind.  Definitely not the type of man that a respectable lady would associate with.<br /><br />Venetia is put in a difficult position.  Aubrey's injury requires him to remain at Lord Dameral's for his convalescence.  She insists on caring for him, but risks her reputation each time she enters his house without a suitable chaperon.<br /><br />This is the first  book by Georgette Heyer that I have read.  I loved the amount of detail, both of the physical setting, but also of the relationships of the various characters.  Reading this novel gave me a feeling of peace and relaxation.  Once I was inside it's pages I felt immersed in Venetia's life, that I had all the time in the world to sit and enjoy every cup of tea she drank, every walk she took and even each of her visitors.<br /><br />Even though I have read books by other authors set in this time period, I was still surprised at how controlling Venetia's neighbours were with regard to her life.  They assumed they knew better than her how she should conduct her life, whom she should marry and whom she must not associate with.  No one ever explained to her why. It was interesting to follow along with Venetia as she worked out what she would do with her life.  It seems to me, that the choices Venetia made were a direct result of her isolated upbringing.  She didn't give London society a chance as she had not been brought up there nor had she ever been led to believe that she would be properly introduced to that same society.  All she knew was the small area where she had been raised and those few people she had been allowed to interact with.  It appeared natural to me that she would fall in love with the first new man to enter her life.<br /><br />The peaceful feeling I experienced while reading this book has stayed with me in the weeks since I finished it.  I hope that I will feel the same when I read  further books by Ms. Heyer.long with Venetia as she worked out what she would do with her life.

B004EPYZP8|4.0|Great movie to snuggle up on the sofa and enjoy a suspenseful well written movie. The actors do a great job in keeping you on the edge of your seat. Enjoy
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is the last straw.  Lucas has found another way of just trying to cash in, all the while destroying our childhood memories.  If he had the decency of including and restoring the original film without any alteration, it would be worth a buy.  As it stands, he only wants your money.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Waiting for this with DVD and digital copy included. When that happens it will be added to my wishlist. Mos def.
B0055IU3G8|5.0|Vinyl version was fantastic sounding.    The songwriting of course excellent. Purchase in the format you like but the vinyl was well done and I highly recommend it. Can't go wrong with Hiatt.

B001C1066E|5.0|This wallet is awesome. The one I got did not have the googly eyes and had too much stuffing. Both issues were easily fixable: you can get rid of some stuffing by cutting the stitches at the very tip of the frog's tongue; and it's very easy to sew everything back again (it took me about 5 minutes) :) Also, with a pair of googly eyes and some special glue you can have the perfect Gama wallet. Easy as that! Totally worth the money, mainly if you are into Naruto stuff. Enjoy your Gama.
B004ZZITEU|3.0|There is a lot of dislike for this cd.  I listened to pieces of it, and could agree to an extent, but had to hear it fully in order to form a decent opinion.  I downloaded it, and listened to it for a few days.  Then I bought it!  This is Morbid Angel..! Little different than their older material, and an easy progression from the excellent \\"Heretics\\" and \\"Gateways to Annihilation\\".  Trey's guitar work is amazing as always, and though I REALLY miss Pete Sandoval, Tim Yeung does an excellent job replacing him.  In fact, the production is TOP NOTCH!  The drumming and bass sound like they're coming out of my speakers in 3D.    There are many complaints about Dave Vincent.  I can't help but think that they are from newcomers who've not really heard the old stuff.  Dave Vincent sounds like he sounded in \\"Domination\\".  Like \\"Domination\\", the vocal delivery is powerful, but the lyrics are cheesy.  No more than at any other time he was in the band.  The \\"hip hop style boasting\\" one reviewer commented on was ignorant of all the other first-person boasting he's done in older songs.    Still, a few songs are out of place here:    Radikult - though similar to some older material, sounds like a terrible cross between \\"Beautiful People\\" by Marilyn Manson and Danzig.  Destructos Vs The Earth - is a good song; but not a good Morbid Angel song.  It sounds a bit like Christian Death or Moonspell.  10 More Dead and I Am Morbid- were good songs, but had Gene Simmons vocal deliveries.  It didn't work for me.  All in all, I prefer Steve Tucker to Dave Vincent; but I still prefer Morbid Angel!  I'd like to add, that if you want a more tradition (stock) Morbid Angel sound, check out the new Vader \\"Welcome to the Morbid Reich\\".  It is AWESOME!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I have been playing this for awhile and really enjoy it. Definitely a thinking game. Great graphics and fun sounds. I was just hoping that this would turn up on Amazon the other day- it's nice to see it as app of the day but so worth the 99&cent;price
0375758992|1.0|I trudge through this book to learn a little history but I despised the book and gave it's companion away. I did not find the drinking  and drunkenness at all appealing. Ugh!
B0001FR3IG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, and regardless what you read from other reviewers, it was a chilling experience. I would have cast Penelope Cruz in Halle Berry's role, and there were cliches as there are in most movies of this genre, but it didn't bother me. From the perspective of the script, there was uneven treatment of Halle's relationship with Downey, which did kind of bother me. And from the perspective of continuity, if you lose the fender of a car in one scene, and it is somehow replaced in the next, you have a problem. Nonetheless, it's still worth watching, a few flaws notwithstanding.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I've been looking for a book like this... the kind of book that sucks you in, that transports you to another world, a book you don't want to put down and wish it never ended.  A book you can't help but tell your friends about.  This book was all those things.

0307477479|5.0|This is a masterful and relevant book that, in my opinion, is completely deserving of the Pulitzer Prize. Egan bravely shows us what we've become as a society. The book's structure of interlinking chapters and her depiction of time as the \\"Goon Squad\\" is brilliant.  Egan's characters are complex and recognizable.  This is an important book that rewards and respects the intelligent reader.
0240815807|5.0|I'm neither a pro nor a beginner and I think `Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio' works regardless of your level.  Senior doesn't teach software details; you should have that down otherwise you'll be continually distracted from what he does teach - the process of integrating ear, mind, and gear to craft professional-sounding mixes.     The author speaks in a non-condescending and encouraging tone to those of us trying to create great-sounding recordings in not-so-great spaces: the odd-shaped bedroom or closet, a corner of a dorm or living room, etc.     The overriding `secret' I took away is that, without a reliable and consistent way to monitor your mixes and understand what you're hearing, all the fancy gear, software, and microphone tricks in the world won't get you to that next level - beyond the common problems that plague many of the small studio productions Senior reviews regularly in his Sound On Sound columns.      Accordingly, the first few chapters are about listening to, evaluating, and enhancing your environment including sensible acoustic treatment and the use of reference recordings. The accompanying website contains frequency files for calibrating your space and gauging the impact of reflection, comb filtering, trapping and diffusion.  I learned things about monitor design and performance I hadn't come across in such detail before:  the effects of ported versus non-ported designs, the value of listening through a single midrange-heavy speaker  (a la Auratone), why laying near field monitors sideways may look cool but actually has a negative effect on what you hear.    Don't be misled by the title: this is not a collection of spoon-sized snippets of wisdom. It's a long-form text that rewards careful reading. The presentation is logical and attempts to follow the realistic thought process an engineer might go through: assembling the raw tracks and taking advantage of DAW features to create a comfortable workflow, building a raw balance, applying compression, EQ, reverb, and making final stereo enhancements.     But that by no means does the book justice. Senior brings his insight and expertise to each step, as well as a level of detail other mixing books I've read can't match. Yet there's no dogma; the author is always upfront that rules are made to be broken and the creative vision will often trump accepted practices. Useful comments from name mixing engineers are woven sparingly throughout the text without disturbing the author's focus on you and what you can do to improve your own work.     Along that line, rather than providing specific tutorial projects, Senior encourages readers to use their own projects to experiment with the techniques. That said, the website includes plenty of audio to illustrate various points covered.     A book of this depth has to be clear to be effective. I really like the way 'Mixing Secrets fo the Small Studio' is written: crisp, straight-to-the-point, in a way that's effortless to read even when discussing technical details. It's definitely one of those too-few books that, once having finished, I know I'll be referring to again and again.
1597801585|5.0|This is one of the better SF novels I've read in the last few years.    I normally consider hysteria about \\"frankenfoods\\" to be an example of what goes wrong when people don't get a proper science education, but Bacigalupi succeeded in creating a dystopia revolving around that issue that I found convincing.    The pace was slow. I would have liked the book much better if Bacigalupi had cut 150 pages and three or four points of view.    I'm not normally a big fan of the technique where the point of view shifts with every chapter, but Bacigalupi makes it work here because the characters are almost all pretty compelling, even the ones you don't like.     ---------------SPOILER WARNING------------------    The main exception is Anderson Lake, who is portrayed as if the author isn't sure what to make of him. Both Lake and his factory are unconvincing; they both seem to be there mostly to oil the wheels of the plot. I think this is the issue underlying, e.g., Angela's very negative review. I understand her objections to the Lake-Emiko relationship, and I agree with them to some extent. My take on this is that the real problem is that Bacigalupi is unsuccessful at portraying Lake as a fully realized character, and this is what makes it difficult for the reader to know what to make of some aspects of the story. Lake exhibits some good actions and some evil ones. Most of the good ones are toward the beginning of the book, most of the evil ones toward the end. Since he is also the POV character on page 1, there is going to be a tendency for the reader to imagine that he is the protagonist. By the end of the book, we see him as something more like an out-and-out villain; he uses Emiko sexually and then betrays her horribly. It's hard to know what to make out of any of this, especially because we mainly get access to Lake's thoughts in the first half of the book, not the second. In the second half, it's hard to tell whether he is even conscious of his own moral decisions. Emiko, on the other hand, comes off to me as a fully realized character who consciously recognizes the genetic cards that have been dealt her, transcends her own limitations, and ends up changing the world, partly in ways she intends and partly in ways she doesn't intend.    Many reviewers criticize the story for including some very brutal descriptions of Emiko's sexual abuse. One thing to point out is that these are absolutely necessary to the plot. Emiko is genetically programmed to be subservient, and the abuse is what, ironically, causes her to snap and free herself from mental slavery. But Bacigalupi's handling of her sexual abuse is clumsy, because Lake participates in and exacerbates it (partly for his own sexual gratification and partly in order to serve his corporate masters), and Lake is a blank. Because Lake is a blank, readers will make their own attempts to fill him in. Some may fill in the blank by assuming that Bacigalupi intends the reader to identify with Lake and get off on the sexual abuse. This is IMO not what Bacigalupi intended, but he leaves himself open to that interpretation by not handling the character better.

B0019N94X6|5.0|Since most people browsing this product have seen this film, this review will focus on the Blu-Ray's special features and video quality.<br /><br />First off, the visuals of the remastered Blu-Ray are amazing.  Watching the Blu-Ray in Hi Def offers you vivid colors, and detail that allows you to spot the smallest beads of sweat on character's faces.  While the new edition does offer 7.1 audio, it's more noticeable with respect to the film's music, not as much to spoken dialogue.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray comes in a special Steelbook metal case, and includes 10 collectible cards with a variety of Scarface graphic artwork.  It also includes a bonus disc of the original 1932 film of the same name, which the 1983 version borrows a few elements from.<br /><br />The good news is that the Blu-Ray contains plenty of extras.  The bonus area starts with three-part featurette titled \\"The Scarface Phenomenon,\\" a mini-documentary that explores how the film became so ingrained with pop culture.  It features commentary from Scarface fanatic Eli Roth of Inglourious Basterds, as well as Cuban rapper Sen Dog of Cypress Hill.<br /><br />The World of Tony Montana offers an interesting look at the lives and lifestyles of the 1980's Cocaine Cowboys.  Everyone from DEA agents to local law enforcement comment on the film, as well as their personal perceptions of serious coke dealing.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that the TV Version segment only lasted a few minutes.  Clips of the rated R version and the TV edits are played back to back to comic effect.  While a funny addition, it could have been much longer.<br /><br />One of the most interesting featurettes is The Making of Scarface: The Video Game.  I'm a big fan of the 2006 Scarface PC game, so it was fun to get a glimpse of the voice actors involved with the project.  There is recording studio footage of  Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Ice-T, Cheech & Chong, Anthony Anderson, Michael York, Sen Dog, Tommy Lee, Ling Bai, Wilmer Valderrama, and Jillian Barberie.  The feature offers brief clips of project comments by several of the actors involved, from Michael Rapaport to James Woods.  Various executives of both Radical Entertainment and Vivendi also lend their insight on how the game reflected the spirit of the film, as well as Tony's own \\"morals.\\"<br /><br />Not all of the extras are new features, however.  The Deleted Scenes segment is a great addition to the Blu-Ray, although it was available on previously released DVDs.  \\"The Creating\\" contains older clips of the film's producer and director discussing why most of the film had to be shot outside of Florida, and their struggle to avoid an \\"X\\" rating.<br /><br />In the bonus feature \\"The Acting,\\" there are interview accounts of how Pacino, Bauer, and Pfeiffer were cast for the film, and how those actors were able to prepare for their roles.  The Rebirth featurette includes comments from De Palma, Martin Bregman, Oliver Stone and Al Pacino on how the original 1932 Scarface provided inspiration for their own take on an epic gangster film.<br /><br />I only have two serious complaints about the Limited Edition release of this film for Blu-Ray.  The first is that there's still no audio commentary by Brian De Palma or Oliver.  My other gripe is that all of Pacino's interview clips were noticeably old.  While his comments were a solid addition to the Blu-Ray, it would have been nice to get fresh feedback.  Recycling clips doesn't just apply to Pacino, there are also a few segments that use noticeably dated footage of producer Martin Bregman.<br /><br />Overall, the Limited Edition Blu-Ray is an excellent film to enjoy in high definition.  The visuals are sharper than you've ever seen them, and there are plenty of bonus features to give you a better understanding of this cult classic.  If you consider yourself a Scarface fan, absolutely add this one to your collection.s brief clips of project comments by several of the actors involved, from Michael Rapaport to James Woods.

0316017930|5.0|I anticipated that this would be an egg-head look at the subject.  Gladwell's style is imminently readable, his topics are relevant and interesting.  I absolutely couldn't put it down....and the minute i did, I picked up Blink.
7208091242|5.0|Jean Renoir (1894-1979), one of the old masters of the French cinema - he was film director, screenwriter, actor, producer and author in one - did French Cancan in 1955. It tells the story of a music hall entrepreneur, played by Jean Gabin, with Françoise Arnoul as the main female lead. Gabin, against many obstacles, gets money together for a new project - Le Moulin Rouge - where the main attraction is the Cancan, an earlier music hall dance now considered out of fashion. Not really, as the success of his new place shows. The whole style is light - the stage, the playing, the mood - and the production uses an interesting mix between real studio and dance hall. Renoir was active into old age - like his father, the famous painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Renoir, My Father (1962), remains the definitive biography.

B000066JLO|5.0|This is a fantastic sounding album.  I like the SACD for the sound, but even if you purchase a straight CD, the music will not disappoint.

0425241505|5.0|Dragos Cuelebre, Lord of the Wyrkind demesne, is an ancient dragon who takes on a human form. He has led all of the Wyrkind for centuries from his demesne based in New York. As founder and head of Cuelebre Enterprises, Dragos is very powerful, financially, politically and magically. He can be selfish, callous, possessive, territorial, wicked, cunning, and ruthless - and those are his kinder traits.<br /><br />Then something happens that has never before been accomplished. Someone manages to locate his hidden horde and steals a small object. Finding the horde is a miracle in itself, but to somehow slip through all the magical wards and traps - and survive - should have been impossible. Worse, none of Dragos's wards ever warned him of an intruder. His bellow of rage shakes all of New York. He would find and tear the little thief to pieces.<br /><br />Pia Giovanni's late mother had engraved the lessons into her mind. Pia was never to tell anyone about herself. She was to blend in with the humans. Stay under the radar and avoid scrutiny. Never tell anyone that she was half human and half something else. She was to live her life in secret. But her mother is dead and Pia did not want to be alone. She told one minor secret to her boyfriend, Keith, the man she once loved, while they had been tipsy. No lock can hold her. She can open any lock as if it was not there. Uttering that single fact marked the end of life as she knew it. Months after Pia broke up with him, Keith reappears and blackmails her into stealing an object, any object, from Dragos's secret horde. Pia takes a secret pleasure in retrieving a simple copper penny for Keith instead of anything valuable. Her conscience has her leaving another penny in its place, along with a short note of apology. Before handing the coin over to Keith, she returns the favor of blackmail. To get what Pia stole, Keith has to read a binding spell. Never again would Keith be able to use her or tell any of her secrets. When the Great Beast roars and all of New York trembles, Pia knows her theft has been noted. She must leave everything and everyone she cares for behind. There is no doubt that the massive dragon would find her. Dragos has never shown mercy. Her circumstances would not matter. He would find her. He would rend her to pieces. Pia can only run to dely the inevitable.<br /><br />Pia makes it to Charleston, South Carolina. It is the seat of the Elven Court and the Wyr, especially their leader Dragos, cannot trespass without breaking all sorts of treaties. So Pia is standing on the beach, feeling safe and secure, at least for the moment, when a humongous dragon dives from the sky, morphing into the form of Dragos, as he pounces upon his prey - her. Stalling, Pia starts answering all of Dragos's questions while wondering when he would begin dishing out justice for her crime against him. Once she finishes explaining how and why she committed the theft, Pia is shocked to hear that Dragos is sparing her life. Of course, she will have to make recompense by serving him (at Cuelebre Enterprise) until he deems the debt is paid.<br /><br />Upon catching his little thief, Dragos realizes that, for the first time in centuries, he is not bored. Pia constantly surprises him and he is eager for her to remain close. Until Dragos releases Pia, she is his! But getting her safely back to Cuelebre Tower in New York turns out to be a challenge. The Light Fae, goblins, the Dark Fae, and even the sadistic Dark Fae King, Urien Lorelle, stands in the way.<br /><br />***** FIVE STARS! This is the first title of the Elder Races Series. My synopsis explains the main characters, what first brings them together, and some challenges they must overcome; however, it does not really do the story justice. All the obstacles I mention do not even cover the first half of this book. The second half is in New York, where the pair will face much more danger. Secondary characters (who play vital roles and who may have their ownstory in the future) have their backgrounds developed. In other words, I cannot name and/or describe the other people and events without more than tripling my review and possibly having spoilers. (I refuse to write spoilers!)<br /><br />The author has (basically) kept the world as we know it today. Since it is familiar to me, I feel a connection with the story. It is believable to me. Other authors have done this. The \\"Sookie Stackhouse Series\\" is a good example and I feel that Harrison's world and characters are just as well done. Readers will find themselves hooked immediately and dread having to put the book down for even a brief time. I warn you not to being reading this story until you are sure that you have plenty of alone time. With this one story, the author has made a fan of me. Thea Harrison's writing is exceptional in every way. *****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.ckgrounds developed.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I guess I will skip buying the new blu rays of Star Wars.  With all the negative reviews, I can tell that it is not what I want to spend my money on.  I read an article yesterday with Steven Spielberg that said he regrets changing E.T. and will correct the errors in blu ray.  Thank goodness, because I noticed right away they had removed all the guns.  Mr. Lucas needs to take a copy out of SS's playbook.
B0034G4P80|1.0|I saw this movie on a plane.  Horrid script, pathetic ideas and special effects, lame acting.  I was astonished by how bad it was.  I read Thor comics as a kid.  Somehow this missed the mark, and the main actor had muscles and no ability to convince me of anything.  I would feel punished to ever have to watch this again.  If special effects look bad on a small screen, imagine how they look in HD! All around lower in my mind, and rated high here by fans, but ripped to shreds on many movie review sites along the lines of what I felt.  I had hopes, despite the weak trailer (when a trailer is uninspiring, get ready for a longer time uninspired I guess).
B004EPZ09S|2.0|What a boring anticlimactic movie.  After reading some initial comments, I was prepared to be scared to death to go out in public after viewing this.  I have a tendency to be that person who is turning a corner in the grocery store as someone is sneezing, so I was prepared to have all of my worst fears confirmed.  That society's lack of basic prevention, like washing your hands and not touching your face, would be reinforced - but that was not the case.<br /><br />Beginning on Day 2 of an initial outbreak, you see Gwyneth Paltrow as Elizabeth Emhoff returning from a trip to Hong Kong with what appears to be a case of the flu.  From bad to worse millions are quickly infected with this unknown pathogen thus putting the world into a panic and every major health organization quickly attempting to find a vaccine.  Still not sure the real reason for some of the name actors (Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Elliott Gould, Laurence Fishburne) in this story, but I guess that is what you have to do to bring people to a movie such as this.<br /><br />Do not waste your time with this snooze-fest.  What it boils down to is that the wrong bat and the wrong pig meet up in Hong Kong and the world is thrown into a tizzy over it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Don't pay much attention to the Star Wars Fanboys that give the movies 1 star because some of thier favorite scenes were alterted. These are the Special Editions that came out in the theatres during the 90s - the Special Editions are not your dads Star Wars. This is Star Wars for a new generation.    I saw a New Hope back then (90s) and loved the changes - all my friends that saw the movie back then (in their teens) loved the Special Editions too (I remember talking about the movies in school). Now I understand the people who saw these movies in the late 70s and 80s want the unaltered versions, but you have the DVDs with 80s type quality if that is your fancy.     So if you have moved on (I presume you did if you own a bluray player) keep reading. The bluray movie is breath taking.     1. amazing 5.1 sound - the intro will make your entertainment room rock. They did not skimp on sound, the space scenes with the engine sounds of the various space ships, light sabers sounding like they would shatter your tv, and explosions that sound like they were real and happened in your house. It is clear thy Star Wars has never sounded this good.    2. great HD picture with perfect blacks and depth - this is HD done right (unlike some movies that just do a simple transfer that looks like a burned DVD on a Bluray) Star Wars has never looked this good. They made a 70s movie (new hope) looked like it was released in 2011. The skin tone colors for the actors are right, hair color is perfect, backgrounds look real, I could not believe this is a 70s movie watching this. Space scenes looked perfect black was dark black, stars looked like you were in space, planets looked real, depth in space scenes was perfect, light sabers glowed, were perfectly red and blue and looked redone to me. there is no way Star Wars has ever looked better.    3. Extras touches/improvements evident throughout (go to the official website where this is covered) - They include scenes never released before from thevaults to entice the fans that have bought the movies 4xs already (this is my first time buying a full set).    In conclusion, as a first time purchaser of the movies (I waited for Bluray as an early adopter of Bluray) I am very impressed and can tell the movies were redone right. I am sure your experience can differ based on your TV and Bluray player, but know that if your picture settings are correct, you will fall out of your seat with perfect visuals that make a 70s movie looked like it was released in the 10s. Good job Mr. Lucas!

Like the scorned orphan she plays, she seems plain at first, but as the strength and integrity of her character become known, she grows more radiantly lovely.<br /><br />She is supported here by a fine cast, notably Michael Fassbender as Rochester and Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax.<br /><br />The young director Cary Fukunaga claims he was striving for a more gothic tone than in the famous 1943 version starring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.  In this he is somewhat less than successful, given that the most \\"haunting\\" scenes were cut from the theatrical version (but are included on this DVD as deleted scenes).<br /><br />Nevertheless the real-light cinematography is well-done and helps convey the mood and look of the time and place.<br /><br />Finally I'm pleased to say that this is not a \\"stripped\\" DVD -- it has director's commentary, plus a few short making-of featurettes.<br /><br />At any rate, gentlemen whose ladies insist on viewing this DVD in place of the latest explosion-filled comic book adventure will find it as tolerable a \\"chick flic\\" as exists.

It was kind of hard to get into at first, with so many characters, but before you know it you know them all.  This book was hard to put down and let me tell you I loved every min of it and will start reading the 2nd book right away.  There are kings, queens, war, magic, family, betrayal, romance, and tad of incest; I recommend this book to everyone. It's a great escape.

They're awful) that need not be made. George, for the sake of Star Wars fans everywhere, please just stop. You've done enough.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|This Amazon Mobile app has saved me a lot of time and money when out shopping. This allows you to either search a product by entering the name or, my preferred method, scanning the bar code and then comparing the price and looking at the customer ratings and reviews. It has more than once stopped me spending more than needed (although I like to shop locally when the cost is comparable) and from buying poorly rated products.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B002OSY2T6|3.0|This toy is a lot of fun, but I would not recommend leaving a child un-supervised while playing with this toy. My 6 month old picked up this toy and tried to put it in her mouth. She somehow got her chin stuck inbetween the snails head and body. she got a litte cut on her chin and screamed bloody murder when I pulled it off. I have not let her play with it since.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|I really enjoyed this series so far. But I'm getting to the stage where I want something to be resolved. I'm actually tired of all the bad things that happen to the characters just when things seem to be going well. I know in real life nothing ever finishes but this is fantasy not real life. I still want to know what happens in the end but I am somewhat in despair about another 6 books to get through as the pace is getting slower as the books go on. Geoge Martin says he split books 4 and 5 by moving on half the characters in one and half in the other. I think this is a mistake. Seeing the whole of book 4 again from someone else's viewpoint is not really attractive to me. I think i will wait until book 10 is published and then reread the whole thing if I have the energy...or live that long.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|fun game, addicting and frustrating at the same time! wish you could use hints a little more often to make it less frustrating. some boards are really hard.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Not a bad app, yes it is a big file but it can be moved to the sd card so it isn't an issue.  My only complaints are that the webs are very close together on some levels making it easy to cut the wrong one, a better zoom would help.  Also in a lot of the levels, the first ones anyway, the spider takes the same type of path, he just goes around the circle when the bug is the central point.
0553801473|5.0|i loved it.  i loved every page, i have read all 5 books and i was sorry to get to the last page of this one.  i'm not looking forward to the long wait before the next one and i'm sorry to read that george plans to stop at 7!  i don't understand any of the negative reviews for this book - ok, it doesn't move as swiftly as the first three books, but the complexity of it all is a marvel.  grrm remembers all of his characters, dead and alive, even down to the cats.  whereas the last book, which i still liked, concluded with a wtf???  this book wrapped up marvelously, resolved many of the loose ends from the last book, and left many exciting possibilities for the next installment.  5/5

1451629184|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  Obviously, very sad, but it was written so well and really spared no details of what this MONSTER and his wife did to her.  While I was reading the book, I keep thinking to myself, two words:  Eighteen years.  Eighteen years!  It just blows my mind, that someone was kept that long and yet, look how the author prevailed!  She certainly comes across as a very kind, and compassionate woman to me.<br /><br />I couldn't imagine being kidnapped at all, and being kept anytime, but for this woman to endure almost two decades, is just almost unbelievable.  Thank God she is free today.<br /><br />I wish Jaycee only the best and i want to thank her, for sharing her story.  I hope now, she can enjoy her life, do whatever she wants, whenever she wants and forever how long she wants, because SHE DESERVES IT!<br /><br />After reading what these two individuals did to her, I think they both deserve to die.  I don't care how overboard my comment sounds.  They may not have physically taken a life, but emotionally, they did!  They don't deserve to breathe!  Maybe they both will find the same fate one day, that Jeffrey Dahmer did!  They are sick animals!<br /><br />But, I want to end on a positive note here:  Kudos to the book.  I highly recommend it!  Get it.  You don't be disappointed and you'll see what a strong young lady Jaycee is!  Not to mention beautiful, both inside and out.  Jaycee is not only a survivor, but a thriver, indeed!!

B005LY4B0A|5.0|The game is good, kind of a puzzle type challenge.  The game initially shows up small on tablet, but when you push the play button the game actually expands to the larger screen.  The bottom portion of the screen is a little off, can be corrected if you swipe your finger left.  In any event it does not effect the game play.  I only wrote this review in response to someone who never actually played the game who said it doesn't work on xoom.  I wish people would actually try something before rushing to judge it.  So if you like this type of game its good, if you don't, don't download it.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|I see all these reviews are all over the place so I wanted to weigh in with my own opinions.<br /><br />I barely play my Kinect, and really don't want to have to move my big L-sofa whenever I want to play. So like everyone else I was sold on the idea of playing Kinect with less space.<br /><br />At first my Kinect was on top of my TV, and I slapped the Zoom on and turned everything on.. and it barely recognized my hand, let alone me. I messed with it a bit, including redoing the calibration with that smiley face card, and it helped a little. When I went in to run the Kinect ID setup I saw what the problem was - it couldn't see my feet, and kept showing me as having my legs crossed and in all kinds of strange positions.<br /><br />So I moved my Kinect to below my TV, it's sitting on a speaker on my TV stand, so about 6 inches off the stand with the top of it in line with the bottom of my TV screen. I ran the calibration again, and it seemed to be somewhat better. I went and played Kinect Adventures, and saw in the pictures it takes what is probably the issue with the Zoom - everything is shaped different, and on the outside of each image you can see the circle for where the lenses are. BUT, you can clearly see it sees ALL OF YOU, and more, if the Kinect is below the TV.<br /><br />So what I did was go back into Kinect ID and -deleted my settings-. All the saved things it had to recognize me I cleared out. Then re-did it. And everything started to move a lot better. My wife did the same and experienced the same thing. I think the original way of viewing the world and the new way it looks with the Zoom on all saved together confused the system.<br /><br />So what I suggest for other people who are having trouble before they return the Zoom:<br />- Put the Kinect below the TV<br />- Clear out your Kinect ID settings and redo the recognition setup.<br /><br />Another thing: I think 40% less space is conservative. 5 feet away from the Kinect was freaking it out in Kinect Adventures. So I still need to check that out more.<br /><br />Bottom line from me: For the amount I play the Kinect, once I worked the bugs out I'm happy with the device. It'll save me from moving anything but our coffee table, and that sounds good to me.Bottom line from me: For the amount I play the Kinect, once I worked the bugs out I'm happy with the device.

0385340559|5.0|Anything by Lee Child I love. This is one of the last books I need for the Jack Reacher series. I have pre-ordered the one that is coming out, all I can say is please do not put Tom Cruise in as Tom Reacher, no way no how he is not Jack Reacher ever!!!!! I love all of these books, my sister loves them, and we talk about Jack as if he is one of the family, great books. Will buy from them again if they have what I am looking for.
0439023513|4.0|I liked the way the book began, it was very interesting. I loved the way the dale/peeta thing turned out, but I did not like what happened to peeta in the book. I wanted more romance like in the other two books, and it did not happen. Did I like the ending? I don't think so. I think it ended way too abruptly. I would have liked some more closure at the end. I feel like I didn't get that.

B00003CXD5|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CXD5 The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br />The Treasure of the Sierra Madre<br /><br />John Huston's 1948 classic \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" is my favorite of Huston's many films.  The story, by the elusive B. Traven, is simple and  has been well summarized by other reviewers. The film's most notable achievements are the great supporting role by Huston's father, Walter, as the grizzled old prospector, and the character  development of Bogart's character \\"Fred C. Dobbs.\\"<br />He goes from a shiftless drifter at the start of the film to an entrepreneur as the movie develops.  But his increasing paranoia takes over.  (Remember the scene where he accuses of partner of trying to steal his share of the gold, which he has hidden under a rock.  He is about to retrieve it when his partner points out the hiding place is also occupied by a deadly Gila Monster, which would gladly bite off Dobbs' hand.)<br />In addition to great acting, directing and cinematography, the film also features a fine cast of anonymous local extras.<br />One interesting note is the appearance of a young Robert Blake as the Mexican boy who sells Bogart his winning lottery ticket.<br />The movie won three Academy Awards (best supporting actor for Walter Huston, best direction by John Huston, and best screenplay by John Huston.<br />This two-disk version also contains extras including appearances by Paul Newman and others reflecting on John Huston's accomplishments.
B005CAAXXM|4.0|If you discovered Leprous with their previous album [[ASIN:B0021BUXV2 Tall Poppy Syndrome]], you can safely pick up Bilateral because, being familiar with the band, you should know that you can expect something similar yet at the same time something different. That is to say the differences are there, but at the root of it the band is still the same band you discovered and came to love two years ago.<br /><br />Bilateral is harder to review because I've had it for only a little while now while I had years to fully absorb Tall Poppy Syndrome. In general terms, the new album delves into more experimental territory, exploring the depths of progressive rock with myriad sound textures, varied instrumentation, and stunning musical performances. Compared to its predecessor, Bilateral is definitely less heavy but it still retains the band's heavy/light characteristics in its varied song selection. The use of growls has noticeably dropped as well. Actually calling them 'growls' may be a stretch, as the aggressive vocals presented on this album are more akin to those on later-day Agalloch or Novembre discs more so than Enslaved, who Leprous is likened to mostly (maybe because both bands are from Norway). The only song that utilizes significant amount of aggressive singing is \\"Waste of Air\\" with its complex intro, pummelling drums, and off-the-wall arrangement.<br /><br />Other tracks feature the aggressive singing style sparingly: \\"Restless\\" sets jazzy drums against a powerful clean voice that is both very deep and affective. The production also highlights gorgeous distant vocals humming a sweet melody over a simple, two-note guitar chord. Sonically, the song recalls Devin Townsend's [[ASIN:B00008IXCQ Accelerated Evolution]] until the harsh vocals kick in. \\"Thorn\\" suggests it was a leftover from Ihsahn's [[ASIN:B002OFANME After]] album. Actually Ihsahn makes a brief guest appearance on this one. The song constantly shifts between catchy vocal parts to slowed-down jazz sections to aggressive singing, and the drum tone is excellent.<br /><br />The album's more atmospheric statements also indicate where they may be headed on their next couple of discs. Given the nature of these tracks, I actually wouldn't be surprised if the band abandoned the aggressive vocals completely after a few more releases. I can sense a distinct Kevin Moore vibe (think Chroma Key and OSI) in places here: \\"Forced Entry\\" boasts a wicked, complex riff with a cool bass solo that belongs more on a freestyle jazz disc than prog metal, but the detailed mix also opens portals for spacey instrumental parts with Moore-like keys lingering over them. Also, the more ballady \\"Mb. Indifferentia\\" recalls Moore in that it features semi-sung vocals. I am talking about his apathetic singing style, like he'd rather not be there. Finally, on the heavily bass-centric \\"Mediocrity Wins,\\" vocalist Einar Solberg emotes spoken lyrics over a subdued guitar guitar arrangement and haunting keyboard lines, which wouldn't be out of place on OSI's underrated masterpiece [[ASIN:B000F0V00E Free]].<br /><br />Those expecting heavy onslaughts of riffs with exploding shrapnels should look into the band's earlier discs as well as some Enslaved material. They won't find it here. That said, the band does know how to groove and lay down some pretty hard-hitting riffs. The synchopated riffs of the uber-eclectic \\"Cryptogenic Desires\\" sounds like something Mike Patton would sing. It's actually the groovy side of Faith No More (listen to the bass!) injected with the unexpected nature of Mr Bungle, and yet, it doesn't quite sound like either band. The final track is also the best on the album. It is the perfect amalgamation of the band's current musical vision realized in a little over eight minutes. The song packs the harmonic brilliance of the best songs on Tall Poppy Syndrome, psychedelic guitar sounds that are still paralyzingly heavy (think The Mars Volta), and stirring ambiance-laden passages filled withnifty improvised extensions, interesting lead solos, and unforgettable melodic signatures. This is the kind of song I expect Leprous to write more on their upcoming release, for this is the sound that sets them apart from all these other awesome musicians mentioned in this review. It gives them their own voice.<br /><br />The stereo mixing is phenomenal. Anything inferior would make these songs suffer sonically.interesting lead solos, and unforgettable melodic signatures.

B003L77GGK|3.0|I just discovered Supernatural this spring via reruns. Once I saw a couple of episodes, I was hooked. In spite of the fact that the writing is uneven (though getting better), the acting can be a bit over the top - or stiff - and they jump the shark more times than Fonzie on crack, I am still hooked on this show. I really do want to know what happens next. Does Sam keep on kicking @ss and taking names? Does Dean ever find true love and white picket fence happiness? Could both brothers please spend more time with their shirts off? Ahem... anyhow, I really enjoy the Crowley character -- wicked fun, the Devil we hate to love -- and Death is a very cool character too, just how I'd picture him, very gaunt and with his own blues soundtrack. Cass as God I'm not sure I buy; looks like he's being set up to Fall and become the next Lucifer. Hopefully the brothers get their respective acts together and save him from himself. The writers need to stop focusing on all the angst-ridden emotional bromance garbage they've been beating to death for the last two seasons or so. The boys need to get back to the real work of saving the world from behind the wheel of a classic car. Can't wait to see what they do with the coming season. Meantime, I'm gonna sit back and enjoy all the behind-the-scenes goodies that come with this DVD.

1594744769|5.0|Everyone in my family had read this book before I finally got my copy in the mail, but it was worth the wait. Even though they had shown me most of the really amazing photos, there were still many more to find on my own while reading. The story is interesting, with exquisite details that are matched with an old photograph. While reading this book, the reader is able to imagine that this place really exists and these photos are all the proof one needs. The overall storyline is a dark adventure book that I believe would be suitable for both young adult and adult readers. It may be a bit violent for younger readers, but I imagine teens and young adults would be fine with the storyline. My only complaint about this book is that it is set up for a sequel and while I am definitely intrigued to see more photos and learn what happens to all the peculiar children, I personally hate when a story does not completely end. I cannot wait for the next book to be released.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was an impulse purchase.  I did not expect anything special, but was pleasantly surprised.  Although filled with hardship exceeding my comprehension, it is also inspiring.  Jaycee's boyant personality keeps hope alive, when her life could not have been worse.  Her eventual rescue is almost beyond her imagination, by the time it takes place.  Her ability to adapt to the most adverse of conditions is extraordinary.  And her appreciation of those who aided her is remarkable in its maturity.  She is one of the rare personalities that can see beyond her immediate hardship to the future. She has that rare spark to see a constructive way to aid others who have endured similar experiences.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|First of all, I absolutely adored this book. Lauren Oliver's lovely style of writing is exhibited beautifully on every page. I don't understand how other people said that this was a slow read or an obvious introduction to a trilogy -- I completely disagree. I could not put this book down.<br /><br />The beginning is a general (but interesting!) introduction to the dystopian world Oliver has created, which is set in futuristic America. The government has diagnosed love as a deadly disease, and has created a 'cure' to the problem via a surgical procedure. As the story progresses, protagonist Lena learns more about what it really means to love, and decides she does not want to go alone with the ordained life the government has created for her. Each chapter is fast-paced and exciting, and the futuristic society feels just familiar enough to be believable and scary.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|For those of you said &quot;16 Mb is too big for an app&quot; go look at almost any version of Angry Birds. They are all around 16 Mb and not even the highest I've seen.  Nano Panda, which I believe was also offered as AFAOTD, comes in at at least 20 Mb. Most of the high quality Apps being created today are &gt;10 Mb.   For those who said this is another &quot;Amazon Special&quot; app, think again. I've had the free version of this app, downloaded from the Market, for several months on my Samsung Moment.   Which leads me to point 3. My above mentioned phone is almost 2 years old. It is not the &quot;latest and greatest&quot; but it plays this game juuust fine. Quit complaining. It's a great game that makes you think. It makes you strategize. For those who want Angry Birds' easy style of gameplay, this is not for you.

B005GSY23M|5.0|After seeing Drive I walked out of the movie theater knowing I had to have the soundtrack, which doesn't happen very often. Drive feels like a modern take on the action thrillers of the late 70's and 80's, and the soundtrack only matches that theme. With a retro synth sound not only does it fit the movie perfectly, it also stands well on its own. This soundtrack will definitely help the late night drives home from work feel a little more exciting.

Anyway, this is a great movie, as it has it all: science, politics, social implications of climate change, and even Gore's autobiography. A must see. And I would also suggest watching the extra stuff in the DVD. You can clearly see that in his scripted movie, Gore is entertaining and funny, but that when he is not scripted he is quite a boring guy.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|What can I say? This is a top quality CPU fan that will put the stock CPU fan to shame. It's much bigger than the stock fan, but will fit in a standard mid-size or full size tower unless you have some sort of a built-in side fan that gets in the way (even in this case, it will likely still fit). Installation is a breeze, though a bit more time consuming than the stock fan.     This fan is silent, and it keeps my CPU a LOT cooler. I used this with my AMD Athalon X4 965 Black, and it was worth every penny.
0618918248|1.0|Recently, a friend told me of a Christian missionary who, after reading The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, denied his faith and became an atheist. My first thought was, \\"Wow! There must be some very strong arguments in that book.\\" So, I decided to read it. Dawkins repeatedly asserts that Darwinian evolution and natural selection are facts that cannot be disputed, but offers not one single word of proof to support his assertions. I was shocked. I expected so much more from one of the world's most renowned evolutionists but he just said it over and over again apparently thinking that if he said it enough it would eventually be true. His philosophical arguments against God and the Bible were slightly more credible, but most of his credibility was lost because he repeatedly set up straw men that any five-year-old could knock down. Almost all of his examples of Christian behavior and morality were based on the fringe right. For example, to demonstrate how Christianity affects behavior he quoted from a letter he received from a so-called Christian who used profanity and threats to get his points across. I know of no true Christian who would write a letter like that even to a total unbeliever. It is completely against the teaching of Jesus. Speaking of the fringe, he actually states that a child who is taught about God and religious values by his parents is probably worse off than a child who experiences sexual abuse. Now this is a man who has it in for religion. Regarding the missionary who lost his faith after reading this book, he must have been an atheist in his heart from the beginning or he may have been one of those people Dawkins talks about that believes in God only because of his parents teaching. In either case, if this book changed his mind there must not have been much there to begin with.<br />Two years ago I read God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything by the noted atheist Christopher Hitchens. Although I completely disagree with his conclusions, the historical examples he uses to make his point about how \\"religion\\" poisons things are, at least, supported by historical facts, something Dawkins fails to do. Even though I don't agree with either man, my opinion after reading both is that Hitchens is smart and Dawkins is loud.the historical examples he uses to make his point about how \\"religion\\" poisons things are, at least, supported by historical facts, something Dawkins fails to do.

B005JE7WKI|2.0|The juxtaposition of extreme violence with the light hearted comedy in this movie just didn't work.  All the actors did a fine job, especially Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk (he could play a terrifying bad guy in a horror flick), but seeing a man jammed into a wood chipper, another impaled on a fallen tree, and Alan Tudyk tortured isn't funny.  The attempt at humor alongside these scenes were crass rather than funny.  The violence in this movie was simply too extreme to think that this movie could be considered a comedy.  And all the attempts at comedy kept the movie from being a decent horror movie.

B0058U0EEO|5.0|The cover of the music shows you exactly what it's best for. Not since Sade's \\"Love is Stronger than Pride\\" has there been a better album to ---- by. Not to say this music is the same genre; it's entirely different. It's chill wave; something of a hybrid between 80s new wave and \\"chill\\" music. Think Ultra Chill meets New Order, but with a strong erotic undertone. Put in on, and go to work.     But this music also works as ambient, chill music for working or sipping wine too.     Strong, yet not intrusive. Smooth, but not sleepy.     If you enjoy \\"Re-Creation\\" by Naked Music, or Music Brokers this will light your candle.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I'm very happy with this player.  I used it almost every day.  There are a couple points which you should be made aware of when you consider this.    1.  Output signal is on the low side for both aux and FM.  FM output is even quieter than aux out.    2. Display buttons can be tricky to operate making remote control usage almost necessary (which is ok because there's more functionality with the remote).    And what the instructions won't tell you:  You can have the SD input and USB input occupied at the same time and your bookmarks are still saved.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|Def &quot; thinking game&quot;. Unlike Angry Birds, which is a game of luck. The game is solid and stable. ( Samsung Epic). BUT, having said that... This is not a game for people like me who have &quot; fat fingers&quot;.  A simple slip and the game is lost, even when nothing is selected, I can still lose a turn and blow the whole game. (undo feature Dev?).  The &quot;hint a day&quot; feature is nice, if complicated and difficult to remember.   Take a chance and get this game, but don't expect to complete it.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|i thought it was a great book and i cant wait till the second but wat i dont understand is why he doesnt make more than two books in the series i think it has great potenial to be a great series but the fact is  i really liked this book even though percy wasnt in it.
0553801473|2.0|I am a fan of the series or I wouldn't have made it through five books, but by the fourth book (and maybe even the third) my brain was scrambled from all of the new characters. I thought that maybe there was a purpose for this and all would come together in the end, but NOOOOO, not at all.<br /><br /> What was the purpose of bringing in all of these new characters and not tying them into the ending? The characters that we want to know about are neglected while we read pages and pages about others that we aren't at all invested in. It felt to me like the new characters were there to drag out the story line, making what could have been a great trilogy into a five book jungle of confusion.<br /><br />After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to buy this one but I wanted to find out what happened. It took me a long time to finish reading it, and now I feel that I wasted my time.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I think Martin is a brilliant writer. I just don't think that this one did him justice.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|The alien invasion story of \\"Battle: Los Angels\\" may remind you of Tom Cruise's blockbuster \\"War of the Worlds,\\" but Sony Pictures Entertainment's sci-fi action movie looks more like a cross between a war movie like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and a sci-fi action \\"Independence Day.\\" \\"Battle: Los Angels\\" takes itself more seriously, however, than Roland Emmerich's \\"ID4,\\" leaning towards realism visually, if not storywise.    In \\"Battle: Los Angels,\\" a U.S. marine platoon has to fight the hostile aliens from outer space, to rescue the civilians trapped in the Santa Monica area before the Air Force strikes. Aaron Eckhart plays SSgt. Michael Nantz, who is planning to retire, but when meteorite-like strange objects hit the ocean and the global alien attack begins, he is called back into action once again.    After a short flashback introducing the back stories of the main characters, \\"Battle: Los Angels\\" starts off promisingly, straight to the action. The action seldom stops, which is s good thing, but as the story unfolds, \\"Battle: Los Angels\\" suffers from a clichéd plotline and confusing camerawork. With mostly familiar narrative devices, there are not many surprises as to what happens to stock characters. Also, as we are living in the post-Jason Bourne era, almost all action scenes are shot with a shaky handheld camera, which soon becomes annoying, sometimes leaving you wonder what is going on.    Directed by Jonathan Liebesman (\\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning\\"), the action-packed film is surprisingly gore-free, but the film delivers some intense combat scenes. Sound effects are superb, and visual effects are pretty impressive, especially the flying machines. With more careful choice of camera (less close-up shots, more steady camera), and a better screenplay, \\"Battle: Los Angels\\" could have been a more engrossing experience.

B0051T46XM|3.0|Three Norwegian film students set out to investigate reports of bear poaching; what they uncover instead is a vast governmental cover-up - trolls exist, and are managed by special operatives who hunt them down and destroy them when they escape from their preserves.  Joining Hans, a Trollhunter, the three record evidence of trolls, and of the conspiracy to conceal them from the general public.  Along the way, the viewer gets a primer of sorts about troll taxonomy and behavior, and as the hunter Hans sets off to find out why several of the creatures have left their traditional grounds, he brings the three along with him to see what truly goes bump in the night.    This movie is not without entertainment value, and there are more than a few droll comedic moments that might make it worthwhile, depending on your tastes.  But there aren't enough of them to offset the fact that this film primarily sounds one note - that trolls exist - and then never really moves beyond it.  The 'shakey-cam' mockumentary style is used, and although I don't have anything inherently against these efforts, either the weaknesses in the method are more obvious here, or I'm just getting so used to seeing these types of films that they seem more prominent.  Still, I think I could have looked past any stylistic flaws if the filmmakers, once establishing their premise, used their mockumentary to mock something.      'Troll Hunter' shoots some scattered barbs at several different ideas, including government bureaucracy and conspiracy theories, but, like the film [[ASIN:B001A5070M American Zombie]],  it never picks a definite target.  Thus it fails to take off as a satire, nor does it seem to aim at spoofing certain types of people, a la Christopher Guest.  About midway through the film, my interest started to flag, as it all started to feel like a closed loop - Trolls don't exist, but we're going to make fun of them as if they do.      On the other hand, technically speaking this is a very attractivefilm.  In the blu-ray version, the Norwegian scenery is often breathtaking, even as seen through the windows of the vehicle as the film crew chases down reports of trolls.  Very rustic and natural looking, it made me want to visit.  And it seems to me that CG effects are responding to the higher resolutions of this format: in older films the CG often stands out, though in 'Troll Hunter', I thought the effects were quite seamless.  Whether that's to do with improved techniques, or by disguising the limitations so they aren't as apparent in blu-ray, I don't know.  The end result was a very competent and beautifully filmed movie.    Extras include some behind the scenes footage, outtakes, and deleted and extended scenes, as well as some footage about the CG techniques, but no commentary.  All together, I felt they were disappointing for this format.
0441013597|5.0|This book is a quick read and a sci-fi favorite of mine. It was surprisingly a calm book. In hindsight the book is written just like the setting of Dune: it's super calm, can be harsh and violent at times like the dessert, and strangely charismatic. A must-read sci-fi classic that tells a story about a legendary boy's journey to adulthood and more!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Greedy Spiders features high production values very reminiscent of Angry Birds. The underlying puzzle premise is a fairly unusual one, and a breath of fresh air after playing tons of gem matching games.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was delighted to hear that Star Wars was coming out on Blu-Ray.  However, it turns out that you're not getting the original Star Wars.  You're getting 30 years of Lucas changing bits and pieces to the point where parts of the original films don't even resemble that of the theatrical release.  Not only that, there's no option to watch said films in their original format; even though the Blu-Ray discs hold the capacity to do so.<br /><br />Bottom line:  There have been so many changes over the years to the original films, Lucas doesn't even know who shot first.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|But poorly designed with only phones in mind. Small screen area with messed up backgrounds. Probably looks fine on a phone but not on my Iconia tablet. I hope the developer updates it.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|I wish that I didn't even have to give this 1-star, even though it is a free app it is still wanting me to pay the stupid thing... so thanks a million Amazon, chalk up another to perfection
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is well produced. The art, music and animation are all top notch, and each level keeps you interested in the next (assuming you like puzzle games). The only flaw is that it doesn't scale properly on my Transformer, however that is minor in my opinion, and I hope will be addressed in a future update.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Relayer is Yes' eighth album, was released in December 1974 and features Patrick Moraz taking over for Rick Wakeman. While I can't pick a favorite Yes album, I like this studio one just as much as \\"The Yes Album\\", \\"Fragile\\", \\"Close To The Edge\\" and \\"Tales From The Topographic Oceans\\". The band has a harder sound here than on past albums and it's clear that they were interested in reinventing their sound. Steve's classic Gibson was replaced with a Telecaster For most of this album while drummer Jon Anderson and Alan White used metal junkyard parts as part of the percussion for the album. New keyboard player Patrick Moraz also has a different style than Rick Wakeman.<br /><br />The opening side long song \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" which is based on the book \\"War and Peace\\" with the song split into three sections (leading up to the war, followed by the battle itself and ending with a prayer for peace). It is one of the band's strongest songs and is quite amazing. As you might guess, some of the music is very brash in spots but it's quite effective in conveying it's points. \\"Sound Chaser\\" has more of a jazzy feel while \\"To Be Over\\" is a nice somewhat mellow song. The first two bonus songs were the single edits from the album, \\"Soon\\" which is the ending prayer piece from Gates and an edit of \\"Sound Chaser\\". The last cut on the disc is an early run through of \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" that sounds quite a bit different than the finished version in spots. The sound and packaging on this remaster is top notch.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Works as advertised! I agree that it can be a security hole if you were to connect to an unsecured wifi. What would make it better would be to put in a generated password (displayed on the phone) that the computer user would have to type in to access the content.

B005974CNA|5.0|Full disclosure, Dream Theater is my favorite band, but I'm a critical fan, and I freely admit when they produce something I'm not too fond of (Octavarium, Train of Thought, moat of Systematic Chaos). That being said, this is truly one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. There are beautiful vocal melodies, trademark soaring John petrucci guitar solos, heck, even bassist John Myung has at least taken a step back into writing lyrics again. From the best song (This is the Life), to the slow acoustic ballads, this album has everything that has made DreamTheater Dream Theater. Do yourself a favor. Buy it. in fact, if you've never heard Dream Theater before and are wondering what album to start with, I'd say this one. It's a great introduction into the sound of Dream Theater.
B0042RUMH8|5.0|This Cd is great because she went back to just dance music.  i think this is one of her best in a long time.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I just downloaded this game and have spent the last 20 minutes playing. It's a very clean and polished game. The controls are very easy to understand and after the first level you don't have to concentrate on how to play, just how to win the level. It is kind of addictive, if you fail a level you feel like you have to go back and do it again until you win... Overall really great. I feel like I will be coming back to this one over and over, unlike some other games on my phone.

B004G6009U|3.0|This movie has more than a few passing resemblances to Disney's Beauty and the Beast. The ending is almost identical. One thing it doesn't share is the music. The songs here are bland and forgettable. And what's with those oversized eyes? They were a bit creepy. Not a horrible movie, but Disney seem to be getting a little lazy with their material.

B0058M8BGA|4.0|I was attracted to Virgina Woolf's modernist ORLANDO through its bizarre premise of a protagonist starting out as a young man in Elizabethan England and then, changing sex halfway through, living as a female novelist in 20th-century London. ORLANDO is Woolf's love letter to Vita Sackville-West, with whom she carried out a relationship in the 1920s, and the novel is a roman a clef with Orlando living out West's bisexuality. If gender queering is your thing, then this is the literary classic for you.<br /><br />It's not mine, so were the novel only focused on Sackville-West's sexuality, then I probably would have gotten bored with it quite soon. Happily, Woolf focuses very much on how one appreciates literature, with the protagonist making some insightful observations on how readers go about choosing their favourite books, how critics can be so woefully wrong, and how the artist struggles with the creative urge. There's a great deal of laugh-out-loud moments in the book. Also, the plot anticipates magical realism, with so many fantastical developments that nonetheless remain part of a believable narrative.<br /><br />For the most part, ORLANDO is a tame work from Virgina Woolf, not displaying the stream-of-consciousness style of her other major works. Things do get a great deal more avant-garde in the last 50 pages, but for the most part the narration is quite traditional. Although brilliant at first, Woolf's twee and effusive style can become exhausting two thirds of the way through, the main reason I cannot award this book a full five stars. Still, I enjoyed ORLANDO and the novel has many memorable elements.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|The first time I watched this I LOVED it. The second time, it was good. The third time, Margaret really got on my nerves. She is cold, doesn't take responsibility for her actions, strings men along, and doesn't seem to mind hurting her parent's feelings. I almost think the relationship between Higgins and Thornton is better written. You at least understand why they like and respect each other.<br /><br />The cinematography is great and so is the acting. The music is pretty. Thornton is such a hearthrob (move over Mr. Darcy), but the Hale family dynamics are not well done and it really is a sticking point after the first viewing. The ending scene at the train station is romantic until you start to wonder why Margaret is looking out the window instead of at the man she loves. It was anachronistic, yes, but that can be over-looked.<br /><br />It's still a good mini-series, but it could have been a great mini-series by having less deaths, and a heroine who lightened up at the end. You would think everything that happens would be humbling to Margaret, but she is just as superior and arrogant at the end as at the begining.<br /><br />[...]
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It may sound like hyperbole but this release is a slap to the face for fans.  If it had been nothing more than a prettier version of the DVDs we would have been happy and ponied up the money.  But actually making them worse is unacceptable.
1416955070|5.0|Great item, thank you so much. I was so surprised at the condition of the book. It was in wonderful like new shape.  I had bought this because I had this book before but a friend loaned it to someone else and I knew I would never see my copy again.  I love this series of books and they are worth reading again and again.
1594744769|5.0|This was one of those rare books that once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. The writer's style, the characters, the setting, and the amazing photographs were simply haunting. This is a book that will stay with you forever. Sweet characters so beautifully created you can never forget them.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is, of course, the adaptation that started it all. I needn't go over it's merits. The only negatives (and these are minor) are that the costumes could have been better and that Jennifer Ehle played Elizabeth as slightly too reserved. The character is an out-going, somewhat bubbly, very young woman after all. I should probably hide under a table for daring to say anything not just glowing about this version. LOL.<br /><br />It really is the best so far, though. It is what interested me in costume dramas and it is what got me reading the classics. I'm sure that it did this for thousands of girls my age, too. If you haven't seen it, you simply must. You're in for a treat.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Mine's quite simple. I'm a fan of the series but was never that much into it to be upset with all of Lucas' changes to the films over the years. To me, I simply loved the story and the space age take on chivalry and swordplay. The characters are fantastic (well, most of them anyway), the lightsaber duels are great fun to watch, and the special effects and scope of the films are stellar. For me, I give this Blu-Ray box collection five stars for being excellent transfers on the superior format, and fun to watch on today's high-definition sets. All changes aside, I like these movies on Blu-Ray.
1439153663|4.0|I really loved this book and quickly got to the point where I couldn't put it down. I mostly enjoyed the main characters, Belle, Lavinia, Mama Mae, Ben, how they related to each other which I found believable and very touching. I'm a little surprised at the critical reviews. The summarizing didn't, in my opinion, detract in any way. As for the dialect, I know the author did her research and in her earlier drafts, the dialect was more accurate but made the book more difficult to read.<br /><br />I struggled with the caricature of the evil overseer vs. the kind paternalism of the masters. How many times has this been done? I also struggled with Lavinia's naivete as a young woman. Her confusion about the color line as a little girl was understandable. She was too young to understand and she straddled two worlds with no one to set her straight about her position. However, when she returns to Tall Oaks as Marshall's wife, how can she possibly think things will be the same as when she was a little girl?<br /><br />Strained credulity on this point aside, I feel the book has more strengths than weaknesses. I look forward to Kathleen Grissom's next book.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This movie really had it tough. When you go up against one of the favorite movies ever, you have to be brave. Imagine making a new version of Gone with the Wind, or if someone decided to do Titanic Two. I remember when I saw this in theaters, everyone was whispering comparisons between this and the Colin Firth version. So, how is it?<br /><br />On it's own, it's great, actually. I've never been a fan of Kiera Knightley, but she does well here. I do think she played the part a little more teenage and a little less snarky than it was meant to be, but I'm sure the director was behind that 100%. This is, after all, aimed at the young audience. It's screaming, \\"I'm new, I'm fresh, I'm just like you!\\". Matthew MacFaden seems a little bored, to be honest. When he proposes the first time, it sounds like he's reading a phone book. Of course, I may be just comparing him to Firth because actually he and Knightley are good together. The real star here, though, is Tom Hollander. He play Mr. Collins in an entirely new way, a way nobody else had thought of. He is pitch perfect in his part and if you watch it for no other reason, watch it for him.<br /><br />[...]

0756686970|5.0|On a whim, I purchased this book for my son to enjoy reading about his LEGO Star Wars figurines.  Upon receipt, I thumbed through the pages and was totally blown away with the detailed pictures and fun and obscure facts that the publisher had put together in this compilation of LEGO SW history.<br /><br />I posted a few pictures above to illustrate some of the amazing detail this book has -- also note the entire list of figures listed in the two page table of contents.<br /><br />First off, the book is not too large, and could be easily carried around by a five year old.  It is hardcover and the glossy pages are printed on thick paper.  The colors in the pictures are lively and the layout of each page is very organized and easy to follow.  The publisher/authors definitely put a lot of thought into the presentation of each lego figure.  About 1/4 of the thickness of the book is taken up by a cardboard insert that holds the heroic scoundrel Han Solo.  He looks pretty clean cut and is wearing the medal given at the end of Episode IV by Princess Leia.  He even has Han's smirk on his face.  This figure is an exclusive to this book, so if you want to add him to your collection, you need to buy this book.<br /><br />Each individual figure is color classified into the episode they appear, as can be seen in the table of contents.  The figures are printed quite large, around 7-8 inches tall, with exceptional detail.  Droids are also included.  A small descriptive blurb is in the top corner of each page.  Then a \\"data file\\" box  will tell you which year, lego set#/name, # pieces, and # of variants of manufacture.  Lots of smaller white boxes point out all kinds of details about each and every figure, such as:<br />1)  \\"Stolen imperial binoculars hang from Han's torso\\" p. 92<br />2)  \\"On duty on Hoth, Leia wears her hair back in braids. This Lego hair piece is also seen on Leia in her Endor outfit (p.139)\\" p. 93<br />3)  \\"Lando's exclusive cape is blue on the outside and yellow on the inside. It is a status symbol that distinguishes him as  Baron Administrator of Cloud City.\\" p. 111<br />4)  \\"Yoda's head is made from rubber, like the Plo Koon (p.164), Kit Fisto (p.45) and classic Yoda (p.17) minifigures\\" p. 158<br />5)  \\"Only one other Lego astromech droid has a blue status display, R2Q2 (p.201)\\" p.46<br /><br />As can be read above, the book is quite good about cross-referencing pages to give the reader the ability to quickly find the same attribute in other figures.  When appropriate, a nice colorful picture of the actual Lego set from the whence the figure originates is also included.  Additional boxes also appear with pictures of variant figures including very rare figurines created for very specific events (like a bronze Bobba Fett).  At the end of book, an index is provided that lists ALL the lego set#'s the figure has ever appeared in.  You can then go to the Lego website to find the set (you must use the Holobrick archive, not regular search box):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I believe every single human, alien, and droid figure in the Lego Star Wars universe up to this point is included in this book -- even the obscure and very limited event specific ones.

1451629184|4.0|Jaycee Dugard, A STOLEN LIFE:  A MEMOIR, (New York:  Simon and Schuster, 2011), 273 pp.    June 10, 1991, was just another school day for 11-year-old Jaycee Lee Dugard in Tahoe, California.  She got up a little late to discover her mother had already left for work and had forgotten, once again, to kiss her \\"goodbye.\\"  She briefly thought about asking her stepfather for a ride to school but decided against it because she didn't want to make him mad.  Then after making her own breakfast and a PB&J sandwich for lunch, she set out for school on the path she normally walked.    She hadn't gone far at all when a man and woman in a car stopped, rolled down a window and asked for directions.  Suddenly the man's hand shot out the window so fast that Jaycee had no time to react.  He held something black in his hand.  It made a crackling noise.  Suddenly Jaycee felt paralyzed.  Quickly she was pushed into the car and covered with blankets.  Unable to move, she wondered what was happening.    This was the beginning of Jaycee's 18-year long struggle to survive in order that she might once again be reunited with her mother.  It was a struggle that was filled with years of mental and sexual abuse, two children fathered by her captor, the first born when Jaycee was only 14, and isolation.  Along with her children, she was kept in locked storage buildings or tents.      In essence, Jaycee's life was stolen from her.  Her education ended in the fifth grade.  She had no homecoming or senior prom.  There were no boyfriends.    And there was no hospital or other medical care when her daughters were born.  They were delivered by her captor.    After 18 years, the police finally arrested Phil and Nancy Garrido, Jaycee's captors.  Once free, Jaycee fought to have control over her life, a control she had not known previously.  So it is that she tells her own story in her own words.  It is a story of optimism, perseverance and survival.      The book was fairly well written, especially givenJaycee's academic limitations.  In the first half of the book the writing is similar to that of a young child.  In the latter half, as Jaycee matures, so does her writing style.  It was interesting and easy to read.  The book contains a few black and white pictures of Jaycee as a young child and one of her as an adult on the dust jacket.
0316287059|5.0|I'm a longtime fan of makeup, and I own multiple \\"how to\\" books-but Kevyn Aucoin's \\"Face Forward\\" leaves them all in the dust.  His transformations are simply amazing, and I've begun to use many of his suggestions in my daily routine.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves to play with makeup and wants to look flawless.
0439023491|5.0|AMAZING! That is how I would describe this book and so far the series. There are so many curve balls in the story that I really can't say much without revealing some, and I think it is best for everyone to find out themselves as they read the book. I still can't get over what has happened. My mind is reeling. I will say Katniss is having a hard time dealing with what happened in the games. Peeta is as well although he has found a kind of outlet to help him cope. Going through something like the sick and twisted Hunger Games will definitely change a person. How could it not? After a number of months, Peeta and Katniss have to go on tour, making speeches in each district, knowing that these people lost children in the games...some even by their hands. That's as far as I will go because after that things get intense and I don't want to give any away. Catching Fire will keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. If you haven't read this series then you should get started!
B00008CLOA|5.0|What's there really to say that hasn't been said a million times already?  This album is a classic.  Although I believe the original cover will always be the best, I like the new album art.  It is a shame that original recording engineer Alan Parsons was not included in the mixing of the remaster but it is still very good.  It definitely sounds cleaner then the 1992 CD release.  Every song is excellent.  The perfect mix of instrumentals and songs with vocals.  Who could forget the ever popular radio hit \\"Money\\" or the songs \\"Time\\", \\"Us And Them\\", or the less often but still commonly played back-to-back \\"Brain Damage\\" & \\"Eclipse.\\"  I love how every song fades into each other which is a common thing on many other Pink Floyd albums.  If you are planning on purchasing any Pink Floyd, I would definitely wait for the September 2011 remasters and then make your decision.  Whatever you do, you need this album in your collection!
0553801473|2.0|Seriously? For an author who (I thought) usurps Tolkien, this is a really poor work. Lots of moving pieces around and not much action. The thing that really attracted me about Martin's first books was the sense of danger, the overwhelming fear, the classic \\"people are too stupid/blind to know when things are about to implode,\\" etc. This book was just tiring. Do I recommend you read it? Yes - it's too important and good (still) a series to disregard but wow, this is really making us work. The last one or two better rock or it's going to be an incredible disappointment. Little hint, George - needs to be a little more bloodshed, a little more violence, a little more revenge, a little more tension (I can't believe I'm saying this to Tolkien, er, Martin).

0439023521|5.0|I FINALLY had the opportunity to read The Hunger Games, the first book in the series that everyone seems to be talking about. It is a favorite for many, and that now includes myself. North America is in ruins, but from those ruins arises Panem, a new nation, a capitol that is surrounded by 12 districts. At one time their were 13 districts but there was an uprising. After the Capitol quelled the rebellion and destroyed the 13th district they created the Hunger Games as a reminder to the people of just who was in control. There are 2 competitors from each district, one boy and one girl, who are chosen from a lottery. All the competitors are taken to a location where they are released and expected to kill each other off because there can only be one winner. All the while they are being filmed so that everyone can watch the bloodsport on their televisions. The winner will get a life of ease after the games and their district will be showered with gifts.<br />The story follows Katniss and her progression through the games. I instantly liked her character. She is intelligent and has a great survival instinct that gives the reader hope for her to win. I am going to have to immediately delve into Catching Fire, the second book in the series, to read what happens after the games. I sense a possible love triangle and am anxious to see how that pans out.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Fiance went & bought Star Wars complete trilogy on blu ray yesterday. WOULD NOT PLAY ON SAMSUNG BD-P1600!!!![[ASIN:B001TK3D4A Samsung BD-P1600 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player]]<br />We had to go buy a new Sony blu ray player to watch these movies.<br />When we originally tried to play them, a firmware update came up and we updated so that all features would be available.<br />After that, all we got was a red screen with yellow letters saying that the player was not compatible & needed to be updated while Samsung customer service said it was as updated as it could get.<br />Just wanted to let others know about this before you get really frustrated.<br />Customer Service at Samsung said that sometimes it takes a while to catch up to the new technology.<br />Considering Amazon has had this on pre-order availability for about a year.....you would think Samsung would be able to be ready for the release.<br />We are now a full-blown, anti-Sansung household.

B0011U5E1S|5.0|I like this CD for a two reasons.  Remastered sound and unreleased tracks.  People mistake the fact that nowhere on the package or inside does it say that it was a hits collection.  Looking at the tracklist you will notice that the song selections were indeed radio hits and one would think that is the case.  But actually, the soul reason for this compilation was that Courtney Love thought the song \\"You Know You're Right\\" was too good to put on the boxset to get lost with a bunch of poor sounding demos.  She was right, because indeed it is now a hit in it's own right.  It was also a chance to include the cancelled Scott Litt mix of the 1994 \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" single that was planned shortly before Kurt's death.  I do wish they'd have included the studio version of \\"All Apologies\\" but again, I can't complain because this was not intended to be a proper hits collection.  Buy it even if only for \\"You Know You're Right.\\"  You won't regret it!!!
B00123KDMO|5.0|Really \\"beefy.\\" If you like \\"Pretty Woman,\\" (you're a complete dork) you won't love this album. Their pinnacle, artistically. Crunch riffs, good vocals, straightforward themes - this made Van Halen into someone who could compete with Aerosmith but they lost it (presumably under label pressure) thereafter...yeah, \\"Hot for Teacher,\\" \\"Panama,\\" etc. rocks but they weren't the same after this album.

B0015DROBO|2.0|Very disappointing. Way too much narrative for me, with endless descriptions of many things that didn't add to the plot. A lack of dialog attributions and a poor translation from Swedish to English compound the problem, and make it difficult to read in places.  The plot weaves around, but not in a good way -- it's full of cliches, is way too predictable, and has serious problems with pacing -- plus some serious plot holes.<br /><br />I did like the girl from the title of the book, but I was disappointed to find that she plays a relatively small (though important) role.<br /><br />The book feels like a first draft; a few good ideas, but badly needing some polish.
B0011Z1BTW|5.0|The excellent sound quality and Jimmy Page adding the missing tracks to complete the entire 1973 Madison Square Garden show is amazing.

Also, look for the triple disc live album called \\"How The West Was Won.\\"

B005ETA5K2|2.0|When I first installed this adapter, I was thrilled because my signal from the network was so much stronger than previously. In fact, I could see 7 or 8 networks in the area that I was unaware of. Unfortunately, my XP laptop then evidenced signs of instability. It would freeze, the cursor would stop working and some programs would not open when double-clicked. This is especially apparent when the machine has been in standby or hibernation. I saw reviews on other sites attributing this to the Alfa software. I uninstalled this, and picked up the chipset drivers from the Realtek site. Although the Realtek software installed fine, it never gave me the signal strength out of the adapter that the Alfa software did.   I ended up keeping the adapter for one particular work location, where I am so far from the wireless router that I live with system instability in return for being able to connect. At other locations, I use the built-in adapter in the laptop. If you are planning on relying on the Alfa as your only network adapter on an XP machine, it would make sense to plan for the driver and memory conflicts that appear to be endemic to it.  Update: Blue Screen of Death!  Troubleshoot a problem with a device driver  You received this message because a device driver installed on your computer caused Windows to stop unexpectedly. This type of error is referred to as a \\"stop error.\\" A stop error requires you to restart your computer.  Once again, I downloaded the latest RTL8188RU driver from the Realtek site. This time, instead of installing the whole software package, I just updated the driver. As soon as I did, signal strength dropped by over 50%. I rolled back the driver, and signal strength increased. I am dropping my rating to two stars, and hope this problem will be rectified in future updates. (The driver update I used was from 29-July-2011.)

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am not buying this.    I've seen the changes Lucas has made to the film.  Sure, he \\"owns\\" the films, but a film is a group project, requiring hundreds of actors and artists, making decisions, creating moments that make the film.  When Lucas changes the film, he disrespects the creativity and work that went into making the film by the original cast and crew.    Furthermore, it disrespects my memory. I've grown up with Star Wars.  I was born on the day A New Hope came out.  I've seen the originals hundreds of times.  But the changes Lucas made has changed the films in rather significant ways that do not match up to why I love these films.    Sure, he has the \\"right\\" to change them, to \\"revise\\" them, but should he? The film was made for the audience to watch . . . and it was a generations that watched it.  By changing the film, he is alienating those generations.  He is changing our history.    *Waves hand/arm in a slight arch  Lucas, you want to release the original theatrical movies.
B001QUP5MQ|5.0|A beautiful work with exquisite music, Knopfler's typically poignant lyrics and great overall storytelling, this is one of my favorites. Why his post-Dire Straits work is not more often compared to singer/songwriters like Gordon Lightfoot surprises me. Plenty of other reviews detail the song list on 'The Ragpicker's Dream' so I won't recount them. This project would be a deal at twice the price, but you'd be crazy not to get it at $8. It is worth any number of stars, it just so happens that 5 is the limit here.
B00319ECGU|4.0|I know what you're thinking, did Clint do 4 Harry films or did he do 5? Well, to tell you the truth I had almost forgotten the last one, The Dead Pool, being it was the weakest of the bunch. But being this is a Blu-ray collection with picture and sound quality that will blow your head clean off, you have asked yourself one question: Should I buy it? Well should you, punk? The answer is, of course YES! So, here we go with the iconic Harry Callahan all here in one box on Blu-ray. From 1971 to 1988 Clint portrayed one of the most famous cops in film history. The no-nonsense, maverick, take-the-law-in-his-own-hands enforcer that did things his own way while pissing-off his superiors from the chief of police to the mayor. Always with a good line and a stellar aim with his .44 S&W Magnum, Harry always got the job done. Some looked at him as a hero, others looked at him as an out-of-control fascist. Regardless, either way we always cheered him on. We wouldn't want a Dirty Harry in real life, but we love having him on the big screen. Let's take a brief look at these five classics:<br /><br />Dirty Harry (1971) *****<br /><br />After serious considerations for Paul Newman, Frank Sinatra and Steve McQueen (who all turned it down), the studios finally went for Clint. As usual, the first is generally considered the best and that rule certainly applies here. Stylishly directed by Don Siegel with some amazing camera work and editing for maximim impact, we follow Harry as he pursues the psychotic Scorpio serial killer (loosely based on the real life Zodiac killer) beautifully played by the unknown Andy Robinson who himself was a pacifist and was rather uncomfortable with this role. The film was controversial for it's tackling of issues like the conflict between the perpetrator's rights AND the victim's rights. Violent crime was going rampid in 1971, and this film fit right in. Smith and Wesson Model 29 .44 magnum sales went through the roof after this came out. Some critics (most notably snotty New Yorker critic Pauline Kael) called the film a glorification of fascism. No matter, it was a huge hit and escalated Clint's career.<br /><br />Magnum Force (1973) ***<br /><br />The first sequel was somewhat weak and overlong. Directed by Ted Post with a screenplay co-written by future Apocalypes Now screenwriter John Milius AND future Deer Hunter writer/director Michael Cimino, Harry goes up against cops you would think he would condone, vigilantes who are simply blowing away as many known criminals as they can. Nope, not a chance. Harry may hate the system, but he'll stick with it. It's an interesting plot and it does hold you, but unfortunately it pretty much falls apart towards the end involving a rather silly chase scene with Harry on a motorcycle riding around on an old aircraft carrier. Still, there's plenty to enjoy with some good comical bits like Harry posing as an airline pilot to handle some hijackers and a very young Suzanne Sommers taking her top off exposing her nuptials in a pool scene before having a cap popped in her. Also veteran actor Hal Holbrook does a good turn as Harry's adversarial boss Lt Briggs. Regardless of it's shortcomings, it still ended up one of the biggest hits of that year.<br /><br />The Enforcer (1976) ****1/2<br /><br />Now this one is more like it. A good taut storyline with Harry going up against a group called The People's Revolutionary Strike Force (loosely inspired by the infamous Symbionese Liberation Army that kidnapped Patty Hearst) that kidnap the mayor for ransom. But the real clincher for this installment is Harry having to deal with a new partner he doesn't want, an inexperienced female! Played by a pre-Cagney and Lacey Tyne Daly, the two play off each other terrficly. Harry just wants to avoid her as much as possible while she just keeps tagging along constantly grating his nerves. Feminism at this time was hitting a peak and it doesn't exactly sit well with our Harry. But sexist as he may be, thetwo eventually warm-up to each other. Also of note, this is the final bow for John Michum's (Robert's younger brother) Inspector Frank DiGiorgio, Harry's occasional partner and best friend in the previous entries, he will be missed.<br /><br />Sudden Impact (1983) ****<br /><br />Clint decided to take the directing reins on this one and the result is almost as good as The Enforcer, but not quite. My only real beef with this one is the presence of Sondra Locke. By this time I was getting pretty tired of seeing her in Clint's films. I never thought she was all that good of an actress or all that attractive, she looks anemic. Locke plays the victim of a gang rape and is out for revenge against the perps in the small fictional town of San Paulo. Harry has his hands full enough dealing with mafia goons out to wack him as well as trying to solve the murders in this little peaceful town. The real scene stealer in this film involves local \\"madame\\" Ray Parkins, played to the hilt by Audrie Neenan (Law and Order: SVU), you've never seen a more wicked bitch in your life! You have the usual Harry shannanigans of him up against young hoods, rednecks and hitmen and not to mention his superiors. And let's not forget that this is where that iconic line \\"Go ahead, make my day!\\" came from. Look fast for a young Camryn Manhiem from the hit show The Practice in an elevator scene. This is also the swan-song for African-American actor Albert Popwell who had a good run in all the previous Harry films playing a bank robber, a pimp who's weapon of choice is Drano, a Black militant and finally here in a switch as a good guy fellow cop.<br /><br />The Dead Pool (1988) **<br /><br />Without a doubt the weakest of them all. I seriously wouldn't have complained if this one wasn't included in this set. Clint appears to be tired of playing this role and more or less sleepwalks through it. By this time the big screen has been taken up by the likes of John McClane and Martin Riggs among others that probably wouldn't be around if weren't for our Harry. The plot is basically a film buff serial killer who has his crosshairs on Harry. Once again Harry is struck with a rather unusual partner he's reluctant to have, a Jackie Chan type martial arts kicking Asian-American. Despite the shortcomings of this entry, there is one scene that just about makes up for all the flaws. Yes, I'm talking about the most wacked-out car chase you'll ever see. Harry and his partner are pursued by a car rigged with plastic explosives. The twist is this is a radio controlled toy! No doubt this is a wacky send-up to the famous 1968 Steve McQueen Bullitt chase. Both cars fly over the hills of San Francisco with grace and ease and it never lets up. It's silly and farfetched, but it is fun to watch.<br /><br />Well, that's basically it for this 17 year journey in Harry Callahan's career. This set is well packaged with plenty of extras. Documentaries galore going over the making of the films, the impact they had on the then cultural and political climate and how they influenced many of today's filmmakers. Picture quality is generally very good with these aging films, except for Magnum Force. That particular film has not been to well preserved for some reason. Colors are washed out with some excessive grain showing. Soundwise the 5.1 mixes kick in better than I've heard them before. And checkout the audio commentaries, you won't find Clint here, but Milius, Schickel and others give you some good insight. All in all a good buy for 5 films, and definitley worthy for Clint completists. So go ahead, make your day and buy it....PUNK!ote, this is the final bow for John Michum's (Robert's younger brother) Inspector Frank DiGiorgio, Harry's occasional partner and best friend in the previous entries, he will be missed.

B005DZMODI|4.0|Any accolades I would add about the talent represented in this CD would be totally superfluous.  My biggest treat on this album has to be the rendition of Layla.  Not on the original playlist, it was suggested by bassist Carlos Hernrequez, and, as per the liner notes, was \\"arranged as a Crescent City dirge/swing\\".  It is, in my opinion, the highlight of this enjoyable album and becomes, to me, the definitive version of the classic.  This 9 minute song is, by itself, worth the price of admission.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Like so many others, I pre-ordered this edition back in January of 2011 with great anticipation.  Given the large data capacity of the blu ray disc, it never occurred to me that Mr. Lucas would NOT include the original theatrical versions of Episodes IV-VI  alongside the \\"improved\\" editions.  While I respect Mr. Lucas's right to manipulate his property, I will not give him my hard earned money for this version of these beloved movies from my childhood.  Call me a nerd, call me a geek, call me an old timer.  All I want are the original versions we saw in the theaters.  Mr. Lucas, maybe if enough of us return or cancel our orders, you will reconsider this ill-conceived release.  I'd gladly pay more for the original versions alongside your updated ones in one giant set.  Amazon... you'll be receiving my return shortly.

Sure, we'd love to think that working hard and persevering to get our product on the market will always lead to success, many times we fail.  The author states learning from the mistakes is key to becoming more successful in business. I, for one, can attest to that.  I wish I could have known that in 2003. wink wink. I could write my own book about that year. But I digress.    Entrepreneurs and boardroom-fixtures alike will enjoy this journey that, at times, perfectly embodies the feeling that many of us have had at the start of new ventures. The advice contained within, is both useful and flawed (can't wait for a follow-up novel to finish up Eric's writings in chapter eight.    Recommended read for those that are neck-deep in a new endeavor within today's economic backdrop.
0345472322|5.0|Mindset was highly recommended to me by several people I really respected.  It did not disappoint.  Although Carol Dweck makes her point in the beginning of the book, she has some fascinating research that answered a number of questions I have had about why things happened they way they did.  As an educator, I was drawn to the chapters that focused on how this may help my school in a practical way; however, I have been using the examples from the other chapters to promote the book to my colleagues.  I was so taken by the book that I purchased one for every member of my school staff, including my secretaries, and for my PTO Board.  I am looking forward to the conversations they will generate in the coming year.

I would have said, are you kidding me, a 930 page paperback...no way in hell!  Instead, I discovered it at my Borders which was closing.  Wow! Although I am in my 7th decade, what I know about India is minimal. What author Gregory has taught me is first-hand, compelling insight into modern day India at all of its caste levels. He moves openly and sensitively from the entrepreneurial lepers at the bottom \\"up\\" to the mega-billionaires who travel the planet with or without any sense of moral obligation for their investments.  Today, reading the NYT at home in St. Louis, I see an in-depth article about corruption in a 200 million populated state, Uttar Pradesh.  $2 billion invested by the national government into health care, apparently, is being corrupted through political customs and greed.  However, the clinic that Gregory had started in a 25,000 residential slum worked on a first-aid kit and common sense treating rat bites on children, for example, successfully.  He is walking in Mother Theresa's sandals...for awhile but yields to his earlier life of crime and money in search of, call it love, satisfying an insatiable hunger.  Make it a movie, yes, but only with sufficient time and money to capture the breadth and depth of India today.  Mr. Gregory, thank you for stopping your way of life long enough to bring this book to life.
0240815807|5.0|Mike Senior covers all aspects of mixing, A through Z, in excellent clarity and objectivity. His colorful, witty humor dabbles the pages making for a chuckle-inducing reading experience. But what I found this resource to be so effective at is that Mike establishes clear objective processes and decisions to be made during mixing that yield reproducible results, as well as describing any potential negative side-effects of each mixing decision. This is most definitley the core of this book and exactly what places it apart from other resources. Be prepared to learn everything from acoustic room treatment, to proper vocal compression, to multi-band dynamics. I believe this is THE best resource for the beginner and intermediate producer/mixing engineer looking to start mixing with results, or more specifically, looking to mix totally objectively. This book changed the way I approach my mixes, giving me direction and confidence in knowing when my levels are at the right spot, understanding how to combat mono compatibility problems, and learning how to effectively employ reverb and delay effects to create space and density for my instruments, all whilst keeping the negative side-effects of said processes to a minimum.
B004WR125O|5.0|I'm using it with an Onkyo TX-8050 receiver. It worked as expected with my DLINK DIR-825 wireless router. 82% signal strength through two walls and a floor (wood construction) to reach my DIR-825 in the basement.    Please remember to upgrade the Onkyo TX-8050 receiver firmware. The 07/14/2001 update includes improvements to UWF-1 connectivity. I did this before I listened to any music source. The USB stick upgrade instructions where simple to follow and worked first time.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Quirky.  If possible, I'd throw in an extra half star- I did enjoy the story in this book quite a lot.      A future where people are so wrapped up in a virtual reality game, that most people choose to live in it- The OASIS- rather than the real world that surrounds them, because the real world has become such a lost, depressing, and depressed place isn't that far-fetched.  In the OASIS you can be anyone you want to be, build relationships, go to school, even build your own planet if your resources allow... of course, the fact that most of the OASIS is fixated on the 1980's is the catch, and it's amusing (& tiring at times).      When the real game starts- the hunt for Halliday's Egg- to gain control of the entire OASIS, the action begins & the story takes off.  What makes this story fun- particularly to those of us pop culture vultures- is it's unending references to all things 80's, is also is its downfall.  Fun at first, it tends to drag it down toward the end.  I could live without the blow by blow recaps of some movie scenes that I, too, know by heart or the complete history of some video games that I frankly didn't care that much about.      This book was essentially a love note to the 80's with a little sci-fi story thrown in for fun.  So if you loved the 80's, it will definitely make you smile.  If, however, John Hughes, leg warmers, & Sarah Jessica Parker in her dorkier days make you break out in hives- you might want to skip this one.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|My subject says it all. Childish at best, still not worth a download ....even free. C'mon developers let's see some innovation.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|The reality is, the problems extant here didn't begin with this release.  Often ignored is the fact that there were DOZENS of changes to the movies over the twenty years following their initial theatrical releases (prior to the 1997 special edition).  They were non-invasive, mostly sound related, and did nothing to add or detract. Nobody got bent out of shape about these production edits, because they were mostly imperceptible and not impactful whatsoever to the story.  Admittedly, we all scratched our heads when George began modifying the original trilogy back in the mid-90's.  It felt strange to alter a story that was so well-defined and coherent, not to mention already ingrained into our collective consciousness.    But while those 1997 re-do's certainly generated plenty of controversy within the fanbase, there were some gem moments that really made the films pop again.  The new scene with Jabba was a terrific addition, because it added to the story and clarified character relationships.  Even the ever-hated \\"Han shot first\\" change was somewhat understandable, as it did nothing to take away from Han being a badass (he still shot Greedo at point blank range, after all) - it just meant Han wasn't a flat out murderer.  Certainly the extensive rework on the sound, the cleanup of bad special effects remnants, and the addition of gorgeous new scenery, ships, and environments was something to be applauded.  So even while the hardcore fans cried foul, I found the Special Editions to be a generally ok upgrade to the originals.    Unfortunately though, this is where the cracks in the wall began.  In the Special Editions we also got our first taste of something we'd end up getting in spades with Phantom Menace... cheesy, poorly placed, poorly timed, and poorly delivered comedy.  The added shot in ANH of the Jawa being bucked off his mount at Mos Eisley is supposed to be funny, but is unnecessary and adds nothing.  The extended band segment in Jabba's palace in ROTJ (the most egregiously bad decision of the 1997 Special Edition) feels grossly out of place, and brings silliness rather than feelings of danger, uneasiness, and foreboding.  It undermines the story that is about to unfold - or at the very least, fails to help set it up properly.    Everyone knows the prequel trilogy is filled with this bad comedy problem - personified, of course, in the character of Jar Jar Binks - but there's more to it than just that.  Why is a line like, \\"You came in that thing?  You're braver than I thought\\" a hundred times more funny than anything in the prequel trilogy?  Timing, context, delivery, and not having that feeling of being set up and forced.  Throughout the prequel trilogy, bad comedy decisions coupled with dozens of insincere and stiff performances leave one repeatedly asking \\"THAT was the best take on that scene??\\". It demonstrates that George is losing sight of what makes a great scene - or even great delivery of a few lines. The fact that he would ok the ROTS scene with Vader screaming that awful \\"Noooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" is proof enough of that.  Imagine the difference if that had been simply a cry of defeat, reflecting a moment of immeasurable blinding anguish and pain.  Instead, it was laughable and became an internet meme.  I was embarrassed for Anakin, not sorry for him!     The 2004 DVD editions once again focused on improving sound and fixing issues - although as many know, the color of these editions was quite poor.  Again, fanboys fumed about some of the changes to ROTJ in particular, but they were generally in line with trying to tie the prequels together more effectively, which I can understand.    As we arrive at these new BluRay editions, it's worth pointing out that they're BEAUTIFUL.  SW has never looked this good, period.  It was a good idea to replace the Yoda puppet in Phantom Menace with CG, as it never looked quite right.  Most of the other changes are incidental and add value.  But the addition of Vader's \\"No. Noooo!\\" in ROTJ undermines a wondrous moment in cinema.  That close up on Vader's mask as he watches his son being tortured requires NO EXPOSITION.  We can see the inner turmoil and mental reconciliation all culminating in the moment he takes action to save his son.  But now, poorly placed dialog - the greatest failing of the prequel trilogy - is thrust upon the original trilogy.  True, the average viewer doesn't know or care that it used to be better... but these two stars are for George, who has lost the ability to write dialog and is making things worse with each additional release of these wonderful films.
0553801473|5.0|This was a truly great new book in the Game of Thrones series, especially after the lackluster A Feast for Crows (the 4th book).  While not much happened (at least with our favorite chabracters) in A Feast for Crows, in A Dance with Dragons we see alot of Tyrion, Jon Snow,and Danyerys, Theon etc ( though not enough of Jamie Lannister).  And while there aren't any slow parts in this book, at many times while reading it, I thought to myself, \\"wow\\", not only is this guy a great fantasy writer, he is a great writer in general, bloody brilliant.  So far 4 of the 5 Game of Thrones books could be considered works of art.  The only tough thing is waiting a long time till they come out.  As it is, A Dance with Dragons has inspired me to loop back around to the beginning of the series to revisit how the characters were at the beginning of their journey.  At any rate, look out book number six, here come the Others!
B003LXXEFG|5.0|Fantastic album, but if your reading this chances are you already know this. Great deal with Amazon, best place to buy digital music in a market where everyone is competing on the cloud.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I really wanted to purchase this set, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Unfortunately both directors saw fit to mess with their movies post-release and neither is getting my money.   The DVD versions of the original trilogy are going for over $100 here on Amazon. The Blu Ray versions of the modified movies are going for $80, and that is all six movies! Seems the people have spoken quite clearly, produce a Blu Ray version of the originals!!!!
B004SRWW0C|5.0|There are other applications you can use, but this one is a must have if you are serious about it. Love it, and thank you Amazon for having the best deal on it!

B0050SYS5A|1.0|This product does not work! I've tried it above and below my tv without any luck. Hand tracking is particularly a problem now. Also, conceptually the device is flawed. It does not add any additional functional space for Kinect play, it only zooms in on the player. I can't see this helping in alleviating any space issues a person could have. In addition to the above, it left tiny scratches on the Kinect even with the protective film applied. I would not recommend this to anyone looking to extend their play space or to those using it for shooting games like Child of Eden or Gunstringer.
1401310400|4.0|This is a fun book, but only if you've watched the series.  It cannot stand on its own without the show. But since I like the show, and know what's going on, I enjoyed the book too.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The stale and lifeless special effects of the 1970's may have dazzled fans then but today they would fall flat on a more expereinced audience.  In the era of CGI, would you accept a puppet espousing universal wisdom or wooden and stiff sword fighting?  Of course not.    George Lucas delivers to the fans, old and young, new and veteran, freshly polished and retuned trilogies.  The new krayt dragon call is clearer and more chilling despite the scoffs of so called \\"fans.\\"  The scene of Vader defeating the Emperor has been improved and now linked to the end of the \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" almost like the meter of an epic poem.    Improved audio and increased clarity with vibrant colors are to be expected with a Blu-Ray release.  What makes this a \\"must buy\\" is this is a re-telling of an already masterful story.    A star off because of the packaging.  It's too filmsy and I have to imagine a future released will have something more sturdy.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|This book suffers from the fact that the first two were so brilliant. It's in their shadow, but it's still definitely worth the read as it ties up loose ends.
0553807919|4.0|Books like these are very powerful in content, because in this case, it's a book that was written to help struggling parents (in other words, every parent!) to deal with the every day problems of their children.  These problems are often the problems of parents because they need to some how deal with tantrums, wide varying moods, and many other every day problems that a developing child may experience.    In this age of video games, the authors of this book are trying to teach adults how to develop their children into \\"whole-brain people\\".  So, the first self-help is the parent trying to retrain their thinking and their general ways of parenting to first recognize the state of the child during the problem periods and then apply the 12 advertised steps to help both the child and parents to work through the every day challenges that create these mood swings etc..  This is where the \\"we-help\\" comes in to play.  At this point, it really becomes group therapy with only the help of the techniques in the book.  Finally, given enough time and experience with these techniques, the child actually has the ability to self-regulate through the myriad of problems they face happily developing into an emotionally healthy child and then adult.    So, this all sounds good, is there a catch?    Well, the authors assume that the parents have the perception and sensitivity to handle this kind of advice and methodology.  The \\"whole brain\\" goal involves the successful transition from a lower brain (highly emotional mostly reactive) response to an upper brain processing of the situation.  This upper brain processing mainly involves finding ways to \\"center\\" the child so they aren't stuck in terrible psychological state.  Sounds easy, however, most parents are highly emotional themselves when they face these kinds of problems in their children.  So the first question becomes \\"Can the parent find a way to move from their lower brain response to an upper brain handling of the situation?\\".  This is a lot to ask of the average every day parent who is trying to do this on their own with no professional training.  It really takes a special individual to sense, react, and then provide a control mechanism to correctly change a situation.  Fortunately, most of the advice and methods really are based on common sense approaches and in my opinion, not so revolutionary as the title suggests.  The explanation of the workings of the brain really reinforce what common sense would dictate.  This makes the book usable for a wider audience.  The part that is \\"revolutionary\\" really involves teaching your children self-awareness techniques that provide models that represent extremes and re-centering techniques.  Although the pictures are new, re-centering is a very old concept.    With all that said, why 4 stars?    I believe that it's important to go back to fundamentals and bring to conscious thought the things that are lingering and sometimes drive emotions and states into a bad state.  Although this might sound like psycho-babble to some, and even put the person at risk that they might be misdiagnosing a problem, and subsequently making their child's situation worse, the thinking emotional parent has a shot at simplifying and doing some real good.  The book was almost three stars for its general usability, but I believe that people that aren't into \\"self-help\\" books in the first place won't have any interest.    Finally, the book is fairly readable, including some theory of brain that is simplified to the point of general understanding.  Some concepts are a bit murky due to a poor organization.  In particular, the authors start by going into a right brain / left brain discussion.  This completely abandoned after the first ten or so pages and then never explained relative to the remainder of the book that favored a lower brain / upper brain model.  Mainly, is the upper brain both left and right, and if so, is the process of transitioning your child from lower to upper right to upper left?  Or something else completely?  The authors never explain.    Who is the right audience for this book?    Someone who pauses in the self-help section of the bookstore.  Someone who is open-minded and is willing to open themselves up for change.  Someone who can translate slightly convoluted common sense approach revolutionary ideas (namely the book) into practice.   Someone with a problem child and just doesn't have any other idea on how to handle difficult behaviors.

Thousands of passionate re-enactors help make this partial recreation of the pivotal Civil War battle a rousing experience for viewers.

0790740443|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I know a lot of people don't like the theme, but if you consider Hitler and other people of that type, you can see how such an idea for such a negative soilder might develop - which is a good premise for a sci-fi type of theme. It should be interesting to the army buff or sci-fi buffs.
B005974CNA|5.0|I'm assuming a \\"Dramatic Turn of Events\\" refers to losing Mike Portnoy's driving influence that lead DT to<br />it's current status as the one of the premier Progressive Metal band's in history. The Dramtic Turn doesn't<br />seem to have effected the band at all in my humble opinion. This album is good or better than any other. If you<br />loved DT before you'll love them as much or better without Portnoy!
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|I really can't understand how John Lasseter thought this was a worthy follow-up to a wonderful movie like the first Cars.  I think that movie gets a lot of undeserved flack, but this one deserves every bit of it.    The premise alone worried me quite a bit.  A movie about simple life values given a sequel as a spy movie?  It doesn't work as a James Bond parody.  It doesn't work as a comedy.  It just flat out doesn't work.  Once in the theater was too much.  No way will I be buying it on BR or DVD.    Only thing that saves it from getting one star was the final chase sequence, which was fairly entertaining, but definitely not worth the first parts.
B001G70M6S|4.0|Since there is a very limited selection of people making this film, it's great that Fuji makes a high quality film for the old 100 series pack cameras. I think that the Impossible Project is making film for them, but you will pay twice as much or more. The black and white images come out beautifully and beat digital pictures any day.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the price. It's about a dollar a shot, but still a great film for those of us who love these cameras.   As for the construction, the tab breaks a lot on the safety cover. So be careful when pulling this one. Pull it toward you and go slow at first and don't yank. Then when it is out a bit, pull it straight to the left. Their color film is also great.
1439183392|5.0|I've read the other reviews and don't have much to add.  Winslow is maybe my favorite writer working today and \\"The Gentlemen's Hour\\" is one of his three best.  \\"Savages\\" is more high octane.  \\"Power Of The Dog\\" is more epic.  But \\"The Gentlemen's Hour\\" is a page-turner par excellence.  Read \\"The Dawn Patrol\\" first, to get familiar with the characters.  It's very good, but not as good as \\"The Gentlemen's Hour\\", which is also going to make a terrific movie.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am a newly discovered Nicholas Sparks fan.  Safe Haven was a gift on my Kindle; first noval I read of Nicholas Sparks and must say, I am now hooked on his writings.  This noval is easy read and does capture the reader and draws you into the plot.  I like the way Sparks introduced the main characters with such depth yet leaving you wondering more; and then when the plot hightened, it was written with the characters being alternated through chapters.   This story demonstrates the beautiful power of true-forever love & shows how life continues on.   I would most certainly recommend this story to others.  Now, I am ready to settle in with my Kindle for . . .another Nicholas Sparks noval: The Lucky One!  Happy Reading . . .

1609611543|5.0|This book is a wonderful read!  After going gluten free last May, I realized first hand how sick wheat made me.  This book showed me numerous studies that prove it and was written by a doctor.  I have 100% health improvement since getting rid of the toxic effects of wheat.  I was very underweight as a result of eating a high grain diet and gained a wanted 6 lbs going gluten free.  I did not read this book as a weight loss idea. I belong to several independent online groups that are gluten free and  most people are overweight and going gluten free allows them to lose it.  Word to the wise,  you MUST read labels on food.  Things you would never think of have wheat in them.  Eating out will almost always give you a dose of wheat.  Stick to the outside part of the store and eat at home!  I also got rid of anything in my food I couldn't pronounce or tell you what it was...no MSG or any other crap!  Try it for 30 days and don't cheat!  I'm sure nearly everybody will see a big improvement in their life!  I believe wheat is the root cause for most of our illness in this country.  Everything from cancer to acne.

B004EPZ09S|3.0|CONTAGION, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is an intensely frightening look at what really could happen should a new and unidentified virus begin to spread globally.  Unfortunately, it's not a very successful film.  What makes it work is its documentary-style script, which takes viewers through the spread of the virus, the reaction of both governments and everyday people, and the fear that ends up possessing the world.  What makes it unsuccessful is actually the same thing - the documentary style of the film makes it almost impossible to become emotionally connected to any of the characters, most of which are played by people we know and want to care about.  Because Soderbergh keeps us so detached from his characters, CONTAGION never quite jells as a truly gripping thriller.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow plays Beth Emhof, whose business trip to Hong Kong ends up infecting her (and a lot of other people) with a mysterious and deadly virus.  Her husband Mitch (Matt Damon), back home in Minneapolis, is inexplicably immune to the disease, and his horror at what happens to his wife and young step-son is palpable and gut-wrenching.  Unfortunately, we see so little of Mitch (and even less of Beth) that it's hard to stay connected.  Kate Winslet plays CDC doctor Erin Mears, and for a while we get caught up in her race to unravel the mysteries of this terrible virus.  But the film jumps so methodically from Dr. Mears to her boss, Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne), to World Health Organization investigator Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) - and it's hard to keep up, much less get invested in these characters.  On top of that, there's a very involved sub-plot about a self-serving Internet journalist (Jude Law) who mouths off about unsavory political connections between the CDC/WHO and the pharmaceutical companies, while he's trying to push a homeopathic remedy that could make him a multi-millionaire.  There's also a kidnapping plot, lots of scenes of people gone amok, and a very quick resolution to the virus that is neither comprehensible nor particularly satisfying.<br /><br />Parts of CONTAGION are downright mesmerizing, and there's no doubt Soderbergh knows how to push the panic buttons of moviegoers already worried about H1N1, AIDS, and the latest strain of flu.  I just wanted to feel more of a connection to Damon's Mitch, or Winslet's Erin Mears, or Fishburne's Cheever, or Cotillard's Leonora.  Soderbergh ends CONTAGION with the kind of lack of closure that will either infuriate its audience or confirm the ultimate reality of its subject matter.  Don't expect to find out what happens to everyone . . . or anyone, for that matter.  Then again, maybe Soderbergh did us all a favor by keeping us distanced from his characters and not allowing us to actually wrap our proverbial arms around them.  It's easier to forget about them that way.  And this is definitely a film you won't want to keep thinking about in the wee hours of the morning.y quick resolution to the virus that is neither comprehensible nor particularly satisfying.

B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Before I get to the movie, a couple of points I think worthy of mention.<br />First of all, if like me you are one of the people trying to embrace the new 3D wave, and have shelled out for the equipment to do so, it's a shame that you cannot buy a bare bones 3D version of the film.<br />DVD and now Blu-Ray have always given the choice it seems of a standard 1 disc release, and then a 2 or 3 disc \\"special edition\\" with bonus features etc.<br />While these are nice to have, it's harsh to have to shell out for the 3D release, with 4 discs, if you have no need for the other copies, perhaps this will change as 3D becomes more mainstream and affordable.<br /><br />Secondly, watching this movie demonstrates the huge disparity or broad width of the PG-13 rating, with the exception of a few scary images, this film has no sex, no bad language, very little to offend, and the violence is stylized and succinct. One wonders how a movie like this, which I was happy to watch with younger children (7 & 9) after seeing myself first, has the same rating as something like the Twilight franchise? Perhaps this deserved less, others more or we need a middle rating in between?<br /><br />Anyway, the movie itself.<br /><br />Both the 3D version specifically and the BD version in this set have phenomenal pictures and sound, the opening part of the movie is quite darkly lit, but that is nothing to do with the reproduction here. The 3D is also nicely done, controlled like Avatar, without the director feeling the need to throw things out of the screen all the time and say \\"this is 3D!\\" like the rather ridiculous \\"Drive Angry\\".<br /><br />The story is an old and has been well told in many formats over the years, young petulant and headstrong Thor get's on the wrong side of his father the King, thanks to some back stabbing connivance by younger brother Loki, and ends up on Earth, to find himself, and learn humility, sacrifice and how to be a king, not just a warrior.<br />The action is well interspersed and the movie moves at a nice pace, plenty of eye candy, some humor, and enough references to the upcoming Avengers flick next year to keep the comic book fans happy.<br />That said, and to reiterate the comments of others, this is a stand alone movie, whether you are familiar with the comics, Norse legends or not, and is well directed by Kenneth Branagh.<br />Good old fashioned storytelling it is, the movie opens strong, builds well, and ends satisfyingly, with enough of a crack in the door for a sequel, or to whet your appetite for the upcoming  aforementioned Avengers movie.<br />Heroes, villains, battles, betrayal, loyalty, and action abound, even the love interest is tastefully handled and compliments the story.<br />I for one was very impressed with relative newcomer Chris Hemsworth (I don't really count his cameo at the beginning on the Star Trek remake) and think he will definitely be one to watch.<br />5 stars for great entertainment, relax and enjoy with the whole family, just remember some of the scary stuff will be too much for very young viewers probably.lenty of eye candy, some humor, and enough references to the upcoming Avengers flick next year to keep the comic book fans happy.   That said, and to reiterate the comments of others, this is a stand alone movie, whether you are familiar with the comics, Norse legends or not, and is well directed by Kenneth Branagh.

I for one was very impressed with relative newcomer Chris Hemsworth (I don't really count his cameo at the beginning on the Star Trek remake) and think he will definitely be one to watch.  5 stars for great entertainment, relax and enjoy with the whole family, just remember some of the scary stuff will be too much for very young viewers probably.
B0055S348W|4.0|Got this as the free app  of the day. One of the best free app of the day (Thanks Amazon and PrinterShare!). My wifi printer Lexmark x6675 did not get recognized for nearby printing. I tried the nearby printing from windows. Super simple setup and I was printing stuff right away. Definitely worth the money if you ever like to print stuff stored on the phone.
B0055S348W|3.0|found my kodak printer on WiFi. everything sets up but when I hit print it just goes into  sending 100% loop. never prints. really could have used this.  Don't know if it works with pc assist. I will continue to work on this. possible issue on my equipment not ap. has too many good reviews to be the ap.  great value for free.

B002LVUKIS|3.0|If you have updated your computer since the first and second Thief games came out, you could be in danger of the original 2 not playing on your current system. There are ways to twink your settings in order to play them, but is it really worth it? Not being a computer genius I am leery of doing such things. Especially since I plan on playing other games and not just the original Thief exclusively.

B000XAR2EE|5.0|Ok so it is not \\"blue-ray\\" and I am sure there will be a re-release of this set when they decide to convert the movies to that format, but as it stands this is a great way to get these movies in 1 package.
B0055S348W|5.0|The only thing I can say is get this app.  I tried several other apps that were supposed to do what this app DOES.  The other cheaper/free apps I tried barely worked if at all.  This is the premier \\"print from your phone app.\\"  Highly recommended!
B00130UFY2|5.0|Think Jason Bourne as James Bond on steroids minus the slow parts, the middle age sex and Q.  The Bourne Ultimatum is third in the trilogy featuring the renegade killer agent Matt Damon as Jason Bourne who is both running towards and from the CIA agency that trained him and is trying to kill him. If you are unfamiliar with the two earlier films in the trilogy featuring Jason Bourne, you might want to see them first. Otherwise you are in for a very fast, technically superior cinematic roller coaster. Take nothing for granted and have plenty of coffee on hand to keep up with the frenetic pace. Matt Damon is made for the lead role and there is convincing acting support and cutting edge direction across the board. Repeat viewing also helps in order to follow the full nuances of the plot, action and frequent switches of world locations and is well worth the effort. The Bourne Ultimatum is an exhilarating exiting ride of a movie that leaves you wanting more. 5 stars.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|it's a lot of fun I would definitely recommend this app to people who like to play puzzle type games
B00012BSHG|5.0|I got this to use strictly inside as a ball pit. We have carpet, and it doesn't get dragged around, so it's in a stable place. We filled it with 200 or so balls, some stuffed animals and other soft things. Every so often I find something like those monkeys from the barrel and I take them out, just out of fear of rupturing the thing. I would suggest getting something to blow this up, electric if you can, this thing requires a lot of air. The best part about this is that it's bottom is also inflatable, and therefore cushioned. Like anything, it's lifespan is limited to what you do to it. I keep it in my daughter's room (she's 18 months, and she can BARELY climb in and out of it on her own), but my 6 year old son jumps in it as well (and his friends) and so far no issues. We are pleased with it, it has held up after a few months and has lost no air. I looked at quite a few, bought another from Walmart (that lasted 1 day and cost me more), and this was the best that I could find.
B004N66XYE|4.0|One simply cannot compare a series that lasted for five years to one that is three hours long. There cannot be the depth of character, the slow unraveling of plotlines, or the in-depth exploration of the political and social mores of the times in just three one-hour episodes! Instead, it's a quicker paced, more superficial glance at the doings at 165 Eaton Place, with a background that's painted in broad strokes. More of an impressionist painting than an old world masterpiece.<br /><br />BUT ... that's not to stay it isn't a wonderful show!  IT IS! There is top quality acting, writing, set design, costume -- everything we've come to expect from the best of British period dramas. Taken on its own, it would have garnered far more positive reviews. It is only when the inevitable comparisons are made to the original that this \\"Up-Down-Lite\\" suffers.<br /><br />It's true. You'd can't go home again -- particularly when \\"home\\" is 165 Eaton Place. But I have to admit I enjoyed the short visit!
B0036JU6CY|4.0|This could only have been better with Chuck Norris.  Awesome, rocking action with not a lot of complex dialog or deep storyline to slowdown the tempo.  It looks like a demanding line of work and 100lbs of gold strikes me as a bargain for the services of these ninjas.  If you like action movies you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />- Ninjaluva4eva
0553801473|3.0|Seriously, whenever Martin runs out of ideas, another Stark must die. At least, that's how it seems, but since we likely wont know the outcome of that particular scenario within this book for the next 5 to 10 years while we wait for book six, i simply make this plea to G.M. while he writes, lol.<br />Anyway, this was definitely better than a Feast for Crows, but was not on par with the first three books in my opinion. It feels like he waited too long to write this, and there was a bit of broken continuity, and a rush to resolve things. For example, he spends A LOT of time in Winterfell, but at the end, he glosses over what would seem to be some very important events by simply having a letter sent via crow basically detailing the situation. I think the time between books worked against MArtin.<br />Anyway, there are more than a thousand reviews here already, but i just thought i would put my own take out there. It wasnt a horrible book, but it also didnt wow me. Since it is over 1000 pages, you would think it would be a bit more gripping. I dont know what has happened with the series, but it is dragging its feet right now.<br />You're obviously going to read this book, but there isnt really any hurry, and for me at least, it was a three star area. Just okay.
B005974CNA|5.0|Many people feel like DT has started to get stale with the last few releases.  This album feels like it was made to address that concern.  A Dramatic Turn of Events is the most song focused album that Dream Theater have released since the 90s.  Every track on this album feels like it has an identity and purpose all its own.  There is much more direction in the songwriting.  There are still unexpected changes in mood and style, but they feel much more natural than before and like they are moving towards something grander.  The album carries that momentum the entire way through.  If you are a DT fan, you probably have already decided to buy or have bought it.  For those who are just getting into the band, this is a great entry point.  All sides of the band are represented here.  From the straight ahead anthems like \\"On The Backs of Angels\\" to the progressive technically insane tracks like \\"Breaking All Illusions\\" to the melodic ballads like \\"Beneath the Surface\\", there is nothing left out.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Kenneth Branagh is really incredibly talented, both as an actor and as a director. This effort was no exception. Spot on effort introducing Thor to us, in the obvious direction of getting the individual Avenger movies out of the way. I would both expect a Thor sequel and anticipate an actual series of Avengers movies. We've had the Hulk, we've seen Iron Man, Captain America is out there. I am interested to see what comes next.<br />For this movie specifically, it serves to show why Thor would care about Midgard and also details the reasons behind his rivalry with his brother Loki.<br />Additionally, a lot of thought went into the imagery and the settings. Midgard in particular looks like an amazing blend of magic and technology, seamlessly blending together. BiFrost is a perfectly foreboding and frozen plane of existence, and the Earth setting (mostly in a desert town) works well. The settings actually serve as both important plot devices and awesome visions of worlds outside our own.<br />This is really a star laden event as well, so you will see quite a few familiar faces.<br />I had a good time watching this.<br />Enjoy!
0760335540|3.0|The information in this book is accurate and, for the most part, useful. But anyone expecting to find 101 distinct projects for their Boxster in this book will be disappointed, as a good number of the projects described here are either prerequisites or preliminary steps for other projects, rather than projects themselves. Example: jacking up the car, which is a worthwhile thing to know how to do, but is not a standalone activity in itself; ditto for engine or transmission removal. And it's not clear whether the time/cost/skill numbers provided include the prerequisite steps. There are also such no-value-added \\"projects\\" as \\"Installing the Das Schild Protector\\", which basically consists of \\"buy the part from us\\" and \\"clip it into place\\". I assume/hope the part in question comes with better instructions than this.    And that's my main complaint with the book: to some extent it is a catalog cum advertisement for Pelican Parts, its author's business. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as Pelican is an excellent source for parts and info. But if you actually know what you want to do to your Porsche, the Pelican website has the complete projects from the book available for free, and the data on the website is more up to date and usually provides additional photos. (Or, to look at it another way, the book is an outdated printout of the website's technical info section.)
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is the bad guy turns good guy with a whole lot of fun getting there.   Well done and not your typical story... silimar idea to Megamind but do with a lot more style and charm.  A great fun film for family and  adults!!
B0000242KQ|4.0|This is possibly one of the greatest albums in my collection. The only thing I think needs work with this purchase is the handeling.    Though it is minor, there are several cracks all over the cd case, and the cd has a (very minor) scratch on the front of it. The cd is in almost mint condition, just the minor scratch that really isn't even noticeable.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Do you know what I think happened?     Lucas got drunk one night after he created the Special Editions, thought that he made a better product, and burned the originals. The next day he wakes up and sees the havoc he created, then convinces himself it is for the best. Years go by and his faith in his spontaneous decision begins to decline. He starts having nightmares about it... waking up in a sweat, unable to escape that one important decision that would alter his artistic integrity. He becomes an insomniac. His days are haunted by the ghost of the real Anakin. He desperately tries to cover it up with new material, trying to throw a veil over his all too intelligent fans, or maybe just create younger ones that have yet to understand what real art is. But he still sees a vast majority crying out for the masterpiece that was... people who grew up with the originals, and people like me who never got to see the originals in the theaters but who have watched the originals over and over countless times, thirsty to taste the movies with HD tongues.     But he cannot deliver it... because it's gone, its energy spread across the galaxy.     Or maybe he's just being stubborn.     Until we know the truth, I'm watching the 2008 DVD release and am not spending one dime on anything Star Wars until its true fans get what they deserve. We helped make you what you are Lucas. Give us back the respect we once gave to you (and are still giving) for your initial genius.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This is a dude's action flick,all these stars and all the action,Great Chases,Fight Sequences,a Good Chase that happens to have a Cameo by A Semi Truck Peterbilt 362 Cabover hauling a container,Great story and Mercenaries! Although the CIA part is a little played out as usual.Yes the CGI is a little off and the Spanish from the Fictional Island is bad(it was filmed in Brazil where the native Language is not Spanish.)It does not take away from the Merit of the Film.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|this is a great puzzle challenge game. it is turn based, so it is fantastic for me bc i prefer games that i can pick up and put down as needed without ruining my progress on a level.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|It's a tragedy.  Halliburton did not even have the decency to warn people that their house water was contaminated by natural gas drilling.  Halliburton knew it was toxic and DID NOT EVEN WARN people with effected water supplies. They in fact said that Water contaminated with carcinogens used in gas drilling was SAFE to drink.  People suffered from headaches, stomach sickness, cancer, and spinal problems.  George Bush gave energy companies exception if they violate the clean air and clean water act which they have done extensively.  The amount of toxic pollution caused by these natural gas companies is disgusting.  They kill animals, contaminate water, and air.  They are probably responsible for many many cancer cases that they will never be held responsible for.  As an American you should see the extensive damage done to our environment by industry.  This is a National Crisis.  Natural gas drilling is done all over the country...quite literally ALL OVER the country.  The companies that due this dump their pollutants into the air and water as if their was no clean air or water act.  Thus our environmental policies are no different than 3rd world countries.   This causes cancer, cell mutations, acid rain, ozone pollution, and numerous other sicknesses associated with the toxic nature of the chemical compounds used in \\"fracking\\" aka natural gas drilling.

B005CMSDLE|1.0|I wanted to see this movie the moment I saw the movie trailers. Due to life, my viewing was delayed until now. In the end, HANNA was not worth the bandwidth it took to download it.     I'm not sure what I had been expecting of this movie. Suspense, action, the thrill of watching a young girl with skills beyond her years in a desperate struggle to escape the clutches of a recruitment facility. Well, most of those elements were there, I suppose, but the movie offered them with such a slow, guarded hand that I got bored waiting to sample it.     The characters felt insubstantial. Even after I got to the point that verified their pasts and existences, I had reached those conclusions very early on and stopped caring. I'm told this movie is a \\"coming-of-age\\" for Hanna, but I didn't, no, couldn't sympathize with the pain she was meant to feel upon learning the truth. Her character didn't feel real, not with the some of the stunts she was able to pull off - the unrealistic erased the praise for the realistic. I do not wish to reveal spoilers, but it was not the truth about Hanna that made her impossible to connect with. By the end of the movie, I was hoping she would be killed to give the movie a change of pace.     It has received good reviews from a number of people, so maybe there was something I didn't see here. However, I have no intentions of watching a second time just to find out.

B0055V6EZE|4.0|A Revival for the New Orleans Sound.  HOUSE - Hugh Laurie has such a following that purchases will be made just because of his character and who he is.  Then when they hear the music and the work of not only Laurie but the other New Orleans musicians it will bring an appreciation and a REVIVAL of interest into that musical genre.   This will bring new listeners to the New Orleans Sound.   I think this is a great project and I will encourage others to listen and purchase.       I am a New Orleans girl now living in Illinois and I THANK YOU for bringing this collection of MY PEOPLE to me.   I FEEL IT.   I LOVE IT.   I MISS IT.   THANK YOU.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This is an outstanding Video with great entertainment value. Domingo & Villazon work together like Master and pupil. Both are in great voice and Villazon really gets the 20,000 crowd going (in this former 1936 German Olympic venue?) with his sparkling rendition of Rossini's La danza. Netrebko always a star and a delight in any performance is the \\"iceing on the cake\\" with her charming personality, beautiful voice and great audience communications skills.  All togethet a remarkable program that you will watch and listen to again and again. I have alraedy sent copies to several friends as gifts.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|The Star Wars saga on Bluray = INCREDIBLE, AWESOME, BREATHTAKING!!!!!!!    I just finished watching all six films,The Phantom Menace twice, all the deleted scenes and bonus content on discs 7 & 8, looked through disc 9, I am VERY IMPRESSED with the quality of this set!  The films NEVER looked or sounded as good as they do on Bluray! The special features on disc 7 & 8 are outstanding! Personally, I'm glad that the special features from the Episode I, II, III and 2004 box DVD set aren't included. It would render those useless. Between the DVD's and this Bluray set the only thing, in my opinion, that's missing is a few more deleted scenes from Episodes I, II & III.  The \\"Collection\\" is incredible bonus feature. I LOVE the 360 and video commentary, on many of the pieces, fun to navigate and watch.  This is a MUST HAVE for any Star Wars fan!!!!! This is the DEFINITIVE version of the saga for me!    IGNORE all the whinny 40 somethings that can't move past there own childhood! This is Star Wars at it's finest!!!! The films HAVE NOT changed, the story and characters are the same they where back in 1977, 80 and 83. They simply look better then they ever did before!    George Lucas made my childhood! And has added to my adult hood. I have nothing but the deepest respect and admiration for him! He gave me Star Wars, which I can now share and enjoy with my own children, for that I am forever in his debt!     Thank you George!!!!
B005KWL2IW|5.0|This is one of their top TWO albums.  It's such a solid album and the return of Belladonna makes this a masterpiece.  It is light years ahead of anything they ever recorded, well, since Belladonna left.  I hate to say it, but it serves them right.  They STUPIDLY got rid of their fan favorite singer, and replaced him with a tone-deaf \\"vocalist\\" from a mediocre band which had never produced anything notable in their short career.  There are songs on this album, which could only be performed by Belladonna. Bush couldn't sing several of the songs on this album...he lacks the range or vocal capacity to sing a song like \\"I'm Alive\\" and he certainly couldn't even begin to contemplate singing \\"In The End.\\"<br /><br />The big rockers on this album are \\"Earth On Hell,\\" \\"Devil That You Know,\\" \\"Fight em Till You Can't,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"The Giant.\\" That song in particular has all the elements of what I associate with 80's era Anthrax, big back and forth choruses, loud fast guitars and crazy 80's style attitude.  \\"Revolution Screams\\" is pretty solid and contains a hidden track which begins about five minutes after \\"Screams\\" ends.<br /><br />This album is very acrobatic, the instrumentation is perfect, the vocals spot on and it simply blows away anything released since \\"Persistence of Time\\"...blows It away like it never existed.
055389787X|5.0|I must say that I never expected so many characters to fall by the wayside (nor relative homicide) in this book.  Things seemed to be going along (business as usual) with no major changes coming until around the middle of the book.  Kings were dying left and right, and plotting was everywhere.  I really got into the book the last few hundred pages as I could tell things would be happening. I think this is the best of the first four books; even though there is still a lot of wasted time and words, the book has a story (I would say plot but myriad plots would be more apt), and the characters twist, turn, and some even survive.  Still, it was  sweet when one of my most disliked characters perished  (via poison)in a marriage feast.  I don't want to spoil the story, so I am being type lipped about which characters fell under the axe (or the quiver or whatever), but suffice to say, it was numerous.  It is interesting that none of the characters are totally \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\"; some, like Jamie, seem to be mellowing and showing more maturity and even tolerance.  Probably the only real stretching the imagination is the revival of one of the Starks at the end of the book.  Later we learn more about how (in the next book) this resurrection came about, but I digress. Bits of magic or hints seem to be turning up more and more.  In some places the author is planting seeds for future books and muddying the waters as to what is going to happen next.
B005LY4B0A|2.0|this app is made for a small screen phone.  while it plays on a tablet the formatting is all messed up.<br /><br />It needs directions.  Another review mentioned what are the requirements to get 3 stars?<br /><br />It is kind of fun and if it was formatted better would proably rate 4 stars.<br /><br />New Release 10-14-2011.  Well things got worse for tablet owner.  The game was poorly formatted on a tablet but playable.  Now it is worse.  The openning menus to get into the game are horribly overlayed and you are basically guessing at what you are doing.  The level numbers are not with the squares so you don;t know what you got 3 stars on.  Once into a level it is again sort of playable  The background is just not format correctly for the web on the screen.  This could be a fun game if the developer would correlty format his app for different screen sizes.
0553573403|5.0|This book I read about in one of the national magazines, the reviewer saying Martin (the author) was the American Tolkien, and to a certain extent I would agree.  However, there are vast differences in the two authors and their type of writing.  Both have created totally \\"new\\" worlds with their own maps and characters.  Good and bad with Tolkien are obvious, with Martin there is a lot of gray.  There is only one major murder in this book, and the author seems to imply honor in political intrigue is deadly. There is a lot of backstabbing, double crossing, and other finer points of politics in the book.  It gets you hooked to reading the rest of the series, at least it did me.
B003UESJFQ|4.0|\\"Made in Dagenham\\" received good buzz from critics and award committes alike, but I wasn't sure if I'd be watching another chick-flick. Rest assured, there's enough guy involvement to make this a generally pleasing true story about equal rights. The delightful Sally Hawkins is on hand to provide a strong and centered heroine, and the always reliable Miranda Richardson scores as hard-as-nails Barbara Castle.<br /><br />There will be comparisons to \\"Norma Rae\\", but this film isn't as character driven; rather, the ensemble excels as a whole to provide insight as well as strong entertainment.<br /><br />I enjoyed it more than expected; glad I saw it.
055358202X|4.0|This book is not nearly as good as the first three (especially books 3), but it keeps the story going.  Some of the characters in the prior book (the dwarp and Dany, for example) are not even mentioned in this book (at the end of the book the author says those characters will be covered in book 5).  Much of this book is just the characters running around from place to place  with no end in sight; Brienne is one that wanders around almost aimlessly and foolishly.  I was saddened when one of the \\"good\\" characters is apparently hanged at the end (I'm hoping she will come back, but it looks like it's a done deal, dead!). Sansa is one of the better characters in this book, and she has an interesting relationship with Littlefinger.  The other Stark girl has one misadventure after another, with a terrible thing happening to her at the end of this book (no, she doesn't die, but in killing of another, she pays a price--hopefully only temporarily).  Sam and Gilly have numerous misadventures and a little fun at one point (of which Sam feels terribly guilty afterward).
B0034G4P94|5.0|I loved this movie! This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only are the fight scenes incredibly exicting, but the family drama is very moving. I cried during this film more than once. I think I am a little in love with Tom Hardy now. Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton all gave Oscar Worthy performances.<br /><br />Tommy (Hardy) and Brendan (Edgerton) are estranged brothers who both enter the same MMA Tournament. Tommy is an ex-Marine, an Iraq War hero, fighting for a fallen brother and Brendan is a married Physics Teacher fighting to keep a roof over his family's head. They have an ex-alcoholic, ex-abusive father that they both dislike who caused heartache and a terrible childhood for both of them. Their father, played by Nick Nolte (incredible performance)tries like hell to make it up to both of them and becomes Tommy's trainer. Their past mistakes and regrets all come to a head in the arena.<br /><br />This is a beautiful and moving story about love and forgiveness. Go see this movie, you will not regret it.

0838577016|5.0|It's a really big book. Explain a lot of things in detail and can be a bit boring a dry. Nice addition for anyone going in Neuroscience. Get the electronic version if you can so you don't have to carry this phone-book size thing around.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I love games that are fun and make you think and this one does just that! Works great on the Galaxy Tab.
1594484805|4.0|I used this book for one of my classes in my masters program. This is a good book! It's very informative and the stories are relatable. The information stuck with me and that is a good thing when reading a book. I will definitely be using this book as a reference from time to time.
B0029LHW68|5.0|This is an awesome CD!! I have played it to death already. Jared Leto is an amazing talent, and TSTM is an amazing group. Highly recommend this one!!!!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|les + : jeu bien pens&eacute; ! fait penser au jeu &quot;burn the rope&quot;. facile au debut, le jeu devient vite un casse tete et promet pas mal d'heures de jeu !   les - : dans certains plans les cordes sont trop proches les unes des autres ce qui peut nous induire en erreur.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I understand George Lucas has been milking us fans for like 20 years, but I still love this set. Looks truly amazing!!!

B005LY4B0A|5.0|EVO 3D,  I just got the game and it looks amazing.  The graphics are very well done.  It makes you think and its based on strategy.  Super recommendable.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|the app shows me the beginning video....then closes out. I really wanted to try it too. on original droid. maybe I'll try it on my itouch
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Just as happy with this movie as all the previous X-Men movies.  Did have a little trouble with the streaming half way through, but I do not think that should be a reflection on the rating and review of the movie itself.  That is a reflection of amazon service, not the movie.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I disagree with the review that said the first part of the book was slow. I thought it was very interesting. I think the author had to spend some time showing the world Lena grew up in and how it \\"shaped\\" her thinking. I liked how her character developed. The book was touching and thought provoking. The ending was great. I have pre-ordered the 2nd book. Would recommend it to teens and adults alike.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Perfect fit for the Plantronics Voyager Pro. I've used this case daily for over a year. Worth the money. Protect your headset.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is actually really well made. I have never had a problem with it since I got the free version on the Android Market. I was very pleased to see that all of my progress from the free version was transfered to the Amazon version. No having to start over, as was the case with the drag racing game a few days ago.<br /><br />As for the gameplay itself, it's extremely fun and extremely addicting. It's turned based strategy at (in my opinion) its best. I've had this game for over a month, and it hasn't gotten boring... just challenging. Definitely worth the buck. Its provided me with hours of entertainment.
B0034K2DM6|4.0|This is a great audiobook, the cast is really top notch and their interpretations give life to the story. However, this is an abridged version and you should get the full version of the book, to get the whole picture.<br /><br />World War Z is a great book. The main character is the human spirit, the will to overcome the most terrible odds, the desire to survive no matter what. There are great ideas in zombie combat in the book and it also takes into account the complex social relations of such a situation.
B005804N9G|5.0|I really just want to weigh in with a score; I don't like writing reviews that much (and yes, I've heard the album-- about half a dozen times at this point). I'll just say that I love the new DT. Mr. Mangini, you took a job that few people could fill and blew us all away.<br /><br />The spirit carries on!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|this is a fun game no doubt. part of the fun is progressing through it. ive played the pc version allmost to the max. dont think that will happen with this one as it keeps putting me back at level 1 erasing my progress.
B000002R48|5.0|I definitely prefer James, but Charlie Dominici's vocals are very good: Kind of a cross between Geddy Lee and any totally competent metal singer. Not much to say about the album otherwise (in a good way). Really solid songs: High energy, original and intricate. I think I like this album better than Awake. Can't believe I waited so long to finally buy it!
B005KH928E|2.0|I don't understand it. W. Marsalis will record and release CDs with guys like Willie Nelson and Eric Clapton in the hopes of becoming more relevant to a wider audience but he ignores and belittles contemporary jazz and even some post-bop jazz artists who may incorporate electronic instrumentation and funk elements. In addition he completely ignores (authentic)blues, r&b and hip hop artists who occasionally use elements of jazz and give it(jazz) a fresh voice. When I think of Willie Nelson, I think of a country artist who incorporates elements of the blues but he is not a true blues artist. When I think of Clapton I think of a rock musician who was heavily influenced by the blues. That is not a slant on either of these guys. Both are masters in their respective genres. On the other hand, Marsalis gives me the impression that he will walk ten miles out the way to avoid the appearance of selling out and possibly being considered a visionary for jazz. Not that Marsalis' music doesn't do justice to the style of music that he's primarily known for, but he hasn't broken any new ground with this CD or any of his previous CDs period. For all his accolades I don't believe Marsalis has moved the music forward one iota and he continues to disappoint me in that regard. But I guess what I think doesn't really matter thanks to the media who have made Marsalis their 'go to guy' for all matters pertaining to jazz.
B0052WSX32|5.0|No one has ever sung like Doris Day; I doubt that anyone ever will.  There are countless albums out there, all of which are excellent (whether original studion releases or compilations). Her newest is no exception: the exception is the fact that it contains 8 never before released songs, many from 1986.  Today's vocalists can learn a lot from listening to this album...She sings DIRECTLY to EVERY listener, just as she always has; that is her most unique quality.  Her singing career spans the decades from the mid-40's to 1986 when many of these songs were recorded. However, they have been brilliantly re-mastered, and they sound as fresh as anything available today. It is no surprise that this is the #1 best selling pop album in the UK in several categories and a top hit in Australia as well.  The fact that it is not doing as well on the US scene is not surprising. When is the last time you have ever seen anything by Doris Day on the shelves in an American store...shame on US and hooray for those who support this fabulous iconic star.  Everyone deserves a copy of this album; Doris deserves to be heard again and again and again.
B00005UQ9F|2.0|...with a good movie. I was influenced by all of the insanely positive reviews for this film on here and other sites. Unfortunately I found this movie to be nothing above average - with mediocre acting, direction, and production values in general. David Caruso is even worse in this than he is on CSI: Miami!<br /><br />It's not creepy, nor is it suspenseful - it's just not good.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a much better than average game.<br /><br />Cute graphics and upbeat music combine well with this simple to understand, but, challenging to solve game.<br /><br />I will likely play this all the way thru before uninstalling.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon.

B000002UB3|5.0|This shipment was made timely with the item arriving in excellent condition.  Having grown up in the era it was released it was a must have item.  My old lp had become all to noisy to enjoy, so having the cd to replace it was very welcome.
B0034G4P80|1.0|Thor is a pretty good movie, and there are other reviews that sum it up better than I could. However, it is crippled by Copyright Protection that render it unable to be played on any DVD-ROM on PC or Mac. I'm returning this product. I have a larger, higher-def monitor attached to my computer than the TV hooked up to my dvd player. If I'm not allowed to watch a dvd *THAT I OWN* on my system of choice I have no reason to own it.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|the game is good but : The layout of game on tablet is not good. (assus transformer)  please developer test you app on tablet ;)
055321263X|4.0|Came earlier than was scheduled!The book is fine for used BUT I have gotten better used conditions than this. Wouldn't have ranked it used-like new... more used fair. But overall still good.
0670022411|1.0|This book came highly recommended to a member of one of my book groups and we decided to read it as our \\"Halloween\\" book.  My first impression was that the book was poorly edited.  I had to suppress the urge to grab a red pen and cross through at least 20 percent of this book.  It was an easy read, but it felt much like a supernatural romance novel - it really isn't much more than that.  It was fun up to a point, but after reading close to 600 pages and not having any answers it felt like a waste of time.  It was a valuable lesson for our group though, since we created more guidelines for future reads.
B002GU605G|5.0|I have totally been window shopping this album for almost 2 years. I have always viewed the Cult's Love album as quintessential Cult, but to hear alternate takes on songs like Rain and She Sells Sanctuary and a live version of Nirvana (my all time favorite) would be just Heaven. But bear in mind, that these are just wishes. Now I have to save up my money and actually buy it. I'm pretty sure after I purchase and listen to it, it will make for a great review.
030788743X|5.0|This has to be adapted to a movie at some point!  The story is insanely addicting and thoroughly satisfying.  I highly recommend for readers of all levels.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Let's start this review off right. Absolute Garbage.  Star Wars is one of the greatest films of all time. Maybe I should say Star Wars was one of the greatest films of all time. I picked this up today and I am disgusted. There is absolutely no reason that the original theatrical version could not have been included. All you are allowed is George Lucas' perverted re imagining of a classic master piece. The original trilogy is littered with terrible CGI, awkward changes, and deep running character changes that destroy what made Star Wars so great. Han Solo is a bad ass smuggler who doesn't take crap from some scum named Greedo. He shoots him straight out. And Darth Vader doesn't scream like an awkward teenager at the sight of his son's near murder.     In short, do not buy this set. Buy the 2006 2 disc set and accept that Star Wars will never be presented as it was originally intended in HD.
0439023521|5.0|I could not put it down!  I read the whole series in a week.  They were completely Engrossing.  I recommend them highly.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Picked this little beauty up for about $10 with the free shipping. I ordered the cold steel machete katana with this and ended up hitting a wall with the tip of the sword. I was able to smooth out the 2mm bend with the diamond file (round pen thing) and then resharpen the tip with carbide, and finished it off with the ceramic sharpener. I also spiffed up other knives which needed sharpening in less than 2 mins. I would recommend this to anyone. Also you can adjust the slide sharpeners to elongate life and use. Don't waste your money buying cheap 1-5 use carbide sharpeners, this pocket tool is small and has got it all for a low cost.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Bought this 4 years ago after catching it on Starz....and like better with every viewing - is now in my Fall Halloween-film-fest rotation.  A lot of old hospitals here around Boston & out in Worcester have this look & creepo feel to them.  Was just up near this one a month ago (this is the only orig. building left on the hill in Worcester):(link was removed by Amazon so google for \\"Worcester State Hospital abandoned\\" and you'll see a site with photos of the creepy building and old photos at bottom).   Tell me those pictures at that site & on bottom page don't make you thinking Overlook Hotel or Danvers State.  There's something about peeling paint and old institutions that will always be a good setting for a scary story and the easily imagined morbidity & suffering that went on there.   Like some others I wanted at first the film's story threads to be tied up nice and neat for me but sometimes it's ok to just leave things a bit....  What are you doing here?  Wha..What are you doing here?   What are yo....  Hello  BILLlee
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Puzzle game not a timed game it makes you figure out what to do.  Higher levels have better tools to work with.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Let me start by saying that the prequels, look really good. And that's what this is a 2 star.    BUT the originals...are terribly done    First off, it's not true HD. In fact most of it looks standard. Secondly in A New Hope, during the escape from the death star, where Luke and Han are shooting the TIE fighters. The fighters have a little brown box around them on several frames, AND during one frame it actually goes back to FULL screen, from widescreen. Then while Luke is about to destroy the death star, one of the tie fighters there, actually is transparent somehow lol. Luke's lightsaber still changes color twice. AND Obi-Wan's does as well during the fight with Vader it turns purple several times.     I'm actually really considering returning this. In fact I probably will.
B0059DOJAA|4.0|\\"Age of the Joker\\" is the 9th studio album from the venerable german metal band, Edguy.  Still fairly young, it's almost surprising Edguy has been around this long and it feels even longer when you lump in Tobias Sammet's work with Avantasia as well.  What started off as an almost Helloween clone back in the 90's has become a more straight forward and classic metal band in the same vein as Dio and The Scorpions but with modern production from the excellent Sascha Paeth.    It's hard to say when Edguy started trending this way, but I would say it started with 2004's \\"Hellfire Club\\" and ever since the power metal element of the band has been phased out nearly completely.  The only classic sounding Edguy song on \\"Age of the Joker\\" is the speedy \\"The Arcane Guild\\" which finds Edguy in their safe zone occupied by other past tracks like \\"Fallen Angels\\" and \\"We Don't Need A Hero.\\"  The sound present on \\"Age of the Joker\\" could probably be described as a melding of the last three Edguy releases though it is an album that stands on its own.  Heavier guitar tones like the ones from \\"Hellfire\\" and \\"Tinnitus\\" are joined with catchy synth work and anthemic choruses throughout.  The production is quite slick without being overly glossy.  When the album wants to rock it really rocks with the punchy \\"Nobody's Hero\\" or punishing \\"Fire on the Downline.\\"    It's when the album tries to get too big that things stray.  The opener \\"Robin Hood\\" really wants to be a big epic, but it also wants to be humorous which is a tough combo to pull off.  The result is uneven and the song features some of Sammet's worst lyrics as the vocals struggle to fit in with the melody on the chorus.  A disappointing dud to kick things off but the previously mentioned \\"Nobody's Hero\\" redeems the album quickly.  \\"Pandora's Box\\" features perhaps the album's highest soaring chorus but the parts in between are less interesting.  \\"Behind the Gate to Midnight World\\" is a 5 minute song extended to more than 8 that loses some punch before it's over and the closing track \\"Every Night Without You\\" is the token sappy ballad we've heard several times now.    Those songs are flawed, but ultimately quite listenable, and the better tracks can easily carry them.  If I have one final piece of criticism it's that this album doesn't contain one sure-fire ultimate cut.  There's no \\"Sacrifice\\" or \\"Tears of a Mandrake\\" to be found to really elevate the album.  Even the often maligned \\"Tinnitus Sanctus\\" had \\"Speedhoven\\" and \\"Ministry of Saints\\" to help push the boundaries.    Criticisms aside, the album is quite good and I've enjoyed my time with it so far amongst this period of crowded release schedules in the metal world.  There's a lot to like here and though I'm unsure of where the band's sound will take it next I'm quite eager to find out.
B004EC5IUW|4.0|Whenever I see a movie get too much praise, I have a tendency to hate it just because of such--not true for Evangelion 2.22. While the series has been synonymous with the terms \\"overrated\\" and \\"pretentious\\" at times, that's not to say that such things are completely true. Partially, maybe, but not completely.    I first watched the movie subbed (and in not the best of quality), having to sort through all the technobabble I was reading from the subtitles and piece together a story, resulting in not the best of experiences for me. That said, watching it dubbed made things significantly easier to follow on my part. Though, at the end of the day, both versions are essentially the same, the dub keeping as close to the original Japanese script as possible, while taking some liberties here and there for the sake of better expressing the characters for English-speaking audiences (ie: expressing Mari's character through stronger swears).    As for the story itself, I am glad that things are finally stemming away from the original 26-episode series. The problem I had with the first \\"Rebuild\\" movie was how close it stuck to the scenes in the original anime, while keeping the pacing rather slow, especially during the sluggish buildup to the climax. This time around, we get a good mix of old material and new material, keeping oldentime fans as well as newbies on their toes as to just exactly what will happen next.    And if the movie itself wasn't enough, the special features will definitely warrant the buy. Not only is there an audio commentary for the movie, but original Japanese trailers for the movie and DVD release, deleted scenes, and additional behind the scenes work, showing scenes as the make it from the drawing board to animated form. One minor complaint would be the inclusion of a \\"play all\\" option for the trailers, but not for other features, such as the deleted scenes. Being sent back to the main menu after 2 or so minutes only to select another 2 minute clip can bea pain after a while.    The picture quality is also excellent--one of the few animated movies that deserves to be seen in high definition, what with its mix of 3D-style animation alongside detailed 2D backgrounds. Definitely worth the purchase!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The changes aren't THAT big of a deal. Remember, in the end, they're only movies. Great set. The movies look terrific and the bonus stuff is way cool. All you pissed off people, chill. Again, they're only movies.

B0058VA2U4|3.0|I'm glad that Joey is back in the band, but this album does not sound like classic Anthrax. It's not thrash metal, it sounds more like nu-metal, but it is more melodic than nu-metal. \\"Worship Music\\" also doesn't sound like \\"Persistence of Time\\" or the John Bush era albums. Joey doesn't sing as high as he did on their old albums. The songs are ok, not great. People, such as Eddie Trunk are overrating this album, it is not Anthrax's best album ever.
B0034G4P8A|2.0|I'm a really big Marvel fan so my hopes for this feature were very high. I was somewhat disapointed. The action was pretty good but it really needed more story. The plot was so thin you could read the paper through it. This is clearly just a vehicle leading up to \\"THE AVENGERS\\". Oh, be sure to watch the trailer at the end of the credits. It honestly was the best part.<br /><br />This gets 2 stars ONLY because, well, it IS the God of Thunder.
1400069181|4.0|I am one of those people that always wants to start their own company, but can't bring myself to leave my well-paying corporate job. I also love Tom's and it's \\"One for One\\" mission. I found this book engaging and highly motivating. Blake gives a history of Tom's Shoes and its success and provides some guidance for other entrepreneurs, such as building trust, giving back and making due with few resources. As someone who is at the very early stage of thinking about starting a business, I found these tips helpful and I found the examples he provided interesting and useful. I would imagine that established entrepreneurs might find the material too basic to be of any practical use, as the book only provides high-level guidance.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|This product does what I wanted from it - gives me usefull data on my running. Its just not as user friendly as I would like it to be. Has too many steps to set it up. And does not support Chrome web browser, yet, as I understand (which is no problem to fix, but its a real inconvience to me as it means I have to manually always remember to turn it on so my running data gets uploaded to the Garmin site)    The touch bezel loses its charm when I want to use it while running (try to tap anything the size of an ant while having to look whats in front of You, not tapping on any of the other buttons right next to it, tapping with the correct preassure and most of all while jumping up and down at the same time). Thou this is a small inconvience as Garmin has made it so that I only need to switch between two displys - running parameters and virtual partner (which I have mastered to do in the last week =D )    What I really like about the watch is it fits good, I dont feel it while running, it makes me look pro and now its more fun to run as I always cant wait to see the results and try to beat my virtual partner!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I was on my way to shop for the Canon bag of similar size, and found a link to this bag along the way.  Others reported comparing it to the same bag, and how they were just as happy, if not happier, due to the much lower price for the Amazon branded bag.  They were not off base at all.  This is a very useful bag.  Plenty of separators for keeping your gear protected.  I was able to fit my DSR, three lenses, a HDV camcorder, MacBook Air 13\\", iPad, as well as extra batteries, cables, tapes, and other miscellaneous items.  Able to get it through airport security without issue (still need to remove MacBook).<br /><br />The shoulder straps were pretty comfortable (which was my main driver from replacing my previous bag).  The zippers are easy to operate, and the padded grips are easy to find and feel good to use.  When packed or empty, it stands up straight pretty reliably.  The outside pockets could be better sealed, but that may be just my preference for another pocket for easy to access travel items for pens and i-cables.

1609611543|5.0|I was sent the book Wheat Belly by Amazon Vine for review. Here's my take on it.<br /><br />For the past year I've been following a number of doctors, health gurus and others who advocate eliminating from one's diet refined carbs, and in particular, white flour and sugar. I've followed much of this advice with moderate success, so finding Wheat Belly with a cardiologist's recommendations and results, seemed fortuitous since I'd been heading that way for some time.<br /><br />On the flyleaf of Dr. Davis' book is the following: \\"A provocative look at how eliminating wheat from our diets can help us lose weight, shrink unsightly bulges, and reverse a broad spectrum of health problems.\\" Wow! Strong words, but does it work?<br /><br />Apparently so, because the author tells in detail how he and many of his patients not only lost weight but reversed or eliminated many diseases simply by eliminating wheat. Sounds drastic, but interestingly enough, many of our favorite foods aren't the wheat but what we put on the wheat. I know I love artisan breads, but what I mainly love is that they're a way to convey gobs of tasty butter to my lips. Ditto chips and pita crackers. I'm eating them for the dip, not for the cracker. So, if I can find a way to enjoy butter, sauces, cheese and dips while losing weight, improving my cholesterol levels, eliminating diabetes, celiac disease and a host of other nasties, will I really miss bread and pasta? I think not. This is what Dr. Davis' book is about, and it he shows how the dwarf, high-yield wheat of today is vastly different from the grains consumed by the Sumerians and, yes, even our great-grandparents. In other words, the einkorn and emmer grains of yesteryear were scrapped for genetically modified high-yield grains for profitability. Of course, nutritionists of the latter twentieth century were no help suggesting that we eat a diet consisting of large amounts of whole grain. In doing this, we've become fatter and fatter, particularly with the visceral fat that makes us apple shaped and prone to heart disease, cancer, diabetes and even premature aging.<br /><br />Wheat Belly offers several recipes in the last third of the book, along with many references. While the recipes are different, many using ground nuts and/or flax seeds to replace flour, all look very tasty.<br /><br />I decided to take the pledge and go wheat free for three months, so I'll be checking in to update my progress as I go. I'm looking forward to weight loss and relief from the pain of osteoarthritis. The idea of combating these problem through diet rather than drugs is very appealing.<br /><br />Update 1: I've been wheat free for one week. Surprisingly, it hasn't been hard to find substitutes (example: corn flake crumbs instead of Panko for breading fish and chicken, and I spotted a wheat free/gluten free \\"shake and bake\\" type mix at my local natural food store. Diamond Nut Thins are wheat and gluten free and are wonderful for cheese spread or hummus.) My week one results: down two pounds and no feelings of deprivation. Lots more energy and sleeping better at night.<br /><br />Update 2: Second wheat-free week, this coming after a bone density test confirming osteoporosis in lumbar region. I remembered reading about this in Wheat Belly, so re-read to check and learned that eliminating wheat from diet helps to keep the body more alkaline, thus slowing or eliminating calcium loss. Just one more reason to go wheat free. Weight loss was minimal, but the belly is shrinking. My everyday jeans can actually be pulled off without unbuttoning them. Yay! New products to check out: Rudi's Gluten Free bread in many natural food stores. I prefer the cinnamon raisin type for morning toast. Absolutely wheat free and delicious. Also, there's a baking book available: Annalise G. Roberts Gluten-Free Baking Classics. Today I'll be shopping for fine brown rice flour and potato starch to make some of these goodies.<br /><br />Final update: I've beenfollowing a wheat-free eating plan since receiving the book and can say that it definitely works. Since September 18th (one month ago), I've lost six pounds and five inches from my waist without doing anything other than avoid wheat.definitely works. Since September 18th (one month ago), I've lost six pounds and five inches from my waist without doing anything other than avoid wheat.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|This movie provides a fascinating look at slavery from the British perspective prior to abolition in the US. The role of the church in helping to change the perspective of the typically boisterous British Parliament re the wrong-doing that slavery was is seen.  This change was in spite of the economic impact to the British coffers via transportation of slaves on their ships.  The origin of Amazing Grace, the song, in the midst of this transition from acceptance of slavery provides further insight into words from the song--\\"I once was blind, but now I see.\\"

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars is the best saga ever... why?    The movies:   They work at so many levels. They can be as complicated as you want them to be or as simple and fun to watch.  They have the best compiltaion of history, philosophy, psicology, religion and mithology ever put in any movie.  At the same time you can watch it for the explotions, FX and the action.    The blu ray edition changes:  We all have our own opinion on these movies: how they should look, how they shoul be told, how the action ca be more fun, what they shoud`t change and what they shoud improve or change.  All the movies needs something or lacks something but the star wars movies are so loved for everybody that a lot of us are so pasioned about them and any little  or big change is very important and we forgett what were we looking at them at first. I hope some of us still have manage to have fun and find what are we looking for in these BD edition or the olders one.    The Blu-ray picture quality:   I have no words... they look a lot better than the DVD versions by far. i have no reference equipment but they look excellent to me.  It´s like see them for the first time.  You can´t believe how much detail were you missing.  I`m very happy.    The blu-ray audio quality:   I´m not an audiophile and i haven`t had the oportunity to listen them loud but they sound a lot better too.  I still have to install all my nine speakers to hear the difference. They sound they way I remember heard them at the movies.    Extras:   They are cool but it lacks some material of the DVD versions and they feel incomplete to me. I like the package and artwork it´s much better than the DVD versions. The spanish subs are also better done this time, they told better the story and is more adecuate to the english dialogue.    Thanks for reading and sorry for my english
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Be Warned.    Although the title states their the original trilogy and the packages is the same it is the compromised \\"special edition\\" version that no one likes.  You think the backlash that the DVD release had Lucas and Fox would learn their lesson, but no.  They continue to shove this crap down our throats.  I can't wait to see the return rate of this box set in a couple week, it will be Guinness worthy.  save your money and don't make my mistake.   Wait till they release the true original trilogy.  give this a thumbs up so customers are aware of the mistake their about to make.[[ASIN:B000PMLFRA Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]]]
6301966740|4.0|The film is aesthetically enhanced by producing it in colour.  This VHS version is of good quality.  What a pity it is not available in colour in DVD format!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie is great! My children (ages 7 and 10) loved this show. They watch it over and over! The colors throughout this movie are spectacular! The music is catchy and upbeat! The characters are funny and will keep you giggling! I think this is the best movie to come out in the past few months!
630170648X|4.0|This film is entertaining from the start.  The subject matter is presented with a great sense of humour, which was necessary for morale purposes at the time (it was made during World War II); I would guess.  The portrayal of Hitler, both the true and the false one, is quite convincing and the make-up artist is to be commended for the likeness that he created.  Jack Benny and Carole Lombard shine as the Polish Shakespearian actor and his attractive wife and almost like the conclusion to the Second World War, the story has a happy ending! A young Robert Stack as an exiled Polish officer adds interest.  A DVD version of this VHS film would be much appreciated!
B00275EHJG|5.0|This was by far the best of the series! All of the Toy Story movies were great, but this one had it all. It was put together in such a way that you laugh and cry! It was not only for children. Adults are also captivated by this movie! Everyone should watch this movie!
B0028DRGDQ|1.0|When I bought this movie, the article description was very brief.     After returning home and putting it into the disc what do I get? Spanish.    That's right, Spanish.     Like, just one moment here. I bought this movie in an english speaking country and I get the Spanish original? Where is the english dub?    If I buy this film in Germany, I get the German dub. If I buy this movie in France, I get the French dub. How come the Germans and the French have the talented people to make a dub, but all English speaking countries in the world don't?    Don't buy this film until an english dub is made. I can't believe we are the only linguistic group who either lack the money or the skill to make dubs of all foreign films that are being sold in our markets.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|There is little to say about a film whose genius needs little analysis. Welles' mock[ing]-\\"biography\\" of William Randolph Hearst is an attack on just about everything wrong with this country. Nothing has changed in 70 years, and \\"Kane\\" remains an indictment of our vulgar, grossly materialistic society. It is also an extremely entertaining -- and yes, fun -- film that holds your interest from beginning to end. The last 30 seconds -- among the most-famous in film history -- ought to make any halfway rational person seriously question what they're doing with their lives. (The \\"Kane\\" theme is a variation on the \\"Dies Irae\\".)<br /><br />Is it really the best movie ever made? I can only answer that with another question -- what film would replace it for #1? When \\"People\\" magazine selected the 100 greatest films more than a decade ago, \\"Kane\\" was #2, behind \\"The Godfather\\". As great as Coppola's masterpiece is, it lacks the \\"startle factor\\" of \\"Kane\\". Even by modern standards, \\"Kane\\"'s screenplay, cinematography, and non-linear (but easily grasped) structure remain remarkable. Reviewers said they'd never seen anything like it, and in an age of boring, overwrought CGI extravaganzas, \\"Kane\\" remains unique. No one has quite caught up with it. *<br /><br />'til now, the best transfer was the DVD of a few years back (apparently from the composite negative), a big improvement over the previous transfers from prints. This is probably from the same source, but scanned at 4K. Whether you should replace that copy depends on how big your set is, how close you sit, and the quality of the scaler in your BD player. All I can say is that I've never enjoyed the film so much.<br /><br />The only thing that would get me to buy yet another edition (I still have the Criterion LV) is a restoration of the soundtrack. If the dialog and effects stems still exist (and they probably do), it would be nothing more than a matter of finding the money to re-record Bernard Herrmann's score in modern surround sound. With a bit of amplitude and phase EQ to the dialog, \\"Citizen Kane\\" would emerge even better than the original.<br /><br />* Since writing this, I've thought of two films that can truly stand comparison with \\"Citizen Kane\\" -- \\"Chinatown\\" and \\"L. A. Confidential\\". Both are among the finest films I've seen, and reward repeated viewing.ound sound.

B003E6K1VK|5.0|So, I've been playing the violin for over 15 years. I can ear the most subtle of sounds and the highest of frequencies. I can hear the the the whine of power adapters and the buzz of TVs. And yet, I was amazed that when I used the Fiio E7 to listen to the same music I've been listening to for over 2 years, I heard things that I had never heard before. Mind you, I'm using the Triple-Fi 10's. Songs that I thought never had any string instruments actually had the faint pluckings of a violin maestro. It truly made my IEMs shine. For a very noticeable upgrade to onboard audio, the E7 is worth it.

B001U887N8|4.0|I'm working at base in Afghanistan and I bought this shoe to wear back and forth to the showers and around my room when I'm not working.  Its perfect for those reasons.  There is no way I would wear it anywhere else or in public.  But its great for around the house.  Like everyone else has stated, the shoe feels tight the first few times you wear it but after the furry stuff gets worn in (took 2 days) it fits perfectly.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|This man makes great action flicks. I'm going thru a Jason Statham fase, so anyone who is doing the same needs this to complete their colletion. It has a good story and plot!
1402756399|5.0|Incredible presentation of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of the Species\\", his masterpiece that has taken the world out of the dark ages of mythology that is promoted by religions and brought it into the scientific realm that will lead to the ultimate advancement of mankind as a species. I'm completely impressed with the physical structure of the version, and with the beautiful illustrations that keep the mind from wandering from the subject at hand. Incredible price for an incredible book - it has a permanent place on my coffee table.
B00133KHCY|5.0|Loved this movie. Basically a kid with exceptional music talent goes through adversity in an attempt to find his way 'home'. His parents, separated before they've barely begun, also try to find their way 'home' and find their son. Kari Russell did an exceptional job here as did all the other characters. Though at first, it was rather difficult to get the image of King Henry out of my mind when Jonathan Rhys Meyers appeared. Very good story and one the whole family can watch.

B002ZG99IG|1.0|Any movie that needlessly kills an animal, regardless of being in the horror genre, is disgusting.  No good ever really comes for the cute, fuzzy little animal, but they dont need to show it.  Absolutely love horror movies, any kind, good and bad.  But i do draw a line for animal cruelty. Putting a kitten in the dryer?  Really, I'm actually shocked that they actually showed it.  I mean the movie itself is awful.  I have never seen Leighton Meester act this poorly, Queen B is a much better character.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|I may have agreed with  Gene P's terse review had I not got through the first part.<br />Whatever the  producers were thinking I have no idea!<br />Maybe its just that .....they weren't thinking!!<br />Blu-ray is  purchased with idea of spellbinding  imagery and the stellar crystal clear 24 bit sound.<br />Even better if you are listening on a pair  of Focus SEs[...]<br />Pink' s performance is compelling to say the least.<br />She sings from the heart; her rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody was five star.<br />She could easily be the fill-in for Freddie  Mercury on the next Queen tour.<br />If you're not a  Pink fan  a complete view of this Blu-ray may very well change that.<br />What I don't understand is why its under 10.00 for a brand  new copy.<br />Definitely  one of the best buys  on Amazon and certainly one of may favs out of the some odd 100 Blu-ray concerts I have.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Not a bad game. Has a nice tic tac toe feeling. Plays great on Epic 4g. For free app of the day I give Amazon a A+.
B004XZ99LO|2.0|I was able to watch it in 2-D but not 3-D.  I have a Samsung 9000 series 3-D HDTV and a Samsung 3-D player. Oddly the Menu is in 3-D but the \\"you need a 3-D capable TV and player\\" message keeps popping up no matter what I put the settings on.  Very Frustrating to say the least.
0812550706|5.0|I know it is a Nebula award winner. And I could give a crap. This book is inspiring, filled with well thought out and well written characters. I really don't know what else to say about it. It's friggin great. If you are a sci-fi fan and have not read it, this should be the next book on your list.
B005GIS1SY|1.0|If it were possible to give this movie zero starts, I would have done so.   I laughed twice during the first 45 minutes of the movie, and then gave up and turned it off.   This movie is targeted at the sense of humor of a kindergartner and, unlike many of the other fine films in this genre, has no overtones of humor that appeal to the adults in the audience.
1401203078|2.0|I honestly was expecting much more considering how good book 1 and 2 were. There is always a problem with a follow-up book as even if it is pretty good, it will be compared to its prequels. And this one fell a bit flat.

1439148953|5.0|I love books that are driven by great characters. And Eilis Lacey, the protagonist of Colm Toibin's BROOKLYN is one of the best-drawn characters I've encountered in some time. I can see why the book was such a runaway bestseller. Part of that success is due to the fact, I think, that this is a woman's book. I should emphasize that it is exactly that, a \\"woman's book.\\" It is definitely NOT \\"chick lit,\\" a sub-genre which certainly has its place, but is still a decidedly inferior type of book.<br /><br />Spoiler alert here, okay? -- The settings - both post-war Ireland and the borough of Brooklyn - are beautifully and realistically rendered, along with all of the melting-pot immigrant ambience of Brooklyn and the Jackie Robinson-era Dodgers, as well as the far-reaching influence of the Catholic Church on both sides of the Atlantic in those times. I enjoyed the book immensely, but only up to a certain point, i.e. Part Four. Then, because Toibin is so very good at portraying character, I began to slowly dislike his heroine more and more. And I didn't like her bereft and scheming mother any better. Like I said, this is a woman's book. I admire great writing, but I am still a guy. Guys hate weak, faithless women. I won't say any more. I don't wanna completely spoil things, although this book has been around for a couple years now and sold countless copies and spawned hundreds of reviews and reactions.<br /><br />I was so upset by the last part of this book I almost gave it only 4 stars - I even thought about a 3-star rating. But what the hell. This Toibin guy can really write. If he can create a character real enough to hate, well, I'll say it again. This guy can write. All this having been said, I wonder if there will be a sequel. He could probably write a good one. And women would eat it up. I'd probably be tempted to read it myself. Or not.<br /><br />- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir BOOKLOVER
B003ZSJ212|3.0|For some unknown reason, I have no Audio when I started playing the first disc other then some popping type noises.  It's a Panasonic BD35 player.   It's fine with other movie disc's. Using HDMI going into my Surround sound receiver.  It did give me a excuse to buy a new Blu-Ray player, which is a Panasonic BDT210P which the Audio plays just fine.   It boot up much faster then my older player that's a couple years old, but still, it kind of sucked!  I do wish G.L. didn't go and screw the movies all up.   I don't mind cleaning it up, fixing the flaws and what not, but all the added stuff is just LAME.   To me, the BEST Star Wars is #5,  The Empire Strikes Back!  The one G.L. didn't have anything to do with, followed by the Original.  The Added stuff done to them was just wrong.   If only I had a VHS player.  Imagine if other Classics were screwed with like Wizard of Oz, or the James Bond Movies where they where just cleaned up, repaired, Returned to Original Quality,  Why oh Why couldn't Star Wars be treated the same way?!?!?!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|...couldn't even keep my attention for a full minute...but that could have something to do with my short attention span..either way the games sucked.
B0057ZAA0S|3.0|Just a heads-up that the newly released Lionsgate Blu of Trainspotting is not the same version as was released on 2-Disc DVD a number of years ago. It's a mixture of the Miramax theatrical and the true Director's Cut. None of the dialogue is dubbed but the two shots edited from the US version (Diane on top of Renton and the needle going into Renton's arm) are not here. Picture is moderately better than an upconverted DVD. If you are looking for the true version seen in the UK and on the Criterion laserdisc, either hold on to your old 2-Disc DVD or seek it out used as it's now out of print. Otherwise, I would recommend paying no more than $10 for this or avoid altogether. I like Lionsgate very much but sometimes they drop the ball. This is one of those times.
1575666286|4.0|A good book co-authored by the late Dr Max Gerson's daughter Charlotte Gerson.    The book sets out an intensive program for healing of serious diseases such as cancer. The program works all many diseases and conditions as the body is not selective when it heals.    There are testimonies from past patients that have been on the program and been healed which is encouraging.     The theory is based on toxicity and deficiency.    The Therapy involves a specific saltless diet including raw and cooked foods and juices.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Based on a true story about a famous Japanese pooch, Hachi is updated and set in a small American town. The character canine, a gorgeous Akita pup, is found in a train station by a professor (Richard Gere) and the story begins in a slow, leisurly pace as Hachi enriches and changes all the humans surrounding him. It's beautifully directed by Lasse Hallstrom with a touching score by Jan Kaczmarek and gorgeous cinematography by Rob Fortunato. I challenge you to watch this without dipping into a box of Kleenex for a tissue or 2. Also, watch the excellent featurette included on the disc about the making of the film.
B000002BFZ|5.0|I'm currently going through another Pearl Jam-reappreciation perdiod again for some reason. It happens every couple of years. I recently relistened to this album again, multiple times in fact. Can you believe it's been 15 years since \\"No Code\\" has been released? How time flies! This was PJ's 4th studio album, after \\"Ten\\", \\"vs\\" and \\"Vitalogy\\".<br /><br />\\"No Code\\" (13 tracks; 50 min.) starts off with the beautiful understated \\"Sometimes\\", only then to dig into the hard-charging \\"Hail Hail\\", followed by the single \\"Who You Are\\", which of course never had a chance to score on the charts but is a mid-tempo Eastern-flavored tune, just great. Outstanding tracks follow one after another, \\"In My Tree\\" and \\"Smile\\" are biting. \\"Off He Goes\\" is a beautiful pensive 6 min. ballad, about as good as the band has ever done. But wait! we're just getting warmed up! \\"Habbit\\" finds the band rocking harder than ever, one of my favorite tracks on here. \\"Red Mosquito\\" is a mid-tempo rocker, but sounds great. \\"Lukin\\" is an all-out hard rocker, and the last truly great tune out here. The album falters slightly towards the end, in particular with the short and strange \\"I'm Open\\", but it doesn't matter. What a fantstic album this is, and yes, my favorite PJ album, period.<br /><br />Upon its release, \\"No Code\\" was not particulary well received by PJ fans or the public at large. Why, I have no idea. For me personally, it's probably the best PJ album, and relistening to it, it sounds like a greatest hits album to me, that's how strongly it resonates after 15 years. I've seen PJ in concert many times over the years, and I would just love for the band to do what many other bands these days are doing, namely playing older albums start to finish. I know it's unlikely, but hey, one can wish! Meanwhile, 15 years later, \\"No Code\\" is a fantastic album, let there be no doubt about it.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I  find this game  fun, it is quite a challnge but the directions  are a little confusing . I give this game a bad review at first because I did not understand them but now that I know what to do its a nice game. Glad I tried it again.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I watched this over and over again with my grand daughter cause she loved it so much. My daughter loved it as a kid so she bought it for her to enjoy a childhood memory or hers. Shes already singing the theme song over and over again. A must see!!!
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|Picture quality and sound quality were very good. Fast moving animal motions were well reproduced, no noticable artifacts. Fun for adults and kids.
B003IMERWY|4.0|Excellent sound quality for a reasonable price. A classic album that I wish was available in DVD audio or SACD, but I guess this is the next best option.
B0026OE2NY|2.0|Great idea.  Beautiful images.  But the director is much more talented at cinematography than screen writing.  There were some odd errors, such as \\"the first towns appeared over 600 years ago\\" which caused us all to scratch our heads.  Wouldn't have been so bad, but my elementary aged kids questioned everything the narrator said subsequently.   I also have to agree with other reviewers who found the style of the narration condescending and accusatory at times.  I accept the basic premise that our planet is beautiful and fragile, and that we humans must accept our responsibility to care for it.  Unfortunately much of that message was lost in the over-stated delivery style.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|this seems like a fun game, but i'm uninstalling because it only fills about 1/6 of the screen on my xoom.
B0058A119G|5.0|What a record!  How beautiful the voice.  Enriched with time, not diminished as some reviews would lead you to believe.  The music and melodies are gorgeous and only grow more addicting with each listen.  The lyrics?  Startling, mesmerizing and so moving.  I forgot how a listener could react and respond to a perfectly crafted song sung with genuine emotion.  Don't miss this.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Pretty good puzzle type game. Not a bad way to pass the time or avoid working. I have it on my Galaxy P7510 and runs just fine, though at first it looks like it will only run in a phone-sized window. Actual play is full screen.
B004V5QWU2|3.0|The gaps of silence every few seconds when the tracks loop back to the beginning are extremely distracting and actually produce the opposite effect.  This only seems to happen on the paid version for some reason.
B004W48QFG|2.0|The setup instructions were adequate for connecting device to a wireless network but look out if you're interested in using 3G connection. I don't have a strong knowledge of network design and the setup instructions are not that helpful. Support is a joke! I've been sending emails along with screen shots of router settings in hopes to get some setup help. I wish I had explored PhoneMyPC before investing in this app. I followed the recommendation of setting up a DNS account. Everytime I try to make a connection over 3G I get a time out without any errors to flag what is causing the problem. I've made sure I was in a strong 3G signal location just to see if that was my problem but no luck. This is an expensive app and it should be expected to come with good support. Buyer beware, especially if your looking for something that it is a no brainer for setup.     PS: I would appreciate any help in getting my 3G connection problem resolved.
0345529057|5.0|Gripping and hard to put down.  Martin writes in an easy to read fashion which makes the books qualify as \\"page turners.\\"
B004EPZ06G|5.0|This is a very funny film. Thailand is depicted well and is a hilarious setting for this well-acted comedy. I saw it before watching the first one and was very pleasantly surprised. Not for the prudish- be warned!
B005LY4B0A|2.0|Yes I know that complaining about a game is stupid but considering that there are no instructions on how exactly to earn 3 stars other than cut a web is stupid. At least Cut The Rope and Angry Birds explain the rules of the game in-depth.
0316044695|5.0|This is an amazing book, is a great read! unable to put it down. Marcus is able to tell a story that is hard for many to want to hear or read, and as a former service memeber and current spouse of a soldier who has deployed many times, it was sooo much more for me. The story made me want to wince, laugh, cry, cheer and shout all at the samee time. to hear the actual story of all that he went through before getting to that lonely ridge makes it easy to understand why there was no way he would ever give up. So many may not agree with the mission, the prupose, or the \\"politics\\" of the situation, but you can not deny that this is a story about one mans love of Brothers and Country. Would recommend this to any military member, spouse, or someone who would like to see a little of the human side and cost of this battle.
B005974CNA|2.0|Wow,what a huge disappointment.I don't like giving long reviews so I'll make my points.One,FAR too many ballads,I'm almost falling asleep as I'm listening to this as I write.Looks like this band has really dropped the prog metal scepter once and for all.This release will go into my cd graveyard along with the last 3 releases.This band needs to seriously consider retiring.Portnoy is gone and they will never be the same.They will never write albums like Awake or I&W or even Falling again.They have run out of creativity and idea's and It's like they are the Brett Favre of the prog mteal genre and don't know when to quit before they continue to embarrass themselves.Mike Mangini is OK,a bit overrated and definetly not Portnoy.This will be the LAST release I will buy from this band.While a couple of songs are OK,the rest is pure uninspiring doodling filler with no direction.I may be criticized for this but I'm hardly a new fan.I have been drummer for 25 years and I have followed this band since It's inception and have seem them 3 times in concert back when they were worth seeing.They could do better but maybe they CAN'T,maybe It's time to call it a career if they can't give fans more for their money anymore.I would recommend to all new or old DT fans to check out MYRATH,this is an awesome creative relatively new band that is way more entertaining than anything DT has put out recently.Can't wait for the new album in October.Sorry DT,I think you guys need to take a long look in the mirror and read what a lot of your fans are saying about you.As for Portnoy,I think after hearing this new release he will conclude they can't continue without him.One more thing,Rudess needs to freaking take a back seat for awhile and give the constant soloing a break and Myung needs to seriously step up and BE HEARD.So much talent going to waste.
030788743X|5.0|This book was written for those who were raised in the 80's. It encapsulates everything he pays homage to and throws it into this futuristic world with amazing clarity.

B003CFBQBW|2.0|This is a very good album, and it came in a very reasonable amount of time, was in perfect condition, as purchased/expected.  Love most of the artists on this album, which related well to the movie. Movie was very good, despite the deep-set teenage angst that riddles the Meyer books.
B004EPZ09S|3.0|Went to see this tonight, it is an ok movie, and not what the trailers make it out to be. There is little suspense, but I have seen worse movies. Like \\"Ferocious Planet\\" or \\"Arctic Blast.\\" (Which never pretended to be anything more than a made for tv B movie.)    1. There are a couple of completely unnecessary plot lines, that by the end of the movie are unresolved and just kind of left dangling. It's like they took several movie scripts, and tried to combine them into one. It would have been better to stick with one or two points of view, than trying to juggle so many different movie types.     2. At the beginning of the movie, there is a completely unrealistic scene of a doctor telling someone that their loved one is dead in a kind of offhand, \\"I've got better things to be doing than talking to scum like you\\" way. Like they were not worth his time, he failed to keep the patient alive, oh well, gotta go onto the next one. Little things like that that really throw you out of the movie reality and back into ours. (there were more, but that one was the one that really stood out)    3. Matt Damon's character is a bland, scared little sheep, waiting for the shepherd to tell him what to do. Sadly, this is one of the most realistic parts of the movie.    Not bad for watching at home, but not worth the $17 for two tickets. Won't be watching it again.

0307887898|5.0|I've been practicing Lean/Six Sigma for 7+ years now, and found this book to be a refreshing, new application of the Lean toolset to something far outside of the typical places. I've seen it in government, manufacturing, and healthcare, but never applied to the concept of a startup business - and I really like it. I do think it goes beyond Lean, however, into using a more data-driven aspect to startups instead of what feels good. The author spends considerable time talking about experimentation as one of the key tools of a Lean startup. Great stuff to read, and reminiscent of other recent books like Super Crunchers - about how analytics can help solve problems.     Pros:  - Easy to read and well-written, even for people not familiar with startups or lean concepts  - Applies an existing methodology in a new an innovative way  - Not full of random, non-actionable crap like most business books - these are simple, proven tools that can be applied immediately  - Not full of jargon, endless 2x2 matrixes, or anything similar. Just straightforward.    Cons:  - It's a bit short, but he uses it well, so I won't knock points off for that. hehe. ;)

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Such an awesome collection! It is beyond perfect!! The image is splendid and so is the audio! You can find many deleted scenes from every single movie in the extras. I don't know why people keep on complaining. Watch your VHS instead if it makes you happier. This saga does not deserve 1-stars but 5! Come on! It's Star Wars!
B0050SYS5A|4.0|Before I could only play kinect with the back of my legs touching the sectional behind me. I couldn't move it back because it was tearing up the carpet. I did not care to rearrange my living room so I could play a few video games.  Mine is 2-3 feet of the ground in front of the tv. I've tested on fruit ninja, kinect adventures and dance central.   Only issue I have is now it seems I am closer to the tv than I wanted to be but I am able to actually play it.  I'm sure I'll probably run into some game in the future with issues but as long as I was able to get it to work on some I find it worth the 30 dollars.
B002BE7JE8|4.0|Good disc for solid horror story. Video is obviously not reference quality such as AVATAR,etc. for this classic and low budget horror.   Video is an upgrade and solid, as best could be expected for this title audio is fine too.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Fact:  In 1977, a movie called \\"Star Wars\\" was released.  Not \\"Episode IV - A New Hope\\", but just plain old \\"Star Wars\\".  It was a brilliant homage to classic sci-fi and fantasy serials with a compelling narrative, lovable characters, and cutting edge special effects for the time.  Unfortunately, this movie has never been released to anamorphic DVD or Blu-Ray disc formats, and it's an oversight that's unforgivable on the part of George Lucas.    Enough with the changes.  Steven Spielberg said, \\"For myself, I tried [changing a film] once and lived to regret it.  Not because of fan outrage, but because I was disappointed in myself. I got overly sensitive to [some of the reaction] to 'ET,' and I thought if technology evolved, [I might go in and change some things]. It was OK for a while, but I realized what I had done was I had robbed people who loved 'ET' of their memories of 'ET.'\\"  That hits the nail on the head.  Once a film is released, it belongs to us all, and it's wrong - actually, morally wrong - for George Lucas to continue to intentionally withhold \\"Star Wars\\" out of stubbornness to acknowledge the original films as the classic works of art that they are.  \\"Star Wars\\" was a groundbreaking, revolutionary film, and it deserves to be seen in HD format.    Release the originals, George.  Fully restored, 1080p.  We know you have them, and we know you have the technical know-how to do this.  If you can't bring yourself to do it, give it over to somebody else to restore.  In the meantime, I was 8 when I first saw \\"Star Wars\\" in 1977, and I grew up with your creations as well as Spielberg's.  Steven understands how to respect and sympathize with his fans, and you clearly do not.  Well, you have offended me for the last time, and the next Star Wars related purchase I make will not come until the originals - the REAL originals - are released.  Until then, I simply cannot recommend these bastardized versions of the classic movies.    (As for the prequels, they're someof the worst movies of the 2000s, and if they did not have the Star Wars name attached to them, they'd be forgotten by now.  Best avoided altogether.)
0385338910|5.0|I love Tropper's novels. They're funny yet poignant. His characters are very real and he really gets dysfunctional families. Can't recommend him enough. Trooper is often compared to Nick Hornby and Tom Perrotta and I think these comparisons are apt.
B000PMG16U|1.0|No Lucas politics here, just considering the films on their own merits.  And their merits are truly terrible.  These are awful films that, if the Star Wars name was not attached to them, would be forgotten by now, and mocked in the same breath with such movies as \\"Norbit\\", \\"The Cat In The Hat\\", \\"Catwoman\\" and \\"Battlefield Earth\\".  Gorgeous (and very artificial) visuals do not make a great movie all by themselves, and the original Star Wars trilogy understood this by utilizing special effects to serve the story and the characters.  These 3 movies have it all backwards as story and character take a back seat to the visuals, which while technically dazzling, ultimately leave the viewer emotionally cold and distant.  The narrative is a mess, and the dramatic tension almost non-existent, because we simply don't care about any of these one-dimensional characters and the nonsensical things they do.  The story and character decisions are mostly incomprehensible, and it's only in the third film that some of the mistakes of the first two films start to be rectified - but it's far too little, too late.  The spellbinding fun and gravitas of the original trilogy is completely absent here, and it's like the two trilogies were made by two entirely different filmmakers.  (Actually, that statement may not be far from the figurative truth.)    George Lucas was once a brilliant auteur, but it's clear that he's since lost his touch and no longer knows how to make a great film.  However, if a video game company ever needs  some great visuals to go along with a game project, Lucas might be the guy for the job.  Unfortunately, great video game visuals aren't what I want in my gritty Star Wars movie watching experience.  Ignore the 4 and 5 star reviews, these movies simply suck.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is great and very addictive. I find myself trying to 3 star every round before moving on. This one actually makes you think, unlike the birds. Reminds me of Cut the Rope. Even my 6 year old is loving this game on the Galaxy Tab.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I got my copy and watched the first movie with my wife.  The picture was amazing on my 50 inch plasma. The sound on my 7.1 was riveting.  Jar Jar held up very well and the lightsaber battles didn't look effects heavy, it looked \\"real\\" or believable is more like it.  The Menu Screen was ok.  Nice, tight, but ehh bland.... I do miss the THX setup tool from the original DVD's. It may be found with the extras though.    There are a couple of things that I do not recall noticing from the theater or DVD version, one is Darth Maul speaking.  I never really cared for TPM, too much setup not enough story in my mind.  He may have spoken before, but somehow I don't think so.  I will have to check the DVDs at some point.  Another was the pod racers reving their engines prior the race starting.  Again, maybe was there before, maybe it is the better sound now.  Any other changes blended right in and I didn't notice them (or recall them now if I did) from my viewing.  One strange thing is that I found Jake Lloyds acting to be, well, better.  Don't know why that is.  Maybe because I am a decade older and view the acting styles differently.  But I now think he did a fine job with the script he was handed.    I will do a review for each one as I watch them. I must say however, that I am glad I dropped the 80 bucks on it.  I can't understand why people are hating on this for minor changes made by GL to HIS movies.  These movies are not OUR artistic or intellectual property.  They are HIS.  Everything I have seen so far blends in or is an improvement.    Episode 2: Honest, I really didn't see any major changes from the DVD / Theater release.  What I did see was a huge amount of background detail!  You can make out the background characters, they are doing whacky things at times, check out Dex's diner.  The human waitress actually looks like she is in a diner.  C3-PO when he falls in the factory does NOT look like a cartoon!  The movie looked very polished.  Things looked used and wornin.  The colors during the speeder chase where very realistic.  I was constantly looking around at the scenes, saying to myself \\"hey I didn't notice that before.\\"  I could not tell if things where added in, or are just now drawing the eye because of the detail.  The one thing I did not care for is that the romance still feels forced at times between Padme and Anakin.  The visuals and sound are on par with my Episode 1 review above.    One thing I was thinking about is people complaining about the explosions.  Really folks, if you are that concerned about them looking realistic, maybe you should consider that we have no idea what materials and gases are going into said explosion?  That being said, I really enjoyed the asteroid belt chase sequence for its visual effects and explosions. :) Oh and the surround sound for the sonic explosion was floor shaking.  If you are that much of a purist though, why aren't you complaining that there should be no sound in space??????      So to repeat what others have said, only review the movie if you have seen it!  Do you really think your review calling for a boycott will gain traction?  For every one of you who are closed minded, there are 20 others willing to buy this release and watch it.  Trust me, GL don't care if you decide not to give him your money.    More to come soon.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I hope George Lucas will give the fans what they want ... The original theatrical version.  After watching this version of the trilogy, I had to dust off and watch the old VHS versions to \\"correct\\" the damage.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|If it was not for the high graphics quality this game would stink.  It has trouble loading.  I get the application isn't responding 60% of the time when opening the program.  The timer is off by a few minutes.  it is not a give minute hint timer.  One hint a day and a seven minute hint timer is not a good idea.  This game is pretty easy in general, the hint system helps people to keep playing and not uninstalling and giving this a one star.
0385534639|5.0|I'm not even sure where to start talking about this book! I don't really know what I expected when I first picked it up, but I knew it had a beautiful cover and lots of buzz (not hype, but buzz) among the book blogging community.<br /><br />I was confused at first with reading, the book not only jumps from character to character - even putting the reader as a character at times - but from year to year, with no real method to the madness. Yet somehow, all this hopping works. It works, well, magically.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern does a fabulous job of describing the circus, you can smell and feel it as though you are there with her wonderful descriptions. There are several predictable moments, but many that had my gasp out loud through the book.<br /><br />What I loved about this book:<br /><br />  Bailey! I think he was my absolute favorite character in this, although I can't quite put my finger on why. (With Poppet and Widget being a close second!)<br />  The circus atmosphere. I seem to love all things circus... Water For Elephants is one of my favorite books, and I think this one probably ranks in my top ten.<br />  The Clock - the description of this clock was absolutely amazing. I even had a dream about it the night I started reading!<br />  The love story revolving around Marco and Celia which was the heart of the book; although I love how beautifully Erin Morgenstern makes it blend in well with the rest of the storyline.<br />  The flow of time. Just the way everything in this book meshes together, and takes it's place. I found myself totally satisfied by the end of the book, although sad it was over.<br /><br />What I didn't Love:<br /><br />  The Challenge itself, I found it a slight bit confusing until the very end. I'm sure that was the point; but it was rather frustrating for me at times.<br />  Chandresh. I just didn't care for his personality, although I understand why he was the way he was.<br /><br />The Night Circus was such a wonderful read, I took my time with it and cherished each word.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|There's only one thing magical about the Star Wars franchise - its ceaseless ability to make untold millions from twelve hours of mostly mediocre filmmaking. These movies will continue to be released in a never-ending, Orwellian-like milieu of 'super special editions' and 'ultimate collector's tin box sets' all gobbled up by legions of vapid fans who should have moved on decades ago to pursue something more cerebral, like collecting Beanie Babies.     To think a slightly \\"sharper\\" transfer or a few fleeting seconds of unseen celluloid that should have stayed on the cutting room floor repeatedly sells these tired films to the same lost souls wishing to relive an imagined childhood they likely never had is the true triumph of George Lucas's vision; a vision of insatiable greed fueled by the sophomoric whims of a generation of pudding heads.    The icing on this foul tasting crumb of Miss Havisham's cake, however, is the hilariously appropriate middle finger Mr. Lucas has shoved squarely up the posterior end of the lemmings who've been lining his pockets these last thirty years. His unwillingness to throw his throng of benefactors one stinking bone in the form of unaltered theatrical releases perfectly illustrates his utter disdain for those who gave him the ability to live as the narcissistic prince of his Neverland Ranch.     Of course there's little need to worry; once sales from this latest debacle begin to wane, you can bet the new 'double secret' set of the same movies will be headed to the local Walmart. In the words of that great religious icon of yore, Reverend Kenobi, \\"who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?\\"
B0034G4P80|4.0|Jane, seizing the moment to grab that deep kiss at the end, nails it; that moment is the real hammerdinger in the picture, a real but all-too-brief pulse-racer, quite a nice erotic surprise considering he's basically an antiseptic hero type...and the promise to \\"come back for you\\" is, I hope, a spark of a tease for a sequel in which he brings the lowly mortal up to his level of godly athleticism, engendering a deadly triangle amid the tangle of egos...or something.  That guy Hemsworth is HOT, and sweet, brilliant Natalie Portman as a humble astrophysicist complements him nicely.  Don't care what the naysayers say, I enjoyed this movie. as much for the sneaky heat as for the electrifying special effects.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|i agree this game starts off slow but gets really good.  the graphics are very good and the music makes all that more entertaining.

B0058S0OMS|3.0|As many have metioned, if you know Halloween 2 1981, (NOT the insane Crappy Rob Zombie mess)then there is no need to talk about the movie itself,  All die-hard fans of the franchise adore this flick.  Now on the the PQ,Audio and Special features review.<br /><br />As most Halloween die-hards, were hoping for a bit more here. Granted the PQ is a slight upgrade over the DVD, it is a wonder why Universal could'nt take some time to remaster the transfer with a bit more time.  I am sure it is pretty easy to remove scartches/dirt from the negative so we don't get white specks all over the screen every 1/2 second (it's like watching a VHS with tracking issues.  In one sceen where Lance Guest is talking with Stroid in her room there was a bunch of grain on the wall and the image became so unsharp it was horrible.  The audio was a great improvment, but why processed 5.1 DTS, this is Blu-ray, which can handle loseless audio, which seems to defeat the purpose on putting this out on BR.  I can see 2.0 DTS and a lossless 5.1, to give the fans a closer to the theatrical edition.  I think the loseless would've given the sountrack a bit more punch.  So if you your going to boast a 3oth Anv. edition, than make the transfer PQ and audio a 30th upgrade.  The picture could've been much much cleaner and sharper, I know this was shot analog, but if star wars can look this good from 1977 then 1980 halloween should atleast be much improved.<br /><br />The special featurse are much more by comparison to the DVD, but again a 30th Anv. should have more thought behind the specal features, thats why there called (SPECIAL FEATURES).  We got Deleted scenes IE addtional TV scenes added due to deleted stuff that cannot air on TV. I understand not widescreen, since they were set for 4x3 tv's and quality is not bad, I was just hoping they would include the Rick Rosenthal cut in hidef or the R rated verson with the TV scenes added.  Who cares about Terror In The Aisles, that could've been issued by itself.  How about some Documentries, how about a doc called Halloween 2 30 years later, with current innerviwes with cast that are availble, with a count from the director and crew with a detailed malking, how about even a trailer more stuff that had to do with halloween 2.  I even thought the cover art was bad, I like the Pumkin, with the old logo and said more of the night he came home.  Universal could've find some stuff in the vaults.  Surely 30 years could of produced more.  I hear Halloween 3 is due next for hidef, I hope they give us more than just a catilogue tittle.  As we always wish for more, maybe these studio excecs. would read fans message boards or give us an oppurtunity to voice our opinions before they put together stuff, I guess they wouldn't be able to double and triple dip tittles.  Just my thoughts.<br /><br />If you are interested in discussing or want to contribute information you might have on this reissue feel free to e-mail me at mikesippie@yahoo.comsome Documentries, how about a doc called Halloween 2 30 years later, with current innerviwes with cast that are availble, with a count from the director and crew with a detailed malking, how about even a trailer more stuff that had to do with halloween 2.

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Kind of says it all that my favorite character was the house.  It at least showed some spunk...unlike the protagonist.  (Besides all the eating and sleeping, she spent an inordinant amount of time either unconscious or simply being carried about.)<br /><br />I share the sentiments of those who feel the book needed a strong editor.  It also badlly needed a fact checker, because the screw-ups were jarring.  (eg.  The whole thing about the absorbed twin...Male and female twins are fraternal, which means two placentas.  \\"Absorbed twin\\", like Siamese twins, involves a problem with the division/separation of identical twins...one placenta.)<br /><br />All in all an irritating book, which with proper editing probably has a decent enough story being needlessly stretched out to make a trilogy.
0446560065|5.0|Simon's Cat is a series of cartoons about the cat Simon. Some are funny and some are just observational. There is no text, just drawings. This book is perfect for cat lovers. My 6 year-old absolutely loves it and we read it at bedtime coming up with stories to go with the pictures, but I also love reading it on my own. I actually have the second book, and I would say the second book is funnier. But this book is great too.
B005974CNA|5.0|I've had a love hate relationship with DT since Images and Words first came out.  Case in point, I've never been able to get through an entire DT album without either skipping songs or having to listen to it in chunks....until now.  DToE is the the FIRST time I've been wrapped up in a DT from start to finish.  Personally I 100% believe it was Portnoy's departure that allowed the band to do this. If he's like the person he potrays in interviews, I could see him being difficult to work with. A kind of \\"well you know, this is MY band\\" kind of thing.  But who knows.    Also, I've always had issue with DT being called a \\"prog\\" band.  In the early days, they were labled this just because they had keyboard/synth and had a guy that sang operatically.  The songs were more 'powermetal' than anything else to me.  Dramatic Turn however ,actually \\"feels\\" progressive.  HUGE, dramatic dynamics within a single song. Equal parts simple and complex. The balance between metal and prog rock is perfect and I am energized as a fan again.  Theres definitely something for everyone on this album.  An excellent introduction to the band if you happen to be a new fan. Start here and go straight to Images and Words and work forward.

B00007LTIA|5.0|Im going to be 53, unbelievible.My priorities have changed. I listen to music more than I have in years and yet am selling off a lot of my vinyl and CDs. Weeding the stuff that i just do not think I will listen to again. Sometimes stuff just dousnt age will. Red wine vs white wine. Ive owned thousands of pieces and now am under a thousand in my personal collection. I now have a few MP3 players for use at work. Thats the picture. I bought this when it came out and had several other yes lps in my already growing collection. I also had a subsciption to Rolling Stone back then when they were a decent paper. They gave it a big thumbs down. I thought they were crazy. I loved this set from the first listen and it is the only Yes on my MP3 players. It will stay in the collection, as it has lost none of its magic. All that said, \\"Its not for everyone\\". I dont think its bloated or indulgent at all, just great creative music by some very interesting musicians.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|This is a classic. I am thrilled to see this on BluRay. The sound quality and the hi definition video are great. Amazon service was great as always.

All in all very snappy performance, just wish I could have gotten more out of it. Have my vcore around 1.4 now, probably could get higher with more voltage but not interested in frying the proc.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|First let me state that I am a big fan of the series but am very disappointed in the direction the last 2 books have taken. I'm 3/4 through this book and have completely lost interest and lost track of half the characters. Most of the new characters are shallow and could easily have been left out. So far, most of the original characters are barely mentioned or not even mentioned at all. Mr Martin, get back to the basics of your original book, please.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|I wish developers kept tablet users in mind when creating fun games like this. game does not fit screen. glaxey tab 10.1 users dont bother downloading untill they fix.
B001UV4XWY|3.0|What the hell was this? Its starts out very slow and the acting right off the bat is awful, mostly due to Cameran Diaz. It slowy gets better as it goes along and you do finally get into it. Then something happens with a landing on Mars and all the sudden the movie goes into a whole other realm. A wtf realm? Its confusing from beginning to end, nothing really makes any sense? Are they aliens or what the hell? You do get into, but in the end it just does not deliver the goods.
B0041KKYH4|1.0|I wanted to like this movie, but my friend, Cameron Diaz cannot carry a movie, and poor Justin Timerblake was poorly cast as the geeky sidekick.<br />Save your money and leave this one at the store.
