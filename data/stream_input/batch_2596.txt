B008XBCJ34|4.0|Rating is for 3-D effect.  Did not care for the show.  Bought a 3-D TV not realizing how few shows would be made in 3-D and those that are made are either children movies, sci-fi or violent movies.  Good 3-D movie was Titanic---movie was not only good so was the 3-D effects.
159463176X|5.0|A Must. Have to read it.[[ASIN:1453633448 Silent Victims: Arab and Muslim Americans Post 9/11]]Khaled Hosseini's And the Mountains Echoed begins simply enough, with a father recounting a folktale to his two young children. The tale is about a young boy who is taken by a div (a sort of ogre), and how that fate might not be as terrible as it first seems--a brilliant device that firmly sets the tone for the rest of this sweeping, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting novel.

B00908DDZM|5.0|This album is amazing. I absolutely love every song here (except BomBom, but that one is still pretty good)! Here are some you definitely don't want to miss:<br /><br />CAN'T HOLD US: I would honestly pay the full album price just to get this song. This song is my absolute favorite song ever, and it gets me so PUMPED!<br /><br />THRIFT SHOP: Go listen. Just do it.<br /><br />SAME LOVE: The heartfelt song about gay rights is a masterpiece.<br /><br />WING$: Great song about consumerism.<br /><br />STARTING OVER: An amazing song about exactly what it sounds.<br /><br />COWBOY BOOTS: This one is really upbeat and fun.<br /><br />One of the best things about this album is how much it's about. Most albums these days are all about love and relationships, but this one has a song about virtually everything: gay rights (Same Love), believing in yourself (Can't Hold Us), loss (Thin Line), consumerism (Wing$), and much more. This album is varied and just a ton of fun.

B00BIVN82M|3.0|It's my first time purchasing a Michael Buble album, didn't realize it was mostly older songs he is covering - but that's my fault. Did not like the duet with Reese Witherspoon - terrible combo - made my co-workers say &#34;what the hell is that?&#34; He has an awesome voice though, so i'm going to have to look for the albums with his own songs on it.
B0062YADWI|5.0|This item arrived on time, but is slightly different from the one pictured.<br /><br />I like the new design BETTER!<br /><br />Basically both ends of the clip are flattened out.<br /><br />This clip is one of the easiest clips to attach to my belt loop that I have ever used. Since the end (the end shown at the top of the picture) is now flattened out I can have my case for my ear buds, my keys, and a small leatherman knife all hang there together without \\"bunching up\\".<br /><br />As something I use every day I am VERY happy.
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|A well written book that addresses every little detail of the mixing process. The basics anyway. I'm sure that Mike Senior has kept some secrets to himself, but what he reveals in this book is more than enough to get you going and develop one or two secrets of your own.

I have one major flaw though in this app there's no sleep mode so the only way for it to shut off by its self is for the battery to run out. This needs a sleep funtion. Hello it's a premium it needs some pazaz.<br /><br />The thing that I love about this is the peace and tranquillity of it. The abilty to mix nosies is pure genius. The sounds you have though of are clever and effective. The number of sounds you have is awesome. The also sound so real and full. Almost like I have your chanting monks in my room.<br /><br />if you have trouble falling asleep you need to get this app. Or at least the free one.

B00COHAUD4|2.0|i consider myself to very open whenit comes to a horror, thriller or generally a \\"scary\\" movie. But this has to be one of the worst \\"scary;jump out your skin\\" kinda movie. Only reason i gave it 2 stars is that the acting was held up pretty well and the visual effects were pretty neat. Other than that it is VERY far fetched and plot was disappointing. All about a pissed off dead mom wanting her daughter back. and trust me, thats not giving the movie away. Enjoy

B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I heard reviews were not so good, but this did not matter. Had to watch it at least 3-4 times.  Probably a few more times before the extended version comes out in Dec. 2014.<br />I read this and The Lord of the Rings when I was 12 and recovering from a broken leg.  The books have been replaced twice and reread many times since.  Next step is to add to my Kindle library.<br />Now I expected the movie to be different than the book and accept the creative differences needed to put the book on the &#34;big screen&#34; so I am not disappointed.  It was well done and I cannot wait for the next installment.<br />Love how the dwarf characters have been represented. Glad to see Gandalf again.  Bilbo was a little different and I did have a hard time getting use to him but he was still likable which is important.<br />Everyone who likes Tolkien's works should watch with an open mind and enjoy.  I know J.R.R. Tolkien would have!

B00DF0POXA|5.0|Kanye never makes the same record twice. If you have actually listened to his previous five albums, each is totally different from the one that proceeded it. This album is like the anti - Twisted Fantasy, which was full of horns and huge orchestras and choruses. This is gritty, this is in-your-face, this is confrontational, this is challenging. If you like your rap to be all pretty, then stick with Twisted Fantasy, but don't call yourself a Kanye fan; you are a fan of that album. Change is good, and although this album takes a few listens to actually get used to, once you do, you won't be able to stop listening. There is a lot of good music out there which will never be on the radio, as nothing from this will ever be, but that is not a bad thing. This could almost be compared to the sea-change of Radiohead, following up OK Computer with Kid A. Don't be scared, but don't hate if you aren't ready yet. Educate yourself with actual good music.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I had pre-ordered this book and like many of you could not wait for it!! After the release I read some of the reviews and I was very worried about the book. Everyone talking about a huge cliff hanger at the end and how horrible the book was. I disagree. A lot of our questions from the first two books were answered and I love how Gideon and Eva grow in this book. They are able to trust and love each other in a way they could not in the first two books. They are growing together as a couple and its beautiful! Gideon is so romantic in this book it makes my heart melt. I love the way he is always thinking of Eva and the romantic things he says to her.<br /><br />At first, I was shocked to hear this series would not be a trilogy. I waited a long time for the third book thinking it would be the last. Especially when I was reading about another cliff hanger at the end of this book. But now I am excited! I love Gideon and Eva's relationship and I am excited to see where Sylvia takes them! I will agree that I did feel at times this book was drawn out but I did not mind learning more about Megumi. If there is a spin off series with her I would buy it. I like when authors do that. It gives us a chance to learn more about a character we are already comfortable with.<br /><br />Overall I thought the book was good and if you have read the first two in the series I do not think it's a waste of money for you to purchase this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed it. Makes you think and has some challenging aspects to it. Works really great on the Kindle Fire.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|What an amazing book.  It just confirms its the little things in life is that matter.  Once you start reading you do not to put it done.  Just wonderful.
0761166173|3.0|This is a super cute book to read but the larger sized lap edition was a mistake.  My 8 month old likes to turn the pages of the books herself and this one is so big that she often whacks herself in the face with it.  I have to hold it out very far away from her body when I read it so it doesn't hit her.<br /><br />Get the little book though, the story is cute.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|This graphic novel is wonderful in all facets. Filled with strong dialogue, captivating images and purposeful plot, Watchmen left me in awe. Though I was afraid that Watchmen would follow the usual plot of comic book heroes, thankfully, the book ended with an un-foreseen beauty.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|The book and the DVD I ordered to both my daughters after I read it, watched it and was completely blown away.  I was counting the days that it would arrive so I could hand it to them.<br />My younger one is having it in her bag and taking it with her everywhere: when she has a minute, she reads and re-reads it.<br />It is an amazing book! Don't wait: read it TODAY!!!<br />It came pretty quick! Great service

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I read numerous reviews before purchasing this book. Heres my take: although i am totally in agreement that this change in decision by the author to add more books to what was billed as a trio is pretty sketchy and unlikely to have more behind it than pure desire to capitalize financially on the series becomming popular plus the fact that  the book ended abruptly and in a way that doesnt make much sense, i can assure you that if you loved book one and two, believe me you will love this one too. For most it is the principle of the matter and calls ethics in to play but if you just love to read a story that truly draws you in to an escape from everyday life and you can ignore the drama, then this is a five star in my opinion. I love this authors style across genres, especially period literature romance and this is just another example of her fine talent. I know you want to read it but are afraid youll end up pissed like the other reviewers, but it doesnt have to be that way, you already know this isnt a final of three and you already know it ends at an odd cutoff. (The author decides to tell you at the end there are two more books to come, instead of warning you at the beginning like she should have) i checked occasionally to see where i was and when i was getting toward the end i prepared myself and i was not upset at the end. I think the author can make it up to her fans by hurrying up with the next book and by cutting the pricepoint to closer to five bucks to show her readers that she respects this could have been handled better. She earned four or five stars for keeping the story compelling and the intimate scenes spicy but loses one or two stars for creating drama and upsetting her fans. In the end, i say read it, its everything and more of what you loved about the first books in this series.

B000001EL3|4.0|Like a million years ago (well, thirteen-seven, to be exact), way back in the day of 1976, Hershey's chocolate bars cost only fifteen pennies, television was NOT dominated by low-budget reality shows, and nobody had even heard of MTV. Boy, was that the day. The mid-seventies were also a noteworthy time because the members of Kiss were also excellent musicians. That is not to say that Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley, and Peter Criss aren't still accomplished instrumentalists today, just that they were all more committed to the band. (See, because 1976 was also long before the band self-released like a zillion \\"best of\\" compilations, Gene was not on a reality T.V. show, himself, and there were not yet any side-projects -- i.e. see Paul Stanley's eponymous solo projects -- stemming from Kiss.)<br /><br />All of which might explain why 1976's \\"Destroyer\\" is such an enormous success that it is. The band have an undivided attention, and they focus their efforts on mastering the art of original guitar licks, excellent solos, and prominent, muscular bass lines. Paul's vocals are also of note, as they are heard wailing away potently, and seemingly without end. These things make \\"Destroyer\\" an album that put Kiss on the same page as other Seventies hard rock/heavy metal titans, including Black Sabbath, Def Leppard, Aerosmith, and Motorhead (to name only a few).<br /><br />A creepy intro opens \\"Detroit Rock City,\\" with a clip of the news report detailing the death of a youth in a motorcycle accident, followed by the sound of an engine gunning. The rest of the band then kick in with beeping, propulsive, and almost funky-sounding bass lines, wailing guitar leads, heavy, punching hooks, and a crashing drum beat. This song, the album opener, also boasts a decent guitar solo section, and an irresistibly catchy, hit-single-worthy (and soon to be concert favorite) chorus, as well. But the album is at its best when it is at its heaviest, as evidenced by big-riff rockers like \\"God Of Thunder\\" (which has a surprisingly dissonant, wild, shredding solo and fairly mean, aggressive, and raspy-sounding vocals to boot), \\"Flaming Youth\\" (a fist-pumpable metal anthem with memorable choruses and a ripping solo), the AC-DC-esque \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" (which is backed by meaty, churning licks and infectious, sing-songy vocals), and \\"Do You Love Me.\\"<br /><br />But with that said, there are a couple of ballads to be had, here, and they aren't half bad, either. Take, for example, \\"Great Expectations,\\" a song that, despite boasting a big, fat, hard-rockin' main guitar hook, is still a mostly restrained near ballad, and one that mainly gets by on melodic vocals and gently-strummed melodic strings. However the inclusion of a piano (in the background) is a nice touch, too, and \\"Great Expectations\\" even goes as far as to drop in a symphonic-sounding arrangement/choir near its end. And the other example is \\"Beth,\\" a depressing, and fairly calm and ambient (and very subdued) ballad that compliments its piano, backing orchestra, and limpid singing with moody violin flourishes. It all makes for one emotional, if not a bit maudlin, and very moving number.<br /><br />And the last handful of tracks that round out the record are also pretty good -- at least enough so for them to worth commenting on. \\"King Of The Knight Time World\\" is an up-tempo hard-rocker centered around of really sturdy (and almost rock-hard) rhythms comprised of churning guitars, thumping drums, and steady, humming bass lines. The song, naturally, features another extremely good and catchy chorus, but it is almost (if not quite) overshadowed by its use of a surprisingly good and fiery, speed/power metal-influenced solo from Ace. And skipping ahead a few tracks, there are strong, grumbling bass lines prominent all throughout \\"Sweet Pain,\\" as there are rhythmically bobbing guitar hooks and some screaming soloing (even if it is mostly pushed to the back of the mix).  And the set comes to a fitting conclusion with the inclusion of a hidden bonus track, a live rendition of \\"Rock And Roll Party\\" (included on the 1997 reissue of the album).<br /><br />No review of any Kiss recording would probably ever be complete without mentioning that the band members have never been seen in any press release or promotional photo without grease paint covering ever inch of each one of their faces. But this is just one more excuse to overlook the fact that they are one of the best and most influential hard rock/heavy metal groups of all time, and one that is entirely capable of producing albums (like this one) that are not only excellent slabs of shock/pop-metal, but albums that are also very good in their own right. This, along with the already-established fact that they are darn fine musicians (and songwriters) is evident all throughout \\"Destroyer\\"'s ten tracks.onclusion with the inclusion of a hidden bonus track, a live rendition of \\"Rock And Roll Party\\" (included on the 1997 reissue of the album).<br /><br />No review of any Kiss recording would probably ever be complete without mentioning that the band members have never been seen in any press release or promotional photo without grease paint covering ever inch of each one of their faces.

B00D6GT5S8|3.0|I've been following Sigur Rós since () came out, and they've grown to be one of my favorite bands. I was sad to see Kjartan depart the band and I was a bit worried that his departure would leave a gap in the sound. It's difficult to tell based on one release, so I hope it's not the case. However, after listening to the singles for Kveikur over the last couple of months and now the complete album, I think this might be my least favorite album of theirs - and I do hope this is not a sign of things to come.<br /><br />In a large part, Kveikur is a bit like so-so pop melodies put over noisier-than-usual Sigur Rós music, with somewhat simpler, more \\"pop\\", arrangements. Not that that's a bad thing, it's just far from their best effort. Sounds range from \\"industrial\\" (Brennisteinn, Kveikur) to the Valtari sounding \\"Var\\" to the almost U2 sounding Rafstraumur. Imagine the second half of \\"Saeglopur\\" from Takk (you know, after the drums kick in) and that's what a lot of this album reminds me of (in mood and feel)...and unfortunately, Saeglopur isn't one of my favorite Sigur Rós songs.<br /><br />I've enjoyed all of their albums and concert videos. I find me listening to the audio version of Heima and () the most. I have a feeling Kveikur will be getting listened to the least.<br /><br />All-in-all. I think this album is just a little too \\"pop\\" for my tastes. I love the noise and percussion, but it just seems like it's missing something - I just hope it's not Kjartan that I'm missing, because I doubt he's coming back. Looking forward to their next release though.<br /><br />Long time fans, of course, will want to get this album. If you're newer to Sigur Rós, listen to their other albums (I highly recommend () and the Heima DVD) first - unless you happen to like the more \\"pop\\" side of things - then, well, Kveikur might be your thing.<br /><br />While I appreciate that they're continuing to explore new sounds, this one just didn't seem to work as well. Highlights of Kveikur for me were Bláþráður and Var, the two last tracks.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I won't get into why this is such a great movie, enough people have done it for me.  What I mean to place emphasis is on how anyone can rank it a 1 star movie.  They need to re-evaluate what it is to be a one star movie.  A one star movie, to me, is something that is terribly made and unwatchable.  Two star, something you didn't like but not a complete waste of time.  A three star is worth seeing once and you will be ok with never seeing again.  Five star, something you can watch whenever you . . . all it takes if a suggestion or a whim.  Four star, somewhere in between 3 and 5.<br /><br />Anyone giving this a 1 is completely unreasonable and is a Trek Loyalist that hates this just because its change.

1400069742|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.<br />I am not a history buff, so I can't speak to historical accuracy, but I am sure you can find that in other reviews if you're wondering.<br />As for me, I thought the writing style was good and flowed well save for a few parts where it felt a tad tedious but nothing out of the norm for this type of book when it comes to my personal tastes.<br /><br />Somehow I do not think this is going to become a classic or anything, but I think if you like this type of book you will enjoy this particular one.<br /><br />I learned a lot of things that I had no idea went on in this era.  Either I wasn't paying attention in history class or this book gives a more thorough telling of the time period. I think its probably a little bit of both on that front. ;)<br /><br />I do like books about presidents and that is why I jumped on this book, though it is not my usual type of pick up.<br />One of my favorite books about a president is John Adams, the one they made into an HBO series. That was an incredible book and I would highly recommend you read that.  As for this I can definitely recommend it to people who like this type of book.

B00DGMVJAO|4.0|\\"Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum, I smell the blood.......\\"<br /><br />If I were talking to inquiring parents with young children I would say that this is no Disney telling of \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\". The film would have been pretty terrifying to me as a youngster (but no less enjoyable). I don't recall them showing anyone being eaten but the viewer, even the very young will undoubtedly realize that this is occurring. The giant \\"General\\" is extreme and even to this horror-film veteran his creepy 'sidekick' had an effect - it was grotesque and disturbing actually (the film \\"Basket Case\\" comes to mind.....seriously). There is definitely an end-to-all-good-things scenario going on - a literal devouring of Man - and PG-13 is an accurate rating although my parents would have rightfully let me watch it much younger but it depends on the child. My nephew is ten and he would not enjoy the intensity and fright at all.<br /><br />The theme of gallantry is apparent as is the universal fight against brutes. The heroes, villains, and monsters are there for those who want to simply watch a fairy-tale come to life visually in front of them.<br /><br />The scale of the film at times achieves the epic and I thought the giants looked great as did the effects in general. There are some heart-racing moments involving the many giants - some pretty impressive scenes. The human characters are classic, including a princess, but it's not cheesy although all is quite predictable regarding them, their motives, and their actions.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film but I do like a fantasy from time to time.
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Warner Bros. Home Entertainment celebrates the high-definition upgrade of \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\" with the release of all three movies in a special set. The trilogy is presented in a tin box with exclusive art developed for the collection. The Blu-rays are housed inside a single case within its collectible cradle.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the \\"Mad Max\\" movies by now, what are you waiting for? Any fan of action, sci-fi, or post-apocalyptic films will love all the entries in this franchise. You better get educated now before the upcoming video game and new movie, \\"Mad Max: Fury Road,\\" hits theaters and you're left in the dust wondering what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />The movies can be summed up quite easily. Max is an ex-police officer that gets caught up in other people's problems in a post-apocalyptic world where gas and other everyday commodities have become extremely scarce. In order to get these people out of trouble, he somehow always ends up in a fast-paced battle between futuristic weaponized cars built out of junkyard scraps. Just watching these vehicular skirmishes will provide therapy for anyone's road rage.<br /><br />One of the coolest things about the \\"Mad Max\\" trilogy is that every film is co-directed and co-written by the same person. Besides partially giving up the director's chair during production of \\"Beyond Thunderdome,\\" George Miller spearheaded each one. They all have a consistency many franchises lose between films because of changes in directors, writers, and the likes. Miller will continue to helm the next films in the series, \\"Mad Max: Fury Road\\" and \\"Mad Max: Furiosa.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mad Max\\" and \\"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior\\" both contain some unnecessary scenes of brief nudity. Who can forget the buttless chaps the one guy in \\"The Road Warrior\\" wears? Obviously, there's graphic sequences of violence and some bad language as well.<br /><br />I wish there was more to report as far as special features are concerned. Audio commentary by DP David Eggby, art director Jon Dowding, special effects supervisor Chris Murray, and film historian Tim Ridge is included on the \\"Mad Max\\" disc. It also contains a featurette entitled \\"'Mad Max:' The Film Phenomenon\\" and two theatrical trailers.<br /><br />\\"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior\\" features an introduction by Leonard Maltin and audio commentary with Director / Writer George Miller and Cinematographer Dean Semler. A theatrical trailer is included as well.<br /><br />\\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\" only has a theatrical trailer. I wonder why they didn't feature the two Tina Turner videos she made for the songs featured in the movie. Both \\"We Don't Need Another Hero\\" and \\"One of the Living\\" were top 20 hits.<br /><br />All three movies look and sound fabulous thanks to a great high-definition transfer. They have a clean picture while maintaining the grit and grime that made the movies so great when they first came out. Each one features a bombastic 5.1 surround sound mix that intensifies the roaring engines of the post-apocalyptic vehicles and highlights the excellent musical scores.<br /><br />Whether you're watching the \\"Mad Max\\" movies for the first or fiftieth time, these new high-definition transfers are the way to go. They've never looked and sounded better without losing the visual intensity and edge of their original theatrical releases. These Blu-ray versions are another perfect example of films being preserved without sacrificing their cinematic character.tary by DP David Eggby, art director Jon Dowding, special effects supervisor Chris Murray, and film historian Tim Ridge is included on the \\"Mad Max\\" disc.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app!!!!! Can't believe how accurate it is! I used to have weather bug for everything but surely changing to this one now!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app is easy but still fun. most games that u have to escape from some where I have to go to the Internet to find how to beat it. I like it a lot.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a very fun game. It is very addicting. But I can't get on my friends reef and I even have therefore names.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved the design &amp; so different from other games. awesome!! cant wait till they design more rooms to play - def going to tell people about this game!
0439023491|5.0|I had heard great things about \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins. So I decided to buy it from my local bookstore and read it. This was around the time that the film adaptation came out. However, I wanted to read the book first. And it was so hard to put down I finished it just a mere few days. I enjoyed it so much, I knew I had to buy the second installment in the series. I read this book in the car during a road trip and found it to be equally entertaining and gripping. With the suspense and cliffhangers, I know I will find myself purchasing the third book soon. Great book, you must give it a read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is awesome and fun!!  you have to solve awesome and hard puzzles and levels to advance to the next floor
B0013FSL0C|5.0|The episodes slowly evolve into an engaging whole, with each of the sessions building upon the previous ones. One is slowly pulled into the drama by the quality of the scripts and the excellence of the actors. Although each &#34;patient&#34; has a different story, Gabriel Byrne's character, the analyst, knits the episodes into a coherent theatrical piece.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased the workout video to tone up and it certainly is doing the trick! Level 1 is a good break-in which I stayed on for 2 weeks. I am now on Level 2 and it is tough! I feel great after the workouts, Jillian is an awesome instructor!
159463176X|3.0|I found this novel  fragmented.  It would have read better, I thought, if it was a collection of short stories.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Unbelievable true story with a great background from a German point of view. I was hooked from the first chapter and could not put it down. If you like WWII stories, this is a true story with a heartwarming ending. A must read!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Video quality - Exceptional<br />Performance quality - Exceptional<br />Music quality - Exceptional<br />Sound quality - Exceptional<br />The stunning video, performances, music and sound sucks you into another world...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not to hard. I enjoy games like this .it was easy enough for me to do without stressing out thanks needs more levels
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Excellent book!  A truly remarkable story that left me thinking of Adam Brown and his teammates even days after I put down the book.  I highly recommend it!
193700788X|4.0|I've read a lot of the reviews of this book.  Some reviews I skimmed prior to purchase.  Didn't want spoilers to wreck it for me.  I have loved this series in whole.  It isn't Twilight.  I am glad of that.  Which ever character you wanted to see Sookie end up with, she is a surviver and ends up on her feet.  The ending was satisfying.  Thank you Charlaine Harris for the thrill ride.  I am going to miss Sookie.  Sigh...
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Is this what I stayed up reading, to have this kind or ending?  This must be about selling books.  The next one better be good or you will lose your fan base.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like this game .9 years old and up would enjoy it. It is different from the first one. It has zip lines. It's just very fun.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great story.  Adam Brown is a courageous individual.  This is a story everyone should read.  This is a book I have a hard time putting down.
B004GTKP3S|4.0|Good but not a feel good Jane Austin type of production.  Great acting but you never really fall in love with any of the characters.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|Husband and I enjoyed it, He rarely watches a movie to the end but he did this one. And anything with Sam Elliott is good for me plus Mel Gibbson!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Good read but it jumps around a lot.  First two books much better.  However, it's an interesting look into a different lifestyle.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Definately the best album of 2013.this is real hip hop at its best. I wish i could shake the dudes hand. He never disappoints.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great Fun,  Play with friends and relatives.  It is easy to play and a new game starts each week.<br />Try it; You will like it
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Worst album ever released by kanye. I dont know what he was thinking. This is just noise. Save your money. Pick up born sinner instead
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this app is great and fun!!!! you should really get this app.if u love to develop this app is for you
B000VWYNOG|5.0|I listen to this CD every day.  I love it.  This is music diversified enough to have some upbeat songs and some to calm you down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I think this game is awesome.  I played 100 floors but this one is much better and I like how there are others rooms.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I don't see how anyone could NOT like this movie. If you dissect it based on the book, they were able to get so much right and still make it visually impressive. I could watch this three times in a row and still discover new things about it.
B00AYB1TP0|3.0|My two year old loves this game.  I like it because not only is it entertaining, but educational for him.  I don't like it because the app is not reliable. Sometimes it works.  Sometimes it doesn't.  I DO NOT recommend purchasing this app, stay with the Free version, it's more reliable.
0062255657|5.0|Easily my favorite NG book. It's like a fable for adults. Really wonderfully well-crafted story. No wonder NG is one of our generations most read authors. He is brilliant!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This app gives terrible weather forecasts. They can't even accurately predict the weather two days out. The radar is between 45 minutes and 1 hour old...which isn't great when there is a storm.  I am deleting this app and trying a different weather app.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|This movie was booring and I'm glad I didn't pay theater prices to see it.Certainly not a favorite! That's it.
193700788X|5.0|The long awaited series finale. Sookie finshes her vampire and fairy drauma. It is now time in her life to move into a peaceful era. Charlaine gets us there with many twists and turns. I love these books.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Arrived quickly, packaging was in great shape and both discs worked without issue<br />Met all expectations<br />Personal favorite between my kids and I for Disney films
B00006WKY9|1.0|The sound, URGH, MY EARS! This version, although it contains two extra bonus tracks, is a horrid, un-hearable remaster. It is compressed and sounds like utter and complete you know what. GET THE RCA. The RCA CD sounds very very nice. If you rather sacrifice good sound for two bonus tracks, be my guest, but you will be listening to a compressed CD the rest of your life. This HIP-O version is not worthy of Scorpions. Just get the 3 cd classic albums set that contains taken by force, virgin killer, and in trance, all RCA and excellent sounding.
B0001I561E|5.0|Arrived quickly, packaging was in great shape and both discs worked without issue<br />Met all expectations<br />Was shrink wrapped as expected for buying NIB
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Hanson's new album ANTHEM gives fans a little mix of everything they love about the band. From the harmonies, to the soulful sounds of \\"GTGB\\" and \\"Ive Got Soul\\" to the rock and roll sounds of \\"Fired Up\\" and \\"Cant Stop Us\\", Hanson has done a great job of keeping some of the old but bringing in a lot of the new. Hanson has prided themselves on their loyal fanbase, and this album gives a perfect example on how Hanson involves their fans in their music. Making it about the fans.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Arrived quickly, packaging was in great shape and both discs worked without issue<br />Met all expectations<br />Was shrink wrapped as expected for buying NIB
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game. It was the right mix of challenging and relaxing fun.  I would recommend giving it a shot.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Compelling. Mind riveting. I was really surprised. The ending.Will blow you away. A little slow start but worth it completely
B009RWRIKM|5.0|Wim Wenders, and Pina Bausch.<br />The DVD is incandescent, and should be seen by everyone in the arts.<br />Wish I had time to do it justice, but there are dance moves that<br />are original and mind blowing.
B00000FC5H|5.0|It is a great cd. Love it. I listen to it alot and have loaded it on my tablet. Thanks.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. it's challenging fun and not too hard. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I bought this game for my kindle HD Fire as I enjoy all solitiare games. The card's are very easy to see & even have a big print on 1 set for people with bad eyesight. They also let you change the back of the card's & the table colour. Very easy to play & would recommend it to anyone.
1609611543|5.0|It was very informative and I am working with it, it made sense. Buy it-read it-and you will be surprised at &#34;what our food contains&#34;.
030746363X|5.0|A fascinating, information packed powerhouse of a book. I'll admit I wasn't up for trying the diet, though I believe it would totally work, but there were plenty of other bits of great information I can use. I also recommend his other 2 books. Tim is amazing at finding the experts and data from around the world, and then testing it and telling you what it all means
B00785P2QC|3.0|not to bad could be better<br /><br />id like to see cheaper expansions. cant complai rlyfor a free game. i like g5 hope to see more from them
1401941893|5.0|An excellent book and into to affirmations. A lovely quick reference as well as uplifting read. Hearing Miranda's stories are not only inspiring but real. Thank you for you messages and sharing your journey.<br /><br />In gratitude,<br />Michele

0738737909|4.0|I have read the Tarot since 1982. I once owned a Metaphsycial book and gift store with 100 Tarot decks to choose from and I have done Tarot readings from many of those decks. The decks I have kept are the ones that the symbols in the images reflect the meaning of the card, easy to see, easy to interpret. I love the Tarot Illuminati for it's amazing images, color, symbolism and gilded edges! Wow..what a beautiful deck! I do prefer my cards to have a border, as my intution seems to function better with containment of the images. The cards without borders seem to melt off the cards onto the table, these do not have borders. I am using the deck daily and find them quite Illuminating! I know you will love the Tarot Illuminati Kit and the box has a magnetic clasp so you can line it with silk/velvet and keep your deck in the box.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|Some of Britain's greatest actors together in one glorious movie. And the music is magic to the ears. This is what films should be - great actors, glorious music, beautiful settings. And not one car blown up or computer effects. Just a grand and beautiful film. And Dame Maggie has to be the greatest living star we have today. There is nothing she can't do. And how exquisite she looks at the very end of the movie. Talk about a feel good movie.
1435139437|5.0|I received this book as a birthday gift. I had never read any of Oscar Wilde's works and, given he lived in the 1800s, I was nervous I wouldn't understand much, but I was completely blown away! The Picture of Dorian Gray is the first story and it is now my favorite novel. Such a brilliant man, that Oscar Wilde. In the book you'll find a bit of a biography of the author and you'll realize that although he was a narcissistic and troubled man, he was brilliant. His personal philosophies shine through in this works and he makes me think about subjects I never gave much thought. The only thing I didn't like about this edition was that it looks like a bible. It looks purple in the picture but the copy I have is burgundy with gold and silver designs. It's a heavy and thick book; the pages are gold colored, too. Everywhere I went people thought I was reading the bible.
B00AHDXTIK|3.0|The cable was a little thicker than expected and it's not exactly a \\"lightning fast\\" charge on my ipad, but it does work and gets the job done.

1401937519|5.0|I have read hundreds of profound spiritual books, but this one is Very Unique! Anita's NDE experience or Realization of her own Infinite Self as the very Light and love of Pure Consciousness is not framed around any spiritual path or tradition. She somehow remained fully aware during a NDE and most importantly she brought back with her a clear and vivid insight based on the memories of that experience.  From what she says, her experience of life nowadays is permeated by the sense of Oneness, Love, and Contentment which are the natural fragrances of the Infinite Self of all Beings. Greatly Inspirational for anyone regardless of backgrounds or stage of development!<br /><br />Om Shanti & Love to All<br />Anand Nagarjuna
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Like basically every song, it's just a fun album from a cute girl who writes really good lyrics. Happy with it!
B001E75QH0|5.0|This is a complete set of all four of the Indiana Jones movies.<br />fast moving action with great special effects so it keeps your interest from beginning to end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun and simple game to past time quickly. Its very creative but yet simple enough. The levels get a little tricky as you move toward but it is very cute and fun.  I.think age rang should be 11 and older.
0385737955|5.0|I read the first book (The Maze Runner) and loved it. I am currently reading the second book. My partner has finished Books 1-3 and gave them to me to read so I know the series must be good.
B0038UNNBM|5.0|First, I want to start off by saying how impressed I was with the delivery of this pool. I ordered it on a Friday afternoon and it was at my doorstep Saturday morning. Free shipping. I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />Blowing the pool up ( I recommend having a pump )  is super easy. Just 3 parts to pump full of air.<br /><br />The bottom of the pool has nice a cushion that fills with air. It has grooves built in for nonslip. We have the pool on our deck and the bottom is soft enough for our daughter to play in it and not worry about the deck being uncomfortable.<br /><br />The pool is a decent size for our 2 year old to splash around in and stay cool. I would think anywhere from a 6 month old to sit in it to a 4 year old would love to play in this pool.<br /><br />The shade part of the pool is great. Just one hole to fill and all the parts of the shade blow right up. My daughter loved the colors and playing under the shaded part.<br /><br />I cant comment on the durability of the pool yet, since we just blew it up a few days ago. I think it feels sturdy enough to last awhile. It does come with a patch just incase you do end up with a leak.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|You can't not like adobe! I have it on my phone , pc and tablet. It works  fantastic! I love the highlighting and commenting features.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Even though the book only focuses on the Nigerian experience abroad, anyone who has come to the States can relate to the story. Amazing book that you simply cannot put down until the last page... when you wish there were another 1000 pages left.
0788859544|5.0|This movie is my all time favorite. I had to buy it for my niece whom loves it just as much as I do. Perfect condition, not a complaint in the world! thank you
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It works just perfect for me.. I wasn't sure I would like it but I do.. I;m very glad I bought it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive game! I started with only placing one coin on the board at a time, then two, then three, and now four. Four coins seem to fit perfectly across and cause the most effect. I'm at over 900 coins at a level around 100. That's my strategy anyway. The only annoying part is when you first start playing each time... A screen will open up for more free games. I wish I could opt out of that so I wouldn't get those anymore.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started reading this book a year ago and got distracted with planning my wedding. I started up again and could not stop reading it. I'm buying the next two right now.

B0097HSS4M|5.0|Anyone looking for a picture app, get this one. Makes your pictures pretty. Such a cool, easy app to use! Worth the purchase &amp; has plenty of options and effects.
0307463745|5.0|I normally do not rank a book a five, and I surely don't give much credence to business books. I have a MBA and often felt like most of it was about producing worthless documents with fancy charts and graphs. So this book resonated with me. I am also a software developer who has an idea for a web app, so I wanted to hear what someone who has made millions doing it had to say. I do realize that some of the information in this book seems so simple, but sometimes that is what we need. I realize that this wont work for all companies. I read the book twice and my productivity at my start-up EXPLODED.. We had arguments about scale-ability!  Who cares we don't even have 100 customers on the app, worry about it later. We argued over Security, OpenID, Oauth, or roll our own. It is not important we have nothing to secure.  We stopped talking about the fancy logo we wanted.. Who cares it does not add any value to the company at this point..We started making quicker decisions. We kept our day jobs and worked every day for 2 hours before we went to work.. We got so much more done, and we have an app that is going to be released silently, so 50 clients can hack at it. We can always change the domain name and re-brand it later.. We have momentum. I highly encourage you to read it, you literally could read the whole book in a good hour or so. I read it the 2nd time on a flight from Omaha to Vegas.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|&quot;CAMCOINS?!&quot; What kind of cheap person makes an app that charges for taking videos? If you are looking for an app that is actually useful and you can do the things you want to do, move along. If you are ready to buy the capability to record videos, download this one.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It's a fun game that occupies your time. I recommend this game to anybody who has free time. You will not be disappointed.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|This is a great game for everyone to play. The game could be better balanced for the classes( like medic) but overall it's a solid four
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I am always up for improving myself in the various areas of my life, and here that include being more socially adept through communication. Beware, I  only skimmed through the book, but I noticed that I personally was up-to-date on most of what was offered. Now, I am not saying this book is bad, just that if you are already decent at making conversation, you should look elsewhere.<br /><br />Beginners - shy people, people with approaching anxiety, homebodies, etc. This book is for you. It's comprehensive and offers great advice at starting and maintaining conversation with people. You don't have to follow ALL the tips, but I guarantee if you try a few at a time and stick to it, your social life WILL improve.
0321334876|5.0|I'm a C++ developer and should have read this book a long time ago. It was very helpful in improving my C++ knowledge. I knew I didn't know everything about C++ and needed to learn more and this book and a couple of others (mentioned below) got me on my way to learning more. Of course I still don't know everything about C++, and probably never will, but I've definitely increased my C++ knowledge with this book and the others that I've recently read.<br /><br />First, I recommend starting with some FREE books you can find on the Internet - called \\"Thinking in C++\\" by Bruce Eckel. There are 2 volumes and I recommend both. You can buy the print versions but I used the electronic versions.<br /><br />I then read this book - Effective C++. Of course there is some repetition, but I like it as it helps 'drive stuff into my head'.<br /><br />The next book I'll read is [[ASIN:0201749629 Effective STL: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of the Standard Template Library]].<br /><br />I bought Effective C++ Third Edition in May 2013 from Amazon as the seller, and received the thirteenth printing (March 2013)<br /><br />While some of this stuff seems dated in 2013, I think 98% of it is still quite relevant, though I do wish they would keep the books a bit more updated (no more than 4 or 5 years old).<br /><br />I do plan on looking into a book on C++11 in the near future.<br /><br />Bottom line for this book is that I found it well worth the price. It's much easier and cheaper to learn the stuff in this book by reading it instead of having to 'learn it the hard way'.

B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Really appreciate James Altucher and his foresights on the way things are changing. I found some of his discussions on removing thoughts and things from your mind the most useful. He says contemplate the best times in your life, are they the ones with a million things going on in your mind or the times you're the most clear minded and contemplative. Overall great book
B003L77G38|5.0|...and Season 3 was definitely one of the best seasons.  Anna Torv and John Noble should have both received Emmys for their portrayal of both their characters and their FauxLivia and Walternate alternate earth doubles.  Buy this and have a Fringe Binge!

I never thought that I would ever see another Black Sabbath album of all-new material featuring Ozzy on vocals, but here it is and is it ever well worth it. It's really nice to hear these guys together again and doing great music after all of these years. I've already listened to it a few times now and love it and will definitely be listening to it a lot more over the summer.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|All of the Blue rays played perfectly. I will definitely be looking for more great deals like these int the future.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you want to update on your kindle, you must delete it and re-install it. You wont have to buy again, and your worlds should be saved.
B00CZ632R0|5.0|Jon is one of the greatest musical artists ever, in my opinion. His work is never trite or clumsy and it always sparkles with genius. Each track on this album resonates with a different part of me. Jon's previous works have been equally beautiful and unique, but this album is particularly crafty at appealing to even the most elusive facets of my states of being. \\"We Disappear\\" actually gave me an anxiety attack around 1:35 or so. \\"Open Eye Signal\\" continued to encourage my anxiety and suggested I might remain in that state forever. As the album progressed however, I felt as though I was receiving an intellectual and spiritual deep tissue massage. This album worked me over and left me deeply relaxed and really thankful that Jon Hopkins makes music.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Insides\\" by Jon Hopkins, you will definitely like this album. If you like music that demands active listening, this is for you.<br /><br />If you haven't heard Jon Hopkins before, you should definitely listen to this album, but be certain to listen to ALL of his music because there is a great deal of diversity and range.<br /><br />The last track, \\"Immunity\\", is probably the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard in my life.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Just as was predicted. Black Sabbath makes an old school sabbath record. Probably the last one they do but every bit as good as the first one. If you are a fan of &#34;old school sabbath&#34; this album is for you. Only regret, Billy Ward didn't ride it out! Would have been nice to finish that way! Buy it! I don't think you'll be dissapointed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not a bad wee game, could be longer didn't take long to finish it...<br />Looking forward to more levels. Keep it going!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is not easy, but it won't make you pull out your hair either. I love this game and it had no glitches :)
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I had mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand it had a fast-paced, meaningful second half. You really understand the links between the characters and their significance and the philosophical questions the movie poses. However the first half is so slow and boring you almost spend the first hour saying to yourself \\"who cares\\". In the end it's a movie I am glad to have seen. I love the premises of people being connected and every action in ones life creating a path for others lives to take. However, it's not a movie I would buy or watch more than a couple of times.
B000FA675C|4.0|It took me a long time to start reading this book.  Once I started, though, I didn't stop.  It was a fun and wild ride.  I highly recommend.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i like this kind of puzzle game.  it is pretty easy to figure out, but it will get old if it does not become more challenging.  The more you play the easier it gets to figure out  the pattern.  Once you figure out the pattern each floor is basically the same.  But all in all it is a very FUN game and I will highly recommend it.  It is good brain exercise.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Regardless if you like or agree with Sheryl Sandberg, she makes valid points using research, anecdotes, and societal assertions to discuss how women making an impact in leadership or pursuing a career outside the home requires serious reflection in order for women in the workplace to lean in to being career minded without guilt.  These changes are not only a mind shift around gender and gender roles but also around policy changes on every level (within organizations and within  society, gender bias, FMLA, etc).<br />It's also for men who are evolved enough to see that women in the workplace isn't something to fear but embrace. By supporting your wife, sister, daughter, or a female colleague by being aware of the bias and discrimination that can occur when women assert themselves.<br />Strongly recommend for new mothers and women struggling with creating work/family balance.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app its lot of fun espesdialy people who tend to love horses like me and many other people.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|I was under the impression that I would like every album Kanye put out.  I even liked [[ASIN:B00D8RNWFW 808s & Heartbreak [+video] [+digital booklet]]].  This album, though, is nothing like his previous albums and that is not a good thing.  Gone are the clever lyrics and, more importantly, quality production.  Almost every song has a gratingly irritating beat accompanied by Kanye delivering asinine line after asinine line.  I would definitely not recommend this album or even any individual song on it.<br /><br />Here's the blow by blow:<br /><br />1. On Sight - Starts off with what sounds like feedback from an amplifier before transitioning to a still irritating industrial video game sound at :15 (heard in the sample). Kanye starts at :34, but he's almost irrelevant because all I can focus on is the awful beat.  Between 1:17 and 1:30, the song abruptly drops everything it's doing and cuts to what sounds like a children's choir.  While it sounds better than the rest of the song, it doesn't fit at all. 1/10<br /><br />2. Black Skinhead - This is the fastest pace song on the album and is probably the second best song.  Unfortunately, the beat sounds like noise more than part of a cohesive song to me.  3/10<br /><br />3. I Am a God - Starts with some singing from Capleton that was apparently recorded to another beat (heard in sample).  What follows is predictable narcissism from Kanye rapping over a halting beat punctuated by a sci-fi sound.  Oh, and you get some irritating screaming towards the end.  2/10<br /><br />4. New Slaves - The electronic-sounding beat changes so often in this song that Kanye might as well have recorded the lyrics without it.  He only fleetingly catches the beat because there isn't much to catch.  Unfortunately, that detracts from Kanye's attempt to address racism throughout the song.  The outro is well done, though.  2/10<br /><br />5. Hold My Liquor - Best song on the album.  The song is really good before :30 and after 2:20, in which vocalsand the beat work great together.  In between is a brief lull of nonsense uttered through the autoune (heard in the sample) before, at 1:05, Kanye's greatness is obscured by what sounds kind of like a pneumatic tool releasing air.  5/10<br /><br />6. I'm In It - Kanye, apparently impersonating a demon, starts the song with semi-misogyny interrupted tastelessly by an MLK quote (heard in the sample).  What follows is a largely unintelligible reggaeton verse from Assassin and then Kanye starting almost every line with \\"Uh.\\"  The beat includes the sounds of a car alarm beginning at 1:00 with occasional dog barking, both of which are irritating. 1/10<br /><br />7. Blood on the Leaves - If you can stand the nasally Nina Simone syllable that gets interspersed every three seconds through much of the song (heard in the sample), then this one might work for you.  I couldn't stand it.  Kanye uses autotune through the whole song and the beat gets industrial from 1:05-1:45 and 2:03-4:28, which are the best parts of the song.  Too bad the other parts are so irritating.  3/10<br /><br />8. Guilt Trip - The beat is punctuated by what sounds like Nintendo-era video game sound effects, which work against the rest of the beat and in some places are louder than Kanye's voice.  The best parts are the chorus (heard in the sample), which is screwed and lacks the video game effects, but is lyrical nonsense.  2/10<br /><br />9. Sent It Up - It sounds like this song was recorded in a tire shop with a rhythmic pneumatic impact wrench (heard in the sample).  You get a brief break from the wrench between :57-1:17 and the last 46 seconds, but it otherwise dominates and ruins the song.  1/10<br /><br />10. Bound 2 - The nasally wailing you hear in the sample is a constant throughout the song.  I can't think of anything to redeem the song, which is probably the worst song on the album.  0/10
B000024IJY|5.0|If you know anything about Ms. Holiday you may know that she was raped when she was a very young child and SHE was sent to reform school!  I was very moved by an biography written about her.  It was like a nightmare that was never going to get any better but I kept hoping her life would look up.  Every time she had a chance to rescue herself she fell back into the abyss as if just unable to help herself.  She did all the hard drugs, took up with the most abusive men and never seemed to get herself together.  She sings about this life in this collection.  True, her voice has not the purity of some of her previous works in this grouping, but in this one the listener feels as if Lady Day bares her soul and it is very honest-sounding.  It is now my favorite of her efforst and although it is technically jazz it is blues of the downest kind, if I may coin a word.  Highly recommend it if you like this genre.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game provides escape from ennui. I return again and again hoping to gain that next level and solve the mystery.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|GAME IS GREAT KEEP IT UP ROVIO. but please release DLCs for it<br />HOPE YOU MAKE ANOTHER GAME LIKE THIS SOON
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Glad I purchased this game. Best game I have played on my kindle. The puzzles were great and I look forward to more games from this developer. I await the sequel with hope it will be just as intriguing as its predecessor.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome!! I love how it makes you use your mind!! my kids love it too!!!! give it a try!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this app. Although it definitely can trick you into spending too much money. It teaches patients. The soundtrack music is definitely the best part.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great story once again. Can't wait to read more! I love the intensity of their relationship and all the hurdles they overcome together. Never a dull moment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. There are puzzles and clues to get through each new room. I love it. It can be somewhat challenging and uses some math and patterns. Overall, I would recommend!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|doesn't take up much memory and does a good job of cleaning up tasks that are not being used that are still using memory
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This is much more than a self-help book.  It's a manual for living a full life, keeping that forward momentum which prevents the slow agony of stagnation.  Very highly recommended.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I installed this widget on my Asus Memo Pad 10 which provides me with a quick shortcut to see how much battery life is left. if I had to pay for this app, I would not have bought it though. there are other free battery widgets out there that do what this app does. infact I am using one of those apps instead of this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|awesome! want more levels now! lots of fun. gets my brain working. a hint option would be nice but not necessary
B000002UTO|4.0|Good 80's Duran Duran album with some great singles, great to hear it again. If you've always loved this band, check it out.
034580404X|5.0|I heard so much about these books and that everybody was reading them so I ordered them.  The shipping was great on time and all 3 arrived as described.  Thank you.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This is a great movie. Well-acted, well-written, a real blast. Gets a bit violent at times, but keeps its sense of humor. Looking forward to the sequel this summer.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Needs to be more player friendly by letting you earn points instead of purchasing them however the game draws you in it makes you want to keep playing this is very relaxing to play
B0038QMREK|5.0|It's by far one of the best albums to listen to on vinyl, I highly recommend it. It came just as described.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Reading the reviews on Amazon & AVS Forum, I had to watch it.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed. Viewing the Bluray on a large projection screen @ 1080P with 7.1 surround sound was incredible. Music and dazzeling color made this a excellent purchase. It is a long movie with a intermission. Also has a sing-long section everyone enjoyed. Why I waited so long I don't know!<br /> Buy this bluray!
0887431453|5.0|Preschool is over for the summer, but my 4 year old still has the interest to learn.  I find she will spend hours doing pages in this book.  She loves this book.
1572816295|5.0|The detailing on each card is astounding. The artwork is just breathtaking. No two cards are remotely alike and yet the suit themes are very clear and purposeful. I don't want to use them simply for the fact that I want to preserve the cards for as long as I can. This is a beautiful addition to my tarot deck collection.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|This.program is pretty dope. Loving all the free packs. Sometimes there are some.real.garbage and even.questionable FAOTD ..but like.this and the.blood.of the zombie recently hit it out of the park
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good job I will buy from you again, I am satisfied with the product and the delivery. Thank you very m
193700788X|3.0|The Good: After 12 books, Sookie finally finds her place in the world. Of course, that's only after multiple attempts on her life and way of life in this 13th book. Some of the \\"mysteries\\" are more transparent than others, but all do well to round out the overall story line and tie off loose ends in the Sookieverse.<br /><br />The Bad: Even though Sookie ends up with the person I always wanted her to, I'm disappointed in the way it came about. There seemed to be no real build up, rather a very fabricated situation in which the characters just sort of look at each other and say, yeah  - why not? Nothing was actually romantic about it at all, which seems like a missed opportunity. In the end, everyone is all happily paired up, or just about, and it all left a bad taste in my mouth. Fans expected something a little more that all of Sookie's former suitor's showing up, trying to seem like nice enough guys, but not really wanting her anymore. A series finale should be epic, mind-blowing, emotional, something. Dead Ever After was ho-hum at best and didn't do anything to elevate the series as a whole.
145470246X|5.0|Great beaded designs with excellend instructions for recreating them.  I hope to create just a few in the near future.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I have been more of a fan of the Archangel series and had not gotten into the psy/changling series after the first few books.  But what a lovely surprise this book has been.  2 broken people coming together with great angst, passion and finding redemption and each other.  Thanks Nalini for not falling into the trilogy trap and maintaining strong characters that could be read again and again - because there is depth and sincerity.  You keep your fan base and I don't feel sold out by an author who stretched a 'trilogy' into a 5 book series.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Great game but updates are nil to none, forcecloses too often, wants you to spend too much real money on diamond's, chests, etc.  Play for 5 min then wait an hour for 20 pts of energy to be restored. Needs lots of tweaking but is my favorite game despite all the negatives. Should also mention if something happens to your device you lose progress, friends, money &amp; time because GI cannot transfer &amp; cloud only has game, so its too bad about your bad luck!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is just a good waist of time and money for me. I get impatient and buy coins instead of beating the game but to me that's the only draw back.
0345531957|4.0|Does not disappoint.  Good read and hard to put down. Lots of sub and sub plots to keep track of.  A little more unbeliveable than some of the earlier Grisham.  I am a fan.
B000H305U0|5.0|These songs are all hits, so you can't go wrong... Justin really does know how to put a song together.
159463176X|3.0|I loved Khaled Hosseini's first two books and was looking forward to this book. The beginning was very promising. However, new characters/stories were brought into the story without clear introductions. It became confusing to follow these stories and I kept waiting for them to come together in a solid way. The book was not fluid and overall I was disappointed. I should note that I had mixed feelings about whether to write this review.  As an author myself, I know how much time goes into writing a book and how important reviews are. I look forward to more of Mr. Hosseini's work, but I hope his future work will be more aligned with his earlier work.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Wasn't sure I would like any of the other songs, but find myself listening to every single one.  Really good CD.
0345535421|5.0|New to me, at least. How happy I am that I discovered it.  Martin creates a very convincing world with characters you care about.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I pretty much love this game! I can't stop playing lol even though it's not hard it is definitely entertaining!
B00A85EMVK|2.0|THE PICTURE WAS REAL GRAINY THE COLOR WAS OFF, I ALREADY HAD TOP GUN IN BLURAY BUT I THOUGHT 3D WOULD BE COOL...BIG MISTAKE NOT WORTH THE MONEY. IT LOOKED LIKE A COLORED BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|Relax Melodies has more features to start. While it was semi nice to see some visuals they were cheesy at best. I like a similar program but found that having only a few sounds to start somwhat annoying. I realize there might be more options if Iwant to take the time to download them, this does not suit my relaxion needs. The default rain and lightning wakes me but doesn't relax.
B001I8A76A|5.0|I find much of Pink great to listen to.  Funhouse song great. Sober awesome.  Glitter in the air real nice. she has great voice and strikes me easy. Bad influence good one too.
0307951529|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading through this book.  I really liked the style of writing - weaving actual stories of small business owners with principles about starting and maintaining your own microbusiness.  This style of writing held my attention and made me want to keep on reading.  I applaud this book for: inspiring me to create my own business (at some point), helping me think more creatively, and showing me the advantages of venturing out on my own.  I think a huge amount of people have tons of great ideas but are too afraid to take risk.  The people who are successful have had good ideas, coupled with taking a bit of risk.  This book will help you take your risk.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's not bad. It is pretty easy because it will only zoom in on the important things. It is still somewhat challenging because you do have to think.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|If you want to check Facebook then this app is alright. The updated message system it horrible. You don't see what the other person replied until you send another message! It is really slow and glitchy. They need to fix the messages.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It was a great book with lots of twist and turns it keeps on the edge you don't know what's going to happen next.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is free and it is fun so you should try this game! If you like this game go ahead<br />And make your own comment it is a little hard so make sure!
1250012570|5.0|This is the most charming and adorable book that I have ever read. A love story set in 80s, this book made me laugh and cry and fall in love with the characters. The way that Eleanor and Park fall in love, by reading comic books and listing to music together, was geeky, fun, and real. They are both misfits that I could relate to, and I just loved their characters so much. Especially since the story was written by switching between Eleanor and Parkfs view points. I got to see how they both so and felt about each other, which made me love them even more.<br /><br />Although this is a great contemporary love story, it also has other very deep and dark aspects to it. There is emotional and physical abuse, isolation, bullying, and neglect that breaks your hear, and adds so much to the book. The writing is wonderful, and all of the parts, dark and light, come together in such an amazing way that warms and breaks your heart at the same time.<br /><br />Both of the characters are going through a hard time trying to figure out who they are and having trouble at home, and it is very real and relate able. The thing that I love most about Eleanor and Parks Relationship is that they accept each other how they are, and when one decides to do something, the other is okay with it and supports them. They are there for and help each other trough everything, and have no bad feelings or judgement between them. I loved them together, and wish that I could have a relationship like therefs.<br /><br />This is definitely my new all time favorite contemporary novel, and I highly recommend it. It sets you on a whirlwind of emotions, and makes you nostalgic for the time of walk mans and  mullets. I absolutely loved this book, and everyone should pick it up
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It is a great game better than most games I have played and I have played a lot of games.
1594746168|5.0|This book was really interesting to read. The first about third of the novel follows Dr. Spenser Black's life and his research, and the latter two thirds are a book that he wrote about `extinct' creatures.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first part of the book that was about the doctor's life. It was written in a series of journal entries, testimonials, drawings, and commentary from the author. I got to learn a lot about the very strange doctor and the kind of work that he did. Using all of those different writings made the book really unique and fun to read. Even though it was nonficton, the book was never boring or too detailed, and I felt like I was reading a fiction book the whole time.<br /><br />The illustrations in the book were absolutely amazing. The mythical creatures were really detailed and I loved how it showed all the muscles, bones, and other body parts of the creatures in a scientific way that made them look as if they were real live animals being researched.<br /><br />I found this book so interesting and I highly recommend it if you like mythical creatures like mermaids or if you are just looking for a very unique read that unlike anything you have ever read before.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for horse lovers<br />People would love this game even if they aren't horse lovers. Lol<br />I<br />Love this game
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|As enjoyable as the first time I read it.  Perfect for vacation reading through france and England.  Jane Austen rocks!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Excellent game. Would have given 5 stars if more levels were available, I guess I'll have to wait for the m lol
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Was this Star Trek movie directed by George Lucas?<br />There was no novel idea.<br />Recycled Khan, who somehow lost his Indian ethnicity.<br />Explosions, falling gantries.<br />Fast and spurious.<br />Khan beats Kirk and Spock nearly to death, yet they bear nary a single bruise.<br />Rambo in space.<br />Star Fleet has never heard of computer terminals, so people have to run hundreds of meters to control and adjust equipment such as the highly-radioactive core.<br />Not a single novel idea, which is the very essence of sci-fi.<br />These prequel movies are so limited by pre-existing ST stories that they lack all surprise.<br />Next movie, just crowd-source it. Couldn't be worse.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is just so well written. It has the mystery, adventure, romance everything. I have to say I love, love love it!!!!!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book told a wonderful story of life's loses and the determination of a young girl to overcome many hardships.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Too long... Interesting read from a real Seal but could have been shorter and better written.  I think more pictures would have been a plus.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book!! it jis such a amazing story Suzane Collins has out done herself! Great Book great pictures it creats I would recomend this book!
B00CBVRGIK|5.0|Really was not expecting such a great release from anyone, let alone Visage, especially after nearly 30 years of silence. Not sure this one can be topped. Stellar songwriting, amazing analog synths, great guitar playing, many famous musician contributions, great style and f-f-f-f-fashion. There isn't one bad track on this album. What are you waiting for?
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I love this cd it is absolutely one of my favorites it include songs like because we can that's what the water made me army of one what's left of me pictures of you amen and many more
B003VANOFY|1.0|This is my first &#34;High quality&#34; headset and I must say, when it works, it works like a charm.<br /><br />However, to anyone buying this, PLEASE type in, &#34;Logitech G930 keeps turning off.&#34; &#34;Logitech G930 won't play sound&#34; &#34;Logitech G930 USB errors&#34;<br /><br />I'm constantly fighting issues with it taking an extremely long time to turn on (&#62;30 seconds), as well as constantly having errors with shutting off instantly, and it not recognizing that it's plugged in at all. I would definitely recommend getting a razor product over this, as logitech has terrible service and won't even exchange them in a decent timeframe.<br /><br />I would not recommend this headset at all simply due to all of the above issues. With that being said, it is amazing when it works. :(
B00CWY76CC|5.0|realy fun and challenging. everyone should download and play this game. and what's better than a fun free game. I hope they make more
B009NY43NY|5.0|It was a great read.  I love Charlaine Harris.  Thanks for the great books.  Sorry True Blood did not show everyone your awesome plots.  Maybe someone will make them into movies, so we can see the pyramid of gyza (sp?), etc.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book. Captivating throughout,  right up until the very end. Makes you think as a parents what you would do in this case.
0307730697|5.0|Awesome book. Could not put it down, and all my friends liked it. You will love this from start to finish.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was an excellent book. It was easy to read and I could hardly put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a thrilling book.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Very good music from the 70's To bad they are not together again. Early Boston is really good, can't miss
B009AMAGQM|5.0|the movie is really good but the books are really different who ever has or gets this movie will obivisby LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0500516766|5.0|If you ever remember taking apart the radio, and putting it back together, only to find you had a few extra parts, this book might be for you.  It serves a lot of &#34;purposes&#34;:  it's artistic in that the author clearly took time to disassemble - and lay out the constituent parts in an attractive manner.  A lot of thought went into the arrangement and selection of items for display.  It serves another purpose in that these are &#34;everyday&#34; items that many of us use - revealed in the complexity and simplicity.  The seeming simplicity of many items is just a facade.<br /><br />Great coffee table book for your adult guests - and wonderful for the curious kid in all of us.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love every chapter and recommend it to any woman! Great read!  It's just a shame there's only three books...
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great read! Right along the lines of the other books from the same line.  Following along on the HBO series by the same name.  Fantastic series and great HBO show series as well!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a very fun game a lot of animals or dinosaurs to find there is a lot of stuff to do
B008602KQI|5.0|The books were amazing and so was the movie; I just had to buy it when it came out.  Can't wait for the 2nd movie.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I really like this game. Graphics are great. It can be challenging at times. This is one of my favorites, because I do like tennis. Would recommend if you like tennis.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am a SyFy addict...love these movies...it was the perfect price too. I bought it right before Prometheus was released in theaters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its really fun and addictive to play, i thought it was a little hard until i looked up one on youtube..... then you get how the harder ones work.  Plus, its cool how you can go to different rooms while trying to get the door open.  Good For ALL Ages=== Success!
B005LAIII0|5.0|This movie is amazing...the book even better.  I highly recommend it.  It's an inspiration story, full of hope and love.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I wish it had red stone that is the only reason I left 4 stars and it cost a lot
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books....the trilogy is awesome.  I can't wait to finally see all the movies. So excited for it.
B009KHCT94|3.0|I read the reviews and there was such a split I had to give it a go. I must admit there were some very funny parts but there were also parts that tried to hard to be funny.<br /><br />Overall a good B movie. Unfortunately I can see this becoming a &#34;cult classic&#34; as I have seen it on TV in Dubai since I rented it. It is one I am glad I rented and did not purchase.<br /><br />It was not good enough for me to see again or recommend. It is not bad enough for me to say avoid it but you must be into the theme and humor to enjoy it.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I am glad I decided to watch this show.  I started watching in season 7, so watching all the episodes back to back was amazeballs.

0374533555|5.0|I finished this book just one year ago. I find that in the meantime I have begun more deeply to understand, use, and cite the ideas I learned. It has and will continue to strongly influence my ways of thinking. I strongly recommend any serious person to read it and carefully.<br /><br />I have also since learned that the most important ideas were neither original with Kahneman (DK) nor most brilliantly presented by him. Much will be familiar to readers of late 19thC or early 20thC social psychology (see the Appendix in Chester Barnard, Functions of the Executive). It is one of those irrationalities of human history that DK was the one who won the Nobel and became a popular meme and got published and enlightened me. But that's ok.<br /><br />Human beings value rationality and many, presumably readers here, strive to be so. And yet we observe, in others more easily than in ourselves, that rationality is an ideal that is often not attained. DK identifies if not the causes at least the processes for incident irrationality, some of which turn out to be essential aspects of human nature, perception, cognition, choice, and satisfaction. He also considers whether we can do anything systematically to avoid errors and irrationality. DK is an experimental cognitive psychologist whose extensive and Nobel-winning career consisted in thinking out experimental protocols that could plausibly be interpreted as revealing clearly definable aspects of our thinking and especially of our typical failures in thinking. The vast majority of the words in the book are very nicely written reports of these experimental studies, including autobiographical accounts of eureka moments, collegial collaborations (especially that with Amos Tversky who had a part in all the foundational work), academic struggles, and the progress of ideas over decades of publication.<br /><br />Part I introduces some of the apparatus of DK's exposition--the fictional \\"characters\\" S1 and S2 who, as homunculi, have capacities, activities, and interactions that make up our thinking as a whole or at least the part of it that enacts our fallibility. S1 is intuitive, busy, and rash, while S2 is more logical, but diffident and lazy. Using this image, DK reviews some shocking features about the incapacities of humans reliably to perceive and know the truth. For example, S1 will typically avoid rousing S2 for help to answer a hard question by \\"substitution\\", quickly answering another easier question instead. A powerful but potentially confusing ability of the mind is to make analogies or comparisons across dimensions: his cheeks are redder than his politics, murder is louder than lying. He names some of the more common elements in his theory of thinking, or of erring (though he grants that we, including S1, usually get it right), identifying characteristic patterns of mistake making and helpful but misleading heuristics, such as \\"association\\", \\"priming\\", \\"framing\\", the handling of evidence in \\"What You See Is All There Is\\", and the related risky propensity to jump to conclusions.<br /><br />Part II describes various ways in which our thinking is led astray in the consideration of statistical information. S1 is able to make good estimates of quantities, averages, and instantly recognizes extremes; even simple comparisons are reliable. But when computations and comparisons of data are needed, even S2 is hardly able to be accurate. One particularly important theme is the way in which the statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean seems to be beyond our unaided human capacity of thought. Here also we see how suggestible we are when using descriptions to make judgements or predictions. The experiments discussed in this part are fascinating, but also in some cases less compelling. DK reports some of the scholarly criticism of his work, understandably and appropriately offering defenses.<br /><br />Part III presents plausible explanations of how we deceive ourselves in making judgements, estimates, and predictions by failing to make reference to what is usually readily available objective information that would prevent our wildly going astray as often happens. The unreliability of expert opinion and budgeting for time and resources is again shocking at the same time as it is familiar. As we seem wilful deniers of evidence in the cases, we also must nearly admit that we have been wilful deniers that we knew this anyway. For example, DK notes that budgets often understate needs because interested parties (humanly, not cynically) want to get started confident that a mere overrun will not stop a project. But he also notes that this self-deluding stubbornness is what powers all ventures in business, science, and each of our lives. Without the wilful folly of damning the torpedoes, nothing new would get done.<br /><br />Part IV is the core of the book and of Kahneman-Tversky's contribution to science and the basis for winning the Nobel Prize in Economics. It is a critique and expansion of the economic concept of \\"utility\\". Bentham made popular the idea of utility as the dimension on which human well-being can be measured, with units of \\"hedons\\" or \\"utils\\". A person is happier the more they have or get and any action is good if it maximizes them. This is the basis of welfare economics in practice and utilitarian ethics in theory. DK does not make it clear where he stands on these key issues, but it would seem that his S2 shares the now dominant consequentialist assumptions, even if his compassion (if not respect) for S1 leaves him ambiguous or uncomfortable. In any case, this Part starts with the expected utility mathematics of Bernoulli and presents the advances DK has made under the title of Prospect Theory. We learn that it is not wealth but changes in wealth that we feel. And, as shown in the graph (called the \\"flag\\" of Prospect Theory), we suffer more from losses than we rejoice in gains. Through some fascinating examples and experiments, we see how our thinking is barely if at all able to arrive at conclusions we would prefer to make.<br /><br />Part V is an attempt to bring to bear on private life and politics the explanatory apparatus and results of PT and other cognitive findings. Again reifying for the sake of exposition, DK distinguishes in us each an experiencing self, who suffers and benefits from objective outcomes, and a deciding self, who cares only about having future good memories and will sacrifice our measurable well-being to ensure them. This is again a fascinating discussion with many intriguing ideas, but we feel ourselves slipping away from the discipline of experimental science into, as he admits, the more nuanced and intricate challenges of philosophy and axiology. It might have been better for the book as a whole, says the remembering self that wants a happy ending, had he not ventured so far away from his core competences into a discussion he is obviously not intellectually prepared for.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|The books expand on each character's story so much more than HBO's show can possibly show. I enjoy the differences between the books and the show. They keep lovers of both interested. I can't wait to continue reading further and watching next season's Game of Thrones.

B000002J09|5.0|Zeppelin are one of the greatest Rock & Roll bands of all time.  This album came out with no writing on it, no song titles, nothing and just the power of the band sold it. If this is not in your collection you are missing one of the best of all time.
B0054R6BFM|1.0|I chose this book after seeing all the positive reviews. The truth however is that it is much less mature than the synopsis or the other reviews would admit. It was a struggle to finish; I kept hoping it would get more intense and it never did. That being said,I'm sure that anybody 13-16 would probably really enjoy this read.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Really fun, butcan move slowly if you don't want to spend real money. If you have the patience, it's well worth it!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The novel is great fun until the main character has a totally unbelievable reunion with another character (No, not that one.) I enjoyed the style and voice, but I had hoped for more of an ending. I wasn't looking for a happily ever after - just something more.
1781162646|1.0|A just ok work of fiction set in 1973 - but that doesn't stop the author from fast forwarding in time to throw in some 'Bush bashing'. Mr. King obviously doesn't care if his political statements offend some of his readers and his comments about the former VP certainly don't belong in a Hard Case Crime novel.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|i love this movie so much!! i love how they hide their real jobs from each other. but find out in the end. awesome movie!
B000002J0B|5.0|I bought the CD just for the song D'Yer Mak'er.. It was recorded in May 1972, I listened to it a lot in the 80's.. It was the only song recorded where all 4 members of the Led Zeppelin band sang in it.. Good music if you like the 70's...

0345529057|5.0|I have always hated reading, it just was never my thing. I even had a problem reading as a kid. In high school, I never read (maybe skimmed the pages), but after I began reading this series I realized that I have missed out on a lot. I can thank George R.R. Martin for giving me something that I never wanted, the love of a good book.
0062209493|5.0|American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in American History- Chris Kyle<br />Almost everyone has heard of Chris Kyle by now, the most celebrated sniper in military history. Chris was also a Navy Seal and with the take down of Bin Laden everyone has wanted to know more about this elite military unit,though members of the Seals would much rather keep to the shadows, as Chris points out Seals like to come in and do their job and leave silently.<br /><br />Chris gives us his background of growing up a Texas native something of which is is overly proud of, his days spent hunting, fishing, bull riding,his membership in the FFA and then back to his love of guns and shooting.<br /><br />He gives a vivid account of his entry into the military and his desire to become a Seal, his training in Buds, his desire to become a sniper and the path that leas him to his dream job.<br /><br />As far as he is allowed too, being some of their missions are still classified, he tells of his time spent in Kuwait and Iraq.We learn of the many friends Chris made among his unit as well as collation members as well as other branches.He remains forever humble and attributes his and the Seals success to the many units that aided them.<br /><br />Chris also tells the other side of Military life. Hi marriage, his children being born. The joys and most of all the trials his wife went through being married to not only a Military member which is hard enough but to top it off a Navy Seal.<br /><br />This was a great read and anyone should enjoy Chris's down to earth delivery of his story. If you have served in the Military you will identify with a lot of what Chris goes through and experiences. This was just a great read!
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|Let me start by the drawbacks of the album, to get it out of the way. I only have a few qualms with this album: In my opinion, it is too short (35 min total versus nearly an hour for The Collective - which as actually a bit bloated -  a middle ground would have been nice), and a few songs feel disjointed (the first one for example). Also, the last song did not give me a feeling of proper resolution to the album (The Traveler ends pretty weirdly with heavy syncopated guitars and did not really work for me). These are minor qualms, because the album is a fantastic travel, where the band plays very deep layered songs, with here and there insane solos.<br /><br />What I love with these guys is that you can feel that they are extremely proficient with their 7 & 8 strings guitars (and the bass work is also equally amazing), but the album is not a shred fest. This album has a faster pace than The Collective. I love The Collective, it is a very rewarding CD, but the pace of The Migration suits me better. Now, is it better than The Collective? I love both, the Collective had really memorable songs (\\"whales\\" comes to mind), but The Collective was a bit bloated by moments and I had a hard time digesting the whole album in one go. No problem like that on The Migration.<br /><br />Anyway, The Migration is a thrilling record, a record which takes me on a journey and makes me feel good.<br /><br />Memorable song of the album: The Olive Tree<br /><br />EDIT (07-15-2013)<br />I indeed made a mistake, the CD is 42 min long, nearly as long as the Collective. It's just so good it feels too short! After listening to The Migration at least 50 times, I can finally say now that I like it better than The Collective. I also forgot to say: great artwork by Duncan Storr. I love when my CDs sound good AND look good!

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I don't write many reviews, and I don't have a lot to add to what so many others have said. But I will say this much:<br /><br />I have been a Trekkie since I was a child watching the original series in the 70's. I've seen all the movies, all the original episodes, all the TNG episodes, and most of all the others, excepting \\"Enterprise\\" (but that's just because I really don't like Bakula!) I've been there through the best, and the worst (again, except for the Bakula stint). I was very nervous about the reboot four years ago... but upon seeing it, I was one of the ones who came away excited, not discouraged. I felt JJA et al did a magnificent job then, and I think they've done it again with \\"Into Darkness\\".<br /><br />I have but one complaint about this one; it should have been a little longer. Benedict Cumberbatch was fantastic in his role... but in my opinion, he was under-utilized. He needed more lines, a couple more scenes where we get to know the man a little better. I think that would have assuaged many of the concerns that have been raised about the character he portrays.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I loved the film. I feel like these movies (2009 & 2013) are on the right track for the most part, and neither have let me down like so many of their predecessors did. My only fear now is that the franchise will be handed off to someone else now that JJA has committed to a larger project with Disney. I hope that doesn't happen.<br /><br />This is one long-time Trekkie who likes what he sees. I am glad this film was made!

B008OOYALE|1.0|It was fun at first because you don't need gold for every little thing in the beginning! And once I made a name for my Dragon inland I noticed that one word was adocorrected so when I went to change it it said I needed 25 gold pieces to change the name! What a rip of! And they most likely do more stuff like that later in the game but I stoped playing it there because I knew that they were just going to try to gets every bit of money out of me when they had the chance.
B0030IIZ1A|5.0|Classic story with drama, lots of humor (even adults love it), great voices and fantastic colorful animation in every frame!
1594746168|4.0|Quirk Books sent THE RESURRECTIONIST to me instead of the book I was supposed to review, but I was allowed to keep it even though they also sent the other book.  I'm glad because I'd wanted this book and was disappointed when I didn't win it through LibraryThing Early Reviewers.  THE RESURRECTIONIST is fiction presented as fact, even to a page thanking the fictional Museum of Medical Antiquities in Philadelphia (based on the Mütter Museum?).<br /><br />The biographical section first left me feeling sympathetic toward Dr. Spencer Black.  His success with transplants was admirable.  I thought it was a pity he lived before DNA testing could prove his pet theory correct or incorrect.  Then his experiments revolted me.  The way he treated his wife, whom he claimed to love, was horrifying.  I didn't have to reach the end to conclude it was a good thing the youngest of Dr. Black's surviving offspring was taken away.  As with some H.P. Lovecraft stories, the reader has to infer what happened to Dr. Black in the end.  My dark side thinks it served him right.<br /><br />The beautiful anatomical drawings of mythological creatures in the \\"Codex Extinct Animalia\\" needn't be just a marvelous show.  According to the publisher's video of Mr. Hudspeth talking about his illustrations, he took the trouble to try to figure out how different species' anatomy could be merged.  Just as a study of human anatomy can help artists to draw humans realistically, I think THE RESURRECTIONIST would make an excellent reference work for aspiring and professional fantasy artists.  Fantasy writers who would like anatomical details to help them with descriptions and fight scenes should also buy this book.<br /><br />There's no index, so here's an alphabetical list of creatures covered and the pages where they may be found:<br /><br />Canis Hades (pp. 131-139)<br />Centaurus Caballus (165-173)<br />Chimaera Incendiarius (pp.121- 129)<br />Draconis Orientis (pp. 153-163)<br />Ganesha Orientis (pp. 109-119)<br />Harpy Erinyes (pp.175-191)<br />Minotaurus Asterion (pp. 99-107)<br />Pegasus Gorgonis (pp. 141-151)<br />Satyrus Hircinus (pp. 91-97)<br />Siren Oceanus (pp. 79-89).<br /><br />If you prefer ordinary names:<br /><br />centaur(165-173)<br />Cerberus the 3-headed hell hound (pp. 131-139)<br />chimera (pp.121- 129)<br />dragon [Asian] (pp. 153-163)<br />Ganesha [elephant-headed Hindu god] (pp. 109-119)<br />harpy  (pp.175-191)<br />mermaid (pp. 79-89)<br />Minotaur (pp. 99-107)<br />pegasus (pp. 141-151)<br />satyr (pp. 91-97)<br /><br />On p. 117 the lines from the numbers to their respective anatomical sections were left out .  I hope the publisher is willing to post an erratum sheet at their website for interested readers to print and slip in their copies.<br /><br />For readers who have trouble reading words with no spaces between them, the 6th line of p. 153 is: \\"sort of large amphibian, anatomically\\".<br /><br />If you like horror, illustrations of mythological creatures, or want an anatomical reference book for such creatures, I recommend THE RESURRECTIONIST.

1933865474|4.0|Love this book and the content within.  I will note it's much larger than the name suggests as there's no pockets big enough on earth to hold this book.  Not that it's a bad thing at all, it's a good thing.<br /><br />The artwork within is lovely, classy and well done.  My only criticism is that a lot of it feels much of the same, page after page of very similar looking women in similar poses.  There are some to break up the difference but it does get a bit repetitive.  It's kind of like complaining about too much of a good thing I guess but I wish there was just more variation to it.  This is in contrast to say, Dean Yeagle's artbook where there's a lot more variation in poses/subject.  All in all I'm happy to have it but it does make me wish I'd gotten the larger version when I had the chance as I hear that has some more subtle variation.<br /><br />Pros:<br />++ Not pocket sized at all<br />++ Lovely artwork<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Poses/styles gets repetitive when taken as a whole

0671449028|5.0|I used to read Barnyard Dance (more peppy) and then The Going to Bed Book (more relaxing) to my daughter when she was 4+ months old before bedtime.  This book is so cute and the end is very relaxing if you speak softly and slowly.  (I admit that it bugged me at first that the animals went up the exercise AFTER they'd taken a bath, brushed their teeth and put on their PJ's - that makes NO SENSE!)  When my daughter got to around 9-10 months she'd cry when I took this book out because she recognized it meant it was almost time for bed.  So we took it out for a few months and now she loves it again. I was recently invited to a shower where everyone is supposed to bring a book they love.  I'm bringing this, \\"Flip Flap Fly,\\" and Karma Wilson's \\"Bear Snores On\\" - so much fun to read!

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have to say that I had hoped the negative reviews on this book were wrong but they were not. This book started out hot and heavy- and stayed that way through about half of the book. Then it went more in depth into the storyline and just ended.... just like that. This was an obvious attempt to turn this trilogy into something else. Honestly this has ruined it for me. I can gather how this series will end as it follows Fifty Shades of Grey so closely so I may just make up my own ending and move on.

B00A80SHFM|2.0|I bougth this regreting my self to spend my money in such a horrible cd. Where the actors don't sing. They Chat as Rusell Crow...for God sake, he is an actor ! Not a singer. I gave this cd as a present. I could not keep this cd in my collection
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was not that bad of a game than I expected it to be because most games like this are annoying and frustrating because of difficultly, but it is kinda short. Put a lot more levels on it!!!
B000002NAK|4.0|It's a great cd. It contain some songs, that are not in the musical broadway cd.<br />I like it a lot. Than you
B0054JZC6E|3.0|A great game but can be stupid nobody can beat some of them stupid games. But it's fun exciting and very entertaining
B006CHML4I|5.0|In this price range, it is the best you can get for a core, functional, day - date automatic w very decent nylon+canvas strap.  It is a kinda watch that will grow on you.  I have had it very short while, wear it occasionally w blue jeans for a casual look and like it.  Additionally, I like the size also.  All in all it is a very decent buy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A highly a addictive game, particularly due to ease of use. Ads are not distracting in free version. Highly recommend! As great version of a great game!<br />revtimbeneski@gmail
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Excellent movie!!!!!  I would highly recommend this action packed movie.  Matt Damon does a great job in this movie I had never heard of before.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|My son has loved reading the Percy Jackson series and loves the movie. He's excited for the second movie to come out.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|After reading the reviews, I wasn't sure I wanted to take a chance on this free app of the day, especially because of the \\"gap\\" and privacy issues reported.  After researching and considering for about half an hour, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />After installing the app, the following screen displayed.  For your reference, I have copied the screen in word for word:<br /><br />Attention!<br /><br />Have you recently experienced 'gaps' or 'skipping' while using Lightning Bug?<br /><br />'Lightning Bug Audio' is a custom audio component we built to address the 'gap' issue reported by many of you over the last few months.<br /><br />*If you are using a dual-core Android device running the Android 2.3 OS (Gingerbread) or higher, this issue probably effects you!<br /><br />To enable Lightning Bug Audio, press 'Enable Now' below or:<br />- Press the Clock Setting button from the main on-screen menu (the button that looks like a clock)<br />- Check Lightning Bug Audio (beta)<br /><br />Feel free to use Lightning Bug Audio even if you haven't experienced audio problems, you can always switch back to the normal Android audio component from Settings.<br /><br />Please report any issues to support and thank you for using Lightning Bug!<br /><br />Your Choices -<br /><br />Enable Now!  or Ok<br /><br />I finally decided to give it a try, and clicked on the \\"Enable Now\\" button.  Right away, I was blown away by the beautiful graphics and the realistic sound of the surf and a lightning storm.<br /><br />When I started exploring, the app stopped responding.  I forced a close, and re-opened the app.  A new screen popped up.  Again, I've copied that screen, verbatim:<br /><br />Thanks for using Lightning Bug!  As of our 2.0 release you can now switch Lightning Bug to Plugin Mode where you'll not only get more scenes and sounds, but you can also mix the scenes and sounds however you want!<br /><br />Tips for beginners:<br /><br />- To bring up the main menu simply touch the screen or click you phone's Menu button<br />- The left side of the menu gives you option for configuring the app and choosing different scenes<br />- The right side of the menu gives you options for configuring the current scene's sounds<br />- Long and Short press the menu's sound buttons for more options!<br />- To enable Plugin Mode, click the puzzle piece button in the main menu<br />- For more help and info, click the info button in the main menu<br /><br />Your Choices:<br /><br />Don't Show again  or  Ok<br /><br />So I decided to play along, and haven't had any other issues (so far).  I will update my review if problems are experienced.  My initial impression is that the app seems to be wonderful.  I also like that there are several ways to reach out to the developers for assistance if you experience issues. [But I did notice that the Help menu, FAQ, e-mail support (that requires Facebook for a direct link, or you can use the e-mail address listed on the screen) and an e-mail address) all had links for which I received a \\"web page not available\\" message.]<br /><br />The jury is still out, but I am cautiously optimistic.<br /><br />I don't have time to explore more at this point, but the app does look promising for use on my Kindle Fire.  I like what I see so far.  Meanwhile, I hope this information will help you decide if you want to take a chance, or not.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/19/2013:<br /><br />I've had some more time to explore the features of this app.  Overall, I am very impressed, and I like the plug-ins. (For example, I love the sound of geese flying overhead!)<br /><br />Please note that I had a little trouble, initially, running the app, and it crashed a few times.  But I checked out their website - listed in the information (\\"i\\") menu - went out to their web site, and learned a couple of tricks from their FAQ menu.  (I cannot post the address here because the posting guidelines won't allow reviewers to post e-mail addresses.)  After following the suggestions listed, and then uninstalling, reinstalling and re-opening the app, the crashes ceased to be a problem.<br /><br />Above, I mentioned the web pages do not re-direct the end user to a working web page.  I located their support e-mail address on their website, and sent a message to them, asking them to take a look at the problem.  I will update my review once the developer corrects the problem.  And then we will all be able to see how responsive the developer is...<br /><br />P.S. I corrected a couple of minor typos in the original posting.  :\<br /><br />UPDATE 6/20/13:<br /><br />The developer responded to my e-mail, and will try to fix the issue within the next few days.gestions listed, and then uninstalling, reinstalling and re-opening the app, the crashes ceased to be a problem.<br /><br />Above, I mentioned the web pages do not re-direct the end user to a working web page.

B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game has been fun up to this level.  I am stuck and there aren't any hints.  I can find the red &amp; green weight but not the blue.
1400069289|4.0|The book is interesting.  Like the discussion of how companies target habits.  The one drawback is the author doesnt do well enough to define what a habit truly is.  Definitely a good read.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|It has a simple plot that gets right into the heart of the movie.<br /><br />Wouldn't want to watch it if I already knew ahead of time what the movie was all about.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|a beautifully told story of love, aging, and wonderful music. We enjoyed seeing ageless actors at their best. Great movie for the whole family.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|All I can say is that this movie makes you realize that the real heroes of the world were much more of heroes than what we call them today. Great cast, writing and acting.  The shame of it is that the story is true, making it tragic and wonderful at the same time
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Love these games from g5 they are fun to play and great to look at. I can't believe that many of them are free
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Don't waste your time; not worth the rental.  Some humor but mostly not worthy of these actors and how they got them to do it, I'll never understand unless it was throwing bushels of money at them
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are superb! Only thing when I downloaded it on my kindle my internet went wonky. I may have to unload.
0380789035|5.0|Take a mental ride on the mythological side--American Style. We still live with the gods our forefathers brought over with them-- gods made in image of men... and women.
B000002KAT|4.0|This is a very good concept album. It deals with life, death, regeneration, and spiritual mysticism.  Although the songs are good on their own, it is best to listen to the whole album in sequence.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The acting and character development are incredible in this show. The entire cast, particularly the charismatic Michael Chiklis and devastating Walton Goggins, is strong and the show does an amazing job of making you root for flawed, human, and sometimes even evil characters. It's not for the faint of heart--quite a lot of realistic violence and not much sentimentality. The show held onto its strengths until the very end of its last season. I was frequently on the edge of my seat.
B000WS4OZM|5.0|I've never come across anything by Johnny Cash I didn't like, but this was even better than his usual work. This is an album of covers but he more than does justice to each song. I especially liked his version of the Nick Cave song &#34;Mercy Seat&#34;
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book,it gave you such a new and wonderful side of Guideon and I loved it. Didn't think I could love these books anymore until this one! Looking forward to the next book!
B007Z9QWVK|1.0|This movie was just awful.  I could not watch it to the end.  I had to remove it from the player and just toss it out.  They story line was ridiculous.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|I know Kanye West thinks he can't do any wrong, but this is precisely what he did. This album is probably the worst album of the year and one of the worst albums I've ever heard. Absolute trash.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I bought this Nerf gun for my kids about a month or 2 ago and I think it is the coolest Nerf gun my kids currently have.  It is easy to assemble and holds 8 N-Strike magazines up to and including the 18 dart magazines, but only comes with 4 6-Dart mags.  I ordered the Hail-Fire upgrade kit to get 24 more darts and 4 more 6-dart mags, but in order to get the full 144 dart capacity you will have to spring for 8 of the 18-Darts magazines.  The bigger mags do make the gun more cumbersome but the added capacity more than makes up for that.<br /><br />The only minor downside to the Hail-Fire Blaster is that it incorporates what is called an “accelerator trigger” in order to launch the darts; this makes the blaster a little loud and all but eliminates the possibility of a sneak attack on any semi-conscious prey.  This drawback is minor for most Nerf battles in my opinion and the added range and accuracy provided by the accelerator is worth the noise. As with any N-strike Nerf gun I strongly advise buying a bunch more N-Strike darts because your kids will lose them faster than a set of gloves in a snow storm.<br /><br />All told, I highly recommend this Nerf gun and think your kids will love adding it to their Nerf arsenal as much as mine did.
1451626657|5.0|It's been 18 years since I last read Catch-22 (in AP English class), but every once in a while I'm fondly remember one of the little vignettes, so I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did! It most definitely held up to my recollections, and in fact was even so much better now that I have more context, having worked in bureaucracy myself.<br /><br />Brilliant piece of satire.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|ok app wish it was longer and gave more clues. there should be more puzzles per round. maybe a little more direction as well.
1451627297|5.0|I've seen several films based on Mr King's books, but this is the first one I've actually read... and what a pleasure it was! This is a real page-turner! I have a long commute from home and to work and this made the trip just burn away. Yes, in a sense, it created it's own form of time-travel... I could hardly wait to find out what happened next. The book is very readable (I had the Kindle Edition which had only a few typos). There is some course language in there, but also a bit of common sense wisdom. King creates characters you care about and the time travel plot about an attempt to stop Kennedy being assassinated makes for a great romp. Well Done, Mr King!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|A riveting read!<br />A story with a twist in its tail!<br />I can highly recommend this compelling read.<br />A page turner!
0446580848|3.0|Potential for a great read was here, but this book needed a better editor.  Character John Corey,s side bars were often predictable and nearly always redundant.  DeMille could have told this story in under 400 pages yet it goes on and on for a whooping 576.  Still love Demille, this one just isnt one of his best
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This movie has so much action and is funny at the same time.  I love Malcovich, he's hilarious.  Have fun.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book deserves 5 ecstatic, hilarious, laugh-out-loud stars. And five aren't even enough.<br /><br />No matter what you are doing or where you are right now, get this book and read it. It is such a breath of fresh air. As much as I like the angsty, heart-breaking smutty romances, this one is such light-hearted fun. It left me with a smile on my face for days while reading it and had me quoting parts of the books to people out of the blue because they came to my mind. This book will make you laugh, make you cry, will warm your heart.<br /><br />Written from the point of view of the male main character Drew, a rich successful investment banker that happens to have seen more vaginas than any gynaecologist on this earth, he will win your heart in an instant and make you keel over with laughter.<br /><br />The playboy of all playboys suddenly falls in love and the world turns upside down. All due to Kate, a new colleague at his father's firm.<br /><br />Drew tells us the story of meeting Kate, being attracted to her, arguing with her, falling in love with her, arguing some more until the grand finale. The way Drew thinks, talks, feels and behaves might feel misogynistic to some. I find there is so much truth in his statements and observations. He really calls it the way he sees it. He doesn't lie or lead woman on. He is upfront that he doesn't do relationship. So I really did not find a single thing about Drew that I did not to like. His sense of humour and the comments are so funny, I was snorting tea through my nose at various points of this book.<br /><br />I loved the interactions between him and his friends, him and his sister but what made my knees all wobbly for him was the interaction between him and his niece. It was the sweetest thing. His niece is a little firecracker and you can tell she's got some of her uncle's traits.<br /><br />I loved his banter with Kate. No wonder she couldn't withstand his charm. Her character was fabulous as well. Strong, ambitious, a career woman, but still sweet, caring, fair and loyal. I liked her from the start.<br /><br />And the sex scenes between her and Drew....oh dear smutty goodness.<br /><br />I'll be honest here, I don't think any words can do this book justice. Emma Chase has managed to write a book that is light-hearted yet not without a message, that is steamy yet not sleazy, that is funny yet not without some serious moments and that is witty yet not over-the-top. I'd love to share a quote, but then I would just have to copy the whole book into my review.<br /><br />In case you can't tell, I am incapable of forming a coherent thought and am totally fangirling here.<br /><br />Go read it. Now.
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|Hanson has done it again, and I think they might've done it better than all the other times they've done it.  Anthem is an amazing record.  So soulful, rocking and melodic!  Every song has its own personality.  I personally love Lost Without You, Tragic Symphony and Scream and Be Free.  Anthem is just full of heartfelt, incredible music.
B00000634K|4.0|Sound is good, but recommend getting cd.  Lennon is the man.  Has really good hits on it. Terrific selection.<br />Good product.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a very fun puzzle game.  You slide pieces around a board to create a final shape.  It is very polished with great animations.
193700788X|5.0|I have read each of the Sookie Stackhouse novels in order. Some were better than others. The final book is a great success. It is guaranteed to leave no characters hanging. Good prevails, evil is bested, and there are no unanswered questions. I have no intention of being a spoiler so I won't say who wins the heroine in the end. Just that there will be a happy ever after.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|After I bought the Skynet Edition Blu Ray of T2 I've loved this version. I love the way they brought back KYLE and all the points we don't see in the theatrical.
B00BV2M9LO|1.0|Normally, I am not one to harshly criticize someone's writing or to outright hate a book. I tend to find at least some redeeming qualities. This &#34;masterpiece&#34;, however, really deserves a single star. (-1 stars, really, if they allowed that.)<br /><br />The characters are so one-dimensional to be completely unbelievable. The plot line has major holes in it. (Since when is it possible to retrieve recordings of somebody's phone conversation *after* the fact? And a hacker acquaintance doing it in a few hours?) Also, characters' actions often seem ludicrous. (Why doesn't Peter tell the cops he recognizes the woman on the cliff? Why does he confront the Nanigen officials with his DVD in this completely arsenine way and thinks that's a good idea?)<br /><br />Those are just the worst parts.<br /><br />Please do yourselves a favour and invest your money and time into a different book.
B00BGI076M|5.0|Finally, complex TV for smart people.  I had almost given up on Hollywood.  The New Yorker was right - really good.
0307895505|5.0|could not do the game with out this book now when there is a book for a game I get it thanks
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Easily in my top five authors and top 10 books.Top of the list for fantasy authors and books, sucks you in and keeps you reading. I would say this is Assassins Apprentice mated with Harry Potter and it works great!
B001EN71CW|5.0|It's a mash-up of spaceship sci-fi, the postbellum American wild-west, and some of the most careful and well-wrought creative efforts put on a screen. What's not to like?
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Worth the time. Not an amazing movie but good if you have some extra time and need to be entertained.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|this is a superman for a new generation and an old one as well. A great origin story and a great reboot for the man of steel. and this time a fights superpowered villians. one thing i will say is that marvel may have some competition real soon. lets hope that steel and wonderwoman supergirl and greenlantern get movies in the future.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Not an amazing movie but good if you have some extra time and need to be entertained, not for kids and not for couples prone to fighting… there are some very awkward moments, which is par for these actors and directors.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|It was fun for me to be able to run around the yard with a M1 Garand. I really can't wait for more weapons. Hopefully a whole selection of American, German, and Russian guns. Possibly even some French, Italian, British, and Japanese to. Would give five stars but flash doesn't work on my kindle :(
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|This album is by far the most rock-inspired album (of the six studio albums). I listened to The Walk & Shout It Out, they were pretty sweet, but THIS is perfection in a shiny round disc. This is the album I've been patiently waiting for for sixteen years. #Anthem
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a great book with tons of twists and turns. New favorite author. Would read another book by this author again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so addictive and really makes you think. ANYTHING can be a clue! Makes you rate after level 8 or else you cant move on.
B00COHIFQS|2.0|The following pages link to this post on the Internet and email tools and resources to help you out of the most popular games and more than just a little bit of an issue
1401937519|5.0|Excellent narrative. We are all in control of our own lives, despite what we believe. It is good to see someone overcome their disaster and rise above, showing the way for others to do the same, if they only will believe.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|awesome game highly recommended great graphics great game play runs excellent on kindle fire must have game as well as all other Dungeon hunter games great way to past time
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|I love having this series on DVD so I can watch the episodes over and over, getting more nuances from them. Great story line.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved the game was on it for hours without getting bored can't wait for new levels love it love it love it you should definetley download
1451662432|5.0|Very well and very interesting written. I loved this book.  He is a very interesting person.  So glad I know now more about him.
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia has a Skyward Sword bias but all the Zelda games are present here.  Obviously the post-90s Zelda games have more information available but even with Skyward Sword there's a lot of great concept art and notes for the diehard Zelda fan.  There's a Zelda manga in the back but I would have greatly preferred Shotaro Ishinomori amazing A Link to the Past comic that was serialized in Nintendo Power.
B0038W0OIK|2.0|It was great at first I loved it great sound quality and felt good on my head great for gaming. Then about 4 months after I got them the left ear cup stopped working. Got in touch with tech support they said I should ship them to them and they would replace them so I did cost me $15 to ship them back. Finally after a week or so got the refurbished or new ones it was hard to tell witch. Then about 1 to 2 months later same problem again except this time it was with the right ear cup. I think this has to do with the way they are built to come apart. Anyway don't bother with these they are a waste of time and money.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It is well written and captivating. The ending is shocking. I read it twice and it was wonderful to pay attention to the subtle details during the second reading. The best book that I've read in a long time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool little puzzle game. Like everyone else said not too easy and not too tough. Fun for about an hour or so. I recommend highly
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Plenty of twists and turns to keep you wanting more. Well-written, very exciting and filled with suspense. Can't wait to read the next installment!
1451695195|5.0|could not put it down.His practice is in Lynchburg, Va, Do I believe. I don't know. but would recommend it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|The story with all it's intricacies is a definite Connelly hallmark. Trying to figure it out always proves to be a great read and an enjoyable passage of time.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quintin has been hands down one the the most creative and influential director/story tellers of our time. This could be his best work in my eyes, and with a past like he has that's saying a lot. He blew it out of the water with the orignal screen play and casting of the film. From begining to end i felt the story built and drew the viewer in closer at every turn. The acting was nothing less than superb and served as a strong example of what casting the correct actiors in a role can achive. I have been an enthusiest of Quintins work for 15 years or more, and consider him one of the most creative individuals in hollywood. If you haven't seen it, i would plan to do so.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Love this movie!!!  Purchased online because it was hard to find in stores and the price was actually better online too!  I would definitely purchase again!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|My Mother saw this movie in the theatre when it debuted in 1964, and was the only movie she ever went to see more than once in the theatre.  We had the double VHS set for years, with video quality that left lots to be desired, and sound that was out of sync during the entire Do-Re-Mi sequence.  This Blu-ray brought back the memories of seeing it on the big screen, and is much clearer than anything ever available before.  The commemorative book is great, and the box is sturdy and very nice looking on the shelf.  A no brainer purchase decision for anyone who has loved this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There were twists and turns in the book that I did not expect! I am going to read the 3rd book right away.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read this twice now!!!!  And will read it again and again<br /><br />This series always has me wanting more. I wish it was 10 books instead of only 3!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was a smart, fast read that delves into the deep questions of identity and humanity in a war story wrapper. Great job!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a great book. It is worth the time it takes to read. It is a book that can really broaden one's views about war and how it can affect anyone.
B009PAETCG|5.0|you get to curve balls and it gets easy then it gets hard its a good game and you get to see how good you are
B00881VLCE|4.0|This puzzle is very comm<br /> on your spirit and so l am enjoying the quiet and soothing time the game has brought.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|We'd seen this one before, and probably only bought it because it was on sale, but we think it is pretty entertaining!
B00DF0POXA|4.0|the first time i herd this album i was very shock that he changed his flow i dident like the album afther first listen i was so dispointed but i went back listing again its was not that bad afther people hated yeezus but the only song i listen to was bound 2 thats it the others was ok but going the wrong way kanye need to get back to the collage drop out days and make a part 2 i will give this album a 3 star but i like others songs but just give this album a chance you may not like it first but just try to give a secound chance you will not be dispointed
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|we knew we would love this movie because we'd seen it before a few years ago, and have children obsessed with Miyazaki films.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's entertaining and well made. They need more levels. I like it! The puzzles are not trivial but it could be harder... the could use effects such as moving the device fram side to side to uncover things
B004FEJ3VY|3.0|Arrived sooner than expected which was GREAT!  Although the toy is not 5 stars.  My son who is a Master at Transformers, said it was not made as well as he would have liked, and when put together in truck form, the wheels do not work right.  He was a little disappointed in the toy.  He does like it when it is transformed, but not perfectly molded to fit right.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the UK version. There isn't anything left out, you get to see the episodes in their entirety as they originally played.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The levels are not so hard that you can't figure them out.  Nor are they so easy that you get the level in a few seconds.  More levels would have been MUCH better.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This is crap there is a game called minecraft they copyrighted this thing.... I think lol :P Maybe it is just minecraft
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|It was ok. I only continued reading because I read the first two books and I always give the book a chance. I didn't like this one as much. But it did reveal much more than the first two. Wish the story would actually end! It's just dragging on.....
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|According to several sources on the internet, the release of the blu-ray version of Shane has been delayed until August to address fan concerns about the altered aspect ratio.  The reports say that the new blu-ray version will now be in the original 1.37:1 aspect ratio.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|After AFFC, I was ready to jump into this book and I LOVE IT!  You won't be disappointed if you read it.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|The movie is extremely well put together. Kids and adults alike enjoyed the antics of the toys and the imagination of the Pixar animators.
B008602KQI|5.0|The fact that's it was a new idea was what I liked best. they did leave a little out of the movie, but then they always seem to do that, I have not met a director yet , that knew more than the author.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I'm not sure what all the fuss was about this book. It was good but not greatest thing I've ever read. Entertaining and after some reading I enjoyed the perspective of post war reporter. Go ahead. Read it
B003SNKBXW|3.0|This book was not as interesting as other books I have read by Perez-Riverte. Try The Flanders Panel for a better read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this instead of my calculation. I like it better. I would recommend this especially because it is free
B008C1O8CA|4.0|Punk masters Green Day released their studio album \\"Uno\\" in 2012. This album is part of a trilogy of records that came out that same year. While I have never been the biggest Green Day fan, admittedly, this album really caught me by surprise and turned out to be really enjoyable.<br /><br />Blowing up when the punk resurgence of the early 90s was happening, Green Day has since evolved into a pop-punk force to be reckoned with. These guys have essentially remade themselves from hardcore punks to radio-friendly rock stars. This album shows everything you need to know about why these guys have stayed viable for over twenty years. The songs on the album are all pop-rock friendly; they don't even get to sappy or contrived, but they meet that happy medium of rock and pop. The production of the record is also really well done, and the band sounds as great as ever musically. My favorite songs from the record are \\"Carpe Diem,\\" \\"Oh Love,\\" \\"Feel for You\\" and \\"Let Yourself Go.\\"<br /><br />If your a Green Day fan at all, then this album is for you. If you like the whole modern pop-punk thing that's been going on, you'll also like this album quite a bit. I been a fan of this band for a while, and this is one of their easiest albums to listen to in my opinion.

B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I have paid for this movie and have not been able to watch it. Even more frustrating...THERE IS NOWHERE ON YOUR SITE TO REPORT THAT MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP MOVIES ARE NOT PLAYING!!!I am a loyal and devoted Amazon member, convinced of its superiority over alternate mediums, but am very disappointed that I cannot voice my concern directly, and must hope that someone human reads this and makes adjustments. Please correct this issue before I have to go back to Netflix. Thank you
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|Movie was terrible.  Super cheesy, many flaws to the story (wreck the car, next scene it's perfect, zombies can't drive but all of a sudden they can when they need to etc).  I knew it wouldn't be realistic, but it was just plain dumb.<br />Don't recommend.

I have the utmost respect for Navy SEALs...absolutely amazing account of the recovery and extraction of a member of the CIA, who had been taken hostage. These Navy SEALs will stop at nothing. They go in 'dark' and it was an incredible insertion! From beginning to end it is well worth having purchased it. I have already watched it twice!!!

B001NLKZUA|4.0|I got hooked on this series by chance and so far enjoying it.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|I almost quit reading &#34; The Kitchen House&#34; before I finished it but persevered because it was a book club selection.  I was glad I did because it was an eye opener.  I did begin to care about the characters although they were mostly stereotypical.<br />The author has left the ending wide open to continue the story in her next book, which I probably will not read.

B00C5W3SBE|4.0|One of the most cherished films for nearly everyone who's ever seen a movie is THE WIZARD OF OZ. Made in 1939 this movie still captivates viewers to this day, young and old alike. Sequels have been made over the years but none have captured the magic that the original film did. But the recent release OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL comes pretty darn close.<br /><br />The film opens like the original, in black and white and in Kansas, where a traveling circus plays to the farmers nearby. Magician Oscar Diggs, known as Oz (James Franco) has brought on a new assistant, just like he does in every new town, by romancing her. The one possible love of his life, Annie (Michelle Williams), has shown up to let him know she's considering a proposal from a local man. Unable to take care of her he does the right thing and encourages her to do so. At about this time the circus strong man, whose wife Diggs romanced as well, heads for his wagon with intent to kill. A quick escape in a hot air balloon would help if it weren't for the tornado heading Digg's way.<br /><br />Swept up in the middle of the tornado, Diggs begs for the chance to redeem himself. That chance is granted and he lands in an odd little place called Oz. With the help of a beautiful young witch named Theodora (Mila Kunis), the head to the great Emerald City. Along the way she tells him the story of Oz, how a young witch killed her own father the King to take over and how he had foretold them all that a wizard of great power would come to save them. Oz/Diggs the con man knows better but Theodora and everyone they meet consider him their saving grace. Theodora also decides that the two of them will marry, something that comes back to haunt her later.<br /><br />They arrive at the city and are greeted by Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) who doubts Oz' abilities or claim to being a wizard. She too falls under his spell though and sends him on a mission. That mission is to retrieve the wand of the witch whose father was killed and break it, ending her power.<br /><br />Diggs sets out and along the way makes some friends who accompany him, one of which he came across earlier. They find the witch, Glinda (also played by Michelle Williams) but also discover something else. Just what that is I won't reveal as it twists the story being told. Just know that things aren't always what they seem. The story takes an odd turn here and changes just about everything and everyone in the process. Just how Diggs and his friends will survive makes for an interesting and delightful movie.<br /><br />At the heart of this film, as with the original, there is a story of change and of finding oneself. The original had four characters who thought they didn't have the things they needed but discovering that they had them inside all along. This film offers a similar concept with Diggs/Oz discovering that perhaps he's not the scoundrel we witnessed at the beginning of the film nor the complete waste of humanity that he thinks he is. Finding out just who he really is and what he is capable of rounds out the tale being told.<br /><br />The acting on screen is well done to the point where some characters that could have been played over the top are made real by the performances seen. This would be especially difficult considering most of the film is shot on green screen for special effects. But the entire cast does a remarkable job.<br /><br />Director Sam Raimi (the original EVIL DEAD and SPIDER-MAN 1, 2 & 3) does a fantastic job of combining eye catching visual effects that make the land of Oz believable while at the same time getting these actors to turn in great performances. He also brings to life characters that we've never met before like China Girl and has us caring about what happens to them. As with the original you'll find many touching moments here captured right beside the adventure being told.<br /><br />Set before the events of the earlier film, this one could leave the door open for numerous sequels and indeed author L. Frank Baum did write numerous books that took place in Oz. Many of these are free to download for e-book readers online at sites like manybooks.net. If Raimi has intentions of using those stories to build from this one, I for one look forward to them. This movie was one to not only watch but to watch again and again, shared with children old and young alike.s sequels and indeed author L. Frank Baum did write numerous books that took place in Oz.

B0047BXRB2|5.0|I first saw this film at the theatre way back in 1956.  I liked it then and still like it now.  I think all the actors are (like the Krell) mostly dead now but their work will live on now in this classic film.<br /><br />Altair 4 is a beautiful little green world 22 light years from earth.  It was there some 20 years in the past that Dr. Edward Morbius, (Walter Pidgeon) his wife and crew of the Belleraphon began to explore this world.  Millions of years ago it was the home of the Krell, a wise an noble race of beings that had been wiped out in a single night.<br /><br />Commanded by John J. Adams, (Leslie Nielson) the space crusier C-57D and her crew arrives from earth to check on the situation here.  They are greeted by a robot (Robby ) who is fluent in 188 languages and is more advanced than all of earth's sciences could have created, However, Morbius insistes it is only a useful toy.<br /><br />Commander Adams meets, then falls in love with Morbius' daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) who has a way with animals and, except for her father, has never seen an earth man before.  It then an unseen force begins to kill the crew of the C-57D one by one, just as it had on the Belleraphon crew 22 years in the past.<br /><br />This film seems to be ageless, despite the 57 years of advances in technology.  Gene Roddenberry was so impressed by it, he used it as a template for the series Star Trek. The film's development is far beyond the typical monsters from space as the 1950's film industry had been cranking out (ie. Creature From the Black Lagoon etc. etc.).<br /><br />And so I find myself many years later buying a copy of the 50th anniversary edition and being excited about having it.  I wonder how many generations of us will continue to enjoy the movie.  Perhaps, in years to come, our descendants may actually visit the world of the Krell.
0061353248|5.0|A super fun read for anyone interested in behavior economics or marketing. This book will have you thinking about how marketers work and how the human mind interprets information.
B001CDWFPC|3.0|The ESV Study Bible is the best study Bible you can buy, hands down. I own the print version and it is rich in content. The study notes are fairly conservatively written, and the charts, illustrations, and diagrams are very, very good. All of these features are included in the Kindle version and when I saw it on sale for only $4.99, i jumped at it.<br />However, what it offers in content, it lacks in maneuverability. It works fine, if just a tad slow, on my Kindle Fire (first generation)but is very slow and sluggish on the Kindle app I have loaded on several other devices (PC, Android phone, Nook HD+). The navigation on my Kindle Keyboard is somewhat cumbersome, but not impossible to work with.<br />I'll continue to use it but will have to resign myself to either the print version or using it on my Kindle Fire exclusively.

B0060MYKTY|3.0|I really loved this second season of the Borgias and would have given it a 5-star rating, except that none of the Special Features which are advertised on the back of the case and listed inside the case as part of Disc 3 seem to be accessible.  Although Disc 3 itself is clearly labeled as including Special Features, the Main Menu of that disc (and that of the other two discs as well) doesn't list any such Special Features, only \\"Play All\\", \\"Episode Selection\\", \\"Set Up\\", and \\"BD Live Connection\\".  So, where are the advertised Special Features and how are you supposed to access them??

Yves Pigneur, the coauthor is very compelling as well both in person and in his obvious input and collaboration with Alex.  These guys are changing the world and I am happy to be part of it.
0525953728|5.0|Mesmerizing!  I couldn't put it down.  Very well written.  I didn't want the book to come to an end.  I'm glad this soldier was brave enough to come forward and reveal the truth and give credit where credit was due.

B009NY43NY|4.0|On Goodreads, I've rated this book with 3 stars, which by first glance doesn't look all that good, but it actually means 'I liked it'. And I did. I don't think Charlaine Harris deserves the bashing she's gotten from many of her reviewers, (especially on Amazon),  because I can appreciate that she admitted she had told every story she felt Sookie had to tell and didn't want the series to continue and possibly suffer until nobody cared anymore. Sometimes you have to know when to quit and I think she did the right thing. That said, I am going to miss Sookie and all of her cohorts. They gave me many hours of entertainment and actually introduced me to the entire vampire genre that I had completely ignored previously.<br /><br />I am not a fan of TrueBlood and I do not watch the show. I am content with the ending Ms. Harris came up with for the book series and I commend her for making the difficult decision to end a beloved series, even though the fans were sure to be upset with her. That takes guts and Charlaine Harris has guts.
B000FC12SM|5.0|Excellent book.  Should be a required read for all men and women who are dating and contemplating marriage.  Wish I would have read this 10 years ago would have been a good information for the last 3-4 years of my 22 year marriage.

B001ANSSDC|3.0|I have not seen the movie, which got high ratings. The book is just so sad; with its dysfunctional family, mental illness, etc.<br />It left me feeling empty and as it I wasted time reading it.
B00BXVKKPA|2.0|I bought this pretty much from the reviews saying these guys are a good AC/DC clone.  Of course back in the day you had Krokus, and more recently Rhino Bucket filling in that role.  These guys are a disappointment......it's the vocals!!  They have this chanty, sing-along chorusy vocal thing that just stinks.  Listen to the beginning of the first tune and see what I mean.  What we need is a good, sneering Bon-style vocal whereas this is hair metal, Def Leppard style and it just ruins any rocking attempt they try.  It's so bad I couldn't finish listening to the thing.  Oh well.....when's the next Rhino Bucket album coming out??!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for more. Wasn't to hard but yet you still had to work for it! I really enjoyed th his game

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best games I`'ve played in quite some time. Played it off and on for days. Totally enjoyed it.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Up close it looks rather cheap. It's plastic so that's probably why. The square plastic button that moves it up and down also pops off super easily and that's annoying since I don't want to lose it. Overall though I really like it. It's a great prop and the noise is spot on!
B0035XVVDY|5.0|I liked this DVD because I was upset when this man`s family was killed. I think he did the right thing about getting back. But he went to far and was killed later. It was an very good DVD.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This game tests patience and concentration and memory. It always provides a satisfactory solution if the player sticks withit.

B00CEMH31Q|3.0|It is very Hanson , something I would have expected. I love the new sound that echoes the 70's. I just wish they would start sinning about more meaningful stuff other than girls and broken hearts- lets try world peace next time . They have more potential than this album offers. Please let Taylor do the vocals , he is the strongest asset to the group, and perhaps next time let us hear more of his voice rather than a bashing of instruments behind him. Not there strongest album but any collector should have this at hand and perhaps listening to it more than once one would start to enjoy more of the tracks . Get the girl back was one I would listen to over again xxx
0007477155|5.0|I choose this rating because the product is excelent, is exactly the same as the seller shows. If everyone saw the show on HBO, i recomend to read the books because are better.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Having read history all my life, I found reading this book very much like reading medieval history only history is much worse. So I got used to the characters getting killed. What this book is really about is honor and strength of mind to make the right decisions to achieve a good outcome. Some of the characters did that and some didn't and they paid a heavy price. I loved all of it and will keep reading. What an ending!
0061122416|5.0|The book is amazing. Take you to places you never imagine. I can read this book over and over. I will definitely recommend this book to friends and family
B005COO1X6|3.0|I doubt many fans are going to think that Mile 81 lives up to King's highest standards, but it's still an entertaining (though not very scary) tale. Definitely worth a read, but be warned that it's not very long.

B007REV4T8|5.0|In Casino Royale, Bond is new to spycraft and is expertly played by Vesper Lynd. Having set up Bond as a maladjusted youth and coldblooded adult the inference is that for him this is a rare connection in his life. Having been betrayed on multiple levels, Quantum of Solace is a twisted film wherein the organization that dominated Vesper into her actions is taken down piece by piece: you're never quite sure how much is revenge for her or against her. In the opening minutes Bond frankly states that he has no friends.<br /><br />In this film Bond has apparently continued to be a tactical asset as his purpose in life. When a risky action is sanctioned to take out an enemy of the state Bond is sent into the depths to heal and take a look at his life. Upon his return we see the beginning of the distance the character is famous for: the quick wit and black humor comes from a sense of worthlessness and betrayal by everyone around him. Unable to drop his guard and isolated, we see a man who does attempt to connect with others on the only level he believes he has. His existence outside the system in his professional life transgresses into the personal.<br /><br />By the end of the film Bond has survived most everyone he entered into the life with: and like the postmodern world he represents continues on a journey with no apparent destination.
B00338QENI|5.0|This should be added to any high school class non-fiction reading list, as it tells a story of our history as well as a potential troubling future of genetic foul play.

Chimamanda is a fantastic writer and I really enjoyed reading this and highlighting lots of excellent phrases that should take my through discussions next time races comes up. The ending was a little too formulaic and disappointing for me and Ifemelu becomes less and less likable as you read through.
1781162646|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal.  I blasted through it in three days flat.  After reading a couple choice reviews, I will agree with one common complaint... it is hardly hard case crime.  BUT!  If you go into this book with zero expectations, you will love it.  Just as others have said, it is more of a coming of age tale about a young man working at an amusement park in his college years.  But it is so much more than that.  It is lyrical.  The characters are strong and unique.  There are several plot twists that I didn't see coming.  The way King narrates the book in the first person is poignant, and you can literally see, feel, smell, and sense everything this young man is going through.  And if you are older than 21, you'll be able to relate to his yearnings and actions, as well.  There were several parts that were very 'human' that is to say, they seem very real, which, being an author myself, is what good writing does.  To me, it doesn't matter if this book doesn't live up to it's hard case crime claim.  The story was great, some parts tugged at my heart strings, and there were parts that really got your heart going with excitement and fear.  NOTE: There is a crime case, but it plays itself out in the background, but for the story that is told, that item isn't a huge issue (at least it wasn't for me).  One thing I found strange when I first started reading the book (and which I warmed up to when I got about 50 pages in) is the lack of chapters.  Each section is marked with a cute little heart, but after getting a flavor for the plot and story line, those hearts do seem appropriate.  I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a heartfelt and very real story, with a little bit of crime, and a little bit of a supernatural twist.  King is my favorite author, and I will continue to love the wide breadth of stories he creates and churns out for the world.
B00BPXKWGS|4.0|It was good, always like rem.  They sound great at that age and stage of their career, Im sure they will do more new music
B00BYISRC0|5.0|Some of the songs seem like the continuation of 'High Violet'. The band didn't disappoint me at all. 13 songs, very good lyrics, all issued on 2 vinyls with a code for downloading mp3 and flac versions.

0786955554|5.0|First, let me start off by saying I don't own a battle mat, but I own several Flip-Mats. I bought 2 of these and 2 of the wilderness set. Each box provides you with a decent collection of slightly generic, but useful tiles to create a dungeon on the fly. I'm not fond of the smaller more location specific sets, so to bolster my tile collection I simply bought 2 of this box... twice the tiles, w00t!<br /><br />I also recommend the Wilderness set...<br />http://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Tiles-Master-Set-Wilderness/dp/0786956127/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1371681199&sr=8-1&keywords=dungeon+tiles+master+set+the+wilderness<br /><br />I do not recommend the City set...<br />I find the City set extremely underwhelming and ugly, I would rather just use Game Mastery Flip-Mats (Village Square)  and GameMastery Map Packs (Shops).
B008OOYALE|3.0|I love this game! It's so addictive! The dragons are cute and funny looking! Wondering why I gave it three stars? I wanted to expand my &quot;Isle&quot; but when I did it said I could wait to expand or use twenty &quot;gold.&quot; Then when I tapped wait it spent all my gold! And to earn &quot;money&quot; on the missions you  have to spend up to three times as much as you earn! Shame on you TeamLava! Now I'm saving all my money for only the dragons, not the super costly missions!

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great for a free game should check it out honestly was just searching for random things and stumbled on this
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Fantastic cast, superb writing, beautifully filmed, both serious, and amusing, absolutely enjoyable. It takes two watchings to catch all of the detials, even for people familiar with the subject and the history of the period, but I do not see how it could have been done otherwise. It will be a film I will frequently re-watch, and re-watch with immense pleasire. Of course, the snobs among the critics panned it, but professional critics write criticism because they can write nothing else. Buy and enjoy.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I liked all the characters.  I liked the plot.  I felt it was very witty and quirky.  It was very interesting all the way through with ups and downs.  I like how it was written.  I also liked Remember Me and Can You Keep a Secret and Twenties Girl (see my reviews on here).  I have not read her Shop Aholic books yet but did see the movie which was made from Confessions of a Shopaholic.  Anyway I do recommend this book and look forward to her next.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|watching the muppets make me remember my chldhood. this movie is great it brings back memories of the muppet show the only scene i dislike in this movie is that disney children starts that appears in the end. they didint even know the muppets exist. overall good entertaining movie to watch :D
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|Enough of drilling our pockets, TWO TRACKS are missing of this 2 discs Soundtrack. Is Water Tower Music planning to release these in a Extended or a Special Edition??? This is unacceptable and pitiful! Beside the tracks are not in chronological order. The music is a huge Zimmer Production but this release is very poor.<br />AVOID SPOILER ALERT - AVOID SPOILER ALERT - AVOID SPOILER ALERT - AVOID SPOILER ALERT - AVOID SPOILER ALERT<br />First the track played when Jor-el is flying to get the codex [This track sounds as I Will Find Him and ARCADE but is not, this piece has a huge Wagner spirit] and the other is the track when Clark find the ship after he drilled the snow.

B00723NWJE|4.0|I have loved Norah's voice for a long time, but not much of her previous work. Finally she has created an album that portrays her voice in songs I love. Her band is great, my favorite tracks are the title track, Say Goodbye, Take It Back, Out on the Road, All A Dream, Miriam. I love the change from previous albums.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye West has built an impressive discography that is diverse in its production and themes.  The soul and orchestral feel of College Dropout and Late Registration, the techno polish of Graduation, the kitchen sink manifesto My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and now the jarring, minimalistic feel of Yeezus.  His albums have songs that range from socially conscious to socially irresponsible.<br /><br />In other words, Kanye West is a true artist.<br /><br />Yeezus is another masterpiece from rap's version of Stevie Wonder, reinventing his sound while at the same time sounding wholly familiar.  The album has a claustrophobic feel, as if this is the music Kanye would play to an imprisoned mind, spoon fed their ideals from Fox News, their perceptions on celebrities from TMZ, and their music from whatever floats from the toilet bowl to the Top 40.  It is raw, intense, and never asks, only demands the listener's attention.<br /><br />Bound 2 has a soothing set of samples that ride like a wave of early Kanye soul, but in a 2013, bareboned, almost punk rock way.  A tease with Charlie Wilson is juxtaposed to the infectious sample, not allowing us to feel comfortable with either portion, but enjoying the entire work.<br /><br />Other standouts include New Slaves, which has Kanye sharpen his Cruel Summer flow to perfection, and Black Skinhead, arguably the best produced album on the record.  The latter includes an outro that feels more like a victory song for even recording the preceding sonic assault.<br /><br />Is the album for everyone?  No.  It takes a certain listener to appreciate this, which speaks to the state of hip-hop, because all of the classic rap albums of yesteryear (Straight Outta Compton, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, Ready To Die, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, etc.) all had that same criteria.  This isn't the R&B chorus, techno beat, sexed up trendy pop of recent times.<br /><br />No, this album is a throwback.  Hip-hop was not founded on clichesand predictability.  You couldn't simply just throw it on for the uninitiated, and grant their passive enjoyment as they disregard everything but the most superficial elements.<br /><br />Yeezus is a return to the uncompromising, uncomfortable,in your face form of urban expression known as Hip-Hop.<br /><br />If you want a good album catered to current taste, I suggest J. Cole's Born Sinner or Mac Miller's Watching Movies With The Sound Off.  Or even the soon to be released The Gifted by Wale.<br /><br />But if you want music that cuts deep, pick up Yeezus.
B003XKNFVA|5.0|She is an excellent reporter on the life of the time.  Her characters are crisply identified.  the writing is clear. I was engaged from the start.  In fact I've read EMMA also and will read more
B009R659L8|4.0|This book was an ok read. Kind of slow. The end moved much faster. It was all right but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to be read.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|great movie... can't wait for part 2.  i watch it whenever it comes on cable as well. it is very entertaining but sad that kids have to be put to such extremes just to live a better life even if it is just a movie. and i wonder why no one rebels; however, i was informed by my sister and nephew that there will be an uprising, so i am anxious to see it.
B006TZBGBW|5.0|This box set is well worth the money. If you are a JP fan this is a great way to get ALL their cd's in one fast move.<br />I read the reveiws say the packageing is cheap but I disagree.<br />It is a nice compact pack that is easy to store in a collection.<br />The LP art is great.I still own all these on vinyl but thought it would be nice to have a set on cd as well.<br />For me money well spent. Glad I got them!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great app! I love having so many sound choices. I also like the fact that it will play continuously!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun, timeless classic brought into our age of tech, brilliance and elegance combined into this amazing app. Great if you have an hour or two to kill.
B005NQ94KS|2.0|This product was advertised as being brand new. When I got it in the mail today I could hear something moving in it. I thought maybe it was some inserts. No, instead the insert and the DVD were moving all around in it so now I have scratches on the front and the back of a supposedly &#34;New&#34; DVD. Also the plastic covering the case was like vacuum sealed on and was very hard to get off. I love this movie to death and the the book was phenomenal this packaging was not.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|You'll get hooked right off the bat! Fun! Great graphics. If you like tiny monsters you will like this game.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|First I need to point out that this review is for a FOUR port hub that is square. For some reason Amazon is now showing two other hubs with this same product identifier.<br /><br />The first hub I received worked reliably on some computers and cameras, and very inconsistently with other computers and cameras. But Anker customer support went out of their way to send me a replacement. They even paid shipping both ways as I returned the bad one.<br /><br />The new one seems, so far, to work without any of the problems I had before. I tested it with the same devices that were not staying connected before. So whatever was wrong, the replacement seems to have fixed the issue.<br /><br />I would recommend buying with confidence from Anker in the future, because I know if there is a problem they'll go to extra effort to make it right. That's rare, and needs to be rewarded with our purchasing dollars.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Keeps crashing on samsung galaxy s2 cyanogenmod 4.2.2 - just after splashscreen. Please fix it. Otherwise it's not good to put such apps in free ap of the day. Cyanogenmod is almost clean android...
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Well, what to say. A good book and a good addition to the series. There is a little additional development in the actual relationship between Eva and Gideon. You can see they are beginning to learn how to be secure in themselves and in each other. There were a few new minor issues beginning from their past issues and Gideon's criminal issues resolve just enough that a new twist can bloom; but overall there is not much else that takes place in this book. Feels more like a filler book than anything else. Not that I am complaining as any time spent in Gideon and Eva's world is nice but I can see how it will definitely upset others (since it really was suppose to be a trilogy). Overall, I enjoyed the book. It was an good read and left me feeling entertained but do not expect anything new or groundbreaking here. No big developments and conclusion for our couple, just some small baby steps and hot steamy sex (but how can I complain about that). HA! Overall, I would give the book a 4 star rating, because despite the lack of development and/or earth shaking plot growth; I still very much enjoy the story, writing and little amount of development in the couples relationship.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so much fun and crazy addictive! No freeze ups and you earn coins to upgrade quickly. Great way to pass time
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|It's an ok app. Honestly not worth the download. Ok sounds, graphics are blah, I seen better. Download at your own risk. Too many crazy privacy requirements.
030758836X|5.0|Loved this book and have ordered several others from this author. Suggest you do the same. Great reading and well written.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|An informative and insightful read that puts the present and future in your perspective. A must read for educators who need a window into the future of technology. If you made a decision to go with chromebooks for education (although not extensively covered in the book) this validates your decision.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It is a good game.  It's good for long car rides and it is fun and keeps you or your kids busses.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I want more levels for free. A couple of sections could of used a hint. The game makes you think. Putting in that algrabra was tricky.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Loved this story but would have loved more of Tyrion, Dany, Arya, Catelyn and Jon Snow! I wasn't excited about all the donnish and the Greyjoys but understand they are an important part of the story! Looking forward to the next book!
078322804X|5.0|After building up the duo's popularity through recordings and several performances on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd as \\"legendary\\" Chicago blues brothers(Jake and Elwood Blues)--took their act to the big screen in this action-packed hit from mid 1980.<br /><br />As Jake and Elwood struggle to reunite their old band and save the Chicago orphanage where they were raised, they wreak enough good-natured havoc to attract the entire Cook County police force. The result is a big-budget stunt-fest on a scale rarely attempted before or since, including extended car chases that result in the wanton destruction of shopping malls and more police cars than you can count.<br /><br />Along the way there's plenty of music to punctuate the action, including performances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown that are guaranteed to knock you out. As played with deadpan wit by Belushi and Aykroyd, the Blues Bros. are \\"On A Mission From God,\\" and that gives them a kind of reckless glee that keeps the movie from losing its comedic appeal.<br /><br />Otherwise this might have been just a bloated marathon of mayhem that quickly wears out its welcome (which is how some critics described this film and its 1998 sequel). Keep an eye out for Steven Spielberg as the city clerk who stamps some crucial paperwork near the end of the film.<br /><br />THE BLUES BROS. also amassed 115,229, 890 at the Box office in the Summer of 1980, but production was delayed when filming began in the Summer of 1979, due to John Belushi's serious drug abuse which only continued to worsen, plus Aykroyd & Belushi left SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE at the end of the previous season, especially since Belushi's fame & reputation was going down the toilet at the end of 1979.<br /><br />This musical comedy flick also had notable singers like<br />*John Lee Hooker as musician on Maxwell Street and non-musical supporting cast such as<br />*Director(John Landis)as State Trooper<br />*John Candy as Det. Burton Mercer<br />*Kathleen Freeman as Sister Mary<br />*Steve Lawrence as Maury Sline<br />*Steve Williams as Trooper Mount<br />*Twiggy as Chic Lady<br />*Henry Gibson as Head Nazi<br />*Frank Oz as Corrections Officer<br />*Famous director(Steven Spielberg) as Cook County Assessor clerk<br />*Chaka Khan as Choir soloist<br />*Paul Reubens(aka Pee-Wee Herman)as the ritzy Chez Paul restaurant waiter<br /><br />THE BLUES BROS. was also claimed to be the 1st American flick to gross more money overseas than it did in America.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Clean, to the point presentation.  Does what it claims simply.  I get the information that I want organized in a way that is most useful to me.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Captures great audio, and is very easy to mount/dismount. Has withstood pretty harsh treatment at times, especially when I was in a hurry and failed to put it in its storage bag. Great item that I would recommend to anyone.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I loved the first season of this show and shared it with my friends.  Not so taken with the second season - too mamy new characters.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|So many settings, so many great photos. I never use direct flash and the controls for pointing the flash for bounce flash are wonderful and numerous. First flash that I've owned that can take a good night photo at 300 feet.
0307591549|4.0|I tried some of the techniques in the book and I definitely found my happiness quotient improving.<br /><br />Being somewhat of a perfectionist, I tend to think &#34;I'll only be happy when...&#34;.  As Achor points out, when the &#34;when&#34; arrives, you'll just find some new need that has to be met before you can be happy.  So the take away is start being happy now.<br /><br />There are plenty of other techniques suggested in the book.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I have to &#34;tease out&#34; the techniques from the book as they are somewhat buried in the prose.  Perhaps a second book could be written; a book that cuts to the chase and gives out the techniques and some space to write down your observations and results.  Perhaps a work book?
0345803485|4.0|I am really enjoying this book! It started off slow in my opinion but now, I don't wanna put it down. I had no clue what the book was about when I ordered it, several people highly recommended that I read it so I purchased it glad I did :-) . I've already ordered book 2 can't wait to start it once I'm done with this one.
0756655307|5.0|This book is pure awesome...that's all I can say about it.  If you're a Marvel fan I highly recommend it.  Pick it up
B000LB7G00|3.0|I purchased to use with an HP Z1 workstation and Sketchup  8 Pro.  The ability of movement control is not as advertised.  Yes, when you use the &#34;getting familiar&#34; utility provided with SpaceNavigator's software, where movements are allowed one function at a time, it sure looks like a panacea, and performs flawlessly. Unfortunately, this is a bit of a rigged game.  When used within Sketchup itself, you don't have nearly the granularity of control; it's fairly difficult to keep the movements separate.  I find it, in fact,  to be a bit of an awkward novelty that has me using the  Sketchup's hand and orbit tools more often.  On average,  I'd say I'm using the 3D Mouse about 40% of the time.....simply because I bought it (as opposed to &#34;once you get used to this, you never go back&#34;. Not true.)
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I pre-ordered this Blu-ray/DVD Combo and it arrived just a day or two after it was released. Since then, my kids & I have watched it more than 10 times! Another great Disney/Pixar movie:-)

B0000714BP|5.0|I had ordered this before, but ordered the soundtrack CD by accident so I returned the CD and re-ordered and now all is good. Received the DVD way ahead of scheduled estimated delivery.
034580404X|2.0|I did not like the books.  They get boring after a while, and I skipped a lot of the wordage.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I tried to get it to download and it stops right at 33.33%.make this game worth .99 cent.horrible job. do better
B00CQGU9GG|4.0|Well I almost blew a gasket when I opened my new  box set for the first time because the discs themselves look *identical* to the generic black on silver original standard issue Warner Bros cd's.<br /><br />However I did a quick comparison with my old WB discs and wow, to my joy all of that previous annoying reverb is now gone!<br /><br />I'm not saying that they did such a great job on the remastering, in fact they don't really sound like they have any better dynamic range, highs & lows, etc, in fact they even sound a bit flat to my ears, but at least no more of that gross reverb & echo, hallelujah!<br /><br />So I guess that this new box will be the closest thing that we get to the original vinyl for now.<br /><br />Also the packaging os rather as basic as can be, though they did a pretty good job of shrinking the LP covers, though no protective inserts for the discs themselves, no additional tracks or booklets, nothing.<br /><br />But then 10 discs for less than $40 is a pretty good deal if you ask me, so enjoy you ZZ heads!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|you may think you knew it - and you did - but when written in the correct style, you might hear it differently... woke me up to a new/old world... a place i was ready and waiting for - you must be open to read the book and open to critique yourself to reward yourself as well.

B0000029GA|5.0|I bought this album on its reputation alone and i cannot quit listening to it! This is probably the greatest rap album made only rivaled, in my opinion, by The Wu-Tang Clans \\"Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers\\"
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I must have had some other idea as to what this movie was going to be about. I had the theme correct but thought the approach was way off from my perception. It turned out to be more than silly and the only reason I didn't stop watching was that I was hoping somehow that it was going to take a turn in a better direction. As it turned out, it never got any better. I would reccomend this movie to a child but wouldn't be surprised if the channel changed.

B00AKO93JK|2.0|It looks good, but it won't finish downloading. I have tried a few different ways with no luck. Anyone with same problem?
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|As the title noted, and recognizing that 2.5 hours is roughly 8 times the focused attention span of humans, I really think the trio of directors, cast and crew did a rather outstanding job of pulling together the novel's complex of six story lines, without losing sight of the books underlying purpose to suggest a rather disastrous ultimate outcome from the past several hundred years' unbridled economic, technological and political trends.<br /><br />I do have a few minor complaints regarding comparison with the book, specifically (1) I thought the resolution on another planet, which was at most implied in the book, yet ended the movie, was useful for video closure, but not necessary from a narrative perspective; (2) I realize that the Sonmi 451 narrative line was shortened, but I really think they made the chase scenes a bit extreme - admittedly, chase scenes in novels are not as useful as they are in movies, and (3) they left out a large part of the book's middle chase scene with the Kona after Zachry & Meronym (it was the middle, because the Zachry/Meronym chapter was number six of 11 - the book being written like a suite).<br /><br />I thought the Cavendish story line was very well done, as were most of the others.<br /><br />I do, however, recommend that everyone read the book. It is, without doubt, one of the best and most interesting that this international literature major ever read.

0783240287|5.0|My grandons love the Joseph DVD - my 4 yr old grandson knows most of the songs!  The 17 month old sings back up  (la la la la) in one of the songs.  They have seen it a few times and never tire of the music. In fact, I have the CD in the car - its the most requested CD by our grandons - I often play the music for the boys when they go to sleep - trouble is my 4 yr old grandon sings and doesnt sleep!  Now we did try a new song for them to listen to, Ring the Bell...............:) Now my grandson has added that song to his  list of songs.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Not one of the fastest readers out there, but this book was so good that I had trouble putting it down- i finished it in 3 days!  This novel sincerely changed my life (for the better) and put ideas into consideration that I never even thought about.  It opened my eyes.  I hardly ever cry at the ends of books, but John Green's eloquent language and emotion made me cry a waterfall at the end.  This book is so realistic and the reader can feel the characters' struggles and pain, happiness and joy.  This novel is a Must-Read.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|Magnificent! Buy it and share it! I'll write a better review later. I have to get to my headphones. Just buy it!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Glad I saw this movie.  Wish I could have seen it in theaters for the full visual effect!<br />Really sit down and watch this movie, it isn't one to watch in passing or as an after thought.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I believe this book will be a worthy addition to my classroom library. I can't wait to share it with my classes. Each character gives us a different perspective to consider, and for that, I am grateful.

0007466064|2.0|I thought this was the entire book of Dance With Dragons. The pictures are too small to know that this was only part 1 of 2 parts.I thought that 'Dreams and Dust was a sub-title. I feel cheated! I had to go back and buy the WHOLE book, so all I got out of this book was time. I got to read half of the book. Now, I have had to buy another book to get the rest of it. Feel like I was misinformed. It was in the same section as the complete book (5) It should have been under a separate listing. I don't know who is to blame, the seller or Amazon. Waste of my money!.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|I bought this because I wanted a basic reliable automatic watch, and this certainly delivers. I swapped out the strap it came with for a NATO strap- I have small wrists and the stock strap was on the last hole. It ran a bit fast out of the box (+15sec/day), but it's my understanding this is typical for the first 2 months until it breaks itself in (and it can always be regulated for better accuracy). Very happy with my purchase so far!
0761171703|5.0|gave this book to my daughter when, after 15 years, she decided to hang up her ballet shoes for sprinting spikes. Just looking at the pictures makes one happy and astonished. Reading the &#34;how' sections on how these photos were created makes you amazing and grateful for what the human spirit can accomplish.
B00B1MSL70|4.0|♬ saw it on the tube / bought it on the phone / now you're home alone / it's a piece of crap ♬<br /><br />'Old Ways' is the second of the Geffen records Neil released in the 80's and album 14. I'd missed this one in vinyl after &#34;Everybody's Rockin'&#34;.  CD's were all the rage that decade. The music on this album is first rate with enough friends and session players to give it a big sound. Stand-out tracks include, &#34;Are There Any More Real Cowboys?&#34; with Willie Nelson and &#34;Bound for Glory&#34;.  I found out in the release of &#34;A Treasure&#34; (Vol 9, NY Archives) that Geffen was suing Neil at this time for not recording NY-enough souding albums... f*#@n' doubters. And true to the Geffen legacy of screwing around with the sound, this particular pressing had to be the dirtiest I've ever seen, covered with dust and very rough edges. The finish is rough, the sound is fine and I won't send it back.<br /><br />As the song goes...  ♬ I went back to the store / they gave me four more / the guy told me at the door / it's a piece of crap ♬
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not for someone looking for a peaceful heart!! The story is great, the characters fascinating but the psychological tension makes me wish I had chosen something else for my exploration read! Still, gives me something trendy to talk about. So if you want something trendy, check it out.
1452115567|5.0|Whats not to love, i'm an avid photographer myself, and I love dogs. a full photography book of a dog standing on things around the country. It's so cute. A bit pricy but with how many pictures are inside its well worth it. it also takes a long time to get through the whole book, unless you dont mind starring at a dog for a couple hours. i took 3 days, flipping through a couple pictures every minute i got. its fun to bookmark pages and share them with children or friends who also love dogs.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|I was sad when I reached the end of the book as I wanted to hear more stories and accounts of WWZ.  The format was creative and provided for a fast and entertaining read.  Max Brooks has a well formed talent for moving a story along and creating a good deal of pathos in his characters.  I look forward to his next project.

B00CBSYDSE|5.0|Scale the Summit have done it again. After an incredible release in The Collective, they follow it up with a worthy successor in The Migration. Do not expect The Collective 2.0, this album has its own unique sound and feel. If you are a Scale the Summit fan, this album is a must buy, hands down. If you aren't a fan of Scale the Summit yet, it's time to give them a listen, they are a truly incredible band.

0062255657|5.0|Right up front I should admit, I'd never heard of Neil Gaiman before I read an enthusiastic newspaper review about this book and decided to preorder it a few days ago. Last night, it was wirelessly delivered to my Kindle and this morning, I picked it up and started reading. Almost instantly, I was so absorbed and lost in the storytelling experience that I didn't do anything else until I finished it a few hours later.<br /><br />It's a short book; it's enchanting; it's very well written...definitely top-quality fantasy literature. I'm not a fan of fantasy literature, but this book swept me away into such a delightful and fascinating series of incredible adventures--or should I say misadventures--that I could not pull myself away. The author is correct to warn that this is not a fable for children...the reality is far too stark and dark, and there are definitely some adult themes.<br /><br /> \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is a tale about a lonely bookish seven-year old whose life takes a terrifying turn into a dark and creepy reality. The child is never named, but in recent interviews, the author admits that this child is very much like he was at that age. The child lives in the lovely English countryside of Sussex--the same environment where the author grew up. And like Gaiman, the child is wise, responsible, and moral beyond his years. The parents are blithely confident that nothing bad could happen to their brilliant bookish son in such a bucolic setting. But of course, bad things can, and do happen, especially to the pure and innocent...<br /><br />The parents have no idea that the Hempstocks--an eleven-year-old girl, her mother, and grandmother--who live by a pond at the end of the lane, are really a group of immortals who play at being human. Our seven-year-old child makes friends with the girl, Lettie Hempstock, and she introduces him to the pond, which is really an ocean. Eventually, our narrator and Lettie take a trip into a higher plain of reality that is entered somehow through the property owned by the Hempstocks, and so begins a series of remarkable misadventures with unforeseen consequences.<br /><br />This novel is a heroic tale about the age-old battle between childhood innocence and mythic forces. The book will charm you, fill you with awe, make you feel on edge, surprise you, and make you want to keep on reading no mater what important obligations you might have waiting for you to accomplish.<br /><br />Since finishing the book this afternoon, I was so curious about this fine writer that I started doing research into his life, philosophy, and writing. It seems that in prepublication interviews, Gaiman says that he's prouder of this particular work than anything else he's ever written...and, as I learned today, this is an author who has had an insanely prolific career spanning blockbuster successes across a large number of different creative media. He says he's put an enormous amount of effort into writing and rewriting this book in order to get the tone, words, and dramatic focus just right. A number of critics have already said they consider this work to be as close to sterling literary fiction as Gaiman is ever likely to get.<br /><br />Indeed, I was very impressed. For me, this work is, without doubt, first-rate fantasy and escapist fiction...and very fine literature, as well. It delivers a highly imaginative, fabulous and fascinating fable that envelops, and attempts to explain, everything in the space-time continuum. Yes, it's that ambitious! It had me hooked from the first to the last page. Simply put: it is an incredible gem of a novel.is entered somehow through the property owned by the Hempstocks, and so begins a series of remarkable misadventures with unforeseen consequences.<br /><br />This novel is a heroic tale about the age-old battle between childhood innocence and mythic forces.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|There were a lot of twists to this season.  I thought the second season was even better than the first.  Anxiously awaiting season 3.
B004LWZW6U|4.0|Its not as good as the first one but it's still decent for what it is. It's extremely predictable but you can't really expect too much from this movie. If you liked the first you'll more than likely enjoy the second.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A GREAT way to pass the time while riding in a car. I usually play hidden object games, this is a nice change of pace.

B00AKO93JK|3.0|The free app of the day from Amazon.com for June 18, 2013 is Daily Workouts from Daily Workout Apps.<br /><br />If this app seems familiar and you have gotten exercise apps as free apps of the day before, it is because this is a bundle of then app maker name Daniel Miller's exercise apps and some of them were previously given away as free apps of the day last year.<br /><br />There are both positives and negatives by presenting this in a bundled version.  The positives are that it is easier to find the app you are looking for if you have a lot of apps in your app list and this one will let you choose and mix exercises from the 5 previously separate apps.<br /><br />The negatives are that since this has video clips from all the 5 previously separate apps, this new combined app uses a lot of app space (almost 50 megs) which could be a problem if you have a lot of apps stored on your device and little free space.  Also an improved interface could have been nice along with more integration instead of just throwing the 5 previous apps into a single package.<br /><br />Since this offers little new that the individual entries didn't have and the interface and integration could probably be somewhat improved, I am going to give this 3 out of 5 stars.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|Its different.  Not much \\"music\\" or \\"traditional Kanye style music.  alot of just loud thunder and lightening.  Not happy.  Dark twisted fantasy was much better.  i do like \\"hold my liquor\\" and dark skinheads.
B0097C8XL0|3.0|Ok the game is ok at first it was kinda lame ha I mean really lame. But then my friend convinced me to play it again and it was... Ok ....to pretty good. Just saying the game gets boring after awhile u can't keep playing it over and over again and again.  3 stars  grade B.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|these things are so adorable and perfect and fluffy and cute and they are just absolutely fabulous. 5 out of 5
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I agree with a previous reviewer who likened this to Myst. I felt some of the same wonder in figuring out the mechanical intricacies. The notes also had a similar feel. I loved the music. This game is different enough to be captivating. I wish it had been longer but realize how difficult it must have been to create such a high quality game.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Guys watched  the video play it love it good hate it bad I love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it PLAY THE GAME
B00BFIFIPS|4.0|I love this case ! It's good ! I love the color . The price is expensive but overall a good deal ..
0399159347|5.0|I was hooked from the very first page of this novel wondering what was in the mysterious letter that Cecelia found addressed to her in the event of her (very much alive) husband's death. And when I found out what the letter said, I was even more hooked. Even toward the end when I could pretty much tell where things were heading, I just had to keep reading to find out how it was all going to play out. The writing was good, the characters real, and Moriarty did a great job at just dropping enough info to keep me turning pages without giving the whole thing away. I've never heard of Liane Moriarty before but you can bet I'll be checking out her other books after reading The Husband's Secret.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I thought it was a great documentary that told the up and downs  the band and the great success that they still have after forty years

0425263908|4.0|I liked it, its well written and entertaining.  Not as addicting as 50 Shades.  Has a lot of sex  ( and oral sex) parts but besides that nothing like what 50 shades had.

0062059963|5.0|I've been dying to read The Elite after finishing The Selection the only reason I've avoided it the last few months is because the wait for The One is so long. The Elite starts off right after the end of The Selection with the six remaining girls still all attempting to win over the prince Maxom. America is torn between being with the man she's falling in love with and the man she's loved for so long.<br /><br />While the girls remain focused on winning the prince's heart around them attacks from both the north and south pushing to end the Selection before the prince makes his choice. As the threat's get more violent the king press's his son to eliminate more girls moving closer to ending the selection before the rebels can end it themselves. As the Selection progresses she will best tested in more ways than she can imagine as all the girls are each tested some in harsher ways than others.<br /><br />I really love America's character she is very strong, stubborn, defiant, acting rashly. Yet she follows her head and heart even when it's not always the best choice speaking out for what she feels is right. I have enjoyed reading about her adventure in the selection watching how she grows from just wanting to be there for her family to really wanting to be the one. I'm kind of torn on the whole Maxon and Aspen thing, at first I hated Aspen for the way he treated America and now I'm not so sure. As for Maxon we kind of have a love hate relationship, every time I think he's perfect he end up doing something to make me hate him. I tend to avoid love triangles but this seems to be the exception.<br /><br />The Elite is a fun continuation of America's journey through the selection process. Like the first the elite is very much Revolution meets The Bachelor which I kind of love. I can't stop talking about this series I even tried to push the books onto people I've just met. I love the concept it brings a unique twist into the whole dystopian genre which I also love. The characters are fantastic you can't help loving them even the ones who are oh so bad you just love to hate. I'm torn over America's choice but that's to be expected I just hope The One ends the way I want it to when I figure that out. The Elite is a fast paced story just like the first I finished it in an afternoon so captivating I was unable to put it down. I'm dying for the next book can't wait to see how it's all going to end.cters are fantastic you can't help loving them even the ones who are oh so bad you just love to hate.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|Music these days suck. Everything is now auto tuned or dub stepped but this is what talent is about. Maybe it could be that I'm getting older (late 20's) or wished I could find other musicians that want to create music like this here in NYC. If you like the more blues style that you get from Queens of the Stone Age from Songs for the deaf & lullabies to paralyze CDs you will love this cd because its more blue. It is worth every penny. I find myself listening to this cd alone out of all their other work the most. My favorite songs are \\"too afraid to love you\\", \\"I'm not the one\\",\\"sinister kid\\", & \\"go getter\\". My favorite lyrics is \\"I am the bluest of blues everyday another way to loose\\" from the song go getter.. The cd does come with a poster with lyrics & the cd does play tricks on you. It's black but when later played turns white while displaying the album name. This is in my collection with BB Kings \\"Thrill is gone\\" & James Browns \\"This is a mans world\\".
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|I remember getting the first Deep Purple album because I liked their take on \\"Hush.\\" Got their second as a Christmas gift. Their third had \\"Chasing Shadows.\\" The percussion in it is simply amazing. I was bummed when I saw \\"In Rock\\" at the store because Rod Evans surely wasn't etched in stone. Of course, after a single listen I changed my mind since it was simply a masterpiece. So now I have the complete DP library (minus bootlegs and such) and some I just got to support the band in my own simple way. I got this, not expecting much, and I was wrong again. These guys can still bring it. I'm actually surprised that I keep going back to it, even after this short time post release because it's so good. Somebody made a comment about Morse being a better guitarist than Blackmore. When you get to that level of expertise, I think it's more a matter of stylistic enjoyment than 6-string competence. I say Bruce Dickinson is 10 times the pilot that Morse is. Who cares? I'd love to ride with either of them. I've got all the Dregs recordings too and I'm surprised Morse works so well with DP considering his roots. I remember going to see DP back around 1999. They were doing \\"Speed King.\\" When it came to the guitar solo, Morse just stood there with a big grin on his face and played it perfectly as if to say, \\"What's the big deal? Anyone can do this.\\" He does kind of lack the rock god guitar superhero antics. That shows up in his playing which is soulful, sometimes playful, but always tasteful. All of that is on display on what I consider their best Morse-era recording. So there's no need to get this out of a sense of responsibility, get it because it's a great recording.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I just finished this book, but I've been doing the Daily Practice since I read it on the blog. It works. Beyond that, this book is poignant, compelling, and funny. Well worth it.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Loved it.  The miniseries did a great job but the book allowed it be more focus on the view point.  I would recommend this to all who enjoyed the mini series
B0063IH60K|5.0|LOVE THE GAMES, like other reviewers do not like ads but understand why needed to enable us free games. Really like to have  all the choices of deals/games.
1400023343|2.0|There is some good advice, and very helpful case studies in this book.  Unfortunately, the author spends too much time summarizing academic studies on the cognitive development of children, how children learn language, and brain function.  This information is important, but the title is misleading when it reads, \\"A step-by-step guid for parents.\\"  In my opinion, this was far from a step by step and more of a conglomeration of academic research inserted into chapter titles.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|another fun game to play. hours of fun bongo playing. one of the few that I play that do not freeze up.
0345803493|5.0|For those of you who are so critical and have way to much time on your hands to go through the book to find repeated words, go write your own story.  I am amazed as to how many are rudely commenting that they don't like this book. It seems like everybody has a problem with something these days.  It's a friggin romance novel which is written solely for pleasure. You're not going to find it educational. I admit that there are some words that stand out which I never heard before. However the overall story, I enjoy.  You don't have to be into dominant/submissive type crap to like this book. I will admit it is like readable porn, but there is nothing wrong with that. Bottom line, if you don't like it, kick rocks and go read something else. Stop bashing the author because she is making a ton of money while you are sitting at home in front of your tv dinner.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Nothing but lame jokes and pop culture references not to mention seth mcfarline is a cheap skate so if u rent it u can't watch the unrated it drags on very bad hitting for laughs that are for people with low intelligence or just simple laugh at almost anything trash

B00BWJARHO|3.0|A great movie trilogy continues but no longer an epic just a everyday kids movie nothing special if u got kids rent it if not don't bother with it
B00CEMH31Q|3.0|Honestly, I didn't think that Hanson would/could ever disappoint, but... Anthem is a bit of a let down. I've NEVER felt that their songs were just \\"alright\\", but Anthem seems pretty mediocre to me.<br /><br />This album isn't \\"bad\\" by any means, but IMO if a song takes more than a couple listens to start to get into, you're missing something. Most songs on Anthem miss that initial hook to get you interested and keep listening. The songs seem diluted or monotone or... something. I can't really put my finger on it. It just feels like there's something off about Anthem...
B008K7RGA2|5.0|WE have seen Tosca in many Opera houses throughout the world, This performance is by far the best although the only complaint i had was again in the staging of the first act. The pagentry of the Te`Deum was diminished completely. When the Archbishop, holding the Blessed Sacramant passes by Scarpia, he is forced for freconsider wher he is. In this staging he only hears the procession  and kneels just because it was the thing to do even though he was nowhere near the Archbishop or the Blessed Sacramant.
B00113N6KQ|5.0|If your looking for an action movie that seems almost plot-less but is full of non stop unrealistically violence gunfights then this is PERFECT!

0307948110|1.0|This was the first novel I have read by Robert Harris, so I had no idea what to expect. I was extremely disappointed. As some other readers have noted, it was a slow read with a predictable cliche ending. I too, found the Leclerc character much more interesting than the protagonist. Won't be picking up any more of his fiction if his other books are this bad.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is simply amazing!  I am having my family read it together this summer!  A perfect reminder about how kindness makes a difference-we can change the world!!!!!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This product saved my neck, shoulders and back.<br />If you use your laptop a lot while at home/work, make sure to get one of these. The elevation changes the angle of your head, causing you to look straight forward instead of down and low.<br /><br />Also, the computer doesn't slip off of it, it's stable and the stand can be taken apart into three, easy to carry parts.<br /><br />Get it. Your back's worth it.

B00BHO70L0|2.0|If you enjoyed 1.0 and 2.0's fresh retelling of the Eva series with better characters and a somewhat more fleshed-out storyline, you should brace yourself for disappointment.<br /><br />It feels like this movie was rushed, and while the animation was spectacular in some scenes, the plot breaks apart into completely unexplained scene after scene, with cryptic dialog and mysterious new terminology appearing mid-sentence, likely to never be touched on again.<br /><br />A lot of things happened and I'm not sure of what most of it was supposed to mean.  It feels like they let Anno get his hands too firmly on the reins again for this one.<br /><br />The most frustrating part of this movie is that with a one minute exposition scene here and there, they could remove all confusion for the viewers and Shinji.  Instead...you get the movie here.  Its an OVA! These exist to make the fans happy revisiting familiar characters, themes and situations, and to clear up murky plot points for a feel-good experience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they chose to delve back into the indecipherable garbage and pseudo-significance that muddled up the end of the first series.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Loved this when it was new - Bought the book! The person I lent it to liked it too much to return it. Taped the audio on cassette tapes off the air before videotape.<br />Finally DVD's, Hooray!<br />I know the BBC has made other series since, but sorry, they pale by comparison.<br />For Americans, 13 episodes is typical for BBC (remember The Prisoner? Cosmos?) &#34;seasons&#34;

It has awesome graphics, an incredible storyline, and a shocking ending, get this app and I almost guarantee that it will become you're favorite.
1400052181|4.0|This book was recommended by my book club and I am glad I read it. It brought up quite a few topics for discussion of which the idea that doctors can use your blood, parts, plasma, etc as they wish, that your body is no longer yours once it is in medical hands, was the most disturbing. I had never thought upon the matter but I have had blood taken many times, I have even volunteered for a few research studies at a local university....now I wonder how much of myself is out there and perhaps being used for science. Why is it illegal for me to sell my kidney or other body parts but it is not illegal for science to use me without my knowledge? This book did bring up the issue of race, however, humans have been used by science many times without race being the issue. How many soldiers and US citizens were exposed to radiation when the atomic bombs were being tested for example? HOw do we feel about that? SHould one person be guinea pig for the good of many? Anyway, this book was such a revelation and opened up a lot of subjects to discuss and so for that I am thankful.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|A good read. Easier to put down for awhile than most of her books. But an interesting story line,enjoyable. I will recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really like seeking for items to complete levels. You find time flying by very quickly. Can't wait for new levels
B008M721MS|4.0|omg it works very good i think ppl should try you can video friends  and who wouldnt want that i will
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was worth the wait! Love the story line and look forward to seeing how things turn out for them.<br />GREAT LOVE STORY!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have always enjoyed the Dungeon Hunter series, but there has always been a huge detail that has been missing. Story. This is how I rate all my games, how good there story is. And when I saw that beginning cinematic, I was blown away. That and I also enjoy class variety and individuality in games and that is what DH 4 delivered. I continuously wish that you keep the legend of Dungeon Hunter alive. Farewell, my young lore masters.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Stripped out a lot of functionality available on web-version and added a bunch of useless graphic clutter. Make the basics easier -- searching for someone in a particular role at a company, viewing messages in Inbox, viewing a company profile.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|App closes shortly after opening.  Never gets to main screen.  Until this bug is fixed the app is totally useless.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|lots of fun til I got to level 6 and now keep going to open cabinet with no arrow to back out of it so I gave to to back to the menu and start the level over.  quickly becoming not fun....
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is a great game for the adults AND the kids in the house. its so much fun to play and sometimes the kids will even have fun watching! must have!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Ok i'll admit the first listen I was skeptical, but on subsequent playthroughs DM's vision shined through and it's now in my top 3 DM albums of all time.  Masterful!
1582701709|5.0|Very Good Book, Really Great read, Very Positive. A really good directional book for business minds people and motivational.<br />Get it and read it.
B00C2C637I|1.0|I have to admit my serious disappointment in Mr. Bradburys writing. I have long heard of his great talent and stories but I could hardly make my way through the first chunks of this books because of all the swearing. I think that it is an ill conceived book and project when the author has to cover up his or her talent with so much language. Far better authors out there to conect with!
1451626088|4.0|Ms. Gregory has a way of taking what could be boring history lessons and bringing it alive and interesting.  I like that she covers  history from a woman's perspective, which is never covered well in standard history.  Looking forward to the next book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|My wife read the book in a few days. Could not put it down. A little different than the movie but still worth reading.
159463176X|5.0|His writing is beautiful and the images are so real you feel you are there experiencing it with the characters.  Can't wait for the next book!
B00BB67UNW|5.0|This dvd was very good there is a lot of action and some good arguments. I would recommend this movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is probably the most addicting game. Whenever i have free time i would play it, i think everyone should try it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|There are so many that are upset that this was supposed to be the end, and Sylvia has decided to stretch out Eva & Gideon's story, and I am happy to hear that it's NOT the end! I can't wait to see what will happen next as I think Sylvia Day is a wonderful writer, and she shares their story beautifully! So many people compare the Crossfire series to Fifty Shades of Grey, but I think this is nothing like it. A wonderful read, and I can't wait to see what will happen next with Eva & Gideon! I'm hoping babies!!!! :)
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book.  Great love story with ups and downs.  Pigeon and Travis were soul mates from the beginning.  Bravo
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy playing Can You Escape because there is many different ways that you use to open the doors.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app is easy to use and &quot;remembers&quot; multiple alarms as well as allows more than one to be running at once.<br />My only complaint is that the numbers are a little small for people like me with reading eyesight issues and while the colors are pretty, the lesser contrast makes it even harder for me to read.<br />Thanks.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is the coolest strategy game I have ever played. It is so addictive and I love it. I strongly suggest that you get this amazing free game.
B000JLSM00|5.0|Considered by many film critics as the greatest Western of all-time.  I heartily agree that it is in my top five.  John Wayne's role has been singled out by many as his finest.  A Western that can be enjoyed by all.
0811821846|5.0|Lots of tasty recipes that are simple to make. Really neat photos of the food as props with Star Wars figurines. My husband bought it for me for Christmas. I have used most of the recipes so far. Great for kids and beginner cooks. Definitely recommend.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone.  The show does a very good following the books so if you love the show you will enjoy this read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like Temple Run 2. Imangi Studios decided to play it safe and not change any of the gameplay, instead, they re-skinned all the obstacles, added some new ones. The minecart part might seem challenging at first, but once you learn the pattern, it's cake walk. That's the main problem with the game: once you figured out how to get through all the obstacles, everything gets too easy. Besides the extra obstacles, there's the gems, the save me feature, and they messed up the powerups and character related things. Temple Run 2 brings nothing new, but everything's still as fun as the original. I give Temple Run 2 a 3.8/5.0
0887081770|1.0|i guess i blame myself---  this is a small size book  not what i thought i was buying  very sad  also  i didnt know it was being mailed from England
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Quick download and install on my kindle fire. Controls work smoothly and game is easy to understand. Takes a little time to figure it out and once you have the solution you want to kick yourself for not solving the puzzle quicker. Overall a very different and good game.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|\\"All the Little Lights\\" is an album full of fine melodic songs, in most cases with strong roots in British folk music and Music Hall. The songs also shine with have unusually well-written lyrics that contain both humor, bite and a high degree of self-irony; several of them also with melancholy undertones.<br /><br />Best known, of course, is \\"Let Her Go\\"; great to know that good songs still find their way into the charts. \\"Let Her Go\\" has the qualities to become a true classic. Another of my big favorites is \\"Wrong Direction\\". Strong lyrics and catchy melody. Indeed, most songs could be highlighted, with only a few being slightly anonymous. The final song \\"I Hate\\" is from a live performance. Perfect end number - funny and with plenty of bite.<br /><br />Exiting whether Passenger will be able to follow up on this fine album, as it may well a genre where musical development potential is not very obvious. But can he continue to write as good songs as on this album, I'm with.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great start to a good game, only ten levels with the promise of more to come.  Could become addictive if it was only longer just got the hang of it and it was over, look forward to playing it again but once you figure out the levels you have no reason to replay it
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I got into this show after my step dad told me about it. Now I'm hooked. Now waiting for season 2 to come out so I can watch that on DVD
0425263991|5.0|This remains my favorite PNR series and it never fails to impress me with each new volume. This latest installment tells the story of two Psy, both incredibly powerful, and each marked by a dark past. I loved watching their relationship build even as their world was threatened time and time again with destruction. Big changes happen here and what the future will bring for the world remains uncertain, but the love of the two Psy at the center of this story is unbreakable. One of my favorites in the series, or perhaps my new favorite, I can't decide. Highly recommended.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I've been a fan of this show from the start. I've got every season so far that 's on DVD. Never a let down. It keeps you on your toes through every episode. A must watch!
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|Always been a fan of minions.  I bought this just for the heck of it.  Very detailed has the feel of a good quality dog toy.  I might just have to collect them all!
B000VI70X6|5.0|Greater than ever! I hope to see her performing live some day! I have almost every single DVD of Shakira.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Works out great for me... I have the gopro 3 silver edition, then bought the black edition, but hated I couldn't see what I was videoing or taking pictures of. So after putting this touch bacpac on... solved the problem. I think having the ability to go thru menu functions, and quickly changing on such a small screen... this isn't bad at all, yes the screen has some delay when touching functions close to corners or end of screen, this still operates pretty smoothly. I know what its like using dslr camera screens & other touch screen video cameras.... this is the smallest I have used... so for gopro to come up with this small screen, I think it's beautiful. Now the battery situation is another story... hope they can improve on that. I would highly recommend this lcd touch bacpac. To me  I think one needs this and its worth having if you are going to use the hero 3 editions.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is my new favorite show. I love the suspense that you do not know what is going to happen next.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I think this was an excellent read.  It was even better the 2nd time through it.  Once you kind of dig in and see some of the sociopolitical thoughts that Mr. Brooks is sharing.  I really believe that there is a real world take home message in this book.  It is hidden under a whole lot of Zombie action and mayhem.  I have seen the previews of the movie with the same name and I must say I WILL NOT BE GOING TO THE MOVIE.  I will, admittedly, probably watch it on Netflix when it comes to that venue.<br /><br />The way the author wraps the entire 12 year \\"war\\" up into an interview style is excellent and should have been brought to the movie.  There was no \\"single\\" hero in the book.  It was a story of mankind coming together and triumphing over the \\"plague.\\"  It did show how stupid people will always be stupid (you can't fix stupid.)  It also showed how government and politics gets in the way of common sense so often.<br /><br />Hollywood is so full of itself that they can't appreciate the story behind the story.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks wrote a good book and I encourage everyone to read it.  Keep in mind that it is a thinking book, so you will need to think and process the information as it is delivered.  I will say that if your IQ is borderline, you may not like this book.<br /><br />Have a nice day and thank you Mr. Brooks for a nice book.  You should have kept the rights to the movie until you had an offer that allowed you to \\"run the show\\" in Hollywood.  Having said that, I'm sure the offer was financially sweet enough that you really didn't care about the movie!!!!<br /><br />-ThunderDoc
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Chose this rating because of how the author allows you to become emotionally attached to Harold and his journey.<br />This book really makes you think about how we react to life's tragedies.<br />This story is full of surprises.
B008COII1Y|5.0|For the mainstream zombie film lover this one may not make the cut... but for those of us zombie movie who enjoy something other than the usual young folks trapped in a mall, stuck in the woods, etc., this film has some really neat points to it.  The fact that it takes place around the Civil War era makes it that much more entertaining.<br /><br />Not a great film that would succeed in a box office settingby any stretch of the imagination, no, but I suggest anyone who enjoys viewing new and interesting takes on what a zombie crisis would look like take the time to watch this film.
B008D30K7E|5.0|Could not put this book down. Brilliant from start to finish. I havn't read a book like this in a long time.
B000062YAY|5.0|I suppose having liked Slayer's early music makes this concert from, I think, 1991 such a great find for me.  They play a ton of the classics that I have enjoyed for a number of years and the recording quality -- unlike many live albums I've listened to -- did not suffer because of the live venue.  I can hear the highs, lows and vocals very clearly and without a ton of distortion that sometimes clouds live concert recordings.<br /><br />Add this one to your Slayer collection... or start one with this 2-disc set!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really gets you thinking. best game I have downloaded yet! Only had to use cheats once for level seven, but all other levels were a piece of cake!
B00785P2QC|3.0|it's okay for a mobile simulated city.  It could use a few more buildings.  And a crime system would be nice too.
B0097AX6EQ|5.0|Robert Mason had me captured from page one. Raw, honesty mixed with battle dumb humor, insight into times no one should forget. A great pilot, a great read, a tragic story.
B000000ORE|4.0|I bought this to replace my old tesla disc that got stolen out of my truck. I hate people who steal.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I purchased this thinking it was a novel, not a teaser with no resolution. I feel a bit betrayed by both the story and by Amazon.
B000000OQ5|4.0|Tesla is one of those band where every member is a star. I think they are way underrated rock band.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|[NOTE: First, let me thank everyone who has warned others about the permissions in this app! :)  I love you gals and guys, and am so glad to see the diligence and caution!!  Keep it up!!!]<br /><br />You may or may not be aware of my reviews of many of Amazon's Free Apps of the Day.  If you are not aware, I try to protect users from bad apps as well as praise the good apps.  I use my experience as an IT professional to help guide my reviews.  Over the last couple of years, a good number of folks have used my reviews for guidance.<br /><br />Which is why this review is likely to anger and confuse some of you gals and guys. Surprisingly, I approve of Lightning Bug.  Undoubtedly, this will alienate and/or anger some of you who have supported my reviews in the past, which is why this review is so hard to write.  But please, bear with me; I *promise* I haven't gone to the Dark Side (if nothing else, drop to the last line to see why).<br /><br />Can this app be used maliciously?  Yes, it can.  Can it be compromised and used for its permissions?  Yes, it can.  So yes, this app can certainly be a security risk.  On its own, though, this particular app is not malicious.<br /><br />Nearly every application that I have warned about used permissions that were not necessary, or even dangerous.  Almost all of those were games or similar applications that had no business incorporating the permissions they were using.  The difference between a bad app and a good app is this: The primary reason to require a permission is for a valid purpose.  In this case, those are some invasive and scary permissions.<br /><br />Unlike games and such, Lightning Bug, along with similar apps, need some of the permissions to work properly. Lightning Bug needs additional permissions for extra functionality but doesn't require them.  For example, if you want any add-ons, then the app needs to download those from the internet; if they were included, the app size would be huge which would cause download and installation problems for folks.  It also allows for updating and adding new add-ons in the future.<br /><br />Lightning Bug, unlike a game, is a utility application.  For it to function properly it needs to be able to control the lock screen, quiet down during a phone call (do you really want thunderbolts during a phone conversation?  Wait... yeah, I can see when that would be a nice feature.  But I digress...), and set the alarms when the phone or tablet starts up.  Also, since it incorporates weather into it, it needs your location; for travelers, such as truck drivers or vacationers, this can be a very useful tool.<br /><br />By the way, I am glad the developer took so much time to clearly explain the permissions.  In doing so, the developer offered two things:<br />  1) Transparency.  He or she was upfront about the permissions.<br />  2) Liability.  If the app were to be found to use the permissions for something other than what was outlined, the developer's information could be used to have the app removed or even used to sue the developer.  Of course, the developer knows this and offered the information despite the liability.<br /><br />Lastly, a note about IAP: the original version of this app had In-App Purchasing for the add-ons, which were ridiculously expensive.  The developer REMOVED In-App Purchasing and is including ALL the add-ons and content.<br /><br />For sticking his or her neck out on explaining the permissions and including all content without IAP, I'm rewarding this with 5 stars.  The app itself, by the way, is at least 4 stars to me after the \\"gap\\" fix was made.<br /><br />Between the transparency and the removal of IAP, and inclusion of all content, this developer has shown a keen sensitivity that we aspire all developers to have.  I, for one, am grateful the messages regarding IAP and permissions is getting out, and in this case, so prominently taken to heart.nd installation problems for folks.

0307950654|5.0|I love Austen but have not been at all enthused about the novelistic extensions that have come out recently. This one I think was done very thoughtfully and faithfully.  Wickham was, of course, the perfect suspect that wasn't.  The characters are both familiar and yet have developed further in the context of this story, some in expected ways, while others have undergone a bit of a twist. I hope P. D. James does another one!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is one of the most addicting, fun games I have played. Once you start playing you don't want to stop so don't start it during your work time break.
1444710338|5.0|I'm one who has tried multiple plans and had given up on dropping weight when a friend told me about this program. So far the progress made in the first three weeks is better than any other program that I have tried. Highly recommend it!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The progressive increase in difficulty is nice, but is not impossible. Looking forward to having new levels added in the future.
B005K17RU0|3.0|with on for after at by in instead according to through out in then beyond into near between around about beyond into. I ran out of.prepositions.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|IT NEVER DOWNLOADED ON MY TABLET! I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT DIDN'T PLUS I HAD ANOTHER  GANE THAT DID NOT DOWNLOAD EITHER!
B008JJM88Q|3.0|My kids really enjoy it. I lost interest in it after the first few times. I think it came from another country outside the US because it had some obscure cartoon characters that I have never heard of before. I will keep it until my phone memory gets full.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|was a very good story line and the graphics were pretty good. would recommend this to older teens and adults.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|I loved this movie, although I wish the language was more appropriate for school age children.  It is a wonderful lesson on working together for a greater need.
B004Q3SGWG|3.0|THIS MOVIE WAS VERY INTERESTING...BUT IN THE BEGINNING IT HAD ME WANTING TO WATCH MORE....BUT THEN ALL THE MOVIE WAS FOCUSED ON WHEN HE WAS STUCK...LIKE I SAID IT WAS OKAY
B00B2DSK06|5.0|As a older gamer, this film was easy to love, brought back some of the memories of the arcades of the past.  Young and Old alike will enjoy this movie.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I AM SUCH A FAN....I HOPE THEY DO MAKE ANOTHER A SEQUEL OUT OF THIS MOVIE.....BUT IF NOT ILL JUST KEEP WATCHING THIS ONE.....JUST LIKE ALL THE TWILIGHTS
030758836X|5.0|It's been a while since I've found an author who makes me want to read all her books, and this one is so good.<br />Read every word, don't skip anything, and enjoy!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|GREAT GREAT GREAT MOVIE.....CAN'T WAIT TO OWN I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT....THE STORY IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS TO REAL PEOPLE AND THEY DO NOT HOLD BACK!
B008NA3I30|4.0|&#34;Away From Her&#34; was a brilliant film; this one is very good. Great performances-Polley is a talent to be watched.
075669812X|5.0|The book arrived in good condition and exactly as described. It is consistent with other DK books I have seen in the past. My son loves it!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I've been raving about this book to anyone and everyone who will listen. Men and women alike should read this. EVERYONE can gain something from this book though it is BEST geared toward working career women.
1594746036|1.0|The only thing original about this is the amalgamation of others' ideas: X-Men (Marvel comics, 1963), War of the Worlds (1895-97), Stargate (1994), and the Harry Potter series (1997-2007).<br /><br />But not put together well at all. Don't waste your money.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is better than some pet apps and it will give you something to do in your spare time.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I would not recommend this moving to anyone.  It was full of blood, gore and extreme violence.  The only thing I liked was the underlynig story of Django &#34;moving mountains&#34; to find his wife.  But the gore really was not necessary.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|More fun than I thought it would be for a two dimensional game. I feel like habeas broken neck. Keep driving
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Good backpack. Serves its purpose and for a cheap, reasonable price. I am satisfied. Very flexible with how to compartmentalize it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Ok so this is like an absolutely amazing upgrade of temple fun with different obstacles and like I said, it is easy better, I would recommend getting this game, you can get on Facebook with it and compete against friends, but but had a problem connecting to Facebook a few times!! Take the challenge to get a higher score than your friends![[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Always liked the Tom Cruise style.  Good plot, character, and action sequences.  Hope to see a sequel before his age just makes it funny.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is fabulous and I am touched and into the action of the book. I have read this book 6 times because of how great it was.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|John McClane from the outset was a third wheel throughout the movie. It was sad to see a once commanding character reduced to the embarrassing old man in the way.
B0091QS88K|5.0|it helps kids understand a little about coooking and helps them understand that it is a little hard to cook but really hard
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the part where rue showed katniss the tracker jacker hive. I also loved the part where she sang rue to sleep and covered her body with wildflowers.
0345529057|5.0|I recomend these books to anyone who reads.actoin adventure, magic, murder, It took me away and made me care about the people inside. I need the last book now I wish it was included in this set.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I don't normally rate apps but I love this game it is not borring like the other time based collection games it gives you something to do by letting you chase animals<br />so download this game
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next installment in this series. I've read these books about five times each now. Great book!
B004X4QW42|5.0|I liked the actors and story line. I beleive it puts you right there in that time in Chinese history.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|to my kids and we loved this program is very interesting, fun and entertaining for everyone who enjoys instrumental music
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I liked this movie because I have seen all of the lord of the rings. This movie is a definate  precursor and gives more depth to the other movies. I will like collect the whole series.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Crashes immediately after the first loading/splash screen. I can see some dialog popping up, bit it happens to fast to read.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My boys lived this movie. They play Lego video games so this brings it to life for the in a fun way.
B001RJQ700|5.0|this movie is a very good movie for anyone who has never seen one of the many spawn comics out there
B000E1JOSE|5.0|That was one hell of a performance. Wish I was there. To bad he is gone. They must have needed him up stairs.
B00D2HTRVQ|1.0|This app is terrible. I bought this for my son, and it crashes every single time (at the part where you fix and paint the chair. (Maybe 3-5 minutes into playing it, and you can't skip that part.) It's ridiculous that they are having people pay for such a terrible app that doesn't work. Surely other people have had problems with this too...  I wish I could have returned it, but I waited for half a day to see if the issue would be resolved (I reported the issue). Hopefully it will be fixed, but I wouldn't buy it until they say it has been fixed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books from this author. You will enjoy them too.  I just could not put them down. You will enjoy them too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great app for passing the time. Not terribly difficult for seasoned gamers  but will give the novice a run for his money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a Minecraft PC Pro and this is great to play it on mobile!! All the updates bring it closer to the PC version!!! Just great! :)
0061950726|4.0|For some reason I never learned about these trains in school.  I did read children's books on this subject to my kids.  This was a touching story and I really did sympathize with the main character.  Both of the subjects in this book have their own heartbreaking story.  I just wish it wasn't so rushed at the end.  I wanted to know more about how the main character survived her whole life.  There were a lot of unanswered questions.  It is a quick read.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|A wonderful addition to the Angry Birds family.  I can't seem to get enough.  Get it and enjoy the expansion of Angry Birds.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this app. The graphics are great and you don't have to buy anything after you purchase it (although you can buy objects to speed things up).
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|A fun game for the whole family.  My daughter can't get enough Angry Birds. A great way to pass the time.
B00BIR381W|5.0|My niece watches the show every Tuesday night and was very excited and thrilled to receive it as a gift.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|A great spin off from Angry Birds.  This is another game that I can't seem to put down. You should get it too.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn does a great job of keeping upgrading. Some of the characters you like but many you don't and that keeps it interesting.
0545265355|4.0|Great novels.  You don't realize that these books are about a self absorbed tween with daddy issues until at least the third book.  The end sucks...Collins spends so much time developing the story and just slams the door closed in the last 10 pages or so which felt forced.  Should have spent more time there.
0142421715|5.0|This is a really great book. I am really enjoying reading it and would reccomend it. Price was really good too
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The game is complicated enough to keep you thinking, but it is interesting enough to be keep you hooked. I recommend this game for th rose of you who like puzzles and seek and find games.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game. It really makes you think. I am looking forward to more rooms being added. i highly recommend this game.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|this is the most fun app I have played in a long time. it will guess anyone. it is worth the money. you could think of a movie that not many people have watched and pick a character that isn't a big part of the movie and he will guess who you are thinking of correctly. I highly recommend this app to anyone who is creative, board, or just if you enjoy tricking people.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I heard about pin interest one day while listening to the radio. I found the app and I've been addicted ever since.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I really like this game, its a good game and the best of the angry birds series. But there is one problem. My kindle is almost new when I got this game and I know its not my kindle. When I click on the cloud city level the game will exit on its own. I wish for this to be fixed as soon as possible.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|can do what you want with the game without paying. have had fun playing both campaign and interactive. I recommend.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love the classic. Great game this is one of my favorites and I spend hours going through the levels of this game
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I have nothing but positive feedback for this series. It is riveting to watch and I still can't believe one man (George RR Martin) was able to come up with such intricate stories for each of the characters. I purchased this when I didn't have HBO, but it's still great to rewatch, as I'm sure I've missed a few things here and there.
B00BDZV7WQ|1.0|I have bought every Lil Wayne album. Never had to even hear a single tune, prior to this bogus album.  My number one complaint is that his vocabulary needs to be widened.  I got so sick of hearing, pussy, pussy, pussy, ad infinitum.  I'm far from a prude, I have no problem with the word, per se.  However, it's like wayne's become a one trick pony: no breadth, no width, no depth to these rhymes. I't just so freaking boring.  I am so sorry I wasted my money on this piece of crap.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book because everyone in college had been reading it. Best decision I made! The book is so good; once you start reading it, you'll become a little addicted to it! Great book, it never disappoints!
B00AM0C6YG|4.0|I liked the entire album and I LOVED a few of the songs. Laura Mvula has a beautiful voice which she uses to it best on every song. Some of the songs seem like they drone on at times and lack a defined melody but that is pretty much the case for almost every album in the last 20 years or so.<br />I recommend putting the album in your CD player and just enjoy this marvelous singer's talent.
B0065NAKRO|4.0|I love to play dominoes.  I've played them for 40 something years, however, I don't always understand the scoring used on the All Fives game for this app.  It doesn't always give me my points!  Sometimes I don't understand why I won & sometimes I don't understand why I didn't!  It doesn't offer a how to play option that I have been able to find.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these kind of puzzle games. REALLY wish there were more levels. I blasted through the first 8 in less than a half hour. But it was fun!!
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit-- it especially resonated with me as a self-published author/entrepreneur.<br /><br />Nothing much new has been said in the self-help genre since Epictetus, two thousand years ago, laid down the the path to happiness: focus on what is within your control (your own thoughts and actions) and disregard everything outside of your control. But Altucher applies that ancient truth to todays circumstances, in provocative and inspiring ways.<br /><br />Among other things, he explains the benefits of a daily routine; why fitness/nutrition is key to all aspects of life; and why it's time to choose yourself--and self-publish or start your own business--rather than waiting around for some gatekeeper, producer, or executive to anoint you.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Three and a half stars. Nothing spectacular but we'll worth the buck. It's something to do when you are bored. Several different boards to choose from. Has an option to shuffle the tiles when you are out of moves, which I think is pretty cool.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Their best work yet! They just keep getting better & better. Love all of the songs. Love the diversity, slow & rockin. Worked with Sir Elton John & Trent Reznor. Awesome!
B0052REUW0|5.0|Ever since reading his book \\"The Language Instinct,\\" I have been a big fan of Steven Pinker. It is hard to escape the study of linguistics without a deep sense of innate and universal human nature. For Pinker it was thus a natural progression to move from linguistics to cognitive science in order to explore the broader questions of human nature. In \\"Angels,\\" he seeks to demonstrate beyond the shadow of any doubt that violence in human society has declined historically and continues to decline up to the present day despite however tempting it may be to believe the exact opposite when faced with a barrage of news about the latest terrorist attack or violent shooting. Pinker's thesis is that humans have always had it in their nature to be both violent and peaceful. The changes that have made the recent decline in violence possible are not changes to our genetic make-up but rather changes to our institutions that encourage the better angels of our nature to defeat our inner demons. Modern institutions are more enlightened. Thus the reason for the decline is reason itself.<br /><br />As Pinker pours over the historical record to find the institutions that really do work to reduce violence he comes across these three: 1. participation in organizations that are increasingly global (moving from tribal to state to international), 2. democracy, and 3. capitalism (especially global capitalism and trade). Pinker even sees market-pricing as an advanced system of morality. Let the economists of the world rejoice! He also applauds the role of Leviathan insofar as governments use their monopoly on the use of violence to enforce the rules of the game and ensure fairness. Institutions weren't enough, though; they also had to be paired with philosophies of enlightenment and reason. If you are a scientific-minded, global free-trading secular humanist, who is socially liberal and fiscally conservative (classical liberalism), who just may have a bust or two of Kant or Rousseau on his mantel, and who also doesn't mind giving certain powers to government as long as you have a voice in that government, you will love this book. In fact, this book will be your moral bible. Otherwise, be prepared to have your world-view patiently and methodically attacked by one of the most penetrating minds of our times. (Don't worry. He'll be polite about it.)<br /><br />If I were to offer a critique of the book, I would have to say that perhaps Pinker has created a narrative that is a little too perfect. Humans are inclined to create narratives that are more cohesive than the facts warrant (a fact that Pinker is well aware of as a cognitive psychologist himself). The probability that reality matches the analysis in the book as neatly as Pinker would like you to believe is slim. Even so, I will forgive him of this sin for the related reason that humans are also more likely to be convinced by cohesive arguments and his whole aim is to convince you of his viewpoint. Although he may not be absolutely 100% right all of the time, I am convinced he is right in principle. Moreover, even if you don't agree with Pinker's analysis of the causes of the decline in violence, you can't possibly read the book and be unconvinced of the fact of the decline. That, in and of itself, is reason enough to read the book.tel, and who also doesn't mind giving certain powers to government as long as you have a voice in that government, you will love this book.

0618918248|5.0|Good read. Simple and to the point.  Expected most of what I read, but satisfied. Highly recommend this book to anyone.  I have to had 5 more words, goddamnit.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This is a good book but it's a little slow & hard to follow at times. It pays off if you stick it..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found the game to be intriguing and challenging.  Once you start playing you cant stop. Great game that id recommend.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Just challenging enough. Wish there were more levels. Hope it doesn't take too long for more levels to come. Entertainment
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its ok but needs more levels! please add more levels it would make it so much better! please game please add more levels!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Amazing return Sabbath picks up right where they left off.  They recaptured the amazing sound that they created back in the day to give us an amazing album.  There is not one complaint to be had the vocals, riffs, drums, songs, lyrics are all pure classic Black Sabbath!
1455523550|3.0|With Nicholas Sparks you can count on two things, great writing and loads of drama! His books are an emotional roller-coaster that rarely end with a happy ever after! They are draining in a good way! very cathartic!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't get enough of Gideon and Eva! I enjoy escaping into their world for a short time. Can't wait for the next book.
0743572750|4.0|Awesome book! I love the whole world. Most of all I love that Clary is so independent. Most books about a teen girl have her life revolving around getting a boy. Yes, there is a romance but it is not the only thing she thinks about. All the supporting characters are great too! I love the interactions with the Lightwoods and Simon! It has such great moments of levity when chaos is surrounding them!<br /><br />Can't wait to start the next book. I have my guesses about where things are going.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It's a good book and kept me wanting to read more. I wish he would have wrote more letters. Also I want to know who he's writing to.
1416914285|4.0|I am very eager to see where this series goes. I love that it is set in NYC and I know every place they mention!<br /><br />I really like that Clary is so independent and not looking for a boy to complete her. Sure a bit of romance is there but her world doesn't revolve around it.<br /><br />I was a little annoyed that nobody guessed the truth until near the end. I felt it was pretty obvious from the moment you figure out who Clary's mother is who her father must be. Other than that it was an awesome read!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|kept me interested would like it to last longer though. would also like it to be a little bit harder not so obvious.

B006ZB3V2C|2.0|This app seems good. Its not too big a deal to download the extensions to get more sounds. Some of the sounds aren't all that great, I mean one of the rain sounds kinda like water in the shwer. Anyway all of this aside I would give this app a solid 4 stars but this app frequently just chrashes out on me . The only reason this has 2 is because of the selection available while if
0743579631|4.0|Everything is finally wrapped up in this third book. Unlike others I thought the pace was fine and had no real problems with the direction. It still had the sarcastic moments of levity that I love.<br /><br />Things are concluded enough that I don't feel like rushing to the next book. I may save the last three until the sixth book comes out in 2014. I hate waiting for a book on a cliffhanger and i am sure if I continue now that is what I will end up doing.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Every once in a while, a game comes along that is more than a game. It goes beyond the preconceived notions that we have about what a video game should look like, feel like and sound like. These gems are far more than just video games, they are experiences in and of themselves. While these treasures are rare to find, with this collection, you have two such games displayed in glorious HD for your Playstation 3 console on one convenient disc.<br /><br />Ico was my first stop on this disc, and what an experience it is. Ico puts you in the shoes of a little boy who has been cast out and sent to a dark, desolate castle to die simply because he has horns. After breaking free from his prison, Ico begins to wander the dark castle and discovers a majestic looking girl named Yorda locked inside of a cage. He frees her, and the story begins.<br /><br />Ico essentially functions as one large escort mission- something that would turn most gamers off. Make no mistake, however, this is one escort that you will remember for a lifetime. While guiding Yorda through the castle, you will encounter puzzles, platforming sequences and enemies. What makes Ico unique, however, is that the only enemies you will find throughout the main game are shadow creatures. These shadow creatures have been sent to drag Yorda into their shadow portals at all costs and it is your job to ensure that she does not get whisked away, lest you face a game over.<br /><br />There are many aspects of Ico that challenge the preconceived ideologies we think a video game should have. But perhaps the biggest one is that the only way to view a game over screen, is to have Yorda be taken away by shadow creatures, or falling from a cliff. This ensures that no matter what, you will always have an eye on Yorda- and that is exactly what the developers had in mind.<br /><br />The puzzles in Ico aren't terribly challenging, but they aren't cakewalks either. Prepare to spend some time pushing blocks around and swinging from ropes before you finally see the correct method of advancing. As you solve puzzles in a way that allows Ico to progress, you must also ensure that Yorda never strays too far behind and that she will be able to advance with you. Taking her by the hand, you lead her through the puzzles and dazzling locales.<br /><br />When shadow creatures attack, prepare for an adrenaline rush. They come from all angles, swooping in, swinging at Ico and making every attempt to drag Yorda off. It is these fight sequences that offer the most intense and well crafted parts of the game. If Yorda begins to get dragged off, your eyes immediately go to the shadow creature as you begin an all-out sprint to ensure she isn't dragged into a shadow pit.<br /><br />The environments and music of Ico are truly dazzling. The environments look fabulous on the PS3, displaying beautiful skies, desolate looking castle textures and rough looking waters well below the castle's confines. The music is gorgeous in its simplicity. Don't go into this game expecting a Danny Elfman arrangement. What music there is plays subtly and this allows for you to hear the interactions between Yorda and Ico as well as the occasional sound of a gull flying overhead or a wave crashing down below the castle.<br /><br />As you make your way through the game, you will feel more like you are experiencing a divine vision. No part of Ico feels forced upon the gamer, or like a chore. Give Ico a couple of hours. For some, it takes time to get used to because it is unlike anything you have ever played. Allow yourself to get a couple of hours in, even if you become frustrated. You will thank yourself that you did.<br />Ico ends beautifully and heroically and will leave you questioning just how far companionship manifests itself in your own life. The emotional attachment that the developers have you experiencing with Yorda is absolutely unparalleled and makes this truly a must play for anyone who considers themselves a gamer.<br /><br />Ico isn't quite perfect, however. Some minor things weigh it down, including a camera that can be downright frustrating. The camera is rather passive in terms of how much control you have over it, so often times you will be unable to see what lies ahead of you as you run down a castle path. Other times, the camera will be positioned in such a way that you can't see a particular jump. This caused me to fall to my death or lose Yorda more than a few times throughout the game. This hiccup is easily overlooked in the grand scheme of this piece of art, however.<br />Many will also criticize Ico for being too short, but I do believe this is how the developers imagined it. Ico will take most gamers around five hours on average. My play time ended up being about six and a half because of the time I spent appreciating the environments. For some players, you may finish in less than five hours, and this is fine. The length of this game should by no means deter you from experiencing it. Play it all the way through and don't worry about a total play time.<br /><br />In the grand scheme of things, art is made to be appreciated, regardless of how long it takes you to appreciate it, and draw meaning from it. Ico functions in a similar way. Whether you are advanced enough to blaze through in three hours, or so slow that it takes you eight, you will be touched by a rare gem of a game that delivers an experience very unlike any other you have had before.<br />For the incredible price that this game now goes for, Ico would easily be worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />However, with this amazing bundle, you get a second incredible experience on the same disc.<br /><br />Enter Shadow of the Colossus. A title that the Ico team began work on after the production of Ico but before its release.<br /><br />Initially code-named \\"Nico\\", Shadow of the Colossus tells the tale of a wandering warrior atop a faithful steed who is willing to do anything to bring the one he loves back fromthe dead.<br /><br />At the end of his rope, the wanderer seeks the help of the gods of a distant temple to revive his love. In order for the magic to work, he and his steed Agro must traverse the world and kill 16 colossi who are represented by statues inside of the temple. When the colossi fall, so too do their statue representations.<br />The wanderer begins a journey that is quite different from Ico in content, but just as emotionally and artistically powerful.<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus, like its predecessor, is unlike any other game you have ever played. The game features no enemies except for the 16 colossi you are hunting.<br /><br />As you ride around the open world on your steed, you will constantly be waiting to be attacked by a random enemy, but it never happens.<br /><br />In this sense, traveling to the various locations of the colossi is a lot like mentally preparing yourself for an experience. It gives you a chance to think while you continue your journey. When you finally do arrive, the colossi will absolutely take your breath away.<br /><br />The colossi are likely bigger and more mysterious than any other video game boss you have come in contact with previously. They do more than fill the screen, and you get the sense that they could crush you with one blow.<br /><br />The process of taking down a colossi involves finding a way to climb onto it and scaling its body until you find a weak point that glows blue. Stabbing this weak point with your sword will drain the health of the colossus, and eventually bring it down.<br /><br />While its fairly easy to figure out how to climb a colossi, by jumping on a certain part of it or waiting for it to move a certain way, others are a little more difficult and a few notable ones are downright frustrating.<br /><br />Making the colossi vulnerable can involve your bow, environmental elements and more.<br /><br />No matter how frustrated you get at some of the colossi, bear down and make yourself pull through. When you finally see the giant topple to the ground, you will want to keep going.<br /><br />Those who persevere to the end of the this roughly eight hour experience are treated to another beautiful ending.<br /><br />The real strength of SOC lies in the epic feeling of the colossi battle. The notion that one man is capable of bringing down a beast hundreds of feet tall for the sake of love is something every gamer should experience.<br /><br />Like Ico, SOC camera can be frustrating at times, too. Sometimes your camera will get stuck inside of a colossi body, or fail to shift fast enough before you get smashed, but like the previous game, it can easily be overlooked.<br />The music in SOC is atmospheric and beautiful and the visuals create dazzling landscapes and marvelously haunting looking colossi.<br /><br />When it is all said and done, these two games are must plays for gamers everywhere, and with this fantastic price tag and beautiful graphical overhaul, there has never been a better time to experience them together than now.<br /><br />Along with the games, the collection comes with two dynamic themes for your PS3 dashboard, as well as insider trailers and interviews with the developers, which are entertaining and worth a look if you really enjoyed the games.<br /><br />If you haven't experienced these games before, as was the case for me, don't think, just buy these right now and dive right in.<br /><br />If you have played them before and wish to experience them again, the price is right and graphics are gorgeous.<br /><br />Every once in a while we gamers need an escape from the Call of Duty clones and the Halo multiplayer.<br /><br />We need to do more than just race a luxury car or beat up a bad guy.<br /><br />Every once in a while we need something to remind us why we play games.<br /><br />Ico and Shadow of the Colossus remind us why we play, and why emotion is the most beautiful human trait.<br /><br />Gamers of all ages and backgrounds owe it to themselves to allow these two sheer pieces of art to tug at their heart strings and breathe youthful life into their hearts, minds and gaming console.

B00ABLJ5NQ|3.0|Neil's writing is a delight. There are sentences that hook into my mind and bring instant joy when they do.<br />At the same time, this book feels incomplete. It's too much coralline, and the price - not enough stardust or never where. It flirts with myth, but leaves our myths behind and strikes out in another direction , of trying to create its own myth - but doesn't quite make it. The world this book takes place in has no coherence or actual consistency, compared to his other works.<br /><br />Nonetheless, If you're a great admirer of Neil's work, you'll read it in one session and wish there was more, and you don't need reviews. If you haven't read anything of his before, you may find it an easy introduction. Either way, it something you should read.

1426308469|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my son's friend. He LOVED it. Apparently he quotes the trivia to his parents all the time. Now i must buy one for my son also.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I bought this skeptically to plug my Raspberry Pi into- which works, using the one amp output- but it turns out, it is SO useful for charging mobile devices. I am frequently away from home, at concerts, festivals, parties- I'm a busy guy. At these outings, my phone almost ALWAYS dies, I have a year old iPhone 4s and the battery is starting to crap out. Thanks to this guy, it doesn't anymore- it's easily fit into pockets on either a suit jacket or jeans, and charges my phone several times over. I'd have bought the 10,000mAH if I'd have known how excellent this was, but the combination of price and convenience in this model is stunning.<br /><br />A must-buy.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Loved all the actors and it is beautifully shot with nice scenery. This story is very interesting and also Kristin Thomas character is fun to watch. This movie is for every one if you like romance, action, funny. Its worth renting or buying it.
0300169787|5.0|I love Alexander McQueen and what he did for fashion.  He was so ahead of his time and this book is the perfect testament to that.  He will truly be missed.
B00000251N|2.0|I loved the book,didn't see the video, but thought perhaps the music would be endearing to the meaning of Bach's writing. However,I did not find it to my liking, disappointing, as often soundtracks seem to be.<br />The provider, Mars, was excellent in delivery, I just realized I don't really care for Neil Sedaka that much either?
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Simply plays for a sec and then closes on my Kindle fire HD. I gave it five tries before deciding to give up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game.  I just played 10 levels straight and  am looking forward to many more.  Go download.
0061726834|5.0|I found a copy of Delirium by Lauren Oliver at a rummage sale, and thought \\"Well this seems interesting; I'll give it a go.\\"<br /><br />Delirium is set in a world where love is a disease known as `amor deliria nervosa'. The powers that be have developed a cure, a handbook, and countless safeguards to ensure no one falls in love - and no one that falls in love survives. Through lies and manipulation, a dystopian society emerges where everyone has a `procedure' at age 18 to cure them from contracting the love disease. Enter the world of Lena - raised by her aunt, eager to emerge into a life without emotion. That is, until she meets Alex. Just maybe love is not the worst thing that can happen.<br /><br />Until I found out this was a trilogy, I was disappointed in the ending. I want to know what happens to all these people caught in a web of lies. I don't understand the negative reviews, as this is a gem of a beginning. The characters lack growth for a long time because their society demands it, which has nothing to do with the writing. Oliver crafts a wonderful world in a believable sense.<br /><br />My favorite part about this YA dystopian/romance novel is the actual romance that develops between Lena and Alex. There is no let's-jump-into-bed awkwardness, no possessive creepiness - there's simply a growing relationship building between two people who seek a brighter tomorrow. I want to wake up in a world where this is the reality instead of everyone wishing for a microwaved - instant and hot - affair.<br /><br />Overall, I will purchase the next two at full price just to find out what happens to Lena, Alex, and their families. That should say enough. Happy reading!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I like this fun glamoures make up game because it's like making a doll prettier than it already is<br />Amazing

076244911X|5.0|I converted to Minoguism somewhere around 2005-2006, The Ultimate Kylie / Showgirl era. The 'Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour' was in fact my first Kylie show I saw on DVD and completely fell in love with Kylie. I was blinded and drawn by the lights, the colours, the costumes (the blue Showgirl gown!!!)...<br /><br />And then, my first very Kylie album came to me from the Bardot-esque, rock glam coquette Body Language era. And in spite to the general reviews, in my opinion it's one of her best albums, both visually and musically. What struck me the most of both eras, was how coherent and strong the visuals and fashion were and from there, I started making my way through her back catalogue.<br /><br />This cannot simply be attained, without falling in love with Kylie's collaboration with the world's top renowned and unknown fashion designers and the book does a good job in documenting her growth in the bizz. From her soap opera princess days to becoming the amazing pop star and fashion goddess that she is, the book takes you along Kylie's evolution in music and in her personal development and seeing how she became more comfortable with herself and blossomed with her own style.<br /><br />Love every picture on it and here's to the next #K25!!! Whoop!!!
B0090SI42Y|4.0|Don't read too much into it and it is fun.  There are some uber cheesy quotes and scenes, and some awesome one (Russel Crow especially).  It is a sort of go to movie for me on days when i am feeling down (usually self induced hang over style) that I don't have to track the storyline or worry about character development, I can just veg out.  I will knock it one star for the way it sort of loses the satirical poise, and starts to take itself too seriously the last 1/3 or so.  BTW the Wu-Tang Clan soundtrack sounds good in digital 7.2 surround though the first few songs are the best suited for the film.
B00333NCTM|5.0|Trying to savor this one. Love it. I can hear Ozzy talking in my head....of course sometimes he is not understandable so it is good to be able to see the words too. :)
B00B2FDF54|5.0|I always thought Clint Eastwood was a &#34;B&#34; movie actor.  However, he seems to be getting much better in age.  The &#34;Trouble With The Curve&#34; was and is an outstanding movie with a good plot.  I found the movie both entertaining and kept me on the couch.  Its a sports movie so if you like sports, you'll like this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I first played on my friends kindle fire and I loved it! then I thought of getting it on mines and I'm not sure why I didn't think of it earlier, because I love horses!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Little buggie but good. Rewards at times are not worth it kindle version at times reaction is slow about to lower the score due the minimum limits on words
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|Well this is one of the best cds that deep purple have done with Morse.  It is enjoyable and the production is pristine.  there is good song writing and playing.  I like how it is heavy on the keyboards....I joke that there is more Jon Lord on this album than when he was alive!<br /><br />That said, it is rather tame as far as killer rifts, solos and true &#34;rock&#34; songs.  This cd does not rock.  it is nice to listen to, but no killer riffs.<br /><br />get it and enjoy it, just dont expect this to be as good as anything they did pre-1994.  Blackmore is truly missed.
B009EFP278|5.0|Saw him on the jay Leno show and ordered the CD that night from Amazon. I love his style. I would recommend listening to the short 30 sec. on the album as it my not be for everyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so good better than temple run 1 or 2 combined. Amazing game. Suberb. A very good time killer.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Saw this group on Jay Leno and watch the music awards just to see them. I think this won best album.  I especially Love &#34;We are Young&#34; - but I love almost every song on this album. i recommend it!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I believe this book is filled with many visual details and will make you want to keep coming back for more. I believe that this book is not only suitable for people who like Greek mythology but it is also suitable for all ages if I were you I would buy this book you won't regret it. This is especially for people who like to laugh and have a taste for action.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|l did not expect this game to be so entertaining but it is really engrossing.  l did need to take notes as the levels got harder and l wish there were more levels to play.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a really good game. It's better than most other games of it's type. For one the graphics are more realistic than cartoon. The progression can be a little slow but that's to be expected for games like this unless you want to spend money. And almost all dinos are available without having to spend any real money. Also having friends who play this game really helps make progression easier by reducing the cost of research.
1439196834|5.0|its really funny, a good read when u want to kill some time and i  would definitely recommend this book  to others.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|This is my husband's favorite movie so we decided the buy it.  This is a great movie with great actors.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is very competitive and will help you bond with everyone even your worst enemy!!!! Hehe anyways its a great game overall ENJOY
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! A good quick read that kept me entertained. Can't wait to start the next!
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|was too many stories and too difficult to follow, it wasn't what i had expected. very disappointed given that Tom Hanks was one of the main actors in this film.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I like this app it's mindless but fun you can change the settings to make it more challenging I would recommend it to families
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Why do I hate it ??? Well it asks me my e-mail the my user and then my password I don't know my password so I keep on trying it and I can't play the game I hate this game. NEVER GET THIS GAME ? U should get other game NOT this ONE ?
B006OCM0G0|2.0|On my Kindle, using android operating system. About every 3rd day the game goes through every goal from the beginning. Takes several minutes and is very annoying.
B001RNO78U|3.0|I purchased my first pair of these shoes in 2010 and loved wearing them. After 3 years of almost daily wear, the soles started wearing out so it was time to purchase a new pair. I ordered the same size I'd had before (11.5). After about 2 weeks of wear, the left shoe of the new pair started squeaking whenever I walked. It was still within the Amazon return window, so I sent them back in exchange for another new pair. At first I thought the problem was behind me, but the latest pair also started squeaking after a couple months of normal use (this time it's the right shoe). It's very noticeable and annoying and doesn't seem to matter what kind of surface I'm walking on (carpet, tile, wood, concrete, asphalt). This time the problem did not occur until I was past the Amazon return window, and Teva no longer seems to stock this size. (In fact they seem to have a dwindling inventory of this shoe in several sizes. Maybe they are phasing out this shoe entirely?) For that reason, if I were to send the shoes directly to Teva under warranty, they will most likely just give me store credit for some other kind of shoe. I guess that's better than nothing.<br /><br />Edit, Nov. 2013: It does seem that Teva has discontinued this particular shoe. However, the Kimtah line seems to be its successor. I'm currently wearing the Kimtah waterproof leather lace-up, which is virtually identical to the Riva except that the color is a little more of a grayish-brown than a reddish-brown, and the sole is apparently now a Teva-branded item rather than a third-party (Vibram) item. I'm happy.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|The meditation plug in for this app really does its job. I literally done out and feel nothing while being in meditation. This has helped me relax.  Even more than before. Thanks so much.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|....that the cinematic version would be as good as I hoped....and it was.<br /><br />I remember back in the early 1990's that Cameron Macintosh was working on a cinematic musical version - and it took THIS long to reach the silver screen.  Despite the critiques about how the film and its (highly subjective) shortcomings I gave it a big thumbs up. The vocal performances were spot on and generated the emotional response I remembered the first time I heard the music (all those years ago).
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|original good written story. enjoyed every reading minute. i felt like getting on my two feet and start walking just like the hero.
B00486070K|5.0|I have a MacBook Air, and even though the wireless works flawlessly, sometimes I need an ethernet connection for more speed, stronger connection or to connect between devices.  This little adapter works great!  You plug it in and it works really great - immediately recognizes the network, no issues.<br /><br />Highly recommend if you need access to ethernet without having a built in adapter.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I like being able to use this while on the go. Just wish it didn't have ads appear on top of the screen I want to watch. Could have bought the \\"pro\\" version to eliminate the ads, but our policy is not to negotiate with terrorists, or those who will do their job better if you support them. I kind of figured that if folks wanted me to use their aps, they should get it right the first time and either charge or not.
B009A9EPLM|4.0|The Aaron Copland influence on John Williams' music for Steven Spielberg's 2012 bio-pic film, \\"Lincoln,\\" of which people speak comes from Copland's classical, orchestral work, \\"Lincoln Portrait.\\" I have two recordings of the work on CD, as well as the 58-minute CD of the music for \\"Lincoln.\\" The resemblance in the movie music CD's opening tracks is unmistakeable to the point that one might even question if John Williams is merely adapting the Copland work to the Spielberg film. As Williams would know from his performances as a conductor and laureate of the Boston Pops Orchestra and Tanglewood Music Festival, Aaron Copland is one of the quintessential names of American orchestral composition. My first recording of \\"Lincoln Portrait\\" is in superior stereo sound, played by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Copland himself, and containing the famous Henry Fonda narration. I recommend this recording, which, in this instance, comes from the Copland three-disc CD set of Copland conducting his own compositions, as published by Sony in 1990 or '91, \\"The Copland Collection: Orchestral and Ballet Works, 1936-1948,\\" on the first three tracks of the third disc, \\"1 Lento,\\" \\"2 Subito Allegro,\\" and \\"3 'Fellow Citizens, We Cannot Escape History.'\\" This is one of the prime recordings, despite Henry Fonda's voice at times being harder to hear over the orchestra than the voice on my other recording. That other one is a live recording played by the United States Army Band containing an occasional audience cough. This recording comes from the ninth track of the one-disc 2007 multi-media CD, \\"Liberty for All, a Musical Journey, Volume Two: Westward Expansion-Industrial Revolution,\\" where the narrator's voice goes unnamed. Like the Copland composition, Williams often states famous American song standards by many American songwriters with his orchestral score to help accomplish an emotion of exaltation for Abraham Lincoln, the character.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|500 stars. definetly worth downloading. super addictive and easy controls. free and my favorite app on my kindle fire!!!! get it!!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Hfj,ggjcjxyhdixjxhxyg It was so cool gkjyfjxjxhdbdkdfhdjdh fjcjf hacker fifth fixed fifth fix chief did @ghost gift gifts fix fish guns faith cheerful guns @
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|it is a little slow at the beginning. it is also difficult to do great in the game without having to purchase things online. pretty addictive though
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|my wife really enjoys these kind of apps. we have two other relax apps including relax and sleep and the other sleep app that was released as a free app of the day a few weeks ago. This one by far, has the most realistic sound effects. Is highly customizable and is 1 user was saying before the paid version on Amazon is much better than the free version that is available for Google Play. I like how you can mix and match all types of sound effects. The other apps of this nature do not have that feature. And you're sort of stuck with whatever they force you to use.<br /><br />another wonderful feature about this app, is that you can select the duration and frequency of the sound effects. Giving it a much more realistic affect that sounds just like nature or whatever environment that you choose. In fact this is the first time I have seen that feature in a relax app.<br /><br />the only con, that I can find with this application is that there is no favorites option so pretty much you have to reset it every time you use it. I know that my wife will not like that part, because she is a creature of habit, and what she has a desired set of sound effects she likes to use them over and over. And without a favorites option, she will have to reset it every time. In fact that is the only reason why for the four star rating once that option gets fixed I will be glad to give this a perfect 5 star rating. Thank you and I hope that Amazon puts more free apps of the day like this. Highly impressed thank you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book and another you can read in one sitting.  Good and will keep this and the set in my collection.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I personally love this app. I have it installed on my kindle fire hd and it works great. This app shows you how much battery you have, how much time you have left of battery life, and it can show you this on your status bar at the top of the screen. Also, as you charge your kindle, this app will continue to show your battery percentage throughout the charging process. Really worth the price. I highly recommend this app!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This is the prequel to 'Blood and Sand' and it is a mini series. Too bad it wasn't filmed for a full length season, because this features GANICUS, who is the man. This is a great setup for 'Blood and Sand' and gives some good background.
0307744434|5.0|Morgenstern is now one of my favorite authors.  I wasn't sure I'd like this book since it skips between character points of view, but it is VERY well done.  There is plenty of mystery through the whole book.  It is truly an adventure through the limits of your imagination, and will have you spellbound after the first few chapters.  The romance at the heart of it is subtle, but very well written, almost to the point where I wish the story was reality!!
B00006D295|5.0|Still love this movie so many years later!  Watched it with my college aged daughter and she loved it, too.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Tried to open the app on my Galaxy and while the update dialog box flashed for a split second the screen then went dark and the process stopped. Pity - it sounded promising.
0061950726|5.0|I would like to see the information in the back of the book, moved to the front as a &#34;forward&#34;  this actually went on in our country during a certain period of time.  It was a &#34;for better or worse&#34; situation.  Story and writing excellent.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|The case was heavy and clumsy to move to the rotating positions. I returned this case for a lighter less complicated case by Marware.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I had the Free version but then decided to buy the premium edition and I am not disappointed; I love it!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Have wanted to get the whole set for some time. This takes up a lot less room that the conventional singles would.
1451626088|3.0|While the story line has great moments of entertainment and joy, overall it left me wanting and waiting. Some parts of the story are very slow and comber some but it is the end that left me hating a character and frustrated by the author. A decent book but not one I would recommend to my friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun for the whole zooniverse. I reccomend it. play it and you won't regret it. have fun.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series is so crazy addictive. I love it and I am super sad that I have to wait for the next book. Umm, Giedion is so yummy. Argh, Sylvia why must you do this to me. Okay so everyone should read this awesome series.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|First season was fantastic. I hear they have cancelled the show. That is said because it was very entertaining. Not much left that is musical and keeps my interest.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its always good to be able to escape a room if the situation calls for it. now try these out see if your up to the task.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|i gave this movie five stars because it was not disappointing. i had been wanting to see it every since the book came out. when i seen it for the first time it was better than the previous ones. i highly recommend this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best thing done with the Bible since Guttenberg! You Version became my &#34;carry with me everywhere&#34; Bible almost immediately. Love at first look.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|i gave this product two stars because it is not challenging, i recommend this game to children six-ten years of age.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie and the 3D. Nothing special here.<br /><br />I do want to comment on all the negative reviews and boycotts due to the lack of a standard Blu-Ray with the 3D disc.<br /><br />The 3D market is minuscule. In fact, statistically it's nonexistent. Nothing we do, as 3D enthusiasts is going to convince Disney to be more generous with their future 3D releases. On the contrary, they might just decide that, for the few dollars they make off of us, they really don't need to deal with this headache anymore. Disney may just choose not to release 3D Blu-Rays anymore. It's certainly not cost effective and if the 3D consumer doesn't appreciate the time and expense it takes to release such a limited quantity of product, why bother?<br /><br />People are crying and moaning about breaking precedent. Really? How old is the format, less than three years? Not really enough time for a precedent to be set. The 3D market is still feeling its way around.<br /><br />There is a dearth of 3D titles available. It's a niche market of a niche market. I don't think it's wise to be slinging mud at a major studio who is just looking at financially feasible ways to support the format.<br /><br />This is a precarious time for 3D. Instead of b*tching we should be buying.
B0063M22QO|3.0|three stars was given because it is the typical mahjong game. the tiles could have been bigger. i would recommend this game to everyone.
B00AW0KGYI|3.0|Everything that was reported as new is already online and can be viewed for free. It was a waste of money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this rating was choosen because of the size  and design of the product. i highly recommend this product to everyone
B00B69UQJY|4.0|I have been a fan for ages and have seen them several time in concert and I have to say I was a little under whelmed with this. Listened to it once and that was it.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|i gave nemo's reef one star because it was too primative, even for the typical school age child. therefore, i would not recommend this game to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is a great challenge but not difficult. makes you think of every possibility and you have to remember colors, codes and combinations. please hurry with many more levels.
B00881VLCE|1.0|i gave this game one star because it was not vivid, and it ran slow. i removed it from my device and would not recommend it to anyone.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I don't give it 5 stars because I was disappointed that there were only 10 tracks. There is also a track or two that I skip over. Other than that, I love it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is very rather quite difficult first to levels easy got to 3 and I was confused I got passed it I'm now on level 6
1449437524|5.0|Difficult issues discussed though the integrated relationship between men and dogs. With  the special art style and jocular manner of a master comic artist.
B00BFPX132|5.0|Long time Sodom fan (since I first Persecution Mania when it came out, yes I'm old school), Epitome Of Torture would have to be one of their best ever releases. I cannot get enough of this album.  The songwriting is some of their best since Agent Orange, production is terrific, drumming is great, riffs are crushing and Tom sounds better than ever. While most thrash/ speed metal bands from the same era are releasing mediocre to just plain bad albums, Sodom have released an absolute gem. Thrash releases these days do not get much better than this. Favorite songs are \\"Invocating The Demons\\" Into The Skies Of War\\", \\"Sigmatized\\", \\"Shoot Today, Kill Tomorrow\\" heck every song is damn good.<br /><br />If you are a thrash fan, get this album, turn it up and see if you can stay still, I dare you!
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|The Band Perry is one of my favorite--I've had this on my Wish List for a long time.  So glad to own it finally : )
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|If you're a bitter person, this movie is not for you!  I always loved The wizard of OZ as a kid, and now.  This was a cool prequel,and the performances were not bad.  It made me feel like a kid again, lol, and I watched it with my 5 year daughter, and she loved it as well, she LOVED the DOll!!  Like I said if you're bitter it's not for you, but if you don't mind showing your inner child sometimes, lol, this is right for you!  PS...THIS IS GREAT EYE CANDY!!
B009MYARIK|3.0|Love - Love - Love! Sophie Kinsella - Unfortunately, this one was mostly ridiculous.  Still love her writing and will always read her books.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Thought I would try based on reviews but I can't even get it to open. Force closes as soon as I start it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I can't believe there will be another book! I really did not care for this book... The sex scenes were a little too much for my taste... I wish the story would have kept going and Silvia Day would have not wasted so much time on the sex scenes.... Okay I get it he can last all night! Not going lie I will read the next book because I want to know what will happen... But I think she could have done it in this one! I hope the next book will give more insight on Gideon and continue with the great story I loved in the first two books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|we want more!!!!  my 5 yr old daughter and I really loved it.  cant wait for more rooms!!<br />perfect level of challenge.
B00439ONA2|1.0|i love this movie so I ordered it on amazon guess what the movie came and is in Spanish cant even play it
1451695195|2.0|This book was written for scientists, to convince them about NDE's, not for regular people like me. I was looking for something different.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This may be their first album in years, but it sounds just like the old Black Sabbath.  Ozzy has a really good voice still, despite his age, and Tony Iomni and Geezer Butler can still rock and play some awesome heavy riffs.  Some of the songs sound very similar, but it is a fantastic album, get the deluxe addition, a couple more dollars are worth the extra songs and bonus content.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Awesomeness addicted to this game. can't seem to stop playing. If u love I spy or where's waldo this is version 2013.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album is awesome.  Its hard to find a band who's first album is full of great music, but Is This It takes the cake.  This album is a great buy and introduction to the fantastic band The Strokes.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Such a cliff hanger I can't wait to read more it was so beautifully written I just simplify loved it it is definitely a must read book I absolutely just loved it!!!!
B004J4WQ46|5.0|Almost all the songs on this album are fantastic.  But then again, that's how it is with all of their albums.  I just particularly like this one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game  everything may be a tad expensive but it's awesome so i really think its fun for everypony from bronys to girls (what ever its called)
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I love almost every song on this album.  But then again, I feel the same about their other albums.  This is before they started experimenting with new sounds, so if you want an album of theirs that will sound like Is This It, I recommend this one, although the other ones are just as good.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is just another romance novel in a different setting; it is typical.  Even if I do not read the other two books, I will bet it is this scenario....girl mets guy, girl falls in love, guy has issues,  and they break up only to meet again, fall in love and get married.  \\"They cannot live without one another!\\"  Leslie
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|This album has got to be one of the best albums ever made.  Every song on it sounds amazing, but that's just Pink Floyd.  This album is a great buy whether you're a Pink Floyd fan or not.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|While not the most challenging of all the multi-room escapes this one presents some clever puzzles which will keep your attention for a bit.  Good, easy game play.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved wonder. It is a great book but made me want to cry at times. I love how sometimes you can relate to the person speaking or narrating.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|We all love these guys. There music is great and getting the DVD with the music videos is an added bonus.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game had good graphics, the story line was good. The things not so good are that the spoken word did not match the written word, some of the objects were really hard to find. And I had a hard time seeing them even zooming in to be sure I was getting the right things.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|We liked the story and the acting was great except for Kristen, who seems her normal reticent self. We like it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very difficult to put down this entertaining book... however it could have lasted longer. Very unique concept and easily readable by most age groups. Possibly to violent for some of the younger audience however.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever and it has a really excellent message. It is so nice to not only watch a great movie but to beable to enjoy it with my sons and know that its not filling their head with garbage but teaching them. I really love all of the movies that I have seen from this group their acting and their stories seem to get better every movie!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Battery Pro does everything that I was wanting from it, and it was easy and I have had no problems. That is a big plus.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|It's great to know that equality is still an important topic to women. I hope people will read this book for the history of feminism, for individual inspiration and to learn why we must continue to discuss it. I highlighted many paragraphs and look forward to sharing Sheryl's insights with the men and women in my life.
B0012GMVXU|5.0|Cohen is such a distinctive artist that there really is no one like him.  The music might be imitable, but the words . . .?  No way.  And he doesn't \\"develop.\\"  He just keeps writing interesting lyrics and finds a way of presenting them in what I think of as his characteristic style.  Sure, he can gussy them up a bit with some instruments and women's voices, but the songs stand or fall on the strength of the lyrics and the basic melody and Cohen's quite attractive voice.  Here, \\"We'll take Manhattan\\" is marvelous  -- inventive and funny.  The other strong ones are \\"I'm Your Man\\" itself, \\"Tower of Song,\\" and \\"Take this Waltz,\\" and \\"Everybody Knows.\\"  There's a lot of humor in the album, some of it dark, and even the less interesting songs are worth hearing.  Now, bring me my monkey and the plywood violin . . .
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is fast and easy to have for your kindle fire. This is  the best dictionary app you can have.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Complicated and at times a slow book, but enjoyable. Not my favourite James book ...Will be interested in others comments.<br />.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game had me thinking, I enjoyed it very much. I just wish there were more room to figure out.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I am very pleased with this CD.  Has many Makelmore favorites , cd is of decent quality, shipping was fast.  We listen to this cd often.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|insane stuff, can't believe they didn't have this when I was a kid. the graphics are crazy and you just can't put you tablet down when playing this thing lol
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I got this app after seeing it on my sister's Kindle Fire! I love Tom. He's cute and funny. What's not to like. Highly recommended for stressful days.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is great fun for young and old. I like the fact that you can create pretend creatures to have in your zoo.
B005K17RU0|2.0|The app is too complicated and hard to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game game you can change players and even board's it is so fun you should so get it.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|When I first got this game, it was a favorite and I played it often. I haven't been playing it lately because I became bored with the game.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The film quality was excellent. Sound was terrific and extras were so-so only but still worth every penny for it!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good game for free, create way to kill time and have fun. Although getting money is hard, you just need enough income buildings.
B00CATSONE|2.0|This is a poor marketing attempt. It's a book about how to be &#34;extraordinary.&#34; There is an interesting discussion about Tesla and his repeated failures and ability to keep being creative and imaginative, but other than that it is a boring self-help book. I would pass.
B00DE8N9QC|5.0|I loved the books and movies. This Hannibal Lecter is by far the most interesting interpretation, given the advantages of time, good writing and an amazing actor like Mads Mikkelsen.
075669812X|3.0|This book is beautifully illustrated and has excellent coverage of the characters and sets in the Ninjago series. He really liked getting the Green Ninja too. Reading the first couple of pages is fine and interesting like all of the other Lego encyclopedias. After a dozen pages though, things start getting terribly repetitive. As in you will read the same couple of sentences dozens of times throughout the book. Even a little creative editing of the sentence would have made it seem better, but instead it looks like the writing literally copied and pasted the text throughout the book. It got old at first, and then it was downright annoying after that. I stopped reading 1/3 of the page because it would all be the same stuff. Maybe they should have shortened the book. There isn't that much to write about apparently.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I was so excited about this game for my little girl. She loves ice age. She Wants to play the game when I get home every night.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|My kids enjoyed the movie and I thought it was cute too. The music was well done and the characters were interesting. The story wasn't all that great and the  morality of it was overdone and silly, but it's a kids movie. Who cares?
1451695195|5.0|Very well written - fascinating from end to end.<br />As an 88 year old woman, I found it to be very reassuring about what awaits me in the near future.
141659521X|4.0|I like how Vince Flynn could put his star character, Mitch Rapp, into any scenario, especially current situations like fighting terrorism in Afghanistan, and tell a great story. I have read all of Flynn's books and was never disappointed. Some are better than others but all are interesting and entertaining. Vince Flynn will be missed by all of his fans. He was called home by the Supreme Commandant much too early. He will be remembered!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very fun and educational family game. I can play by myself or with my son. I'm so addicted.
B00198X0VS|5.0|Admit it, not much of a plot but the special effects and quirky elements make this a hit. Vendor was on time as advertised would use again.
0061969664|5.0|If you like historical fiction this is the book for you. I can devour Bernard Cornwell book in about a day. His historical accuracy is close or spot on.  Very well written and I recommend the entire series.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Nothing quite like it on network TV.  For such a creepy theme and topics, can be very witty.  And the acting of all of the leads is fabulous.  Mads is amazing--he can change the mood of an entire scene with a well-chosed expression (is he curious?  sad? but always in control)....The writers work hard not to fall into the trap of 'killer of the week', and there is a lot of mystery still unresolved for the year ahead.  I'm delighted this has been renewed.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This is not a movie for those with a short attention span. It was SO Long...Wasn't a huge fan of Sally Field and although Daniel Day Lewis did amazing and deserved his Academy win the movie was too long and I just didn't enjoy it...Maybe I'm just better with a lighter movie. :)
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Had higher hopes for this movie considering the heavy weight stars that were in the movie. Can pass the afternoon if there is nothing else to do for the day otherwise spend your money on another movie.
0547258305|4.0|(Source: I own a copy of this book.)<br />Katsa lives in a world where some people develop a special talent called a `Grace'. These people are marked by having two different colour eyes, and Katsa herself has a very unique gift - the Grace of Killing. If Katsa intends to kill someone, she can do it without weapons, even barehanded against many trained swordsmen.<br /><br />Katsa has also started a special council though, that works for the good of the people, and her latest endeavour has been to save a very important man who had been kidnapped by the King Murgon. It is during this attempt to save Prince Tealiff that Katsa meets Prince Po, grandson of Prince Tealiff.<br /><br />When Katsa and Po next meet, he tells her that he knows that she saved his grandfather, and together they set out to try and determine why Prince Tealiff was taken in the first place, and what is going on with his granddaughter Ashen, who is married to King Leck.<br />Why was Prince Tealiff kidnapped? What is going on with King Leck? And can Katsa and Po's friendship ever be anything more?<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. The story was well-written, and I even managed to keep up with the storyline.<br /><br />Katsa was a real kick-ass heroine. She totally owned her Grace, and used it to her own advantage. She also had a real sense of right and wrong though, and didn't allow orders to get in the way of what she felt was right. She was also so selfless and caring, and she made a great main character.<br />Po was a sweet character, and I liked how he opened himself up to Katsa entirely and shamelessly. I liked how their romance was slow and didn't take over the story, but I also wondered what the future held in store for them.<br /><br />I liked the storyline, and unlike a lot of fantasy stories I managed to keep up with the plot without getting confused, which was great. I liked how the story stayed with Katsa, and we didn't have to try and keep up with multiple different characters at once, and I liked how straightforward everything was. I really hate it when we get lots of politics and wars in fantasy books and this one managed to steer clear of those pitfalls beautifully.<br />I'm really interested to see where the story goes from here, and will definitely be reading `Fire'!<br />Overall; a great YA fantasy.<br />8 out of 10.
B000V39KDO|1.0|one of the poorest, most presumptuous films I have seen. Cheesy CGI, cheesy dialogue, sounded like a bunch of guys from Texas or something. People who think this trash is a good movie obviously have never seen real masterworks like Ben Hur. Nasty hollywood trash for people who love macdonalds hamburgers
B006GWO5NE|5.0|my original kindle charger stopped working not long after purchasing it from amazon. but this product works great! exactly like the info says.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a simple understandable game that adults and kid's can play. no blood and guts to be concerned about with this game.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Wanted to wait few years after initial release for child to watch the movie to appreciate the story & amazing characters. 10 year old seemed to enjoy it & follow the plot.
B003V5CTH8|5.0|This movie is just ridiculously good.  It's hilarious and clever and also heartwarming.  It's a clean, funny, family movie, and totally full of Christmas spirit.  Although it's a different kind, I'd say this is a new-classic Christmas movie (and I take my classic Christmas movies very seriously). =)
B00COQKDT6|2.0|Just as the title suggests, this album is a perfect 2 out of 5 seeing as only 2/5 of the album is good! Okay sounds kinda harsh right? Well it shouldn't. Let me elaborate:<br /><br />To start off with, almost every thing on this album is great (except \\"Game Over,\\" \\"Alone\\" and \\"Drifter\\"). The biggest issue is the mash up style that they are trying to use. Some of the transitions are not that bad at all like in \\"Born to Lead.\\" In all honesty if the metalcore styles had stayed with the metalcore and the rap stayed with the rap then the album would have been a jewel. In all honesty the pop style that is featured in \\"Bad Girls Club\\" should have stayed out of this album completely. The title track was not that bad and may even be the best song on the album.<br /><br />Now after listening to the entire album through and through, sitting through Ronnie's poor excuse for the Attila style 'scrapping' and through the catchy dubstep remix of \\"Rolling Stone,\\" it's best to describe that album as a fun b-side album and definitely shouldn't have been featured as a major album in the discography of Falling in Reverse. They got to try a plethora of different styles from the mainstream 4 chord song structure through the popular club style grinding beats and the heavy scream style shredding which is all enjoyable to hear in their own environments but should not have been mixed together in \\"Fashionably Late.\\"  2 stars out of 5.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Firefly and Serenity are awesome!  They are well-written, smart, funny and action-packed!  The story is interesting and the characters make it real and clever (thanks to incredible casting!)  Thank you Joss Whedon!  It's like an outer-space western, where the lovable underdogs may be on the wrong side of the law, but are on the side of right.  They need to make a living smuggling necessities around the worlds, but can't help but come to the aide of those in need along the way.  In Serenity, you see the over-reaching, too-powerful effects of the righteous law-of-the-land, known as The Alliance.  Our crew, on Serenity, discovers The Alliance's deepest, darkest secret, and fights to reveal the truth so that it can't pretend innocence or ignorance and eventually just attempt their plans again.  I'm not going into the characters of the crew, because then I'd have describe all of them, because they are all awesome and make up the world that is Serenity.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I really love these books they're so amazing but I think there should be an interview with juniper and maybe a god
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Awesome movie!  Lots of great action, interesting story, clever writing, each character keeps his strong super personality, while interacting or eventually even working together to form a bond of awesomeness.  Super-witty awesomeness!  I'm sorry my review isn't so clever, but what can I say?  It was fun and amazing; how do you make something cool even better?  Marvel says, you just take all the coolest individuals and bring them together to form something extraordinary...The Avengers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was fun. very challenging.  puzzles are great and really make you think so you have to solve the puzzles. much more fun than so other games I have.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|One of the best series I have ever watched. Keeps my attention and I am always waiting to see what happens next!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was challenging yet simple. I love that it wasn't overly complicated but it allowed some brain power in order to figure out sequence and strategy ...can't wait for more levels!!
B003L77GHE|5.0|One of the best series I have ever watched. Keeps my attention and I am always waiting to see what happens next!
B002Y7ZEMG|5.0|THE QUALITY IS AWESOME!!!!! I NEVER SAW IT LIKE THIS!! AND I HAVE NO MORE WORDS TO EXPLAIN HOW AMAZING THIS IS! LOL
B004PHSTY8|5.0|One of the best series I have ever watched. I am hooked!!!!Absolutely keeps me on the edge to wait and see =)
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this very inspiring book. I am also a novice hiker, who would like to take it to another level sometime.
B001AQQR2S|2.0|I just don't get how this got 4.5 stars.  I'm baffled.  I thought maybe it was me being too \\"dad,\\" but my kids 5, 8, and 9, laughed 2-3 times in the whole movie.  The concept is funny and I'm sure the book was good--remember loving James and the Giant Peach and Willy Wonka--but this movie is just loud and obnoxious with very little to laugh at.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has great mystery, and many turns which kept me interested all the way through.  I really enjoyed it.
B00004D0DT|1.0|im more upset that the company rarewaves is foreign everything was in english but when i went to go play the dvd nothing would read the disk so im not happy
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|It's not a good thing for kids and their families of a heart attack or unwilling to download the latest app.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its pretty ok game but some of the later levels are a bit too hard for kids. good otherwise<br />hints are not that costly but still cost money none the less
B009346RSS|5.0|I have been wanting to hook my computer into my Pioneer SX-750 receiver but didn't want something that required to be driver installation so it wouldn't matter what OS I am running (linux/ windows). Bought this, hooked into my pcs optical port, plugged into the aux port on my receiver and sounds clear as a bell. Love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Honestly this game was relatively easy. Each level had its own challenge but it was easy thinking to solve it.
0425263924|3.0|I wish Ms. Day would have finished at least one story line before opening 20 more. I did feel like this booked was following in Grey's foot steps and maybe that is why 2 more books have been added to the series. The step brother is dead she could have just ended that and moved on, it's not like there isn't enough drama to move it along. However, now somehow the Russian mob is involved someone else is covering up, the receptionist seems to be MIA, Cary maybe having a baby and there is some kinda drama with her mom's money. While 2 more books will be fun reads it will be hard to pick up the next book. When I finished I though well that was a waste. I would recommend waiting to buying this book until the next one comes out when ever that might be. At least then you won't feel hung out to dry with this non ending.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|A cute, clean Disney movie featuring Sofia as well as princesses and characters from other Disney films.  Little ones identify with it as it's also a television show.  Cute characters and good themes.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I remember kids playing the first Temple Run on the school bus last year. It was a blast. But this one is even better! Crisp graphics, smooth gameplay, more upgrades, better menus, and still stays faithful to the original! I also like how they don't scam you out of your money (im looking at you, Glu Games) and keep it ad free. The only problem is the new gems. Basicly what they allow you to do is buy a bunch of them, ressurect yourself every time you die, and dominate the leaderboard.<br />Meanwhile the rest of us are playing legitimately and not getting nearly as good scores. Please return the revival wings! -Thank you
B000IVW25M|5.0|Bought this to replace my much-loved VHS version.  Such a classic Disney movie.  It never grows old.  Young ones and those young-at-heart enjoy watching this movie.  Highly recommend!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Well I like the game it's just that I can't get into the game now and there isn't enough updates.
1616960922|5.0|This book isn't that long. I read the whole thing in a couple hours. Could not put the book down.<br /><br />summary below, minimal spoilers<br />The book is about a forger. Forgers use intricately carved stamps to change the nature/appearance of an object or a person. She is in jail (sentenced to die) for doing illegal things and is offered her freedom if she helps out the arbitrators (a counsel that has political authority). It turns out the emperor was attacked which left him brain dead and his wife dead. The forger is suppose to forge the emperor a new brain, exactly like his old one (personality, history, ideals, etc). While she works, the arbitrators use the 100 day mourning period to conceal the emperor's condition from political rivals. The forger is worried that once she finishes, they will kill her anyway. But she is torn because she becomes invested in her work.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I waited and waited and waited for something to happen and this book went no where.  Just a constant back and forth day in the life of a dysfunctional couple.
B001CDWFPC|2.0|This is not commentary on the ESV Study Bible - I was excited to purchase this title.  Unfortunatley it doesn't work on the Kindle Fire.  My Kindle is practically brand new and pretty much empty, so size of file wasn't an issue from a storage perspective.  Seems that all the links were bogging things down to where it locked up on just about every single page.  It took me 20 minutes just to get to Genesis 1:1 - the first link to a study note then locked up.  I returned this to get my $ back - it was way too slow and didn't make sense if you can't actually study from a study Bible.  I'll probably be getting the hardback version at some point - too bad for now...
B009VYF5E2|4.0|I loved the beginning of this series and continue to follow it because I am invested in the characters.  I bought this DVD set but didn't bother watching the series as it aired because I find absolute evil to be boring.  Yes, I am still rooting for the good guys, but there is no mystery or suspense in terms of wondering who the bad guy is.  The series presents lots of grey areas of life with Arthur and his beliefs, but Morgana and company have been stereotyped into one-dimensional caricatures:  Gee, I wonder what Morgana will do next.  Something evil?  Wow, I never saw that coming.  It's still a good series but, for me, it falls short of great.
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|I havent fully tested it out and will update then..I already use another similar app.  But we've all been conditioned that Amazon has the best prices, but you always need to be an educated consumer and more and more, I find thats not necessarily true.  Whether its general items or apps.  This same exact app seems to be free on Google...One reason I dont think Id ever get a  Kindle is I dont like being limited to Amazon Appstore.
193700788X|1.0|The characters behaved so inconsistently in this book compared to their behaviour carefully built up in the previous ones that I wouldn't be surprised if Charlaine Harris didn't even write this book. Cut your losses and stop reading at book 11 or 12. Or, if you read book 13, then read \\"Stay\\" by kjwrit, which (although pandering a bit to us Sookie/Eric fans) is an example of the characters actually acting according to their characters...
B008A1NSTG|5.0|This movie will touch your heart and have you rooting for the whales safety. Excellent family movie. Old and young alike will enjoy this show. Careful.. may bring tears ..
B000FJGWBC|3.0|There's nothing 'wrong' with the blu-ray, but I received one that has half the cover in English and half in French. It just looks weird. Plays normal and everything, but didn't know I was getting one that had everything side-by-side in multiple languages. Slightly annoying, but doesn't affect viewing experience.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft pocket edition is a very awesome game.if I could do 1000 stars I would give it 1000 stars!!!
B004I744AS|5.0|this dictionary works great! it really helps when your in class and every one in class as taken a the dictionaries off the shelf! it's an amazing app!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|such a fun game. I love the way you have to use every day objects to find every day objects that open locked doors
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book had me questioning myself. Where do I fit in? I found that I have Abdullah's everlasting love for my own sisters, my children and my husband. I could relate to many of the characters to different times of growth in my life. Baba Ayub's sacrifice forever ruined him. Did he hear a bell ringing at night as well? I will always think of Pari and Abdullah when I see a lone feather.<br />Looking forward to the authors next book!
B00006DEFA|4.0|Parts of it were better than other.  Over all it was very englightening.  Somehow I don't think he was actually as giddy and superficial as this depicts..
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|New prog album by Simon Collins (son of Phil) and crew and it is simply marvelous .  A great collection of songs and a true \\"concept\\" album . Highly enjoyable with great performances by all in the band . Highly recommended . This is one of the best albums of the year .
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|iron man 3 is a great game it combines all the best parts of iron man and fun games like temple run
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|I am one of those gay men who feels a bit queasy around camp, and more so when the camp inhabits ageing flesh, so I had to watch this in short spurts, taking breaks to kill a few zombies and then going back for another dose.<br /><br />The film opens in a 1970s gay bar which for some reason boasts a 21st-century sound system.<br /><br />After this slight blip the authenticity is pretty convincing, although Michael Douglas fails to capture the extraordinary plastic persona of the real Liberace - Douglas's version is far more human, and much less bizarre.<br /><br />Given the eccentricity of the main character and the people who surrounded and worshipped him, I would have played this for dark humour: think Bob Fosse directing \\"Cabaret\\". Even the spurned lover throwing a super-tantrum and smashing up the sitting-room was played for sobs, when it could have been hilarious.<br /><br />So I dragged my way somewhat wearily through lots of furs and poodles, and was preparing to write a hatchet job on this movie, but Michael Douglas as Liberace on his deathbed made me weep. Damn, the man can act.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the graphics. Fun to play. A great way to pass the time. I play it all the time and it is hard to stop!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|What a great book. If this doesn't move you I don't know what will. This book can really put things in perspective.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is not bad I would definitely recommend it to my friends. The graphics are ok but the game is free so I didn't expect it to be superb or anything. You should give it a try it's way better than that 100 floors game.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Great book, much better than a lot of reviews made it seem. Now to wait the next book! (The one we've all been dying for).
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I'm not going to sit here and write an essay about what I think is good and not so good about this album because everyone has their own opinion but I do think this album is great. To me it showed how much he grew as an artist. A review I read prior to this said it was boring and well there isn't any fade away club bangers( trust me I like that ignorant ish too)  this album is still hot it's truly a story from the songs to the interludes. If your into that classic story telling hip hop with that new era sound then you should definitely cop this.
1597801585|4.0|So, a great vision of a future apocolyptic earth where global climate change, runaway warming, fossil fuel collapse, and, most importantly, genetic sabotage have crippled life on earth. The setting is Bangkok and the sympathy is with the Thai side, which is already unusual compared to most western stories.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story. Must agree with many of the reviewers that the vision does not seem realistic based on what I know about the sciences involved (Cheshire cats ... really?). However, are we expecting \\"realism\\" from a fantasy and Scifi novel? Taken on its own merits, it's a good and original tale ... good enough!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I THINK THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME. ITS FUN, COOL, AND A GREAT GAME FOR KIDS. ITS LIKE HAVING YOUR OWN HORSE, BUT VIRTUAL.  =)
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Nice case.  Opens easily but can close firmly with strap.  Sets Fire to sleep when closed.  Like the adjustable angle feature.  Use fire mostly for HDMI to TV and this case makes that work well.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Offline mode is great for typing notes after your client meetings and then having them sync automatically when you connect back on to WiFi.  This also means you can type on a tablet from those cramped seats on the airplane when the guy on front of you reclines into your lap and you have no access to WiFi. Then when you are back in the office you can log onto the website and pull up those same notes on your PC. Full circle solution!
B0089LOG02|5.0|If joy through tears is a cleansing emotional purge for you then this is a great read.  The indominatible human spirit is masterfully crafted with the two main characters..  I will look for more from this author who captured the spirit of those two women's struggles.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is definitely an adult book.  I would not recommend it for any person in high school.  It was good, but not my favorite &#34;love story&#34; by any means.
B0054JELS4|5.0|My Dad once said It's a damn good actor or actress that can make you love them or hate them (Characters). NCIS Has characters you will love enough to actually be depressed when they are lost all the way to characters you absolutely cheer when they get theirs. Good story lines, great casting, compelling characters skillfully portrayed.<br /><br />There were a few politically correct episodes that were a let down. Thankfully, they were very few. There were some tendencies of some characters that are more comic book than anything approaching reality (Who can ingest that much caffeine? Really!) I'm glad I bought the disc set. I would have been bonkers waiting a week (Or season) to find out what happens next.<br /><br />I rather like it.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|I like the game I would like more just like it. Please make more as soon as possible. Thank you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this short game! It was easy enough, yet hard enough to give my brain a work out. Played with my 9-year-old son and he was disappointed when the game was over. More levels, please!  :-)
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Great disk.  I have not been a fan of hip hop but people like Kanye (and Common) have made it musically vital to me.  Kanye's disks just keep getting more and more interesting.  Yeezus has all kinds of nooks and crannies to listen to and, I can tell I'll enjoy replaying it many times.<br /><br />There seem to be misconceptions about this disk.  It seems wrong-headed to concentrate on the idea that the album is \\"harsh\\" and a \\"complete break\\" with past work.  To me, all the songs seem really beautiful and carefully wrought.  Yes, Yeezus clears some new ground but, at the same time, there is strong continuity with the whole Kanye project: the deep mixes, the incredible clarity and detail, the ballsy timbres, beats, and jump cuts.  Also, there are more catchy hooks on Yeezus than people are giving it credit for (at least I'm dancing to them!).  This is what we wait for but so rarely get; an artist with creative independence and global reach, who makes music that is both understandable and startling!<br /><br />To object that Kanye did not produce all this stuff also misses the point.  That would be like saying Bjork does not write, arrange and play all the music on her disks.  No kidding.  Actually, a lot of Yeezus makes me think of Bjork (especially Homogenic), both for the collaborative manner in which it was made and for the kinds of beats and sounds it nurtures.  This disk is a fascinating Brundlefly hybrid!<br /><br />Finally, it is silly to fixate on Kanye's irritating persona.  It says a lot that Scorsese used a Yeezus track for The Wolf of Wall Street (or at least the trailer).  The kinds of excess, vanity, and unethical behavior that Kanye provokes us with are a truthful reflection of American culture.  All the extreme reactions from the \\"haters\\" tend to prove Kanye's point, and give him more power.  Art is a mirror...and a hammer!<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'm enjoying every minute of this.  I need to set up my old 200 Watt stereo system; I need old-school power to hear all the glory of this new-school s***!chool power to hear all the glory of this new-school s***!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Excellent plot with fantastic characters.  Ending was suspense filled ending.  All in all, this book is a great read!  Highly recommended!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|trying to make myself read.its sure nice to know that i can get books and other items,immediately to my phone or tablet!!thank you again amazon!!
0671759159|2.0|A majority of this book is just Lynch telling you what stocks to pick, many of which are irrelevant in the economy of today. The rest of the book is filled with anecdotes of his time at Fidelity, littered with unexplained tips that you would already know if you read the first book, One Up On Wall Street.  I highly recommend that you read One up instead, and if you already have, then look elsewhere for stock picking strategy. Take One Up, water down a lot of the strategy and philosophy, and add a great amount of cheap, broker-esque stock advice and you have Beating The Street.
B008NW67E0|5.0|ITS SO SIMPLE TO ONE STEP ORDER SONGS FROM AMAZON!!I ALSO LIKE THE WAY SONGS ARE ALSO AUTO RIPPED TO YOUR CLOUD PLAYER FOR FUTURE USE!!THANKS AGAIN AMAZON!!:)
B005LAII80|5.0|I have to say, the slow-mo special effects was stunning, and I loved the heavy bass techno soundtrack to this movie. Loved it from start to finish to include the way mega city 1 was depicted as this vast sprawling metropolis to the single gigantic housing complex that was sort of the new-age mini city in a city. Acting was just as expected with Judge Dredd being overly stone faced but also humorous. His kinder side-kick Anderson contrasts well with his darker demeanor and the main antagonist was portrayed well as a psycho drug lord.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My daughter and I love this game. She gets super excited when we unlock a new pet. Great for a 3 year old. Wish we could turn in coins for gems or hearts though. And some new updates would be awesome.
0307744434|4.0|I loved this book so much so that when I was finished with it my heart was a little broken.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Good game so far.  Have been able to play without having to spend money.  Need to play more before I can give it a higher rating.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Delivered on time and in good condition.<br /><br />I absolutely love Vince Flynns books and can't wait to snuggle up in bed with this one
B00CH87HF4|5.0|5 stars; I haven't even got to the PvP and I'm already hooked lol. I really like the equipment slots and charms upgrading systems :)
B000AYEL6U|5.0|In my opinion, this story is incredibly underrated. It is beautifully told and the acting is superb. Richard Armitage rivals Colin Firth as the scowling, proud Englishman. This film has earned it's place in my top favorite movies!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Lacks the detail and suspense that was once so easy for the author. Maybe he's done?  Cool plot that could have been a much better read with minimal effort.  Grisham is getting lazy, folks.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is too fun. This is a big hit and I know why. You never win so you can't really show off. I play on this ever rainy day.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I'm really addicted to this app. The only problems that I have are that you only play for 5  minutes.
0525478817|5.0|I was really surprised to see that my copy arrived two days before it was supposed to, and when opened my copy looked perfect not a bend on the cover!<br /><br />This book has not only helped me grasp a new understanding and view of teenage romance but it has also has made me ask myself questions I never dared to ask myself before. Questions like, will I ever find love? Will I leave a mark on this world? Will my life be remembered for generations to come? Or will I mean nothing to anyone after I die?<br /><br />I really do recommend this book to anybody looking for a romance, comedy, humiliation, and great devastation. Beware of the heartbreaking ending that surely awaits every reader.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a great book. It really broadens your perspective. Hopefully I'll become a genius someday, like Nicola Tesla too.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game! Totally worth it! I love this game! Totally addicting!! Great pass time when your traveling or when your just bored while sitting at home.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I got what I expected. This is a great product for the price. The light is very bright. I still need to use it for a while to see if it's durable but so far I'm happy with it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoying solving the puzzles in order to exit each room.  I'm only on the fourth level but I am enjoying it so far.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Since we lost the originally charger for my kindle we ordered this replacement one.  It is perfect!  A really good length and works just like it's suppose to.
0425220931|5.0|The story is just that... a story, but there is a lesson.  And a good lesson at that.  Gives meaning to your work and your artistry.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and the takeaway is being forwarded to my students.
B00A83075M|5.0|my grandson and granddaughter could not stop watching the movie it was great for all ages - so that means nana enjoyed it also
B0000669JL|5.0|Good quality release.  Not too much messing around with the sound.  I like to work out bass lines and put students to task reading and writing them out.  For that purpose it has served me well.
B006FTCH2E|4.0|Though I heard on NPR that this flick was created with an extremely low budget, I was pleasantly surprised with the end product.
B000002KDX|5.0|I bought it because I'm addicted to Amazon and I noticed &#34;hey, I don't have any America in the collection&#34;  It immediately brought back the reason why I didn't have any America in the CD collection.  But I still enjoyed the trip back down memory lane.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As always the author delivers a phenomenal book! If you liked his other novels you will love this one even more.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|Well done, classic Wayne, and with Jimmy Stewart.  Interesting story.  The sound is good, the quality is good, it is a good edition to the collection.
1849015899|4.0|This book inspired a million films and interest groups. As a lover of all-things Stepford, I am thrilled to have this edition in my library. An easy read with an interesting theme, it will make you wonder just how real is this Stepford thing?
B000ZN802W|5.0|Okay, this is another one of those films that I went in totally devoid of knowledge regarding the subject of the film.  True story, read about it if you must.  It was done very well and it is interesting in story development.  You will amazed at what Hirsch put himself through physically to portray this role as it could only be.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Nice game. Takes time to build up though if you don't fall for the buy this and buy this stuff
B00004VWA7|5.0|This is what I consider my favorite Jaco release... it is the one that dropped my jaw....<br /><br />Later on after his time with Weather Report his abilities were hampered by substances and imbalances that were beyond his control.  All the later stuff are great releases but tainted by the fact that you can now in perspective, listen to them and understand how he was losing control of his faculties and how those issues were affecting the quality of his musicianship.  He was suffering and if you know the history behind Jaco and his organic chemical imbalance it all makes sense now.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|i would have liked if there were a little more features.  and also the music is very limited.  needs more..<br />over all it is a decent app
B000I3UAJ0|1.0|As they say, the odd-numbered star trek movies are awful, this being number 1 is no exception.  The plot is boring, the special effects awful even for 1979, and the clothes... ah! the clothes! looks like leisure suit larry out there in a pijama party...
B00BIVN82M|5.0|This CD is great from beginning to end. I don't know how he does it but each one of his CD's gets better than the last one.
B005FFW46S|5.0|There is no author who writes better humorous fantasy than Terry Pratchett.  Many years ago, he added serious themes to the stories, but they are still laugh-out-loud funny.
