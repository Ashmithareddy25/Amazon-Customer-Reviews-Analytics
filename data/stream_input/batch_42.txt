B0000041LA|2.0|While 2 CDs for the price of 1 is rather tempting, and a low-cost way to be introduced to the piano concertos, Ashkenazy does little more than play the notes.  If any feeling is present at all in his playing, it would be  best suited for playing Romantic music.  His interpretation totally lacks  the fire needed for Prokofiev.  I would recommend the complete set of  recordings played by Berman and Guiterrez on Chandos, or, if you can hunt  them down, the recording of Prokofiev himself playing for the Third, and  Baloghova, an unknown Czech pianist whom I have been unable to find any  information about, playing the Second.
B00001OH1S|4.0|Like many others, I purchased this CD primarily for Sting's cut of Windmills but quickly found the rest of the CD enjoyable as well.  It has a nice balance between Bill Conti's original score and classic tracks like  Sinnerman.  I recommend both the movie and CD.
0553565915|5.0|Betty Eadie's EMBRACED BY THE LIGHT is one of the most thought provoking and inspirational readings I have ever read. She draws out from within what each of us know in our soul. She reminds us that we are children of love  and cared for eternally.  Samuel Oliver, author of, WHAT THE DYING TEACH  US: LESSONS ON LIVING.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|uh...i think the guitar is more dynamic in this cd than the others and i like the way it is slightly more heavy than the others. i think the lyrics are much better than evil empire.<br />if you liked the first one, you'll like  this one. if you like rage against the machine, try public enemy or puya.
B00000K0E5|5.0|a lot of people who did not like bond films they change there views throw this film and the remarcable looking bond ( pierce brosnan ) realy he gave a great impact on james bond
B000002V07|4.0|I was in a bookstore where they were playing this CD and I was intrigued by the music &amp; had to find out from the clerk what the album &amp; the band was. The music is so refreshingly different from anything else I  listen to. Sandoval's voice is so haunting &amp; beautiful. I guess I need  to check out their other albums now.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Although this film is kinda long it is by far the best and most thrilling action movie i've ever seen.
B0000028M7|5.0|WHY IS IT THAT WHENEVER I WRITE SOMETHING THATS A LITTLE &quot;STRONG&quot; IN CONTENT THAT YOU GUYS NEVER PRINT IT ?  I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO THE BANK...IF YOU DON'T PRINT MY  LAST REVIEW I WILL STOP BUYING.. ANYTHING... FROM YOU BECAUSE I CAN BUY IT  LOCALLY OR FROM ANOTHER SITE FOR LESS...I WANT TO KNOW WHY MY REVIEW OF  THIS CD WAS NOT PUBLISHED...
0805062971|4.0|I've felt like the guy in this book--so dead to the world that it's better to feel pain than not to feel anything at all, desperate for contact with something real that's not being sold to me by the slick marketing campaign  of some multi-national corporation that refers to me as a  &quot;consumer&quot;, alienated by hypocritical baby-boomer values.  It's  more obvious in the book than in the movie version that the whole thing  about monkeywrenching the consumer culture was Marla's idea. And a danm  good idea too.  I can't believe anybody had the nerve to make a film about  this inflammatory concept.  The censors are all worried about copycat fight  clubs, but how about copycat culture jamming?
B00000DHRZ|5.0|From a new offspring fan this album completely rocks
0140186409|5.0|This book is truely one of the master pieces of the 20th century and Steinbeck one of the best story tellers of our time.  It is a simple book of hard times and how one family has to cope with the times by moving  states in the hope of work.  As we move into the new mellenium this book  reminds us that we should not forget the hardship that our forefathers  endured.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage's third cd has a very great combination of heavy metal/funk. It rocks and you should pick this one up when you get the chance
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah C. is one of my fave singers and this is the best Christmas album I've ever heard. I love all the songs, but I especially love &quot;Joy to the World&quot; and &quot;Jesus What a wonderful Child&quot; Perfection.
B000002U9L|4.0|I think that Labyrinth is the best movie of all time!   I don't think I knew what life was about until I watched that movie!   Well sorta.  I love the soundtrack but I wish it included the actual songs from the movie too,  don't get me wrong, David Bowie was the bomb too, but who doesn't want to  hear the sweet sounds of the goblins? Once again I must say that Labyrinth  is right up there with Ramen noodles, popcorn and orange Gatorade in my  list of things I couldn't live without!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|This album rocks.  Morrello steps up the unique sound that is Rage.  Fans will relate to songs like &quot;Testify,&quot; and &quot;Calm like a bomb.&quot;  The rest of the cd is a bit different.  Not a bad different  though.  It has a different kind of edge than previous albums.
B000002KD9|5.0|Almost thirty years after its release, this album sounds as vital and exhilirating as ever.  Like most great classic albums (i.e., Pet Sounds) there is a certain density and awesome creative energy oozing forth as you  listen to this album.  If you haven't already done so, get this CD into  your collection - &quot;Southern Man&quot; is but one of many brilliant,  emotional songs contained on this album.
B000020617|5.0|WOW, I have been an avid listener of the band since 1995.  This album blew me away, on the first listen I already found myself singing along. &quot;Gimme Stitches&quot; sounds as if Lonesome Dave joined the band for  the song.  &quot;Live-in Skin&quot; is one of the many stellar tracks on  the album, as is the exemplary &quot;M.I.A.&quot; All three of those tracks  are those that you could instantly sing to.  Dave Grohl's vocals are even  better than before, he does the work of 2 guitarists with ease, Nate Mendel  has some great crunching bass lines and it must be hard being a drummer in  a drummer's band but Taylor Hawkin's gets through it swimmingly.          This also proves that you don't need to be some poser mixture of hip/hop  and metal to mkae an album that actually has potential to sell and be  critically acclaimed these days. If the last three albums are any indicator  of what's in store for the future, then we're in for a long and joyous ride
B000020617|4.0|A bunch of sugar-sweet singles. A great album--irresistible, in fact. If you like perfect pop that's not fey and twee or pretentious, this one's for you. A surprise, a revelation, just great song-craft in a cold, cold world.
6300270432|5.0|A beautiful film, by any standard.  Marshall Fine says it best when he calls it &quot;surprisingly heartfelt and deliciously exciting&quot; in the review above.  Like all of the greatest action films, the emphasis is on  character development and interaction.  Even so, the action scenes are  breathtaking.  Sydney Pollack directs like Akira Kurosawa and Howard Hawks,  with outbursts of violence happening rapidly and intensely without being  gratuitous.  Robert Mitchum is excellent as always, as is the rest of the  cast. This would make an excellent Warner budget line DVD, if presented in  an anamorphic transfer at the film's original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (the way  that Warner has presented Just Cause and other movies).  Please release the  DVD soon!
B00000IQBL|5.0|Having seen a hell of alot of war movies in my time, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is by far my favourite. It is the most engaging look at the Vietnam war, in a simplistic Kubrick kind of way.  Who else could make an  &quot;artsy-fartsy&quot; war movie.  Don't get me wrong, i'm not really a  Kubrick fanatic (the only other movie I like by him is The Shining). What i  enjoyed about Full Metal Jacket was the sheer minimalistic way it was  filmed. The scenes were not clutered about, and there were no long drawn  out mega-shoot outs where you don't know what the heck is going on.   Instead, Kubrick took his time with each scene, which in essence totally  envelops you and makes the last war sequence a total gut wretching  experience.  A total enthralling movie, and absolutely great  cinematography.
0671646788|5.0|This is a wonderful book for those of us who need to be motivated...and who doesn't?  I was really inspired by the insight given in this book.  It can help you in ALL areas of your life.
B00000JZIK|5.0|I can't put a review of this movie into words.  Simply stunning and brilliant.  The acting is wonderful.  I can honestly say that Kevin Spacey is the most talented actor in Hollywood today. Anyone who has not seen this  movie has to see it, at least once.
6301744160|4.0|This is one of the few science fiction flicks made back in the sixties that still continues to awe its audience.  We've made much advance in the area of presenting special effects since this film's release; but it's  still got plenty of popularitiy to entertain another generation of sci-fi  fans.
0790736942|5.0|I first saw the film when I was 14 yrs old and I had to sleep in my parents' room because I was so scared. To this day, 20 yrs later, I am still afraid to watch it even on television but sometimes I force myself. I  just think that it was made too well.
6303686745|5.0|Although this film is dated, it still gives a grim, frightening effect of what could have happened during the cold war.  The entire cast gives realistic and convincing performances of the persons controlling the  world's fate when they are all under severe stress.
6305076626|5.0|This movie is wonderful. I have seen it many many times and I hope to see it many many more times. Tim Curry puts on a wonderful performance as Frank Furter and everything about Rocky Horror is great. It's a must see movie.
6305161976|5.0|This is the film that launched Humphrey Bogart into cinematic prominence.  After using Bogart in supporting roles during the thirties with their other stars like Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, et al., Warner Bros. finally  gave Bogie a chance at the leading role here in this picture.  A great  story about a city of refugees during a very grim episode of World War II  is presented in this film that truly is one of the all time classics.
B000002KXV|5.0|If I was stranded on a desert island and had just one CD, this would have to be it.  The lyrics are brilliant and the music has a timeless quality.  I never get tired of listenting to it.
630197154X|5.0|A well-made film about what executives at the television networks can and could do just to draw bigger audiences and better ratings.  This is one film that not only entertains, but also informs us about life in an  extremely competitive environment such as the television industry.   Excellent performances are rendered by the entire cast of this film  although Robert Duvall is a little underutilized.  What ever happened to  Beatrice Straight?
B000009QPE|5.0|When it comes to Reign in Blood, all you need to know is that it is the best. I'm sorry to be blunt but who really cares if there are &quot;other&quot; artists out there with &quot;other&quot; cds because to  be perfectly honest, i don't even need to listen to them to know that they  are FAR FAR FAR inferior to this masterpiece. No one has ever and will ever  come within miles of this cd, and to those who think otherwise you are very  very wrong at the very least. Slayer created my god when they recorded this  monster and no mortal can aspire to this because no one else is that good.  No one is even close to being this good, not within light years. Nirvana?  Metallica? Korn? Dave Matthews? Led Zeppelin? The Beatles? Who cares how  good they are by themselves because none of them are even close to being as  good as Slayer was when they made Reign in Blood and still is today. End of  discussion, if you feel otherwise your wrong, thats all there is to it
0783216084|5.0|Unforgettable soundtrack (Theme from Jaws),brilliant plot ( man X mighty wild nature),one of the greatest and most creative directors of all times,great effects and tons of tension,extraordinary cast... this is  JAWS!It's a unique experience .After watching it,you'll never feel safe  once you're in the water(No matter if it's a pond,a lake,a river,a swimming  pool,the sea or the ocean).Even if you dream about floating in the water,or  there's water in your dreams be sure the quantity does not exceed 4  gallons! MY FAVORITE MOVIE ! It will be certainly remembered in  the  21st,22nd and all other centuries to come.It's a classic about our greatest  fears: hydrophobia!  and dying slowly!  After watching this movie get  into the water,close your eyes and you'll see what SPIELBERG really  meant!
0136879721|5.0|I read this book 5 years ago. From then on my life has been better and more peaceful. I love the way Dr. Murphy wrote the book. It's easy to read and understand.  I'm grateful to the author for writing this book, and I  feel lucky for having read this masterpiece. It reveals the miracle most  people haven't discovered yet in themselves and need to realize. It's like  a magic book! It's a must!
B0000025D0|5.0|Thsi is what Rock and Roll is all about! Forget Sgt Pepper, forget Disraeli Gears, Forget Beggars Banquet, forget any of the pretentious art-rock, THIS IS THE ROCK AND ROLL album! TFrom the opening shots of &quot;Badlands&quot; to the closing  riffs of the title song, all of the  things that made Rock and Roll great are here. Girls, cars, hopes, broken  dreams, angst, frustration, and sex are all here.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Out of print since the 1984 video release, this remixed, remastered version really jumps out at the viewer.  The bass and drums, barely audible in the 1984 Hi-FI stereo mix, now pop out and vibrate your soul.  I was a  little dissapointed that the bonus tracks on the DVD, actually edited into  the 1984 release, are no longer part of the film because  it seeems that  the negatives are sadly lost and only the ' 84 video masters are available.  That's a guess based on the liner notes on the DVD.  The commentary is fun  as well. Buy.  Enjoy.  Dance.
B000002KIE|5.0|Punk fans, dont get this just because it changed everything get it because it ROCKS.  Irritating lerics my a**.  Alright sid isnt paverroti but u must agree the music isnt that hard to listen to.  The best songs wud have to be  holidays in the sun, bodies, and anarchy for the uk.  I also like god save  the queen alot
6301955595|5.0|Jodorowsky is able to show the most terrible side of human beings in the most poetical way. In Santa Sangre, the grotesque and the sublime, the profane and the sacred, coexist in the same dimension.  The images are so  powerful, that strike you in an emotional level, and yet, at the same time,  affect you in a deep psychological and spiritual level.  This author's  vision taught me what compassion meant, in the most profound sense of the  word.
B0000025VU|4.0|If anyone from Columbia Records is reading this PLEASE listen! You recently re-mixed and re-released Street Legal. With Infidels, you have *much* better material to work with, and the chance to release one of BD's  greatest albums. Here's all you need to do:<br />1) Re-mix the album so that  Jokerman (one of his greatest songs ever), Sweetheart, I and I, etc. have  better sound quality than the original release<br />2) Add the amazing songs  that were inexplicably left off the original release: Foot of Pride, Blind  Willie McTell, Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart, and Lord Protect My Child  <br />3) I also understand there was a great song he did a great song called  &quot;Julius and Ethel&quot; about the Rosenbergs -- let's hear it!<br />4)  Release the album, then sit back and read the outstanding critical reviews,  and watch the sales go through the roof!<br />Please, drop me a line if you  have any questions...
1558216847|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Though I understand there would be no way to put down all the details and one has to fill in the blanks it is still as complete as I could have hoped for.  This book leaves me wondering what  happened to Mister Smith and the others.
B000002LA2|2.0|I'm one of the biggest Clapton fans you'll meet, but I just didn't like this album.  That's fine, though, he's allowed to experiment with different styles of music all he wants- most of the time he's always incredible.  The  only reason I bought this CD was for &quot;Holy Mother&quot; which has  become one of my favorite songs.  Thinking back I should have just looked  for it on mp3.  Oh well, no big loss.  Clapton is still God in my book...
B000002MG1|5.0|I own 400 Cd's.  Out of those 400, i have maybe 10 Five star albums.  This is one of them.  REM hit a peak with this record that most bands can only dream about.  The songs, which string together and bring forth the true  definition of an &quot;album&quot;, are flawless.  With &quot;Drive&quot;,  lead singer Michael Stipe, while he could scream his feelings into the  song, tell the youth of America: &quot;Hey, kids, rock and roll, nobody  tells you where to go&quot; almost in a whisper.  His whisper and his  feelings are found throughout the album, and are very effective.  From  &quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot; to &quot;Find The River&quot;, The  underlying theme is melencoly.  The songs are sad, but at the same time,  uplifting.  In &quot;Try Not to Breathe&quot;, Stipe sings about needing to  &quot;fly over my grave again&quot;, while in &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;,  he tells the whole world, and i'm sure many people that have contemplated  suicide, to &quot;hold on&quot;.  The whole time the music behind him,  provided by guitarist Peter Buck, bassist and keyboardist Mike Mills, and  drummer Bill Berry, flow right along with the words.  I think there is more  use of e-minor on this album then on any other in the history of music.   However, Buck uses this chord more effectivly then anyone, making it sound  as fresh and melodic as it can be.   All three musicians sounds as tight as  ever, building the songs from scratch and presenting them to the world with  striking beauty. I feel that this ablum stands next to Radiohead's &quot;OK  Computer&quot; as the best album of the 90's, and for any true music lover  out there, this is a must.
B000002UKS|5.0|Lets all gather round, give Foo Fighters some applause, and thank them for doing their best to save rock through such dark times as the late 90's have become.  At a time when people have started considering such trash as Kid  Rock, Limp Bizkit, and Korn as rock 'n roll; Foo Fighters remain solid as a  great, basic rock band.  That's all there is to it.  This albumn is full of  great songs, they're improving w/ every new record...
B000021XR5|4.0|If you compare this to past STP Albums, well, it just doesn't.  But that's what happens when the band writes the music while the singer is in jail, I guess.  Personally, I think they released this just to remind people that  they aren't breaking up because of Weiland's problems.  I just got it  today, though, so it hasn't had time to grow on me.  I will say that it is  far different from there others, and that may be a good thing.  If they put  out the same music all the time, they'll get stale.  I would have given  this 3 1/2 stars, but you can't do that on amazon.
B000020617|5.0|It's just gREAT!  Old fans and new fans alike will LOVE it!        Like their past albums, the Foo Fighters are experimenting with many different styles rather than having a boring record of all the same GenRe.  The thing  about the Foo Fighters playing all different genres is that they play each  at its finest.  Its a beautiful thing really!  Don't even hesitate to buy  this cd, and while your at it, buy their other two cd's!
B0000041DF|5.0|Tired of lame, slow performances on the piano? Need something to spice up your life? Need more action in the house? Here it is: Not spotless, but raw and blunt, not perfect, but a true ride on the wild side. Turn up the volume, send your neighbor on holidays, lay down and listen to the rockets  full of fierceness and fireworks!!! You won't regret!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This album is as inspiring as all the rest, and if you don't think they have a new sound, listen to mic check, and rage.
0790736918|5.0|First John Ford introduces us to the Edwards family and we warm up to them directly.  Then within the first half hour they are all slaughtered by Indians except a little girl who is captured.  The audience is roped in.   Invested. Yes I was surprised to see John Wayne being free with his  emotions.  I was more impressed with the deep and heartfelt performances of  Jeffrey Hunter and Harry Carey, Jr. as well as Ken Curtis' mastery of  comedy and Ward Bond's deftness at both.  But no one swaggers like the  Duke. No one directs like Ford.  And no place is as beautiful as Monument  Valley.  I originally watched this because Roger Ebert and Steven Speilberg  both raved about it.  Boy were they right!
B000020617|5.0|This is by far their best Cd yet. Great songs all the way through. Stacked Actors is the best song on the Cd &amp; it sounds so much like Nirvana that it sent chills up my spine. Foo Fighters are the best rock band out now and I'm guessing they'll be around for along long time. They're the new leaders  of Rock. It's a must have for rock fans.
B000005DQR|5.0|DJ Shadow's &quot;Entroducing...&quot; is one of the greatest sample and DJ albums ever created. With its smooth flow, and catchy beats, it can easily become a personal favorite of any electronic music lover. This  album, made purly of samples, has a creative way to bring other artist's  music together, and is shown through Shadow's prespective. The music he  &quot;barrowed&quot; is coming through him, to us, the listeners, with a  sweet, relaxing twist. Songs like &quot;Building Steam with a Grain of  Salt&quot;, &quot;Stem/Long Stem&quot;, and &quot;Midnight in a Perfect  World&quot;, give this album alot of variety, and easy listening to  qualities. This is a great album to just chill to, or use listen to in the  backround of another activity.
B000002BFZ|1.0|This is the worst thing I've every heard and I love Pearl Jam. How Sad. It only gets 1 star cause I have to give it something.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie is the BEST.  It makes me cry everytime I watch it.  In college I took many courses on judaic and holocaust studies, and in turn, I've become very interested in viewing as many films and reading as many books as possible on the topic.<br /><br />Many aspects of the film are not realistic, like Guido staying with his son Joshua in a concentration camp, that's very unlikely.  In many instances the children and elderly are killed as soon as they arrived.  If you want to know what it was really like in the ghetto and concentration camps, view schindlers' list or the pianist.  If you want to be entertained and be briefly introduced (I wouldn't even call it that) to this horrific event in history, I would view this film.<br /><br />Otherwise, this movie is AMAZING.  Tops any movie that's been released since its inception.
6301095294|4.0|Magical Mystery Tour is more interesting not for what it was but for what it would become. It was a musical video album before MTV; a series of Monty Python skits before Monty Python's Flying Circus first hit the air; a  performance by an Elvis impersonator before the King died and his  impersonators were everywhere.<br />One can wish that Richard Lester had  directed it, or that the Beatles had actually given Federico Fellini a call  to direct it since it's obviously an homage to him; or even that Terry  Gilliam had been given this film as one of his first directing jobs.  It's  not as funny as it should be but that could just be my prejudice as an  American not tuned to the sensibilities of English Music Hall burlesque  skits.<br />Nonetheless, the Beatles' music was magical and this film contains  some of their best.
B00000J7J4|4.0|Critiquing music has to be next to impossible.  Music is personal, subjective and from the soul.  Anyone who is interested in the CD, I would recommend reading all of the comments from those that rated it 3-stars or  less (I did before I listened).  This gives you the downside.<br />As for the  upside, it speaks for itself.  This is a compelling blend of music that I  think most will find pleasant.  I had never listened to a Santana album  prior to this.  Supernatural was well worth the time and money.  I would  recommend it.  There is obvious talent and soul.  But read the critics and  listen for yourself.<br />You won't be disappointed.
B00001QEE9|5.0|I think that this is one of the best from the Disney golden years. However I had 3 DVD discs shipped to me and all 3 were defective. The picture would freeze and the sound would stop. I checked my machine with other discs and  it was fine. I think there is a bad batch of DVD discs. Has anyone else had  the problem? Please let me know.
0767836286|5.0|Extremely riveting and unsuspecting.  I can't think a person watching this movie expects what they get.  I was constantly waiting for the next &quot;twist&quot; in the movie.  One for my personal collection forever.
B000020617|2.0|I anticipated this release for months. The Foos, I thought, would give a nice injection of rock and roll again to the rap/metal infested scene. Their first two records are brilliant.   Upon first listen I was horrified.   They have really toned down and mellowed the sound.  Nothing really rocks  anymore.  And it's not a subtle change, it's almost like the difference  between Led Zep II and III.  Grohl must be smoking too much pot.  Let's  hope they don't follow the path of the Goo Goo Dolls.  If you love the  first two, just heed my warning. After the first listen, I had to slap on  the Hellacopter's Payin the Dues for some instant relief of all the  balladry.  A big disappointment.
B000020617|5.0|Thankfully the Foo Fighters once again remind us that a rock band can use a guitar, bass and drums and nothing else and create outstanding music. In this era of flavor-of-the-month bands that crank out one good single on a crummy album, &quot;There is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; is a triumph. Every  song is outstanding. This is an album in which you can toss aside your  remote programmer for the CD player when you stick the disc in the platter  -- you'll play the whole thing every time. &quot;Breakout,&quot;  &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; and &quot;Aurora&quot; are gems, but every track  is strong. It's so refreshing and reassuring to know that Dave Grohl,  Taylor Hawkins and Nate Mendel aren't succumbing to the beat-infested,  hip-hop-influenced, rap-ripoff &quot;rock&quot; that pollutes the modern  rock airwaves these days. This is a great rock/pop album, plain and simple.  Foo Fighters proves that there's still magic in six strings.
B000005ITX|2.0|When I put the disc in my C.D. player, it would have been a lot safer if I had been home instead of driving my car. My Porsche quickly morphed into a VW Beetle with a peace-sign painted across the hood. Goose-bumps rippled up my arms as a rush of warmth overcame me. The vocals and guitar pushed me  through the openning of the time-warp as I was thrust into an era I still  miss dearly. This album is nothing short of SUPERB!  I still don't know how  I got to work that day. Arthur Lee and the band had IT. Tomorrow I'm going  to unwrap Bathing at Baxter's and listen to it on my drive. With any luck,  I'll end up in Frisco....
0451191153|5.0|I must admit that even though I was an English major, I did not read this book until just recently. I was surprisingly pleased with the ideas and characters that Ayn Rand expounds upon in &quot;The Fountainhead.&quot;  This novel takes quite a while to get through, but it is well worth the  effort. Be sure to set aside the time not only to read it, but to think  about the material!
B0000021RD|5.0|In my opinion, Chicago's first two double albums are really the only ones worth owning.  After that, maybe a couple of singles are up to snuff, but not much else.<br />Chicago II represents the band when they were musically  ambitious, daring, all over the map stylistically, and incredibly TIGHT.  I  still marvel at this record.  The horn section is just too good, the  drumming is just THERE, and the songwriting was never equalled by Chicago  since.<br />Too bad they finally decided to just let Cetera take center stage  and sing mushy, sappy MOR ballads.  I guess it paid the bills, but it was  sure disappointing to those of us that remembered the band's early  efforts.<br />Forget about what Chicago eventually became.  This is their  great stuff.
0385495315|5.0|This is one of those rare books which you can open at any page and find something which keeps you reading on. Particular good is its  explanation of Turing's technique for breaking Enigma. It also explains a few loose  ends from recent TV programs on Bletchley Park. For example, why sink all 9  U boat supply ships whose position was revealed by Enigma decrypts and so  arouse German suspicions? In fact the Admiralty only intended to sink  seven, but other destroyers unconnected with the operation came across the  other two independently. Each chapter has up to date coverage and lucid  explanations, which leave you believing you know a bit about the Navajo  language or quantum computers.
B00000J7S8|5.0|I've been reading about Krall and her albums on the internet and bought her latest offering to get a taste. The old fashioned great tunes of the past with great piano playing is  wonderful atmospheric music. As for  Krall's singing, I have mixed feelings. She's straightforward, sensuos,  compensating a non range voice with intimacy and playfulness. I can't  &quot;blame&quot; her for anything, yet one can't help imagine the same  songs with other singers with vocal ability (Ella, Vaughn or imagine  Streisand crooning the same tunes). Still it is a wonderful disc blessed  with  beautiful arrangements, strings by Mandel. One has to see how Krall  will develop.
B000000FG8|5.0|bought this on vinyl back in the Gilman Street days...<br />sounds nice on CD...GIT IT...
0802130208|5.0|I have read this book 5 times now. I live in New Orleans and find this to be a truth to what this city is truly like. I laugh out loud at Ignatious! And, if you can believe it, New Orleans built a statue in dedication of  him. HAHA!  <br />It's actually a true story. The writer committed suicide  after finishing it. His mother found the transcripts underneath his bed and  published it. If you want a good description of New Orleans with a twist  you have to read this! It's execelent!
B000002GJH|5.0|This is a very solid album with the efforts of both Pearl Jam, and Sound Garden coming together and jamming like only they now how.  Very Impressive.  P.S. If you ever get a chance to see the video clip of Hunger  Strike don't miss it.  Very cool watching these two bands play.
B00001MXXG|5.0|This was a great movie! If you were born in the late 70's early 80's you probly grew up off this movie. If not then it's never to late to make a new begining........
630218021X|5.0|A wonderful film.  It's a mistake to criticize the overblown style.  Russell was directing in the style of the MUSIC.  The acting is intended to be as coarse and overwrought as Tchaikovsky's music, which is featured in a  masterful way.  Some of the video-to-music editing is incredible.   Admittedly, the film does eventually go over-the-top when Glenda Jackson  goes mad, but the film makes a great effect.
B000005RTG|5.0|This album is by far one of the best of Deep Purple. So what if you don't have Ritchie Blackmore, you have Tommy Bolin (Now Deceased) who was just outstanding guitarist. When you hear this album you have to think of Jon Lord and Ian Paice (the new look of Deep Purple). The songs on it just rock  buy it; you'll love it! It's funky blues at its finest!
B000021XR5|5.0|I have been a big Stone Temple Pilots Fans for years and I remember hearing from one of my friends that the ban had broken up - A VERY SAD DAY!  I almost soiled myself on the spot when I saw his album  in the music  store and bought it straight away.  It seems to blend qualities from all  the previous albums and has not left my stereo in days.  A very welcome  return to Stone Temple Pilots &lt; THEY ARE ROCKING ON&gt;
B00001QGPR|4.0|This may suprise the casual Bowie listener as much  as the Bowie-phile. The album is full of retrospect, yet there are no recyclings of any other styles Bowie has tried. The last three tracks are reminicent of Low, but there is certainly nothing wrong with that.
0780020693|5.0|The lack of an Italian subtitle is simply unforgivable
B00000IL1K|5.0|When I bought this CD I did not know what to expect. Now that I have it I can not put it down. The lyrics to the songs have so many good vibratons that relax your body entirely. If you are looking for an exelent album then this is the album for you.
B00000IL67|5.0|I have been an Alice fan since the early 70's and have anticipated the arrival of this set since it was first mentioned in the mid 80's.<br />Listening to all the songs on the discs brought back many memories  of my youth and the AC concerts I attended.  Every song came back to me as  if I were rocking out to them yesterday (I may have been!)  <br />These are  timeless classics and besides being the master showman, Alice is the master  lyricist.  Having been involved in writing lyrics to every song on his 20  some albums is a great accomplishment in itself.  The boxed set includes 80  songs and he could easily produce Life and Crimes part II with others from  his vast repertoire.<br />It is a truly great set. If I had to pinpoint any  problem problem with it it would be that it did not include more from his  former bands' album [Billiion Dollar Babies Battle Axe] or some Michael  Bruce solo tunes.<br />Alice is the living legend and this is one box set all  fans of rock and roll should have.  Even if you are not a fan... you will  definately be one after listening to this great set.
B00000JPH5|5.0|I have been in love with David Bowie ever since I saw this movie when I was a kid. Jim Henson is my hero. The story, the songs, the characters--all of it makes up one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I am so glad that  it's been re-released on video. I've spent over 6 years looking for a copy  of it,and now that it's here, I'm gonna buy every copy I can find! I will  never be without this film again!
B000021XS0|5.0|This has got to be the best album that Dream Theater has ever put out! And yet, so called Dream Theater fans tell us that they have always loved DT, but not this CD. I'm sorry, but that does not compute. James LaBrie's  vocals are one of the best things about DT, and they are certainly not  mediocre. He never gets enough credit for the tremendous amount of work he  puts into each album. Secondly, Kevin Moore is great, no doubt about it,  but he didn't do much for Awake. I like the new addition of Jordan Rudess.  He has allowed them to get back on track musically. Although at times, he  like to use some strange settings on his keyboards.<br />So, in conclusion, if  you really understood Dream Theater, you wouldn't embarrass yourself by  claiming to be a fan and then contradicting yourself in your comments.
6301442962|5.0|This is definitely worthy of the description &quot;Christmas Classic.&quot;  The storyline and wonderful performances by the tremendous cast create an enchanting tale.  Although made in 1947, this film is in no  way dated.  It shows the commercial aspect that surrounds the holiday  season while still managing to demonstrate the magical feeling that  Christmas brings. I love its theme and its message:  No matter what age you  are, you must always be willing to have faith in others and yourself.
B000021XR5|5.0|This is a must buy for anybody who loves to listen to pounding drums, heavy/raw guitar riffs, and rumbling but melodic bass lines. This is one of the only CD's I purchased this year Finally, some real talent and STP is back!  Everything else on the market these days is trash. STP did their  part in bringing rock back, lets hope some other bands will do the same.
0553213105|5.0|This book is one of the greatest classics I have ever read. The story of five young daughter's lovelives, along with their impertinent mother and lovable but sarcastic father, it is definitely a good read. The plot picks  up as the book progresses, leaving the reader striving to know one thing:  will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy realize their profound love for one another  and finally get together? I definitly reccomend reading this book. Try it,  you will love it!
B000005JAB|5.0|Even if you're not a fan of John Cale's work (and sometimes it really helps) - this is one of the most ambient and exhilerating albums of the past 30 years or so, surpassing most everything anyone from Velvet  Underground have since done, including Cale himself.  The only thing that  comes close is 1982's &quot;Music For a New Society&quot;.  Considering  this was released in 1973 - it might have subconciously set the standard  for most pop-glam-punk-alternative and thus mainstream music since.  Cale  is the unacknowledged Godfather of post-Velvet rock n'roll.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|So says the latest edition of &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; and I'm not at this point inclined to disagree.  And, keep in mind, I've never been a huge Rage fan.  The production alone makes it worth having - I've never heard such a massive sounding album.  There's no doubt in my mind that Morello  does his most creative work here, and the riffage FAR exceeds that on  &quot;Evil Empire.&quot;  How no one could've yet singled out  &quot;Testify&quot; is beyond me, as that song is incredible.  Also, de la  Rocha is finally learning to edit down his words-per-measure, and the music  has benefitted immeasurably in terms of rhythmic impetus.  As far as I'm  concerned, &quot;Battle...&quot; is easily their best and most consistent  album.
B00000DFTG|4.0|I am a big Sabbath fan and that is why I baught this. &quot;Psycho Man&quot; is as great a song as Sabbath ever made and &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; is good too. All the classics are here and a few gems such as  &quot;Into the Void&quot;. If you are a big Sabbath I highly recommend you  pick this up, but if you are just a casual fan, I don't think you need this  cd. I've seen Sabbath live and just hearing them live does not do it  justice. If you have a chance, see Ozzy or Sabbath live. You won't regret  it.
0790745399|5.0|I loved it!  And I'm only 14!  I have always loved a god mind bender. If kinda liked The Game then you will love this movie!  It is so much better than The Game. I wish I had seen it in the theaters, it must have  been so cool. This deserves 10 stars!
B000002KDO|5.0|I highly recommend you pick up Master of Reality. It is my favorite of the Sabbath albulms. From such Sabbath classics as &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; and &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; to the not so famous yet just as rocking  &quot;Into the Void&quot; and &quot;Lord of this World&quot;, this cd never  gives up in it's pursuit to rule the world. Haunting yet uplifting.  Deliberately dark in a fun kind of way. Sabbath rules your world.
0385474547|1.0|Having read this in college for a humanities class on the American experience, I only managed to get through it because I had to. If this story is representative of Nigerian culture, I have no empathy for them. I  found this story went no where, there were no real accomplishments done by  the main character, his could have check in to an asylum for a year, dealt  with his tribal issues, what he missed out on as a kid, came back to his  tribe and really made a difference with his people. Instead, we just see  some ones life that just gets worse.<br />In retrospect, the story lived up to  it's name.
185984054X|5.0|Christopher Hitchens brilliantly dismantles the Mother Teresa institution, revealing a very well-covered world of propaganda, greed, and fraud.  He totally destroys the ill-founded popular conception that there is such a  thing as a purely good man, a notion that, when bought by a huge chunk of  humanity, can and does yield disastrous results for society.
B000002KO3|5.0|From the bizzare opening track, &quot;Born Under Punches&quot;, this album is a party of noises and eccentricities.  Though the first three tracks might inspire the legs to dance (&quot;I'm a tumbler,&quot; David Byrne  sings), the entire album evokes a sort of cosmic double-take from the  listener.  It may be a matter of whether you can take Byrne's weirdness:  His spastic singing style and sometimes almost nonsensical lyrical gift  burrow a deep hole in funk and challenge you to dance your way out.  There  is a suggestion of some sort of amphetamine-charged marathon through the  suffocating universe of middle America, which begins with the hyperactive  &quot;Born Under Punches&quot; (&quot;all I want is to breathe ... I'm so  thin&quot;), accelerates through &quot;Crosseyed and Painless&quot; and  &quot;The Great Curve&quot;, culminates in &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;,  and then descends deep into a bizarre, barren land (and sound-)scape.   &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; is one of the great, strange exitential  meditations in rock music (and one of the few that really works, as a  matter of fact).  Byrne looks in the mirror and finds nothing: &quot;And I  say to myself, 'Self, how did I get here?'&quot;  This album could have  been called &quot;Tales of a Funky Nothing.&quot;
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This is a politicaly inspired album that is a great blend of hip-hop and rock with the sound and fury that can only be rage.  Zack's lyrics are just as good as the self titled and better than Evil Empire.  Tom Morello's work  on the guitar blows my mind on The Battle of Los Angeles just as much as  the other two albums.  My favorite songs are &quot;Testify&quot;,  &quot;Born of a Broken Man&quot;, and &quot;Voice of the Voiceless&quot;.   It is good to see music and political activism back together. Rage is a  band with a purpose in a time when fluffy pop is all over the radio and  bands like Limp Bizkit are screaming about &quot;nookie&quot;.  Great  album, go buy it.
0517122707|5.0|Sirs:       I have to be careful so as not to address all my letters as _____________ Mongoloid, esq.       My vocabulary seems to have been totally depleted before words and phrases such as &quot;abomination&quot;,  &quot;floral abortion&quot; and &quot;geometry and theology&quot; became a  regular part of it.       I went to New Orleans and accidentally came back  with four rolls of film with hot-dog vendors.          People have attacked  me in the subway overcome with joy that they saw another person reading the  book. (I didn't get it then, but now that I do it to others it makes  perfect sense).        I carry the book around with me on days which might  turn out to be not so happy.          And lastly, after reading some  negative reviews -<br />     --Is my paranoia getting completely out of hand  or are there people in world who don't like this book!
B00001ZULV|1.0|All praise the number one artistic sell out band. While their 1980s-1990s music has a sound it never to me to the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;.<br />Save your money, better yet buy Selling England by the pound, Trespass, Foxtrot,  Nursery Crime, or Lamb lies down on Broadway
B00000FCBC|3.0|After surviving through their previoius pathetic efforts (Load and Reload), I bought this cd set with trepidation.  The only reason I bought Garage  Inc. was for the second CD which contained all of their older material.  Some of those songs I just heard for the first time and I've  gotta say that this was Metallica during their heyday. The highlights on  the album for me were Breadfan and Stone Cold Crazy.     The first CD, on  the other hand, is an uneven mix of new recordings which left me  unimpressed.  I will admit that they cover a wide range of musical styles.   I kinda got the impression that they drew the song titles from a hat before  recording it.  While its interesting to hear Metallica's take on a few  songs, ie. Mercyful Fate medley, this first CD falls flat.     I'd only  recommend this album to old fans because of the second CD.  Otherwise,  don't bother with it.  Newer fans, I think, will also be unimpressed.   Overall, the first CD is dull, the second is great, combine them and you  get incredibly mediocre.
6305627401|5.0|&quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer, &amp; Uncut&quot; has become my latest laughter cure for those sad, bleak rainy days in Life!  It just keeps getting better with each consecutive viewing; there's always some latent  gag to pick up on that didn't strike accord with you before.  The crass  toilet humor, satire, vulgarity, and profanity (sorry &quot;Big  Lebowski&quot;, your &quot;F&quot; - word record's been beaten by a huge  lanslide!) totally push the R-rating to the hilt, but who the heck cares!   Whether &quot;South Park&quot; was rated R or NC-17, as the film lampoons  mercilessly with the &quot;Terrence &amp; Philip&quot; flick seen by Stan  and the gang, every inveterate fan of the Comedy Central series would be on  a mass exodus to see it.  As a musical, Mr. Mackey's little number on swear  word etiquette just leaves me in stitches...totally M'KAY in my book!  All  disgruntled Microsoft users will gorge themselves seeing ultranerd Gates  getting his brains blown out when MS98 doesn't run so fast in the military  briefing scene!  Funny as heck, but definitely keep all kiddies and the  faint of heart away from &quot;South Park&quot;. By the way, I am a  God-fearing Roman Catholic...and if I'm going to spend eternity with Satan  &amp; Sadaam for loving &quot;South Park&quot; , then pack up the 1,000,000  sunblock to beat those flames from Hell (HAH)!!!
B000002B2X|4.0|I just bought this cd used last week (like I should've done a long time ago), &amp; Chris Cornell's on here!  I had no idea, so that was a very nice surprise, as AIC &amp; Soundgarden are my 2 favorite bands of the  decade, as well as being my 3rd &amp; 4th favorite bands of all time (well,  if you wanna get technical, they tie, they both rule).  I heard &quot;Got  me wrong&quot; back in '94 for the &quot;Clerks&quot; soundtrack (I think),  &amp; I fell in love.  I only give it 4 stars just cuz I loved Jar of Flies  first, &amp; this is just too short!  Plus the 5th track's annoying, as  previously said...it's supposed to be a joke, right?  cuz I can't keep a  straight face...  So if you thought you had every AIC album &amp; you don't  have this (like me), get it.
0553573403|2.0|I had expected so much from this book, what with its award and all the rave reviews I'd heard. However the book was slow going in several places, lots of interesting ideas just fizzled out and left me wondering what the  point was. Some of the characters were likeable, and even some of the  events were exciting, but mainly it was hard to find anything interesting  to sustain the book. The ending just sort of lost its steam half way  through and it seemed like the author just gave up and left it that way.  There was a great deal of unrealized potential here and I shutter to think  that this is just the start of another unending epic. If you want better  written epic fantasies try, Fesit, Williams, or even Jordan.
B000009ED0|2.0|I give it 2 stars for &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; &amp; &quot;I am the Bullgod&quot; &amp; a couple of other catchy tunes...but I agree with a previous review, &quot;Cowboy&quot; is ANNOYING!  If you want some real  rock-rap, get Beastie Boys &amp; Rage Against the Machine...they came  first.
6304925034|5.0|I have seen this film five or six times, and each time is more rewarding than the last. It is so well crafted, so complete, that it's hard to imagine a scene or even a word that could be removed without harming the  whole work. It is a masterpiece that I would rank among the 5 best films  ever made. To catagorize it as a &quot;Film Noir&quot; is hopelessly  inadequate. I only wish more films could be made with such care and  attention to detail.
0767817443|4.0|Perhaps &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; would have been a more appropriate title for this film.  After all, this Godzilla is more of a velociraptor with an overactive thyroid than the lovable beast of Japanese legend.   Nonetheless, this is a fun film, highlighted by Jean Reno's coffee-slurping  French secret-service agent.  Mathew Broderick plays the lead with a very  intelligent degree of understatement (since the plot stinks and the  character is transparent), and avoids taking himself too seriously.  There  are a lot of good moments in this film and some hilariously inane dialogue  (&quot;I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion!&quot;), but it  holds together well and gets better with repeated viewings.  The Air Force  turns Madison Square Garden into a giant western omelette,  Godzilla  outruns a flight of helicopters, and he seems to have trouble deciding just  how big he really is.  Still, the inconsistencies fade aware in the sheer  fun of the  chase and, after all, isn't that why we watch movies?  It's not  a classic, but its worth the price of admission (or purchase!).
B000002L75|4.0|By the time I picked up this album, I'd already heard the songs Somebody, Master and Servant, Blasphemous Rumours, and People are People on other releases so there wasn't much new material here.  It's clear to me that  those are the best songs from the album with People are People and Somebody  being my favorites.  However, there's something about the two Alan Wilder  penned tunes I've heard (If You Want and Work Hard) that I really like.   Are there any other DM songs he's written?  Those songs have made me  interested in seeing what his &quot;Recoil&quot; project is like (although  I'm sure it will be quite different).<br />Anyway, if you're looking for  &quot;Something to Do&quot;, I suggest you buy this album.  It's especially  worth the price if you haven't already gotten &quot;Catching Up With  Depeche Mode&quot; or &quot;Singles: 81-85&quot;.
0140042520|5.0|I loved every inch of this book. Like &quot;On The Road&quot; it beautifully captures a time that was different, a time that was safer but also beginning to crumble at the foundations. The book tells the journey of  young Ray Smith, an ambitious man on the road. It also highlights  &quot;Dharma Bum&quot; Japhy Ryder, a sort of hero in the eyes of the  narrator, a true icon. Kerouac was an amazing and simple writer and he will  forever be remembered for his wonderful stories, many of which hit  uncomfortably close to home...
B000002HRE|5.0|I cant say that this is a great album. All I can say is that it is different! Im not afraid of change like most other metallica fans. Im sticking by them to the death! This album is not as bad as some people say. For example the Unforgiven 2 is one to remember and Fuel along with Devils  Dance are not bad either. This is the worst metallica album to date but  still is great. Metallica is just exploring different types of music moving  on from a plain bore thrash!! METALLICA WILL RETURN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000021XR5|5.0|This is an incredible CD.  I have thoroughly enjoyed playing these tunes for the past week.  Yeah, the lyrics are a bit weird what with Weiland's everlasting battle with Heroin.   The music, however, thrives with abundant energy, tasteful economy, and Weiland's harmonic, melodic vocals have never  been better.  I rate this as the hard rock album of the year.  It also  contains some beautiful ballads like &quot;Sour Girl&quot;. Even Rolling  Stone gave it three stars and they don't exactly have a love affair with  the band. Also, check out the interview with the band in Raygun.  Let's  hope Weiland can be back with the guys for a tour next year.
B000002H97|4.0|This is a great album. But I like LOAD AND RELOAD even more than it!  You get sick of these songs in 1 week and you will never listen to them again. The only exeptions are The unforgiven and Nothing else matters which  are timeless classics.
0440224764|5.0|&quot;The Partner&quot; is Grisham at his best. Patrick's planning was just too meticulous. I agree with a fellow reader's comment on how Grisham himself must be scheming his life.. (just kidding.. no matter what you  sceme Mr. Grisham just have writing books in your agenda..!) But a lesson  must be learnt, and that is don't ever let go of all your knowledge like  Patrick did. Patrick's lady love learnt from her master and betrayed her  master him self giving him a taste of his own medicine. Everything about  this book was excellent..!
0767821629|5.0|I would recomend.  One of my favorite movies of the year.  Really makes you think.
0783211856|5.0|I am not an enormous fan of Speilberg's work as a whole, but there is no denying that this is the classic cinematic work of the century. I've probably seen this masterpiece five or six times over the years and the  emotions never fade.
B00000K19E|2.0|My favorite reviews here are the ones that go something like:<br />&quot;So, like, it made me think or something about, like, what is reality? This movie is so real because, like, you never know, you know. And there's all  these computers and stuff?&quot;<br />Dude! You are soooo right!<br />Worst  script ever? Quite possibly. Extremely flat character development. Naive  premises. Non-stop nonsequiturs. PokeMon for growed-ups: make the plot so  tangled and arcane that the viewer is so fill with a sense of  accomplishment simply by being able to follow the plot hierarchy that they  never notice that it goes... nowhere. <br />PokeMon!
6303014100|4.0|Gettysburg is a good movie, quite faithful to the book &quot;Killer Angels&quot; on which it is based.  The author of &quot;Killer Angels&quot; states in his book that his work is NOT intended to be a precise historical  reference.  Instead, it is a great story, based on historical events with a  fair amount of poetic license.  <br />The movie is a great visual experience.  Literally thousands of volunteer re-enactors participated in the making of  the film.  These fellows would be the first to tell you that the movie is a  &quot;historical novel&quot; and not a precise re-enactment. But, that  said, no movie I have ever seen is Gettysburgs equal on the subject.   Perhaps &quot;Glory&quot; comes close.<br />I recommend this movie to all.
B000002KO3|5.0|Excellent production (pity it's not remastered, though), excellent musicians and excellent songs.<br />So I'd have to say the whole thing is, er, 'excellent'...
6305076626|3.0|I cant figure this movie out! I watched it on halloween at a friends house. He thought it was the most awesomeist movie but i didnt! Just depends on what movies you like i guess. I think this movie is like  &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; its stupid but funny. I think it could be a  must see though! So watch it.
B000002H33|5.0|I think Master of Puppets is an excellent album with good structure and lyrics. Every song tells a story about drug addiction and the insane asylum. I think the album is falsely labeled &quot;heavy metal&quot; because the guitars are crisp and the lyrics are understandable. It is  harder hard rock with melodic undertones. I first heard the album in '92  when I was 12 and I have loved it ever since. The guitar structure to  &quot;Orion&quot; is amazing and &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; is cool. Buy  it. Peace!
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is the first CD I've bought by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and it will definatly not be the last.  I'm going to but all of their previous CD's.  This CD has a wonderful range of music.  All of the songs are perfect.     Flea and John are magical together, especially in &quot;Parallel  Universe&quot;  Anthony's voice souunds terrific.  Chad  tops it off with  his own style.  I would highly recomend this CD to anyone.  My favorite  song is &quot;Californication&quot;.  This is the best CD I own!   Go out  and buy it!
1570427496|4.0|After reading both The Notebook and Message in a Bottle with such enthusiasm, I couldn't wait for A Walk in the Park.  Sparks does a terrfic job of getting your full attention and keeping it til the very and at that  point wanting more, more, more!  It was a more touching story of first  loves than the previous 2 that were deeply detailed with loves thoughts and  actions.  I can't wait for the next
B00002MZ2C|5.0|With songs like Broken Man, Maria, Sleep Now in the Fire, Guerilla Radio and Testify this album is by far better than Evil Empire. Althought the self titled is the best this ablum still rocks and wont dissapoint rage  fans.
B0000041DF|5.0|These are live performances with such brilliance and vitality as to dazzle one's senses. The soloist is in full command of the music and her headlong rush and aggressive style in both pieces makes this a wonderful virtuoso  disc.
B000001GQD|5.0|There is a lot that can be disputed about this performance of Rachmaninoff's 2nd piano concerto. And I will concede immediately that Richter takes his artistic license to its extremes in this reading of the work. But I will also insist that without taking away from so many other  fine performances by other gifted soloists, this performance is  breathtaking in its artistry, and deserves to be heard for its unique  interpretation.
6302906636|4.0|After several years I've finally had the chance to see Highlander again and it still remains one of my all-time favorite movies. Sure, compared to what we're used to nowadays, it may be a bit cheesy. But for the 1980's,  the storyline and the effects were great. The only problem with the VHS  version, and the only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, was the missing  World War II scene which introduces us to Rachel and to the beautiful  phrase: &quot;It's a kind of magic.&quot; which, in Europe, is included in  all videos and not just in the Director's cut.    And, in response to a  viewer from Minnesota...Christopher Lambert's accent is French as he is a  Frenchman who started off in movies in his homeland before hitting it big  as Connor Mcleod from the clan Mcleod.
068484267X|5.0|I loved this book.  Not because Frank McCourt and I share an Irish history, but inspite of it.  It was a truely riveting book, that makes one not only think of how good you have had, but realize how bad he truely did  have it.  His accomplishment is all the more diserved because of what he  has experienced.  It is only a shame that his mother did not live to see  it.  Great work Mr. McCourt
B00000K3UR|5.0|Laugh,cry,love and then laugh again.It was his best movie yet
B00000J7SO|3.0|&quot;Is Your Love In Vain?&quot; is one of Bob's best tunes, bar none.  The rest of the album is mediocre to OK.
B000002BE9|5.0|The first time i heard of fiona apple was the video crimnal. I knew then i had to have the cd. Crimainal is just one of the wonderful songs on Tidal. This cd is one of my favorites. The lyrics make you think about your values  and morals to the world. I love this cd. I recomend it for all music  lovers.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is my personal favorite Beatles album. It carries the energy of their early work and the deeper feeling of their later albums. It has an excellent assortment of music, and is a great example of the Beatles at  their best. It shows the music of the Beatles at a time when they were  beginning to experiment with new recording techniques and instrumental  ideas. A brilliant album.
0792838084|5.0|Why isn't this amazing film released in DVD yet? Let's go! I'll pay top dollar.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The battle of Los Angeles is heavy and hard. This album represents Rage but at a different approach from pervous works. Surely filling the listener with energy and aggression Rage has done it again. Although this album is  not as heavy as expected it still can make you jump around like a crazy  bomb waiting to go off. I give this album 5 stars and would reccomend it to  anyone! Rock on
6305499365|5.0|This has easily become one of my favourite movies to watch!   Non-stop, real-life humor make this a hilarious trip through corporate office life.  No matter what you do for a living, there's something in this movie that  you can relate to.  The two best characters are Milton and  Lumbergh...they're so funny I wish a CD could be released simply filled  with everything they say in this movie.  Mike Judge sure knew what he was  doing when he made this (and he's pretty funny as the Chochtkie's  restaurant manager, too!)  Don't buy it now at its current $103 price --  rent it instead.  When the price drops -- then buy it!
6301008960|5.0|This movie has some great laughs.  It is romantic. It relates somewhat to high school and is very enjoyable to watch.  If you are having a bad day, get Can't Buy Me Love and you'll feel better.
B00002DE0S|5.0|This performance is the realization of a 20-year dream by conductor/soloist Zimerman, himself the 1975 Grand Prize winner of the International Chopin Competition in Warsaw. His dream was to tour and  perform the two concerti for the 150th anniversary of Chopin's death in  1849, with a hand-picked Polish-only orchestra. Nearly 400 audition tapes  were submitted, out of which he picked the very best 57 young performers. I  have heard them perform this program live at Mechanics Hall in Worcester  MA, as well as on CD, and both are incredible musical experiences. This  recording shows, far more than any other I've heard, Chopin's ardor for the  beautiful but unattainable young soprano Constancia Gladkowska.<br />The  playing is other-worldly. For example, in the second movement of the F  minor, the strings enter with a sound that appears to have no beginning, as  though it were there since the beginning of time. The result is  transporting. Whatever your age, you are 19 again (as Chopin was,) and  passionately, hopelessly in love with someone you cannot have.<br />Buy this  CD but before listening, make sure the shades are drawn, and that all cares  are set aside. This is a trip (don't we all wish it were a one-way trip!)  into the world of perfect, imagined love.
0380789019|5.0|Wonderful, spellbinding, magical, enthralling, entrancing.  Neil Gaiman's astonishing &quot;Neverwhere&quot; is all these and more. Pick it up today... but mind the Gap!
B00000IFWE|3.0|Are you a Petty fan, but can't decide whether to buy Echo?  Well, I loved the past few releases (especially Wildflowers), but I didn't love the first few singles off this album - Free Girl Now, Room at the Top.  I like them,  but not enough to run to the nearest record store.  Well, needless to say I  finally got it and can't stop kicking myself for missing out on months of  listening to this very good album.
B00000J2KX|3.0|I give this movie three stars because I enjoy it every time I see it... but for the wrong reasons. This movie never scared me. The pacing is normal for a Kubrick movie; verrrrry slow. That technique works in his other films  but it doesn't work here. Everyone in this film except for the kid acts  like they are on lithium. And as good as the little boy  is in this film, I  was chuckling at the moment in the film when there were quick intercuts  between the kid shaking violently, and the old dead lady rising out of the  bathtub with campy laughter. I just didn't buy it. And watching Nicholson  go insane was HILARIOUS. His facial expressions were a riot.... especially  during his now famous lines; &quot;Herrrrrrrrreeees Johnny!&quot;  &quot;Wendy, I'm home!&quot; &quot;Little pigs, little pigs, let me  in!&quot; I know they were meant to spook, but I split my gut as I laughed.  This movie is a classic, just for the Nicholson scenes alone.
B000020617|5.0|yeah , this is their best cd out of the three   by far...a combination of the first two on a  higher level...plus you get a cool fake tatoo  in the cd case...and when you play the cd in  your computer some really really  awsome stuff  happens.  get this, it's totally worth it, if  your a fan or  not.
B000002LBH|5.0|If you like Morrissey's singing voice and the way he sounded during the years he was with the Smiths, this album will not disappoint you in the least. It's an album comprised of a large number of songs all of which  sounding like true hits. This was the first album I heard from the Smiths  back in 1994 and it definitely made me a convert. So I highly recommend  this album, recognizing how huge their contribution was musically during  the 1980's.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I first heard the song &quot;Here With Me&quot; from &quot;Roswell&quot;....my favorite tv show....which has no bearing to the music...So I tried to find who sang this song...first I thought it was  Sarah McLachlan, so I sampled every song of hers on Amazon, couldn't find  it...then I looked for all the &quot;Roswell&quot; sites and finally found  who did the theme, I bought the CD, and it was absolutely fantastic...of  course I am partial to the first song, but the rest of the CD is Fab u  lous....Dido has a beautiful voice, and honestly I feel she edges Sarah out  in the music department! An absolutely beautiful CD!
6302816556|5.0|Bruce Lee's presence in this film is utterly stunning, as his physical dynamic completely mesmorizes the viewer, and transends into a state of pure spiritual energy before our eyes. His embodiment, emotions and spirit  are boundlessly portrayed and demonstrate what one is capable of.
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater fan or not, this album is one of the best I have heard from anyone.  Takes a couple of times through for the songs to really grow on you, but now I find these songs follow me around in my head.  I rate this a  must buy album for any rock fan!
B000007OY0|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A lot of the reviews from people who didn't like it say it's predictable (what movie today isn't), and that predictability allows you to sit back and enjoy the conversations  that Andy and Red and the rest of the characters are having.  <br />The Movie  is not about somebody trying to get out of prison. It's about a man  overcoming the greatest obstacle in his life and never giving up.<br />I think  most people who found it boring have an attention span about as long as  goldfish.<br />If you didn't like it the first time, I suggest you rent it  again and watch it with an open mind and enjoy a true work or Art in Story  telling.
B000020617|5.0|My first exposure to the Foo Fighters was the song &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; and I am hooked.  I bought the album and am impressed with their talent and style .  I am looking forward to getting previous recordings and  to future releases.
0767809246|5.0|This movie helps you relive your childhood, but only if you were born before 1980, when you had to create your adventures.  Today kids, sit in front of computer and play video games or watch TV all summer.<br />The only  problem I have with this Movie is the vomiting scene, I have a weak  stomach.
068484267X|5.0|If anyone would ask me a recomendation for a book - this is it! Great story, that took me only 3 days to read. It was hard to put the book down.  Even though many times family had little or no food to eat, I understand  that most people in Ireland did not live this way. It was a good read and  gave me another look what powerty can really be.
B00000BKDS|5.0|Van Halen saved us from disco,But Iron Maiden blew punk out of the water. This cd along with KILLERS is a must have for any rocker. Their debut album,although it's not the best produced of the bunch. Thats ok. First off  Iron Maiden is the last of the &quot;own personality&quot;rock bands that  there ever will be.(Black Sabbath,Led Zeppelin,Deep Purple)The first album  not only shows us Iron Maiden smokes.But if you got to see 'em on this  tour.Opening for KISS,UFO. You can tell, They were not being defiant. what  you got to see was men who had the courage of their convictions. And that  my freind is what comes out of their first two cd's. Also now that they  have been remasterd with added tracks.(Maiden, always giving the best.) If  you have a multible CD machine at home and love to push &gt;RANDUM  BUTTON&lt;. You have to place their FIRST ALBUM next to KILLERS. They  belong together. You can't have one without the other. Period. Makes a  great x-mas gift to. Goes great with Judas Priest/British Steel. Just  thought you needed to know that.  THANKS!  &quot;UP THE HAMMERS!&quot;  P.S. This is also the last album ever released,you could just  look at the cover and tell &quot;I'll just bet this is a rocken'  record! &quot; After this 80 percent of the bands coming out. Well, Lets  just say the covers were better than the music. Just look around and you  can still see. There are still only a handfull of people putting out  quality music. It has always been that way and always will be. That means  the best is yet to come. THANK GOD FOR ROCK &amp; ROLL!  10 STARS.
6305470448|5.0|OK, SPR and Elizabeth geeks.  Get over the Oscars.  Who cares what is called &quot;Best Picture&quot;?  How many of them have you agreed with, anyway?  Shakespeare In Love is one of those movies that I will watch time  and time again.  I put it up there with &quot;Godfather&quot;  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; &quot;Duck Soup&quot; etc. etc. on my top 10.   (p.s.  not a chick.  love action films.  deal with it.)
630339406X|5.0|Very imaginative, well-made comedy about a young boy who got tired of his subordinate role and wished for (and received) the chance to live like an adult.  This is really the first of Tom Hanks' better roles;  &quot;Big&quot; proved to everyone his talent belongs in movies and would  be wasted in TV shows like &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|When I first listened to this cd I was a little let down because it had very differnt sound compared to their privious albums, but the more I listen to it the more I like it all the songs are solid with lost of new  beats like gurrilla radio and born of a broken man you gotta buy it
6304233639|2.0|This flick appears to be a high-budget remake of the George Pal 1953 film &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;.  An expensive outlay of cash for advertising led people into the theaters pretty much the same way a judas goat leads  the innocent lambs up the slaughtering ramp.  It's the same old worn-out  plot of extraterrestrials attempting to seize our planet by force.  If  these aliens had the technology to build and maneuver intergalactic  spaceships and use weapons to destroy civilizations on a global scale,  don't you think they would have made improvements on their  evolutionarily-primitive anatomy and physiology?  Also, if these creatures  had common sense as developed as their technology, instead of exterminating  us to extinction, they would have made an attempt to subjugate us to a life  of captivity and exploit us as a food source (like the Kanamits did in the  Twilight Zone episode &quot;To Serve Man&quot;.  The extraordinarty special  effects are the only thing saving this movie from complete mediocrity and a  comparison to &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;.
B000021XS0|5.0|I beleive this is Dream Theater's best CD. (Yes, even better than Images and Words)  It is full of emotion, mixed in with intense riffs, and crazy time signatures.  La brie shines and Rudess is a great improvment over  Sherinian.  The single &quot;Home&quot; gives me goosbumps.  Not only are  the songs full of talented guitar solo's of john petrucii, but the songs  can be appreciated and enjoyed by all.  This CD can only be described as a  masterpiece.
0802130208|5.0|A co-worker recommended this book saying that it was the best he had ever read--and re-read. Intrigued, I looked it up here, and ordered it. I just now finished it and I am still shaking my head in wonder and amazement.  Incredibly funny and down right sad at times with a cast of characters and  situations that left me wanting a second book. Sadly, that will never be.  This book is a gem.
0399143904|5.0|Timely in view of the threat of terrorism today. The scene with the little girl in the wheel chair is heartbreaking. Clancy makes us aware of those who put their lives on the line to circumvent thugs like these terrorists.
B000001FOS|5.0|The collaboration of Joe Lynn Turner and Yngwie Malmsteen make this album a classic in my book.  The songs are perfectly crafted, which says a lot for an artist who is known as a guitar virtuoso, but a mediocre songwriter.   In fact, this is the only album by Yngwie Malmsteen where the songs are  equal in appeal to his guitar mastery.<br />From the opening cut to the final  note, this album is a winner.  The prerequisite themes of dragons, fire and  medieval times are touched on, but not with the frequency of Yngwie's other  albums such as Marching Out and Trilogy.  Instead, Joe Lynn Turner tempers  Yngwie's &quot;mystical&quot; view with a little romanticism that plays  very well on this release.  &quot;Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Now is the  Time&quot; are probably the best examples of this blend, while &quot;Heaven  Tonight&quot; is possibly the most overproduced and dated of all of the  tracks.  &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot; screams &quot;...made for radio.&quot;  <br />The vocal performance is outstanding, the musicianship is top notch, and  the work as a whole definitely deserves five stars.  Bravo!  Encore!
0553565915|5.0|This book was an inspiration to both me and also my mother.  When my brother committed suicide 2 years ago Nov.25, we were having a very hard time coping with it(and still are today) but, this book reminds us that  everything happens for a reason and although suicide is very wrong, I still  feel that he is with our Lord receiving the love and comfort he needs.  We  both read this book often to help us feel better.  Thank you so much for  deciding to share this wonderful experience.<br />Angel Stam
B000001FDQ|5.0|This is the quintessential guitar album.  There are six instumentals here, eight tracks in all.  This would be worth the price of admission for the six instrumental tracks alone.  This album is that good!<br />Yngwie Malmsteen  exploded onto the rock scene with this album (after a few indy label albums  with hand picked bands).  His performance here earned him the title of  guitar god as teenage &quot;wanna be virtuosos&quot; threw away their  copies of Van Halen One, only to plug a Fender Strat into a Marshall amp  and try to wail away to a new flavor of guitar rock.<br />These cuts still  sound fresh today.  Yngwie was the neo-classical innovator.  No other  album, including his subsequent releases, have lived up to this one.  If  you enjoy classical music or great guitar, you have to buy this album.
B0000029DD|5.0|i had never heard of jeff buckley, as i tend to hide out in my room alot, but thank you amazon.com for your recommendations, i listened to the song clips and bought Grace without hestitation. his voice will make you weak in  the knees, your heart will be twisted into knots, that is what happens to  me every time i hear his beautiful voice
B00000K3UR|4.0|i enjoy it because it was a family movie. i got and add to receive a Free video or Music Title from your company and under 15.00 dollars . how do i get one of these . I refer video.
6304775636|5.0|I really love this movie.It has a good story to it.I love all the songs on it.James Woods did a great job as Hades.I watch this movie all the time.It's my favorite Disney Movie Ever!
B00000JCB2|1.0|What did we do to deserve this?  I sure hope these guys don't die in a plane crash or choke on their own vomit.
6302860253|5.0|I saw the movie when it came out, and have had the tape for years.  Filmed in Spain, the settings are authentic and beautiful.  Migenes-Johnson is a terrific Carmen.  Domingo's a bit wooden, but in great voice.  I'm waiting  for the DVD, and will buy it the moment it appears.
B00002MZ2C|3.0|While their lyrics remain socialist garbage, musically, it is pretty good.  While not anywhere near as good as their first album, it's a good listen.  If you're a RATM fan, you've probably already bought this, otherwise, get  someone else's copy to listen to first, then make up your mind.
B000002JOH|1.0|This is probably one of the most overrated metal CDs around, buy THE most overrated metal band on Earth. To Andy U from LA, who do you think you are? Metallica hasn't sold out 1 bit. I agree though that Slayer and Sepultura  are great, loud, and heavy, like Metallica. But Pantera stands out as the  worst excuse for a metal band. Just listen to the appropriatly titled  Vulgar Display Of Power and know what I mean. Phil Anselmo's vocals are  never good at all. Dimebag's guitars are tasteless. Go buy a better band if  you want real metal. ThanX! <br />P.S., Nirvana rules too!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This CD is one of the all time greatest.  Rage has proven many times before that they know how to please the crowd.  The Battle of Los Angeles is the best yet.  Tom Morello has found some new skills on the guitar and  puts them to good use while still making the same haunting melodies.  Zack  de la Rocha's aptitude for lyrics has made itself apparent once again, Tim  C's beats keep the music flowing, and Brad Wilk's basslines put heavy  emphasis into every song.  If you like to rock out, buy this!
B00000255F|5.0|I was given &quot;Born to Run&quot; as a birthday gift by the first love of my life over 15 years ago and it not only turned me on to Bruce, but it changed me forever.  This album was the epitomy of everything we were  feeling and wishing for at the time - love, innocence, hope, freedom, the  desire to escape and be on our own.  From &quot;Thunder Road&quot; to  &quot;Born to Run&quot; to &quot;Jungleland&quot; and all the unbelievable  songs in between, Bruce and the guys captured our hearts and souls.  I  still have that LP (although I can't play it anymore), as well as the CD  version, which is well on its way to also being worn out.  From the first  strains of &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, I am transported back to that first  love and the simpler time we grew up in. I have all of Bruce's music and  each album evokes special feelings and memories, but &quot;Born to  Run&quot; is by far my favorite.
B000002MNR|5.0|Mark Knopfler is one of the best guitarist in the world. His work always makes me relaxed. I would really recommend this particular Cd because it is more than wonderful. Sometimes I still do not believe how people can write  such a beatuiful music. Anyway, thank you Mark.
0385493622|4.0|Grandiose title aside, I found this to be an entertaining book. I particularly enjoyed reading about the various mathematical players throughout history who had an impact on Fermat's Last Theorem. I felt the  excitement of Wiles' announcement, almost as if I'd been there myself  during the event. And this was accomplished throughout without letting the  narrative get bogged down with heavy mathematics.<br />The Appendices were  very appropriate, in that they expanded on some mathematical concepts  mentioned in the text, while not distracting from the novel-like quality of  the story. I felt, however, that Singh did not go quite far enough with  this idea, when it comes to some of the higher mathematical concepts  ultimately employed in the solution of the Fermat problem. An appendix or  two giving the merest hint of what some of these techniques were about  would have been helpful.<br />I would also have welcomed some additional  speculation concerning whether or not Fermat actually did have a proof, as  he had claimed. Since Wiles' proof depended on such advanced 20th-century  mathematical techniques, obviously the 17th-century Fermat, if he did have  a proof, would have had a much different one. Singh devotes only three  short paragraphs to this fascinating question.<br />I enjoyed this book very  much. It makes me want to see the Nova program &quot;The Proof&quot;,  directed and coproduced by Singh.
6304504012|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it, and just saw it again on video. This is one of the most under-rated films of the decade. Hollywood just doesn't  like Madonna, which resulted in this  wonderfully-acted film being unfairly snubbed by critics and the Oscar  establishment. Despite the presence of half the population of Argentina as  extras, this is essentially an intimate story that rides on the  performances of the three principals--Evita, Peron, and Che. Although  Madonna's voice isn't quite up to some of the vocal challenges, her  performance is otherwise on the mark. Antonio Banderas surprised me--his  somewhat gritty vocal quality is totally appropriate to his character as a  peasant revolutionary. Nobody smolders better. His feelings for Evita were  intriguingly ambiguous; it was fascinating to watch him veer from hope to  contempt to something close to sexual attraction. And Jonathan Pryce is one  of the premier musical theater artists of this era. What he does with the  rather underwritten part of Peron is a joy to see. Watch his performance of  &quot;She is a Diamond&quot;--two minutes of subtle, superb acting with  voice, face, body--absolutely wonderful. It seems that most of the  naysayers saw the show on Broadway and find the movie a poor comparison.  Each should be taken on their own terms. Patti LuPone is undoubtedly  stronger vocally than Madonna, but you have to give the latter credit for  taking on a huge challenge and (mostly) pulling it off. And I never thought  Mandy Patinkin's light tenor was right for Che--Banderas, though not half  the singer Patinkin is, has an earthy vocal quality that works better in  this role. I recommend this movie highly for all lovers of musical theater.
B000002UAR|5.0|My father was a huge Beatles fan when I was a kid, and he played them  constantly.  This is not the reason I'm a Beatles fan though...this is the  reason I HATED the Beatles up until he stopped playing them at about age  13.  He played a lot of the compilations and greatest hits collections,  which consisted of sappy love songs and childish sing-a-longs like  Maxwell's Silver Hammer, Octopuss' Garden, and yes, even YELLOW SUBMARINE.   I consistently cited the Beatles, whenever anyone asked me, as not only the  most overrated band of all time, but the worst band of all time,  period.<br />Then one night, driving in the car, age 17, I heard a song which  caught my attention on the radio which consisted of an orchestra and lyrics  speaking of &quot;all the lonely people.&quot;  At it's close, I thought to  myself that it was a beautiful, poignant song, and I had to find out what  the name was and who had sung it so that I could praise them as geniuses.   Long and behold, when I heard it was Eleanor Rigby by the Beatles, imagine  my surprise.  &quot;The Beatles!?&quot; picturing the mop-tops incessantly  chanting &quot;She Loves You&quot; on Ed Sullivan's stage.  My entire  perspective changed that night on what I otherwise considered an overrated,  teeny-bopper band from the sixties.  I immedietely bought Revolver,  thinking Eleanor RIgby would be the one good song on it, but, low and  behold, all the songs were good, and even the dreaded Yellow Submarine  started to grow on me, though I still agree it's a childish  sing-a-long.<br />Revolver is the album that transformed the Beatles from my  most hated band to my most loved band.  It is a shamelessly flawless album,  and after listening to this album I went back to early albums and forward  to later albums, and this by far stands as their best, and an important  turning point of their career as the band that sells because they make  girls scream to the band that sells because they were the most innovative,  creative,and downright best band to have ever graced the face of the  Earth.
B000002LEM|4.0|Abandoning the fat keyboard layers of the previous '5150'record,Van Halen returned in 1988 with a leaner and meaner formula that comes vey close to the iconoclasm of their albums in the seventies.Hagar sings with power and  conviction;there's a great interaction between all members of the band  giving this unusual album a very pleasant live feel.Very tasty,this is one  of their best albums .
B00000J7J4|1.0|Absolutley the worst garbage to hit the musice industry since ricky martin, the backdoor boys, and n sick. what next...
B00000IO4J|1.0|The only part of this movie worth watching is the \\"pool chase\\" scene...that is if you can can get beyond the idiocy of that humoungous of a \\"queen\\" alien hiding herself in that body.  Overall shallow  plotting, D-U-M-B stereoptypical characters with the blatently requisite  \\"cute\\" factor, and too many holes on the explaining the alien  (WHY didn't it just go live in our ocean?   Would it have even have  had a concept of landbased intelligence coming from the world it [o so  briefly] described?  OR a desire to conquor? )  A good movie to balance  your checkbook by.
1558807381|4.0|No other movie creates a fantasy-world so stunningly beautiful that even the &quot;ugly&quot; parts of the movie are breathtaking.  I have seen this movie several times and certain elements have stuck with me: Tim Curry's  portrayal as the &quot;Dark Prince&quot; is probably the most frightening  conception of Satan that I have ever seen, he is horrifying, disturbing,  but surprisingly sympathetic and even attractive; the cinematography is  gorgeous--&quot;Legend&quot; shows you what it would look like if Spring  preceeded Fall by one day (e.g., flower petals showering and carpeting the  ground like snow); the dialog and the acting is child-like and simple, but  not too cheesy. I hate to dub it a &quot;family movie,&quot; so I won't.   However, it is the perfect movie for a family because the themes and dialog  are digestable for children, but there is enough spectacle and substance  for the adults.
0688156819|5.0|You don't need to like dark things in order to like this dark book. You don't even need to be  gloomy or sad to read it. This book is just brilliant. It's innocent and child-like tales will transport you to another  level of imagination. You will sympathize with the poor creatures in this  book, because they need to be loved too. You will smile and laugh and  empathize. I highly recommend giving this book as a gift. Everyone i have  lent it to, including corporate execs--really liked it.  I also highly  recommend &quot;Lenore: Noogies&quot; by Roman Dirge for something similar  in terms of art and storyline, which Tim Burton also praises.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The Lyrics are sooo significant, the music is sooooo good, you cant beat it. Its is unbelievable and definitly worth the o so long wait. War within a breath is textbook power bass driven hard hitting rage and is by far my  favorite song, it has a significant first ending and re-explodes back with  Tom playing the hardest bass you'll ever hear. My only Complaint is in the  dynamics of the Mixing, every thing is recorded pretty much at one level.  But the band takes music to new height, its a true masterpiece, deep in its  lyrical and musical texture. Zacks rhymes are more significant and hard  hitting than ever, going where most wouldn't dare. Ashes in the fall and  Born of A BrokenMan bring Rage into some ne uncharted territory with  somewhat softer and different sounds. I think that Ashes in the fall is  there most interesting song ever. Obviously Guerrilla Radio is a great  song. But the album is much deeper than the hard hitting hit single.  Mic-Check a heavily rap oriented track is in my top 3 favorite songs on the  album. Its unique lyrics and interesting Eerily echoed sounds make it a  song you'll never get tired of. There is too much to say about this album  than to put in a mere 1000 words, so i'll just stop here. My advice, order  it here or get your a$$ to the store and buy it. This is a true masterpiece  from the coolest and greatest band ever!
6304578458|5.0|I really enjoyed the dark nature of this movie, not only was it fantastically funny, but it made you think. That is the best part of a movie, the way you continue to think about it after it is finished. You  could really watch this over and over without getting tired of it!  If you  buy it there will be no regrets, I promise!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Amazing Album, it has some class songs. But real rage is found on the first album (self titled) and the second is good to &quot;evil empire&quot;, if you are just getting into rage get the first 2 albums  first, they are not &quot;old&quot; they are invincible and dont die, i  have listened to them over and over and each time a new lyric sparks my  imagination. Best to is buy all 3 albums!
B000002O1Q|5.0|Movie was a sleeper that shouldv'e been a box office smash, the music is what made the movie. 5 stars for the soundtrack
B0000214F3|5.0|I loved this movie for its quiet elegance and ability to evoke strong feelings. Brad Pitt is overwhelmingly beautiful and affecting and he has real chemistry with Miss Forlani. The scenes with Anthony Hopkins made me wish that he could exist in the real world. Some of the scenes didn't ring true or were a little far fetched. But I see films to be affected by them and this movie made me think about my life and my actions and realize that it is an incredible gift to be here.
B0000062Y2|3.0|This soundtrack is my favorite. I have the LP (since I was 8 years old), then I bought the CD and I was anxious to get the reemastered quality. I did and I was furious and disappointed. I work at a major Internatinal  Record Label in Mexico and we've had a 100% better results with (I'm sure)  a more deteriorated source. Remastering is not just about taking away the  &quot;hiss&quot; and rising the volume; it's about having the right  equipment, the right engineer and spending lots of hours experimenting and  sampling to take away the noise and improving the quality. I really got  furious when I listened to both CDs at the same time to compare. <br />Don't  buy it if you have the previous CD!
B00000IP2L|5.0|Got this cd, didn't listen much at first... Then saw Zakk at the Whiskey in LA... Zakk blew everybody away!  This album gets better every time you listen, especially if you love guitar! A must-get if you like Zakk's other  work. Only regret is that No More Tears isn't on it live... that's what  Zakk closed with live. (Better than Ozzy)!
B000001F46|2.0|Either this or Carnival of Souls is the least listenable of KISS's huge vault.  This one like COS had Kiss getting away from their sound and dabbling into what everyone else was doing at the time which was Disco here  and grunge with COS.  Ace's song's except Save Your Love (his worst Kiss   song) are good and Paul's I was made for Loving you and Magic Touch are  good songs but recorded in disco fashion.  I was Made rocked on Alive 3,  I'd love to see them do that to Magic Touch also.  Gene is missing in  action with only two songs.  They went soft again with the following  Unmasked, but that one is still better than this one.  Peter's song aint  bad - atleast it wasn't Beth2 or HardER Luck Woman.
B00000J7S8|5.0|I stumbled onto Ms. Krall while surfing late night TV. I was completely seduced with every song. She is a major talent in voice and at the keyboard.
B000000OMB|5.0|This first CD from the &quot;Supergroup of the 80s&quot; was absolutely brilliant. This group of musicians who were with awesome bands in the 70s, then created a rock masterpiece that sold over 8 million copies.  Every  song is crisp, energitic and filled with first-class musicianship.  This  album produced two top singles &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; and  &quot;Only Time Will Tell,&quot; but some of the other tracks shine even  brighter.  John Wetton is a powerful and passionate lead singer; Steve Howe  may be rocks most versatile and capable guitarist; Carl Palmer is also one  of history's greatest drummers; and relative youngster Geoff Downes adds  layers of keyboard work that sounds as fresh today as it did in 1982.  This  CD is a MUST for any rock, progressive or 80s music fan.  But with 8  million copies out there... you probably own it. Just make sure you have  the CD, not the tape or LP. This music never gets old. I hope you agree!
B000001EL7|5.0|Great disk.  I stole Your Love, Shock Me, Love Gun, Plaster Caster, Almost Human, and Christine 16 really rock.  Please add Plaster Caster to Alive 4, guys.  The rest of the disk works too.  Hooligan's kind of silly but it's over quickly and the And then She Kissed me song works well also.
B00000IGGA|5.0|waits' finally does it on this recording! how the hell anyone could concievably combine all the twisted aspects to the musical vision he has been blessing us with over the last twenty plus years is almost mind  numbing when you think of it. The coffeehouse folk of his early career (and  the great material it yeilded), the amazing blues-jazz of the late  seventies (and some shows I shall never forget, THE GAS PUMPS)! Then we  veer into the experimental - still hints of his old self - but here he  shows genuine musical genius but maybe a bit less heart, but still more  than enough to get by. I am a fan of the great ballads, so obviously, I am  delighted with this recording. I'm,listening to Hold On as I type. Ranks  with Tom T's Blues, Jersey Girl - better - &quot;she closed her eyes and  started......swaying, but it's so hard to dance that way, when it's cold  and there's no music&quot;, man, I really love this song. here are only a  handful of genuine lyric and stylistic masters around, and sadly, I don't  see anyone bringing up the new guard, relative to the kind of vision waits  represents, there's this guy johnny dowd who is kinda working sorta around  waits' turf, but jeez, NOBODY does it like Waits.  Jazz/poetry/folk/alternative/rock/blues... mix it all up and you get Waits!  God bless him all to hell!
0671015206|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I too read alot of the one and two star reviews. No where in the book did I get the idea that one should live like Scrooge. Get knowledge, a good job, and live BELOW your means. <br />Too many  people so live, that three months without income and they're bankrupt. I  can tell by some of the reviewers that they have been brainwashed, with  many others, that consumption equals a good and happy life.
B000001ELD|2.0|Unfortunately this was done in 1978 when nearly all music was horrid.  Radioactive is fun and some of the stuff is ok.  I was on the floor laughing the first time I heard the lyrics 'I'm living in sin at the  Holiday Inn' because it was so stupid.  The music on the song was good  though.  Hearing Gene sing 'when you wish upon a star' is very painful.   Overall this album is just too slow - call me a purist but one slow Kiss  song a record is plenty.
B00002DE2L|2.0|Anne-Sophie Mutter is a marvelous artist, but not one born for the Baroque repertoire. This recording sounds too beefy for Vivaldi, textures are thick and the overall view is too romantic. Surprisingly, Mutter virtually  ignores what is going on in Baroque music these days. For the best 4  Seasons in the catalogue the choice is obviously Fabio Biondi and L' Europa  Galante on the OPUS111 label. For the Tartini Devil Sonata go for Andrew  Manze's superlative performance in Harmonia Mundi.
6300216039|5.0|This is THE Romeo and Juliet movie to see.  Leonard Whiting had all the girls swooning when this movie first came out.  That first shot of him in the movie, he took many a young girl's breath away.  Was he supposed to  resemble a young Lawrence Olivier?  Speaking of Olivier, he narrated this  movie.  Lets not forget Olivia Hussey.  She was a perfect Juliet.  This  version was special also, in that it was the first time that Romeo and  Juliet were going to be played by actors the same age as the characters are  supposed to be. Used to, they had older women playing Juliet.<br />This is a  first-class, brilliantly cast film.  I've seen a part of that newer version  with Leonardo DiCaprio.  What a piece of junk.  Graffiti, junkie cars, what  a mess.  If you want to see Romeo and Juliet the way Shakespeare would have  been proud, get this movie.
B0000026DJ|5.0|This is one of the best CD's ever made. Looking back, it's amazing that a song like &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; actually made it to the top 20 of the US charts. This CD is so full of passion and energy and genuine  emotion, yet it never becomes preachy or forced. This is the perfect CD to  take along on a long trip.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Saying this albums lyrics are too poetic and the guitar is too clever then giving it three stars shows that persons ignorance.Never the less this album is ****ING AWESOME! Tom isn't an amazing guitarist, he's God!Zack's lyrics shine through better than the other two albums.Brad and Y.Tim.K up  the fierce crash-n-bash funk and sound so cool.This album is so damn good  it's a better buy then paying $20 bucks for a car.To call this album  perfect is an understatement.
078322608X|4.0|What is it with Bruce Willis, he seems to like movies with numbers in: 5th element, 12 monkeys, 6th sense. Anyway, there were no moneys in this movie, so don't be mislead.
0060254920|1.0|I don't understand how this book is on the best seller's list. The illustrations are scary for young children. The educational value of this book is very negative. Instead of teaching of self discipline and respect  for authority, this book promotes disobedience and violence.  I know, for  years, it has received glowing reviews. I disagree with all of them. This  book entered the trash can the day it entered our home.
B00000IPAX|5.0|ONE WORD: ROCKS!   Blink182 is the best group out there! It's &quot;da bomb&quot;!  You gotta agree with me on this one! <br />Enama of the State! &lt;---- the BEST! <br />Love Ya!
B000020617|5.0|I've liked the Foo Fighters since their first album. I heard &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; on the radio and loved it. It had a good pace and great lyrics. The whole album is great. All the songs are catchy and Dave Grohls  vocals are outstanding. I recommend this album to anyone who likes music  that move you. Their are sad songs and fun songs. The video for &quot;Learn  to Fly&quot; on the enhanced part is hilarious. I'd give it six stars if I  could. buy it, you won't despair.
0385006896|2.0|This is a very cheaply designed volume of paste and cardboard, most of the really good editions of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; have gone out of print. Publishers today produce disposable junk, especially when there aren't many  readers in the U.S.A. the most illiterate country in the western world. The  Amazon reviewer is a liar which comes naturally from a corporation known  for graft, he also manages to compact political correctness while  dismissing these classic books as trivial at the same time.
0780622650|3.0|I know I'm in the minority, but I thought LIS was a lot of fun.  Yeah, the plot was full of cliches, but the cast did a good job and of course the fx (except for the unforgiveable monkey thing) were top-notch.  I think it  would have done better if it were released as a summer movie (the film came  out in April of 1998).  Why?  Because, in general, audiences are less  demanding of summer movies.  At the very least, Lost in Space is a good  family film.  And Matt LeBlanc was so great, I hope he'll get another  chance to show a more serious side in another movie.<br />Lost In Space was  hardly perfect, but it's also not nearly as bad as many people would have  you believe.
B0000000LI|5.0|Wow!  This CD is absolutely amazing.  I like Yanni's studio synthesized recordings...but i LOVE his live performances even more.  This CD is the only one that i own where i can put it on and let it run from beginning to  end without skipping any tracks.  The live version of Santorini is without  a doubt the best song that has ever hit my ears.  If you liked the studio  recordings of Yanni, then you will love the live recordings!  The only song  that its missing to make it 100% perfect is Marching Season...but its still  great even without it!
0393039765|5.0|I must admit, I saw the movie first.  The dark humor and witty commentary on social stereotypes got me wondering if the book could be as good. I bought it the next day and finished it two days later and I'm glad to say  that it is indeed.  I can only say that I now understand why this book has  become a cult classic.  Palahniuk writes in a style similar to the way the  human mind works.  Many might not like the sentence fragments and  bombardments of dogmatic snippets.  I must admit, I was a little turned off  by the random haiku.  I think haiku is random enough.  But once you let  your mind adjust, it feels like you've been connected to another person's  mind and are experiencing the same electrical impulses to the brain as the  narrator's.  While the schitzophrenic nature of the narrator may seem  difficult to understand, by the end of the novel, it becomes second-hand.   Just go with it, you'll be a better person for the ride.
0844660736|5.0|I first read this fifteen years ago and to this day it remains one of my favourite books ever. It is truly funny and will surely appeal to readers of all generations. The descriptions of Corfu is blissful and will make  anyone want to go there. I highly recommend it. You won't ever get tired of  it.
6301640659|4.0|Very unique and interesting film . In a way I believe the producers wanted the controversial gay subject matter to carry this film , and pay little attention to story line and plot . Many of the situations are kind of  disjointed and dont realy resolve intself , but ends up adding to the films  suspencefull quality .  The confrontations that Pacino gets into are played  out well , although the source of some of the confrontations are never  really made clear .  Yes a killer is caught , but is he behind ALL the  killings? Did Pacino have a gay relationship with the playwrite who lived  across the hall?  On the surface this movie could be thought of as quite  bad, and I'll admit some of the acting was subpar for some of the minor  characters. However, the movie kept me in suspence , and the gay bar scenes  were well orchestrated . I respected this movie a little more after viewing  it a 2nd time . I believe the main theme is the uncertainty of the sexual  preference of people we dont know, and the uncertainty of life. The thing  that bothers me most is that the killer had different hair then the one  that was caught , and dont know if that was intentional , or just a gross  inattention to detail .
0553573403|5.0|Every time I would put this book down, it kept me going back for more!  I'm a Robert Jordan fan, so I enjoy a book with 800+ pages.  In fact, I was sorry when it ended!  I purchased the second book soon after!<br />The only  upset was when one of the main characters died.  I had expected a  fairy-tale like ending.. but I guess that's what makes a great fantasy  epic!<br />I love this book!
B00001QGPS|5.0|Yo, Method's lyrics are so raw in this album. The beats are sweet and untouchable. Redman was cool, but i'm more of a Method fan. If you like Lyrics and beats, buy this album. It Maybe the best cd of 99'.
0440404835|5.0|My daughter read this book for school and truly enjoyed it.  Although only 8 and there were some challenging words and concepts, she was enamored with Paddington and all his silly antics.  Now the stuffed animal has better  meaning for all of us at home.
0141301104|5.0|I like this book!  I am in 4th grade in Mr. Murphy's class and I read this book I think it's a great book because it has a lot of action
0792156684|5.0|After over a year of wait the DVD consumers have finally gotten their chance to get James Cameron's materpiece TITANIC on DVD!  By now everyone nows the story of TITANIC so I'm not going to bore anyone with telling it  all over again. But for those that haven't seen the movie, or don't know  much of the story I will say that Cameron works his writing wonders with  this movie once again, the same way he has with T2 and True Lies. The  movies keeps you wanting more.  As far as the DVD goes the video is  amazing, for a non-anamorphic transfer of the film anyway. The film is  presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and as I stated above the  movie has never looked better. As far as the sound on the DVD, the Dobly  Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack truly rocks the house, and when the Titanic  sinks you will feel like your house is sinking along with it. It is truly a  soundtrack that has to be hear to be believed.  As far as the Special  Features go there is only the original theatrical trailer, which is in  widescreen and very entertaining, along with some very nice animated menus.  It should be noted that Paramount has started work on the big Special  Edition of TITANIC for DVD, and that version should be out either sometime  next year or in 2001. That version will contain the many Special Features  that people were hoping for on this disc.  So in short this DVD is really  good, and is worth the money if you liked the movie. It looks better than  any other version of the film and really shows the kind of picture DVD can  do, it puts the VHS to shame in so many ways that you will never want to  watch the VHS version again. Plus you don't have to change tapes in order  to watch the whole movie, the DVD contains the entire movie on one Dual  Layer side! Don't miss this great movie and amazing transfer.
B000002UDG|5.0|All of McCartney's best songs are here,and they sound great.I would have liked if he put more of his better hits on this album(ex.Venus and Mars Rock Show,Maybe I'm Amazed).If you don't like his 80's music,buy Wings  Greatest insted.
0800132343|1.0|Das Boot in this movie was cut to make it an Action Film that if you speak German you have no idea what the hell people are talking about or doing. If you like comics you will like this film in any format. It is actually an 11  hour film, not 6 and shows the plight and character of the crew, their home  life, the life under the 8th Air Force and the realization that they made a  mistake choosing Hitler but there is no way out. It indicts the NAZIs and  the SS and how well they lived up to the very end and just how short the  good times were but leaves out how very short the good tiimes and lives  were for others. If you want good War movies that are for real I recommend  the German/English Version of &quot;A Cross of Iron&quot; and if you into  the Holocaust movies like the German, uncut &quot;Jacob the Liar&quot; as  well as many others.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album if full of beautiful and exciting songs!  I can't wait for them to kick off their US tour next year:-)  In this album, Anthony really gets a great opportunity to really showcase his vocals!  Flea is a bass god!  It's so great to have John back, it just wasn't the same without him, he  had some huge shoes to fill when Hillel died, and John's done a wonderful  job of it!  Chad Smith is just an awesome drummer, he's so incredible and  talented!  If I had to list my favorite songs I'd have to list every song,  these guys are just so talented!  Go buy the album, it rocks!
B000006YYW|5.0|Robin y Maurice Gibb crearon un excelente album, en donde se desarrolla en forma brillante la voz de Robin, rodeada de una atmosfera de un album de &quot;E.L.O.&quot;. Destaco los temas &quot;Juliet&quot;, &quot;Don't Stop  the Night&quot; y el excelente &quot;Another Lonely Night in New  York&quot;. No se lo pierdan!
B000001I0K|5.0|By far their best record. One of my favorites of all time. Ivy has inspired countless kids to pick up a guitar and try to make music instead of just strumming power chords. Lux's stage presence has also been copied  by thousands, but even though he ain't exactly a spring chicken anymore,  and their last two records have been just terrible (how could you guys  release that stuff?), you still have to see them live, because they love  their fans as much as we love them and it comes through on stage.
6305537798|5.0|I loved this movie soooo much. it is extremely romantic and has a great story line (thanks Will Shakespeare). it is really funny and has just enough sound track so that you can here the speaking but also get the full  effect of the music. patrick and kat were great!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|I'm not a HUGE RATM fan, though I do own and enjoy all of their CDs.  This disc, though, really seems to cover a lot more range than the other two.  And, perhaps most importantly, is definetely some of Tom's best work.  He  might not be the best guitarist in the world right now, but he certainly is  one of the most innovative.  All in all, a great CD.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. It's has state-of-the art special effects, and eye popping stunts. Although Keanu Reeves' performance is weak, it doesn't matter with a great story. So  that's why I give this 5 stars.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This album is simply great!  They are obviously not afraid of a little experimentation and it pays off. It blows Evil Empire away, and even though it can't match Rage's original, it has some amazing songs.  A must buy!
B0000028M7|5.0|jerry cantrell is one of the best guitarists, able to make really powerful riffs and creative solos to go along with layne's powerful vocals. this album has their best songs, rooster, hate to feel, would?, down in a hole,  angry chair, amongst others.. the whole album is very much full of great  songs.. some of the them like angry chair, and junkhead, really pound and  crash down into the dark abyss.. great lyrics by both staley and cantrell,  and the best effort by the band. the album is great for creating colors  even in all its darkness.
B000002VMH|5.0|I have bought many other cds from many other artists, and after a few times of listening to them, they end up on the shelf collecting dust. This has never happened with 'Diva'. Annie speaks to your soul with her music.  &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;Cold&quot;, these songs I have never grown tired of.  They can still make me bawl like a baby.  Annie Lennox's voice and vocal  energy on this album...how can I do her justice with mere words, she  touches your soul and your heart with her incredible vocal talent and the  emotion she pours out in each tune. You can feel her pain, her love and,  yes, sometimes even contempt in each word she sings. Her voice is  hauntingly beautiful, wonderfully soulful, and deliciously creamy. She is  one the greatest female singers of our century and this album proves it.
B000003TAR|5.0|after the success of the slickly recorded nevermind, and the the more raw,heavier strange incesticide, nirvana gives us in utero, an album i think fits in between.. its got its very heavy moments in songs like milk it and scentless apprentice, but its also got quieter ballads like dumb and  all apologies... it also has the song heart-shaped box which is one of my  favorite songs of all time, and i would go as far as to say, one of the  best songs ever. as a whole what results is a nice range and variety..  the  drums by grohl are their heaviest on this album, increasing the intensity  of some of the songs 10-fold.. the songs all have a cleverly made sound as  well as lyrics, sometimes containing an intense pounding section which  follows after the first 2 verses (such as in radio friendly unit shifter  and rape me)increasing the power and intensity of the songs. i think  nirvana was an unfortunate victim of success, being criticized by many who  didnt understand that they had never claimed that they were some great  band. they were always very modest and unwanting of their popularity. but  nirvana was a truly needed change from the stagnant state of music.. they  combined, punk, rock, metal altogether, into a raging, angst machine which  people could indentify with, in a different way than ever before. and the  most important thing is how much his music helped people deal with their  pains and frustrations. u can love him or hate him, but i think it would be  stupidity not to acknowledge how much he changed music and influenced so  many bands today, even tho it is likely no band will ever match what  nirvana created so honestly.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is one of my favorite records now. This is a new direction for techno music. It is essentially Moby's take on the blues. It samples old field recordings and jazz records and makes them into songs that only amplify the  feelings expressed in the original samples. By just using one or two lines  throughout a whole song, it still makes an amazing emotional impact. this  is a landmark album
0790738074|5.0|I think that the music man is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  There is great acting, great music, great lyrics, and great everything!For the past couple of days I have had &quot;76 trombones&quot; stuck in my  head.  I enjoy music a lot.  If you like good music WATCH THE MUSIC MAN!
0140186395|5.0|What more can I say; this is the type of novel I wich I could read again for the first time to completely take in all it has to offer
B00000729S|5.0|These guys make the thrash-punk bands of today look like clowns doing a really bad job.  This has the spirit that founded the punk scene and had lyrics that were understandable instead of a lot of fast screaming into a  cheap mike.  Check out &quot;Suspended Animation&quot; (just released in  Aug. 99) it has been my favorite for years.

6304117752|5.0|This movie and soundtrack was a favorite of mine (and my family's) growing up.  I have told my own kids and nieces and nephews about it...they've heard the songs, but we have not been able to locate the movie anywhere!   What does it take to get a re-release?  We are cheating the next generation  by not being able to share this lovely classic.
B000021XR5|4.0|STP is not the most innovative band, but atleast the bands they have copied during their career were innovative. I mean this as a complement, as much as it can be. STP takes old ideas and blends them with fresh guitar  crunch and smooth harmonies to produce songs that are equal parts David  Bowie, Doors, Aerosmith, and Beatles all rolled into one. Their Beatles  influence shows a little too strongly on this album, but that's OK. For  anyone looking for a little music in their rock n' roll, this is a little  slice of heaven.
6302548195|5.0|One of the most entertaining documentaries ever made, this film follows Arnold Schwarzenegger in his quest to become the Mr. Something-or-Other of international body-building. As he gradually drives his major competitor  [Lou Ferrigno, the \\"Incredible Hulk\\"] crazy with his brilliant  psychological tactics, you will be both amused and come away with  tremendous respect for Arnold's intelligence. Great fun!
B00000K2SC|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen since The Devil's Advocate (and no, I am not a Reeves groupie).  Disturbing enough to keep you thinking about it for awhile.  Interesting and with enough depth to make you want to watch it  again so you can catch it all.      Keanu Reeves was perfect for the  role--he is not a great actor, but the character didn't require great  emotional agility.  His straight face and somewhat monotone voice worked.   Moss was the best part of the movie.  She brought an intensity and  believability to the whole thing that just keeps you watching.  My only  complaint is that for such a good story and great action scenes the  soundtrack was awful!  I can't wait for the sequel
B000002UB6|5.0|As the songs were recorded live, either in the studio or on the rooftop, the rawness of performance and production on this album compared with other Beatle albums brings listeners closer to the music. I bought this album  when it came out at the age of ten and still enjoy hearing it to this day.  I've played these songs in rock bands in my twenties and sing them to my 1  year-old son in my thirties. One of my ten favorite discs of all time. Now  if they would only re-release the movie!
6304056958|5.0|My mother first shared this classic with me when I was about thirteen.  We have continued to revisit it over the years, with each viewing resonating more and more.  Norma Shearer is perfect as the film's straight woman, Joan  Crawford is at her catty best, and Rosalind Russell indisputably steals the  show.  Paulette Goddard's helpless Miriam is a delight.  Marjorie Main is a  gem as the unabashedly upfront Lucy, and Mary Boland stretches her  melodramatic muscles as the over-the-top Countess DeLave.  Virginia Weidler  and Ruth Hussey, both familiar from The Philadelphia Story, also put in  great performances.  And Adrian outdoes himself for the film's fashion  show, designing some of the most hilarious and beautiful clothing I've ever  seen.  Amazing direction, production, and performances, as well as the  genius of Clare Boothe Luce's stage play as a basis for the script, ensure  that you will keep coming back for more.
0964385619|5.0|The man who wrote this book is PURE genius!   I'm only 21 years old, and just by reading this book I feel like I am a million times ahead of the  game compared to professionals who are years older than me!  I have  recently been saving up since reading this book, and I know it will help me  years down the road when I start my own business.    I see nothing  wrong with this book, and anyone who thinks otherwise is exactly the same  kinds of people that Robert Kiyosaki points out in this book. The average  John Doe doesn't understand the concept of investing into a good business.   I quote Mr. Kiyosak, &quot;If you're in a hole, stop digging!&quot; My  great-grandfather had his own business, and told my father,&quot;It's best  to get $1 from many people rather than get $100 from only one person&quot;  He said that at a time in America when people belived that  good grades  made more money... but still people have the same poor &quot;money is  bad&quot; mindset today!  In a class I took last year at college, the  professor asked all of us what we would do if we won $1 million?  Like most  people, everyone in the class said, &quot;I would buy a car, a house, big  stereos, stuff like that&quot;  I can't believe people are that ignorant!   When it was my turn to say what I would do if I won the lottery, I replied,  &quot;I would save it up, and invest it into a business like a fitness  center, apartments in a college town or help my younger brother buy a  guitar shop when he gets older&quot;  Everyone looked at me like I was from  another planet when I said that!  Again, this is the best book on  financial advice I have ever read!   I can't thank Robert Kiyosaki enough  for the advice he gave in this book-he is one of the FEW smartest business  men in the world!   It really has prepared me for the future.
0380973464|5.0|A long book that took me even longer to read. Normally, a fast reader, I slowed down for fear of missing the subtleties  of his language.  I took frequent breaks just to reflect on the delights of the selection. For me it  wasn't the plot or characterizations that make it memorable, but the little  tongue-in-cheek satirical asides dealing with WWII, high tech start-ups,  Silicon Valley, Seattle, and the developing 3rd world.
B0000047CX|5.0|The human race is divided into those who have heard these sounds and those who haven't. Those in the first group must surely be glad that they are alive. I know I am when I listen to this CD. <br />Thank you Stan getz,  Antonio Carlos Jobim, Joao Gilberto and Astrud Gilberto.
B000000OAA|5.0|OK, probably the first album I wore the grooves out on...I remember hearing Killer Queen on the radio and being immediately hooked. I hadn't heard anything like it and haven't since (except for the wannabes, and you know who you are!). Freddie Mercury was the epitome of the rock star; he obviously relished the spotlight and he WAS a star in every way. Brian May, of course, has one of the most distinctive sounds in rock &amp; roll, John Deacon could be their best songwriter, and what would Queen be without those Roger Taylor falsettos (LOL)? Anyway, on Sheer Heart Attack you will find the ESSENTIAL Queen, meaning this album shows them at their best, excelling at every genre they choose. Besides Killer Queen, Now I'm Here and Brighton Rock are two of the best flat-out rock songs Queen ever did, and that's saying a lot considering their awesome catalog.<br />Jeez, just BUY THIS already...;-)
B000031WD9|5.0|It was great, awesome, funny, the best!  Sex is not something people normally disscuss it, the way American Pie does!
B000002KHH|1.0|I picked this cd up and I was not happy with it. There are only 3 good song on the whole cd War Pigs, Paranoid and Iron Man. I wouldnt buy this. Buy Sabbith Bloody Sabbith its alot better then this.
B00000K3G8|5.0|Talking Heads were one of the few breaths of fresh air in 80s music, and the complete &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; (the original version of the film) is one of the 10 best albums of the decade.  The music, even with  synthesiser galore, still sounds fresh - simply because it suits the music,  and the musicians knew how to use them - it perfectly compliments what I  call the Heads own particular brew of music - &quot;nerd funk&quot;.  At  times hilarious, meditative, perceptive, at other times downright scary,  &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; is consistently rhythmic and energetic (minus  the embarrasing Tom Tom Club song - the producers would have been better  informed using &quot;Big Business&quot; &quot;I Zimbra&quot; or  &quot;Cities&quot; - the 3 songs not included on the album, from the  extended videocassette version of the film).  Too bad the re-release of the  film, undoubtably the greatest concert film ever made, didn't make it's way  to theaters everywhere - it might have reminded people of what real  filmmaking, and more importantly, real music, produced with real passion,  is capable of accomplishing.
B0000062S0|4.0|How unfair is to compare this cd with the Led Zeppelin albums of the past. Led Zeppelin is and forever will be the greates band ever! No question about it. This is a very solid cd and takes a true music fan to appreciate  it. Sure you're not going to like it as much as one of the original studio  recordings that you have been listening to for 20 years.<br />This CD is for  true Zeppelin fans only. All the wanta-bees need not post any further. Any  song Jimmy Page plays on is classic and for the doubters I saw him live on  this tour and he has lost nothing. Robert Plant is still one of the great  frontmans of all time only behind probably Jim Morrison. Buy this cd and  you will find several songs that you will really enjoy.
B000021XS0|5.0|I did love Kevin on I&amp;W, but....I like Jordan's style better, He throws in classical and ragtime, and I cant wait to find some of his solo cd's.  James Labrie sounds better than ever.  I was very dissapointed with  Falling into Infinity. But this cd is the best cd I have ever listened to.  I get chills listening to Finally Free!
B00000K19E|5.0|Its not just that it was shot in my hometown of Sydney, Australia. It was the far reaching slant on good vs evil. The fact that no one knows about the evil that surrounds us, that we eat, drink and breath it. And that the  good is hidden in another dimension, another time. And that some of us  would choose to return to it after knowing the truth. And the fact that the  two brothers who made this film make sure we see some of the hottest  effects ever recorded during the process is only a credit to them. We go to  the movies to be entertained, and sometimes to be helped to think a bit. If  you want serious thought provoking stuff, read a book or a manual or go  watch a documentary. This was well crafted moviemaking. Congratulations on  the film AND the interactive extras that make the DVD a reason for  switching from VHS. In fact Im just about to buy a transmitting gizmo that  enables me to transmit my computer DVD player to my widescreen TV for  $90!  Thx
B000002J6F|4.0|I read an article about Stephen Stills not too long ago in which he basically dissed ALL of his work outside of CSN and CSNY, for reasons that weren't terribly clear in the piece. Well, there's a lot of solo Stills  that deserved dissing, but not this album---perhaps because Manassas was no  mere back-up band for Stills, but held their own quite well. Chris Hillman  brings out the best in the musicians he plays with, and on things like  &quot;Bound To Fall,&quot; &quot;It Doesn't Matter,&quot; &quot;Both Of Us  (Bound To Lose)&quot; and especially &quot;Fallen Eagle,&quot; he  counterbalances Stills' rough singing with a sweetness that blends  perfectly. Stills himself seems focused on doing his best here---the first  side is a suite of sorts about (I guess) the rock 'n roll life of the time  and Stephen really shines here. I give it four stars only because the songs  themselves aren't very memorable, but the playing is so tight and together  that it might not even matter. If you've ever liked anything this man has  done, MANASSAS is worth purchasing.<br />I saw the same Merriweather Post  Pavillion concert that the writer from Myrtle Beach saw--helluva great  show!
6304140711|5.0|I saw this film on TV, on a Tuesday night a month or so ago.  This was the first time I ever heard of Mark Wahlberg.  Before I even knew his name, his screen presence jumped out at me, and I could not take my eyes off of him.    He is Beyond Cute--Intense, Sexy, and maximum carisma!   Yes, the story is  familiar, but Mark gives it such a boost, with every facial expression and  his &quot;fearless-but-fearful&quot; actions.  I've only seen this movie  once, but I remember all of it so well!  I'm in the process of buying it,  in fact, and cannot wait to see it again.  I would pay big bucks to be on  that roller coaster with David/Mark, that's for sure!   Didn't know someone  could be so steamy and scary at the same time!  Several things his  character did amazed and shocked me, but I had to see it all.  Also, Reese  Witherspoon and Alyssa Milano are terrific. Everyone did a suberb job in  this flick.  I'm not surprised, after seeing FEAR, at Mark's continued film  successes.  He is a talent to be reckoned with!  If you like suspense,  you'll love this one!
B00001SIES|5.0|I think Showbiz is one of the best albums released in 1999. This album gives me the chills - the singer`s voice is one of the most beautiful Ive heard in a long time. Its not that far from that of the great Jeff  Buckley. Muse are often compared to radiohead, but in my opinion theyre 10  times better. This album rocks - I listened to the first track (sunburn)  &amp; the album hasnt left my cd player since. A really cool band. Get the  album now before they get HUGE.
6305313687|5.0|If you don't know why you fear or hate something or someone, watch this movie ! It is a good reflexion over racism and where our civilizations go in general. And don't forget that American people are where they are now  cause they hated and killed native Indians...
0875428940|1.0|When shopping for a tarot deck, one should always choose a deck that &quot;speaks&quot; to them, whether it be the use of color or the images of the deck. This deck I find the images rather weak or watered down. Take the  card, The Wheel of Fortune, for example. In this deck it shows a woman  going through various stages of emotion from happiness to depression  instead of the tradition image of a wheel showing the waxing and waning of  fate - a more powerful image. The Magician is also weak in the Robin Wood  deck, a laughing man with antlers on his head - give me a break! When doing  a reading the images should grab you and not make light of the situation as  I feel this deck does. This deck is definitely for the faint of hearts out  there.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Battle Of Los Angeles is Rage's best disc yet.  The first three track's set the tone, especially &quot;Calm Like A Bomb.&quot;  &quot;New Millennium Homes&quot; also is very good.  I can't wait for RATM's next  effort.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is THE best CD ever made.  I love a lot of music and have a ton of favorite bands, but this CD tops them all by a lot.  It is definately a classic.
0780626966|5.0|The DVD collection of the Nightmare on Elm Street series is excellent. I already own the movies on VHS, but the feature of the collection are great. A lot of thought and production went into the release. the 3-D scenes were  an excellent touch, I was always dissapointed the VHS release wasn't in  3-D. The bonus DVD with the pics, videos from the cast and crew, was very  insightful, and quite entertaining to use. The method of almost Doom-like  travel through the abandonded building was a lot of fun.
0800184327|5.0|This movie was the greatest fun and it made me want to take up latin dancing and I just love vanessa Williams she is great
0312854021|5.0|With all of the books available and my limited time to spend reading it is rare that I go back and re-read a book.  &quot;Enders Game&quot; is one of those rare novels that needs to be cracked open every couple of years or  so.  Although set in the future it is a tale that would endear itself to  those who  can't stand sci-fi as a genre.  Just read it already!
B000002GZ1|5.0|Pure History.  This album opened the collective white consciousness to the stark depths of the blues.  Not to be missed.
B00000K19E|5.0|No words can really do this film justice, it is easily the best film I have seen in a long time. I saw it at the cinema twice and have watched the DVD twice within a week of getting it. <br />The action scenes are oustanding,  acting excellant and what is even better is that there are two more Matrix  films in the making :)<br />Oh yes.<br />On the DVD side of things, the Disc is  top notch. The documenaries are brilliant, and the commentary by the  editors &amp; Carrie-Anne Moss is well worth listening to.
0684874350|5.0|BRAVO MR.McCOURT. ITS A FINE PIECE OF WRITNG. FRANK EXPRESSES HIS LIFE IN IRELAND IN AN INTERESTING FASHION, USING IRISH-ENGLISH TERMS IN LANGUAGE TO MAKE YOU FEEL IRELAND THROUGH THE EYES OF FRANK. DEFENATLY A MUST READ!
B000009ED0|5.0|This is by far the best CD I have bought this year(1999). The only song that doesn't live up to the expectations it has been given is &quot;Cowboy,&quot; and I can still stand to listen to it, so it's not THAT  bad. In short, this CD ranks up there with those of the likes of Limp  Bizkit, Korn, and Rage Against the Machine. If it isn't better that is.
B000021XS0|5.0|I've been a true Dream Theater fan since I first heard them with 'Images and Words' and Simply put, this is by far the best CD since. I hold I&amp;W as the best album I have ever heard by any artist and have wondered how DT  would be able to top or even come close to that sound again. Although I  still love all of the CD's they have released since, none have come close  to I&amp;W....until now! 'Scenes From A Memory' is what I've been waiting  for! I haven't been this excited about music in a long time. 'Scenes' is a  true musical inspiration.
6301777387|5.0|I first saw this when it came out, then I got drafted, then I eventually got sent to...Uijongbu. Whereupon I worked in the dispensary there.<br />Anybody who ever had to put up with the Army will recognize parts  of this movie. And yes it's more about the Viet Nam era than the Korean  war.<br />It does capture the idea of people who hate being where they are,  but still try to do the best job they can while they have to be there. The  book explains it better than the movie or the t.v. series did.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The battle of los angeles is great. the politics and music are still there. i cant wait for them to come out with another album. they are without a doubt the best band of the 90's maybe even all time.
0780625633|5.0|Edward Norton is amazing as the racist family leader, Derek. He lets you into his character's mind, especially when Derek's in prison.  This film makes you question why part of American society condones racism. Go see  this movie!
B000002URV|5.0|Talk about music to get lost in, this is definately tops !   Definately inforces the body, mind and soul connection. Absolutely mind melding !
0446525537|2.0|Not for adults, a good adolescent's book. Predictable.  I was disappointed.
0964385619|5.0|This book will be especially helpful to young people with their career and life planning. Give a copy to everyone you know who has pre-college kids. Coupled with his follow-up work, The Cashflow Quadrant, it explores the  issues of money and life in a balanced way and gives people of all ages an  idea of what effects their choices will have on their life.  This kind of  knowledge can save years of trial and error and lead to a much happier,  more fulfilling life.  I also recommend his board games as a fun way to  practice the principals from the books.
6305537798|5.0|&quot;10 Things I hate about you&quot; was a great movie! It was wounderfully done, and the plot was terrific. The actors and actreeses really got into it. There was not one bad actor in that film. And once you  got into it, it was almost like one of those super hero movies, you kept  routing for the good guy to win.
0792153367|5.0|I love Audrey Hepburn, and this is, in my opinion, her best film ever.  It's romantic without being overly sappy, with great dialogue, and a happy ending.  What more could you ask for?
B000001Y79|5.0|This album is a must have! No one should be without this album or any other album by No Doubt. Buy this CD !!!!
6300267997|5.0|that's another movie, but it's what i have to say.<br />i saw this movie 23 years ago, when it was released.  i was with my 1st sweetheart. (memories).<br />evergreen is still one of my favorites songs.<br />it's a sad  story of love, lust, winning and loosing, and winning again.<br />but what do  you know? such is life.<br />i really liked the scene in the bathroom, with  the tube and candles.  and also the last scene when she sings for him and  the crowd it's helding candles in his memory.
0767802659|1.0|I'm sorry but this movie was just plain awful. There were holes in the storyline and editing that were so big you almost thought they had never really finished it as originally written and planned but just cut together  whatever footage was available so that it could be released.
B000002UAO|5.0|If you're a true Beatles fan, this is a must have in your collection.  This album turned the Fab Four into sophisticated musical artists.  Includes songs from the movie &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Michelle&quot;,  one of the most recorded Beatle tunes.  Earphone listing promises to sooth  your soul.
0060931671|5.0|After my second reading, I am still too affected to write an emotionally unbiased review.  So let me just say that this work is absolutely wonderful, and is one of those few works that really reaches out and grabs  you in the gut -- one thinks, if but for a moment, that  despite his  apparent absence one has really made contact with Pynchon...or at least  with a fellow presence amongst the noise, and that together it might be  safe to tempt or, better yet, pursue fate (even if only for 180 pages)  .<br />Also, this book is soooo much more than merely a Pynchonesque statement  about America in the 50's and early 60's (though it is certainly also that  and in the most briliant way imaginable): the book plays with the big  themes..too big and amorphous to get right here, right now...but you know,  don't you?  If you have ever thought that you might just be making out  against the sensual din about you the Word, momentarily finding some order  amongst the oh-so-entertaining flickering of everything about you, only to  feel the butterflies in your stomach signaling and guiding you towards  'safer' ground which may not in fact feel so safe or sensible, then you  have already met with the Tristero...or perhaps, they have met with  you...or, just maybe, you're nuts!
B0000029J5|5.0|Keb' Mo' is simply one of the best &quot;new&quot; artists to come along in years. He kicked around the studios for awhile before making this recording. Close your eyes and it sounds as if this young man is already in  his sixties, both by the quality of his voice and the experience of his  playing. &quot;Am I Wrong?&quot; is one of the best blues tunes I've ever  heard! You won't regret buying this CD!
B000001EMW|5.0|I would highly recommend this album to anyone with diverse musical tastes, especially if they include Metallica!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|I now have all 3 Rage albums and this one is, at the very least, on par with the other 2.  Tom's guitars (the man is a genius!) are better than ever, and the lyrics are extremely poignant.  Sleep Now in the Fire and  Testify are easily the match of Bulls on Parade or Wake Up (my personal  favorites...) and the rest of the album stands on its own as well.  <br />The  only track I really didn't like was Mic Check.  Yeah, it's different, but  that's not always a good thing...<br />Also, there's a list of rage-ist  websites that nicely suppliment the &quot;reading list&quot; in Evil Empire  for the politically inclined....like myself...
B000002UAR|4.0|The Beatles are more sophisticated in utilizing other instruments and electronics to enhance their music.  They continue to be the first in their genre to create music that is pleasant to listen to and interesting in  musical as well as lyrical composition.
B000000OA6|5.0|After a night at the opera, this album is wonderful composition, not a commercial product but pure art for the listener. Don't forget to include this CD in your collection!
B000001Y42|5.0|This CD rules. It's heavy, loud, and has lots of screaming. It ranks right up there with Rage Against the Machine. I especially like Pollution, Leech, and Faith. Fred Durst is the man!
B00000JCB2|5.0|Limp Bizkit is the best rock-rap group out there and METHOD MAN is cool to.He is on the track n2gethernow.N2gethernow is the best song on the CD.Significant Other is the best thing out there now.So go and get it  NOW!
0385486804|4.0|I agree with other readers that this book would have been better served had the author not included as much material about his own exploits. Having said that, this is a very well written book which was hard to put down, and  even harder to forget. I feel Chris McCandless is very misunderstood by  some Alaskans and many readers of this story.  I believe Chris knew fully  the risk he was taking when he ventured west of Atlanta and into the  wilderness.  The real crux of his reasoning for doing so stemmed in part  from the fact that he really didn't identify with what he saw as the  mundane, materialistic world around him.  His adventure wasn't just one of  personal fulfillment. McCandless had come to the conclusion that normal  life held no imortance to him, and that if the wilderness got the best of  him, so be it.  At least his lived his life to the fullist.  He obviously  had no intenetion of guarenteeing himself a safe return.
0060925000|5.0|I have a lot of Indian friends who  recommended this book to me.  Even so, I was daunted by the sheer number of pages when I first started.  Then I found that the more I read of this book, the more I wanted to read.  It  definitely reflects the attitudes and conventions of Indian life that few  books I have read have been able to do.
B00000IPAX|4.0|This was a PRETTY good CD. However, it's not really punk rock, it's more alternative. It did have some good songs, like What's My Age Again, and Mutt. I'm a die hard Blink 182 fan, and I think Dude Ranch is a MUCH better  CD overall.
0140186409|4.0|Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors but I preferred East of Eden, Tortilla Flat, Cannery Row, The Long Valley and others to Grapes of Wrath.
B000006045|5.0|I've always dug Massive's earlier works, but this CD, to me, is even stronger than 'Protection' and 'Blue Lines'.  The beats and baselines sound smoother and more refined, but at the same time have more of a hard edge to  them,  and they have continued their use of multiple lead voices, which  only adds to the uniqueness of every song.    There isn't as much of a  reggae influence on this CD, which is a little disappointing, but they make  up for it many ways.  And I have to concur with an earlier reviewer who  wrote that &quot;Dissolved Girl&quot; has the best baseline: For me, this  song is the strongest on the CD, and maybe their best ever.
0425129586|5.0|YOU JUST CAN'T STAY THERE AND DON'T READ THAT BOOK.  YOU HAVE TO READ IT.<br />Read the ending very carefully.  The enigma is delivered in the next pages.  It is IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to guess it...
B00000K3UU|5.0|If you loved Billy Madison, you definately like this movie. It has great humor and a great plot.
0790737973|3.0|The movie is not worth the third of what the book can make you feel.  If you read the book slowly and in an attentive way, you'll never get bored.  But the film was boring, at a certain point.  <br />The book is not even the  same story as the movie (it's much better).  I recommend the book, but you  can see the movie.
B00000K3UU|5.0|Greatest film Adam Sandler has ever done.If you haven't seen the movie, you should buy it. 'Cause you are going to be watching it a lot.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought the CD after sampling the songs on a number of web sites. [got hooked by the theme song to Roswell, &quot;here with me&quot;].  I was surprised that I actually like all the songs!  This is really rare for me.  I'm very impressed with this artist and will be looking forward to her next  CD.  Meanwhile, this one will be played often. Highly recommended.
0964385619|2.0|I remember the key premise of this book being uttered by Claire Huxtable on &quot;The Cosby Show,&quot; when Vanessa's friends called her &quot;a little rich girl.&quot;  Attorney Huxtable, wife of the good Dr. Huxtable,  sat Vanessa down and said &quot;Honey, we are not rich; rich is when your  money works for you, not when you work for your money.&quot;  Well, duh! I  think that the best way to get rich in America today is to write a book  based on some premise that anyone with half a brain should already know!
B000000OA6|5.0|I really love this album.The first day I heard it I sat there in awe the whole time and during a couple songs I cried.Sometimes when I listen to it I still do. It is very powerful, a must for all Queen fans.One of my  favorite songs on the album is the way overlooked &quot;Delilah&quot;.  Anyway this is a great album and I highly recomened you hear it.
6305537798|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! The characters were well developped, it was humorous, and it had a nice message. Several of the characters ended up being different from how you expected, and they all got what they  deservred/desired.<br />However, most of the profanity was completely  unnessecary. They didn't dwell on it(thankfully) but it really isn't  appropriate for anyone under 10.
B000021Y7X|4.0|After 15 years of playing my old VHS copy, I am glad to have the newly remastered version of Stop Making Sense on DVD.  The new 5.1 theatrical mix is sonically superior to the old version, although some effects and  performances were changed, probably to account for the changes in audio  technology, in that the old version probably played in mono in most  theatres.<br />The audio commentary is insightful, even though all  participants recorded their words separately.<br />The only flaw I saw (or  rather, heard) was Eric  &quot;E.T.&quot; Thorngren's 5.1 studio mix; I was  hoping for a studio mix without any audience sound, and I was shock at how  flat the bass response was compared to the 5.1 and 2.0 mixes by the film's  theatrical sound mixer.  At least he did not resort to the excessive Linn  drum samples prevolent on Chris Franz's drumming on the CD  versions.<br />After years of watching the extra songs &quot;Cities&quot; and  &quot;Big Business/I Zimbra&quot; incorporated in the first video release,  I was a bit disappointed that they were not again included as an expansion  of the feature film, but tacked on at the end.<br />Minor flaws such as these  prevent me from going to 5 stars, but even so, I will still be watching  this movie for another 15 years or more!
1885283148|5.0|I read it, and re-read it. I couldn't put it down. Along with the information on the US Space program itself, it has insights into the family life of the astros as well as how they interacted with each other. As a  bonus, a strong sense of humor comes through in the writing that makes the  sometimes technical nature of the book spring to life. It is very  entertaining! Far from a dry account of &quot;I did this,&quot; you are  left with a clearer sense of the incredible magnitude of the US Apollo and  Gemini programs. If you ever wondered what went through those men's minds  as they made history, this is the book for you! Thank you Mr. Collins!
B000002LAC|5.0|These three musicians sound so great together. I don't know why it took me so many years to learn about this recording. I already liked them as solo performers, so having them collaborate is truly a treat. I don't think I'll  ever grow tired of listening to this CD.
6305078564|3.0|As many people have already said - this is a series than can be enjoyed over, and over again.  I wore out my VHS copy and was delighted to find it on dvd.  Hooray! 1 copy for the duration.  however, and this is why I gave  it only four stars.  The quality of the dvd is below average. My VHS copy  had a much more crisp picture.  This dvd is faded and washed out.  I have  to adjust the brightness on my tv just to get a decent picture.  That being  said, I will still watch it many many times.  10 stars for the series, 2  for the dvd quality.
B00000I924|5.0|This is one of those albums that you will either &quot;get it&quot; or not. If you don't, you won't like it, won't ever understand it, and need to move on to something more mainstream. It cannot be explained to the point  where you will &quot;get it&quot;.<br />If you &quot;get it&quot;, well,  you'll get it. The man understands the intricacies of the instrument and is  not afraid to show them. A variety of syles, volume and technique - very  satisfying.
6305358567|5.0|I just loved this movie. Cate Blanchet`s acting was inspiring. Even if the historical accuracy was forgotten here, I did take the movie for what it was: a movie. It always has been that way. Movies interest people on some  topics and give them the desire to read about the subject. Geoffrey Rush  has once more made an incredible job. I was fascinated by his talent. My  heart is still beating.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is just perfect..It's going to change all moviemaking in 21st century. Just have it on DVD for you library..Supplements on DVD is also very nice.
B000021XS0|5.0|I've listened to alot of Dream Theater and other music and I've never heard anything like this! The whole CD is filled with little riffs from Metropolis Part 1. The story is amazing, and Portnoy is unbelievable! This  is a must hear!
6303823351|4.0|Help! isn't quite as funny as Hard Day's Night perhaps because they actually had a &quot;solid story line&quot;.  While HDN had a script it seemed to have matched the true Beatles' sense of humor and style.  Help!  is quite good in it's own right but don't expect a sequel to Hard Day's  Night
B00000JRTX|2.0|As a movie I will rate it 4 stars, but the video quality is very bad, lot of artifacts, blury images, MGM transfer is really a big disappointment.
B000002J1S|4.0|If you are considering becoming enriched by the quality-era [read: Gabriel-era] of Genesis, then I suggest you buy two of my all times favorites in my whole (and rather large) collection (1) Selling England By  the Pound, then (2) Foxtrot, and then (3) Lamb.  There are truly stunning  tracks on Lamb like Carpet Crawlers, Back in NYC, and Lamia, but you also  get filler standard for double discs, like &quot;The Waiting Room.&quot;  <br />By the way, there is also great material on Nursery Cryme and Trespass,  but the other three releases best epitomize the Gabriel era, which in my  opinion has never been bested despite all the Collins-era commercial  successes.<br />All of it has aged quite well- better than most 70's era  music!
0694003611|5.0|This is a book that I read every night to my children.  For years, I could not quite put my finger on its appeal.  Finally, it clicked one day.  There is a cadence to the story that is like a mediation mantra, quietly and  gently calming you and your child down.  In addition, the book's text and  illustrations are matched in away that it is natural to point out the words  and pictures to your child, and for them to do the same as they grow older.  This means that you are also starting to teach reading in natural, relaxed  way.  In addition, we all tend to see the glass as half empty rather than  as half full.  Goodnight Moon encourages a sense of gratitude for whatever  is around us.  That is a profound and wonderful lesson for everyone to  have.  Finally, children are fascinated by how another child's room might  look.  So you also help them to understand the differences among families.  How many other books do you know that accomplish so much?  Best of all, you  and your children (and grandchildren, perhaps) will have wonderful memories  to share.  That's fantastic!  Enjoy!
B000002J1O|5.0|If you were to choose one recording that represents the best of the whole Progressive Rock era, this is it.<br />Take a band comprised of all virtuoso musicians, and mix that with the best musical compositions for the genre,  and intelligent lyrics, and the result is musical brilliance. <br />I've  played this disc more times than ANY record/disc in my entire (and very  large) collection, probably several hundred times, and I still haven't  tired of it.<br />Buy this disc.

B00000DHR0|5.0|Celine is one of the greatest voices of all time.  The album shows her wide range of songs.  &quot;The Prayer&quot; with Bocelli is my favorite and i consider it one of the top songs of the past decade.
0780020693|5.0|This film is the quintessential Felini. It is like a look at My family, with the humour andbeauty of growing up in an Italian family. The scenes are brilliant and beautifully filmed in only a style that Felini could  capture!  I can laugh in one second; and cry in the next, from the  beauty of this film!
0684867621|2.0|A young girl is lost in the woods. Period. A reader waiting for that great Stephen King plot twist or suspense will be utterly disappointed. King's book starts out with an intriguing first chapter, but everything afterwards  is a tedious account of Tricia's prolonged nature walk. No surpises here,  but plenty of lost-in-the-woods cliches.
B00000F1D3|5.0|The energy of Cher's music is awesome.  This is \\"taking back your power\\" music that is motivating and inspiring.  If your heart has been broken and you don't know where to begin, listen to Cher!

0553296981|5.0|A fascinating book telling real life obsticles. W The horror of the Halacaust makes it unbearable at times but she was a strong girl who kept going and she was very  proud of her family and religion. Be prepared for  some hardcore reading! If you have any questions about the book feel free  to e-mail me!
0517118297|5.0|It's a wondelful book for all the lovers of Jane Austen. The size of the edition is very convenient.
0449911357|5.0|My daughter, 12, reads this book at least three times a year, she loves it so much! This book is so life like and can really take you back to the times of the Great Depression. It flashes back from a women in the 80's,  going through her mid-life crisis to her old friend's days back in the  Great Depression. The old women lives in a nursing home, and evey time the  middle-aged women comes in, she tells a continues her life story. This is a  great book, and if my 12 year old daughter can read an adult book, you know  it has to be good!
0800130952|5.0|who learns to survive her difficult background and painful surroundings through the discovery of books and libraries; the pleasures of literacy. Beautifully directed, well-adapted, and with remarkable  performances--Embeth Davidtz, in particular, is a charming Miss Honey. This  is one of my half dozen favorite movies of the 90's--it is a triumph of the  decade of odd, independent flicks.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I don't really get everyone's worship of Rage's first album. Maybe it's cause I wasn't into it when it first came out, so it didn't seem revolutionary to me when I eventually heard it. But on that album, just  like on Evil Empire, I had a couple of songs I liked, and then just let the  rest of the songs run. On the first one I only ever really liked  &quot;Killing in the Name,&quot; &quot;Bullet in the head,&quot; and  &quot;Wake Up.&quot; On the second album, I only ever truly enjoyed  &quot;People of the sun,&quot; &quot;Down Rodeo,&quot; and &quot;Bulls on  Parade.&quot; On THIS album, though, the ENTIRE FREAKING FIRST HALF of the  album stands up as individual songs. And the second half is growing on me  more and more, especially &quot;Ashes in the Fall.&quot; My only problem  with the album is that the politics seem to have gotten a bit broader, a  little vaguer. I don't see this album shaking up anyone's complacency. But  it's certainly gonna shake the hell out of your living room.
0140013997|5.0|&quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; has charmed me for years.  I keep lending it to friends who refuse to return it!  Although I know passages by heart I find the book fresh at every reading. My present copy has been in  the house for about four months but I'm about to lend it to a friend at  work so I'm sure I'll be back at this site soon to reorder.  The previous  copy walked off to college with my daughter and I'll wager that she's  passed it on to one of her friends by now.
0316779989|4.0|Actually, I toyed with giving this five-stars.  However, I figure I should employ five-stars for IMPORTANT literary treasures, such as the collected works of Shakespeare, &quot;War and Peace,&quot; and &quot;Valley of the  Dolls.&quot;  So, need a laugh?  Well, any of Sedaris' books will do.   They...&quot;Barrel Fever&quot; and the even better &quot;Naked&quot;...are  funny, provocative, and full of weird and colorful people.  While  &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot; takes from his other books, it is a veritable  laugh-o-rama.  And &quot;SantaLand Diaries&quot;?  I have read it a  half-dozen times, and I STILL chortle merrily.  David, what are you  writing?  This Midtowner wants more.  And, folks, not only is Sedaris an  intelligent, witty writer and essayist, he is just as cute as a button.  I  enjoy getting his books so I can see his little impish face peering out  from the end page.  And, really, when it comes right down to it, isn't that  what it's all about:  the author's CQ (Cute Quotient)?
B000002NJS|1.0|Maybe the answer would be...Buddah Buddah Land? Maybe just in the path of a really tasteless album? It contains songs with too much image and too little depthness. The album is miles and miles from reality. Just like the  Madonna we now know.
B000002U82|5.0|This album is clearly a classic (I bought it on vinyl, 8-track, cassette, then CD).  Also love Wish You Were Here.  Roger Waters' tour this summer was awesome, as he played many of these tracks!<br />A suggestion... finally  after 25 years there's another album that can compare with this -  &quot;UP&quot; from R.E.M. released in 1998.  Much resemblance -  exceptional harmony, sonic effects, melodically rich and timeless work that  gets better with repeated listening!
B000021XR5|5.0|if you're into the whole &quot;new rock&quot; trend, take a listen to this,  these guys were doin it way before creed or godsmack.  what realy makes this album different is that it sounds a bit different,  i think its  because the drums just sound great....a lot like bonzo.
B000006N61|4.0|I've watched this movie any number of times and always enjoyed it, although, as mentioned, it has a low budget feel to it (not necessarily bad though).  I do agree with many other reviewers and would give just about  anything to obtain a copy without the dubbed Americanized voices - what a  mistake that was!  I had a friend in Australia send me a copy thinking that  would solve the problem, but silly me of course it's in PAL format which  renders it useless in my VCR here in the USA!  Oh well, great movie just  the same.
B000020617|4.0|how come cover is made of paper? What happened to the little booklets inside the normal glass like plastic cover? I don't get it. someone explain it to me.
6305537798|5.0|This movie is so great that it has become my new number 1.  I love the chemistry between the two stars!  It makes it so enjoyable and fun to watch.  A great way to relax and have a good laugh!
0385486804|2.0|This book might have gotten an A as a highschool term paper which is how it reads. It was one of my least favorite books of the year. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, so I don't have any objections to Krakauer's  take on Chris McCandless.  My problem with the book was that the writing  was so obvious and clumsy.
6305181772|1.0|First off I enjoyed the film greatly.  Having said that, why make a film and call it Mission Impossible then make it so that it is the exact opposite of the TV series.  I could just about accept the plot apart from  the apalling travesty of making the baddie Jim Phelps.  I would like to  know how Paramount could sanction this.  It is no wonder Peter Graves  wanted nothing to do with it.
0060931736|5.0|This is one of the greatest, and unique books I've ever read.  It had siplicity in plot, but you can get so much out of it.  The characters were in such depth.  I loved it.
B000001DVV|5.0|This Cd is one of my fav,s Its got to be one of the best Cds of the 90s. Its a must have. They are still one of my fav, bands next to korn and alice in chains. Buy it you wont be sorry.
0684857820|5.0|I read Lucky on a flight home. I couldn't put it down. I continued reading it while waiting for my luggage in the baggage claim area and I did not leave the airport until I read the last page. My autonomic nervous system  took a beating. Alice's story haunts me. I think about the unintentional  damage we do to people who have suffered an act of violence when we attempt  to \\"understand.\\"  In our endeavor to put logic on the illogical, we tell  ourselves that what happened was their fault, perhaps because of weakness  or bad judgement.  When we convince ourselves of this, we convince  ourselves that we are in control our lives; random acts of violence  couldn't possibly happen to us.  Lucky blows apart this lie. Alice Sebold  won't let you hide behind rationalization, explanation, or theoretical  discussion on the ills of society to excuse or lighten the effects and the  damage an act of violence has on another person.  She will make you face  the random, violent, crazy world we live in with a writing style that is  direct, harsh and unapologetic. She never asks for your pity. But Lucky is  also a story written with compassion, humor, warmth and intelligence. As  Alice Sebold tells of her long and difficult journey from a place of fear,  rage and despair to a place of meaning and hope, you cannot help but be  humbled and awed at the complex union between fragility and strength in  human beings. Lucky is a book you will remember long after you have  finished the last page.
B000002J1O|5.0|This album is incredible. All different styles of music are included here from the fast-beat of Dancing With the Moonlit Knight to the strange timings of The Battle of Epping Forest. This has got to be one of Genesis'  greatest albums.
0780625633|5.0|The film is disturbing in that is shows you racisim from both sides and almost makes you understand a little about where each is coming from.(whether you want to or not). When an actor is as good as Norton, it's  an emotional event just to watch him do his job, but in the role of Derrek  Vinyard he goes above and beyond anything else he's done.  There is no  better actor today.  Unfortunatly the film left me with somewhat of a sense  of hopelessness.  The damage is done!  Can it ever be rectified?
0767819462|5.0|This is an excellent movie. Anyone who has children and an ex-husband will love it. It has the all time greatest actress, Julia and Susan Sarandon is excellent also. It also helps the understanding of being a step-mom. Great  for young teenagers who have this situation. A MUST see, A++++++ for Julia  Roberts. She is the BEST.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This is the kind of voice that makes you stop whatever you aredoing and listen.  It makes you wonder if this voice doesn't come fromanother dimension, another reality, another lifetime.  Sarah Mclachlan is the synthesis of Maria Maldaur, Linda Rondstad, Judy Collins squared. The passion in her rendering of &quot;I love you&quot; is breathtaking, if tears don't flow from your eyes listening to this song then you are not human.  This woman is incredible.
B000002KKC|2.0|Do not purchase until re-released with the full-length version of &quot;Sara&quot;.  Or get the vinyl double album and burn your own CD.
0792835719|5.0|I'm about to order the DVD version.  Some people have posted that the transfer is so so.  That's a shame.<br />Many people have pointed out how far ahead of its time this movie was.  That is an understatement.  Clearly, the  propulsion method and overall handling of star travel inspired Rodenberry  for Star Trek.  It would be easy to imagine cruiser C57D being an early,  pre-Federation warp ship.  <br />This is the first movie that I'm aware of  that treated the breaking of lightspeed as a very big deal.  Both  superluminal travel and communications is treated as a very significant  issue that physics of the future could deal with, but not easily.  Most  movies of the time, and much later, had star travel with rockets.<br />This  movie begs for a sequel or prequel.  Harlan Ellison mentioned a few years  ago that a group was shopping the idea around, but it turned out to only be  an idea of a remake.  Bummer.  Imagine seeing the Krell as they build their  great machine and then hell night, or imagine Robby running around 22nd  century Earth, maybe throw in an encounter with a Krell colony that  survived and is about to reinvent the same thought/matter machine.<br />Until  then, I'll keep checking out the original.
B000002U94|5.0|I am only 16 yars old and I love all of Seger music. One of my friends always made fun of me because I lisened to stuped music becaused he lisened to rap. So I played him &quot;Nine Tonight&quot; he loved it. The next  weekend he went out to got this cd and now he is  Seger fan.I whis I could  do that to all of my friends. This is a must have in everyones collection.  Truely one of the best cd's ever.
0345350499|5.0|This was an excellent book.  THe depth of the characters and setting was astounding.  The whole novel read like a fine work of poetry.  I especially liked the way Ms. Bradley switched the tense to each instrumental  character. It greatly helped my understanding of the conflicts and  characters.
B000002HMH|4.0|Bottom line, its a different sounding metallica, and no matter what &quot;hardcore metallica fans&quot; say, it not a sell-out.  A band cant be around playing the same exact style music for that long of time.  Thats why  metallica has been around nearly 15 years.
0897500482|5.0|Bruce Lee's Tao of Jeet Kune Do is a testament to both Bruce Lee's open mindedness as a martial artist, and his wisdom, in forging such a concept of Jeet Kune Do is a time when few Westerners had ever heard of, much less  knew, anything about the martial arts in any serious form. Tao of Jeet Kune  Do is essentially the Bible of the contemporary martial artist, and will  live on as being truly on of the greatest martial arts philosophies of all  time.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Ive been listening to rage for a long time they are one of the most amazing bands ever! their ability to mesh music and political veiws is simply insane, this group of artists is one of the most talented in the  world. In this cd tom morrello does some of the most amazing guitar work  ever he is by far the best guitarist of the decade! also in this cd zack de  la rocha blew me away with his amazing vocal talents. Although by far  though the lyrics are some of the most amazing parts of this album, they  have a message to convey and they do it through metaphors. If you like rage  i suggest you get this cd, and all their others!               ---John
0671015206|5.0|Most of what is in here is common sense - spend less and you'lleventually be rich.  But if you read the whole book, you'll findyourself actually following the &quot;frugal&quot; lifestyle a little bit more than when you began.  Definitely worth the time to read even if you think you are already a tightwad.
B00000J7J4|5.0|After creating some of the best rock music to ever grace the earth, it is wonderful to see Carlos Santana and his band getting the recognition they deserve.  This album is phenomenal.  Rob Thomas, Dave Matthews, Eric  Clapton and the other guest artists add another dimension to the many  layers of talent Santana posesses.
B00000IKSC|5.0|This is the BEST live performance video yet. If you like to watch them dance and sing and want to laugh, them this video is a MUST HAVE!  I highly recommend it! They all do awesome solos and they look SOOOOO  HOTTTTT!  Also, if AJ is your favorite then you HAVE to get it! He does  some very nice moves! :) That is all I am saying.
0780626966|5.0|Great game on it, when you have seen all movies and came trough the 7 moviegames you are able to enter the special game on the eight disc, the encyclopedia...
0767812417|5.0|As it says in the above summary, it's my favourite movie of all time. It motivated me into reading Oliver Twist. My favourite songs are: &quot; Consider Yourself&quot;, &quot; Reviewing The Situation&quot; &quot; You've  Got To Pick A Pocket&quot; and &quot; Omp Pah Pah&quot; When I first saw  this movie on tv around six years ago, Oliver Reed's character scared me.  Now he's my favourite villian-along with Dodger of course.
0783222475|5.0|I saw this movie last night on television and I was blown away.hehehee anyway...  Everything was good about this movie.  The plot andthe characters were good too.  I would recommend anyone who loves natural disasters like I do to go see this movie.  Even if they don't. It's a love story also.  So just go see it.  You won't be sorry.
B00000K19E|2.0|if you love special effects and aren't real concerned with boredom for the mid-45 minutes of a movie then buy this now.
6302206294|1.0|This is the politically correct version of Robin Hood, complete with a feminist Maid Marian, superstitious and ignorant Friar Tuck, and a Moor, in the role of the true hero.  The character of Robin Hood is irrelevant, and  annoying, as portrayed by Kevin Costner, who only does well in baseball  movies. In any event, there were no Moors in medieval England, and the  character of Friar Tuck has been changed to represent Hollywood's contempt  for Christians. There were other historical inaccuracies- the Moor brings  gunpowder to England almost 200 years before gunpowder was invented...But  then, movies like this are only interested in politically correct  multiculturlaism- not the truth.
B000021XS0|5.0|Anyone who says that they are a  &quot;Dream Theater Fan&quot;,and does not care for this album,please get off the DT bandwagon. The addition of Jordan was the best thing they could have done. Great job guys, ONCE AGAIN  YOU HIT THE BULLSEYE!  Metroplis Part 2 is a SMASH!  Buy 2 CD's  just in case you wear out the first one! You WILL play it that much!
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a perfect action thriller. Except two, little scenario faults
B0000048V8|5.0|With out any words this wonderful story comes to life with Raymond Briggs wonderful drawings and a music score you'll find yourself singing to yourself afterwards!  It is a humorous and touching story of a little boys  friendship with his snowman and their one night of adventures together.   The &quot;flight&quot; scene to the north pole is hauntingly beautiful.  My  children continue to choose this movie because of its humor, the drawings,  the music and the friendship the boy James has with the Snowman.  A  wonderful journey into fantasy.
B00001ZULV|4.0|I bought this album yesterday, and I've already listened to Carpet Crawlers a good 25 times.  It is, in a word, wonderful.  My favorite part is when Phil comes in to sing the third verse, which is a little unexpected  as one would expect Pete to sing lead on the whole song...they're both in  such good voice, and to hear them together in this wonderful arrangement is  all that a Genesis fan could possibly ask for.  Oh, and here are the songs  that I thought they missed: Paperlate (the best Genesis pop song of all  time, IMO); The Lamb (the Gabriel era song all my friends know, not  Crawlers or I Know What I Like); Your Own Special Way (another great pop  tune, so it would fit right in with the rest of the songs); Home by the Sea  (this is ALWAYS on the radio, a great song); and Man on the Corner (if I'm  not mistaken, this charted here in the states).
6300216543|5.0|Well made film about the dark side of the NYC police department that few ever got to know about.  One of Pacino's better performances on screen.  In order to see its full effect, you have to get the unedited video; censored  television presentations take away too much of the quality of this picture.
1559408898|4.0|I enjoyed every moment of the movie.  With the Criterion version of the film, I had a chance to see several scenes not shown in the original theatrical version.  So why the 1.66:1 aspect ratio?  For anyone who  prefers to watch a movie in the widescreen (letterbox) format, it is  probably because one would want to see both the left and right quarters of  the screen that are cut off when shown in the full screen (pan &amp; scan)  format.  The people who are responsible for producing this version should  have made a decision as to present it in the typical 1.33:1 aspect ratio to  sell the movie to people who are normally confused as to why there are  those black bars on the top and bottom of the screen or go all the way (as  with movies like Terminator 2) with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and show the  movie like it was meant to be shown.  The people in this world who really  love movies (not just enjoy but really love) would like to see the entire  film.  Though this DVD is truly a wonderful film, I am disappointed in its  presentation.
6301008960|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorite movies.  I have been trying to find it for such a long time on video, I hope they release it on video again soon.  I wanted it for Christmas.
B000002NJS|5.0|Well Madonna has done it again, she has managed to turned out one of 1998's best! Orbit and her have managed to fuse electronica withpop viability that doesn't alienate the pop fans! Excellent stuff, strong  melodies and deep lyrics! APPLAUSE for the QUEEN OF POP! A true legendary  piece and a true legend herself!
0790733919|4.0|Cool Hand Luke is just great, classic viewing entertainment. Paul Newman's spirit of non-conformity is so powerful. When we see him smiling in that opening freeze-frame, That classic frame, right then and there we  automatically know we're dealing with a man who's head-and-shoulders above  the rest. The system will never understand him. There's this feeling that's  he's always got something up his sleeve for them. And we see that. There's  a quality of life in him, that, even by the end, is never extinguished.  Because his legacy carries on. Here's a man who won't betray who he is.  Refuses to be catagorized. You gotta love Luke for who he is. The system  can't keep him down. He's going to keep going..... push the limits......
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I got &quot;Battle of Los Angeles&quot; the day it came out, and I loved it!   My favorite songs on this album are &quot;Maria&quot; &quot;Voice of the Voiceless&quot; and the rest are also great.  The only bad thing about  this album is that it's only 45 minutes long, I can only wish that it was  75 minutes long, and I just can't understand why &quot;No Shelter&quot;  isn't on this cd.  But other than that, I think everone should get this cd  NOW!
B00000K19E|5.0|Love technology, love Sci-Fi, love super special effects? Then this is for you! This film has to be the best that I've seen in a LONG time! The special effects are wild and spectacular and the storyline is superb.<br />If  you've never wanted anything else for Christmas, want this! I thorougly  recommend it to all those who are willing to let go of 'reality' for a  while and submerge themselves in this thoroughly unique entertainment  experience.<br />Thumbs-up, Five Stars, 10 out of 10. Go get it!
B000020617|5.0|A great CD.  The first half pretty much keeps in step with &quot;The Colour and The Shape,&quot; but the second half is definitely softer.  However, it's not like these are power ballads or anything.  One of the  things that made the last record so great was the balance of harder and  softer songs.  On this one, they've just softened the extremes.  The  loudest songs are a bit quieter and the softest songs are a bit louder.   And every song on here has the definite Foo Fighters trademark sound.  This  collection is just as easy to enjoy as the last one, in my opinion.  Dave  Grohl can write songs - catchy, aggresive, creative music, strong lyrics.   This is definitely one of the best CD's out now.  A must-have!
B000002JSV|5.0|This one is awesome.Like in all AC/DC albums there has to be a song about Rock and Rock And Roll Damnation is it.Riff Raff and Sin City are awesome too.
0609603086|4.0|As entertaining as 'The Devil's Teardrop',with a powerful ending to rival &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; and a style perfect for the genre, I couldn't put it down. ( OK, I did a couple times . . . maybe even 3 or 4)  Four stars because it isn't up to the normal standards of Follett but still  good stuff.
B000002JS8|5.0|This one is a master piece.It was my 1st AC/DC CD.The title track,Girls Rhthym and Night Prowler are the best tracks.
B0000027F3|5.0|All the songs are good. Pure Heavy Metal. Guitars, drums, and of course,... the voice. Enjoy it!
B000002JS0|5.0|The critics blow, they say If You Want Blood is the second great ACDC album, thats bull.Songs from High Voltage,Dirty Deeds and Let There Be Rock made that album what it was.Anyway this is a great one, one of the best.
6304535570|1.0|Sad. That is the only word for it. What were they thinking. &quot;Hey, let's take Leslie Charteris' compelling hero, strip him (in more ways than one) of all humor and stick him in an Ian Fleming ripoff plot, add a 20-  something nuclear scientist, some sleazy sex and try to pawn it off on the  unsuspecting USA&quot;<br />If that isn't a conspiracy, I don't know what is.  Read the books, this movie eats IQ points.
B000002JST|5.0|This is a very well done album although there aren't any real hits.And why did they put Problem Child on this and Dirty Deeds?
B000002J3W|5.0|I HADN'T BOUGHT A SKID ROW ALBUM SINCE 1992'S B-SIDES OURSELVES WHEN I PICKED UP 1998'S 40 SEASONS-THE BEST OF SKID ROW.  I gave a listen to the songs from Subhuman Race(an album I had been told was bad. Follow  yourselves people) and i was so impressed i bought the album the same day.   WOW.  Heavier which may upset the &quot;I Remember You&quot; crowd but this  album is amazing. Lyrically, a major progression has taken place.  Songs  like &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Firesign&quot; are great examples of that  lyricism at work.  &quot;Breakin' Down&quot; a song written by  &quot;Snake&quot; Sabo should satisfy the ballad crowd as should  &quot;Eileen&quot;.  The album is a bit of a departure for the band but is  still down and dirty rock and roll, just like when the band started.  Rock  on MOTHER TRUCKERS!
B000001GBJ|5.0|This is the most relaxing and beautiful music you will ever hear.  After a long day it is just the right thing.  You won't be disappointed.
B000001F7R|5.0|Having been a Leppard Maniac for over 10 years(go easy, I am only 18), one album is still always spun in my cd player every day.  On Through The Night is that album.  What makes this album so radically different is that you  can almost hear a Progressive Metal leaning from the boys from Sheffield.   The band that made Pop Metal a thing of beauty show no sign of that sound  on this album.  The masterpiece song is one called &quot;Overture&quot;.   It begins slowly(with some great Hi-Hat rolls from Rick Allen) and then  becomes heavier only to go into a laid back funk guitar rhythm into the  slow beginning one more time.  Other songs like &quot;Answer to the  Master&quot;(featuring a drum solo that makes you wonder how Rick Allen  would sound today with 2 arms) and &quot;Wasted&quot; rock out heavy and  stand the test of time.  Other songs like &quot;When the Walls Came  Tumbling Down&quot; and &quot;Sorrow Is A Woman&quot; show a side of  Leppard few have seen.  They play out heavy while telling interesting  stories.  I love all Leppard but On Through The Night is a fave.  Give this  album a listen if you like DEF LEPPARD and ROCK AND ROLL.  DO YOU WANNA GET  ROCKED?
0385484518|5.0|I was deeply moved when I read &quot;tuesdays with Morrie&quot;. Beautiful thoughts, simple prose, full of insights about life and death. It's really a book for the living, not about the dead. It's a parting shot at all of us  who think being Number One is the only thing in life. Come to think of it,  what's really wrong in being Number 2? Good read.
B000001E21|5.0|Leave it to DEF LEPPARD to throw together an album of throwawaytracks and still have an album better than most I have heard.  RETROACTIVE combines songs from that span Leppard's 20 year career into one album.  &quot;Desert Song&quot; is the real great piece here. Lyrically and musically a step in the right direction for Leppard's SLANG album.  It is musically complex and a true tribute to the kind of guitar player Steve &quot;Steamin&quot; Clark was.  I had been a fan of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; since I first turned over my &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot; 45 and when I heard about this album i hoped it would be on it.  Not only was it on there, but the boys had gone and added a new intro to it that fit the song like a &quot;Velvet Glove&quot;.  I stole the term &quot;Velvet Glove&quot; from the album's second song &quot;Fractured Love&quot;, which begins with a tribal jungle drum beat into a dark mysterious beginning then goes into a hard rocking chorus that blows your socks off.  The triple guitar assult(Clark, Phil Collen and Vivian Campbell) sounds great and singer Joe Elliott has never sounded so good.  All in all a great album that really rocks.  DO YOU WANNA GET ROCKED?
B00000K19E|4.0|The first half of this movie reminded me of Dark City except the concept was a little darker but the actual sets were brighter.  The first half was amazing and mind-boggling.  But then they grab the guns and shoot at each  other the rest of the movie.  Really I think they really could have done a  better job with a more intelligent ending to the movie.  But it probaly  wouldn't have made half the money.  It's still worth seeing for the first  half though.
078322608X|5.0|This movie intrigues, stimulates thought, and fully provokes attention. I want to address the various criticisms. First, the movie does drag somewhat, especially at the asylum, yet all this is forgivable because  virtually every fact exposed in that segment serves as foundation for the  rest of the film. Second, the romance is depicted awkwardly and is indeed  unconvincing, but not entirely unbelievable; hence, this is a small flaw,  especially in a movie not intended as a romance. Third, the ending is  strange, and not entirely logical. I believe this resulted from Gilliam's  own indecision and ambivalence: It's nearly impossible to have an ending  that is deliberately subtle and unexplained, and leaves the audience  debating, and yet remain logical and coherent. The woman on the plane - the  scientist - is there to get a sample (if I understood the director's  comments), yet she is exposing herself to the virus. In the beginning, Cole  was told that a break in his suit would bar him from returning from the  surface, presumably because he would be carrying the virus. How then is the  scientist supposed to go back if she has been similarly exposed? There are  a few possibilities, but they are embarrassingly far-fetched. Convoluted?  Yes, but this movie has substance, unlike so many &quot;hits&quot; that  should shame their directors, producers and other garbage men. The DVD  (Collectors Edition) is very well done. The commentary augments the  experience a lot, and the &quot;Making of...&quot; is interesting. The  video quality is good, though not the best possible for a DVD. Unlike most  DVD purchasers, I tend to be parsimonious in my ratings. A 4.5 would be the  most accurate because of the few minor flaws in this package.
B000000QFY|2.0|If you are looking for more tracks like the &quot;rock&quot; single &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, you won't find them on this CD. There is some good guitar work, but the cd is mostly slow and lathargic. Check out Gary Hoeys  cover of &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;
6302649943|2.0|Although the book was the best I've ever read, and Stephen King did a stupendous job in both his character descriptions and plot, the movie was terrible.  Not only has the movie eliminated important parts of the overall  story, the acting outside of that done by Tim Curry is extremely poor.  For  example, the scene where Bill rushes off to get Eddie's inhaler as he fears  that he might die, yet when he returns he is breathing comfortably.  After  this movie, Stephen King should no longer let his books be turned into  movies.
6305603847|5.0|The music here is somewhat different (and better) than the CD version. The film is about this century's evils, as seen by Pink: the wars, hitlerism, neo-nazism, half-orphanage, abuse of children in British schools, teenage  rebelion, destruction of traditional values, capitalist sprawl in the US,  its consequences, drugs, etc.
0553278223|5.0|This book is simply haunting. I love it, and you will too
0156528207|5.0|This book shows life at a childs point of view, and has graet meaning and symbolizem. All children, and adults should read this book. And I garenty you will love The Little Prince!
B000009ED0|1.0|I had given this CD a rave review several months back, but now I don't think it's that great anymore. For all the fun I had listening to tracks like &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; and &quot;Devil Without A Cause&quot;, it just  isn't enjoyable anymore. I said that Kid Rock's tales of the decadent life  were backed up by awesome beats, or words to that effect, but it just seems  a little odd that Kid Rock, who has kids of his own, would rap about doing  drugs and having sex with dozens of partners. Yeah, great messages to send  to your kids, Kid! I'm bound to get a lot of misspelled, foul-mouthed  messages from ill-tempered teenyboppers, slackers, posers and homeboys, but  these are the views that I now hold! Sorry!
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice And Men is one of my alltime favorite books. It is so thought provocking, and is a book that should be read by every one. So If You haven't read this book, do yourself a favor, and read it!
6303402348|3.0|so built-up by the time that i saw it that i was expecting some epiphanic experience.  don't believe the hype.
B00000JPH6|5.0|My wife and I saw this movie in the theater when it was released and loved it. We waited and waited for it to come out on VHS. I bought our DVD player sort of without letting her (my wife)know. She was not real pleased...  until I brought home this disc. The clarity and colors are even more  stunning on the TV screen then we remember them and the 5.1 soundtrack  raises the hair on the back of your neck with surround realism. Thanks to  the Dark Crystal I am no longer in the dog house. NOW ...about that larger  monitor  ... ...hhmmmmmmmm.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|They have regained the agressiveness and passion of their first album. Better than Evil Empire, not as good as the self-titled. I can't wait till they come to Atlanta! Rage is probably the best band around right now.
B0000060NF|5.0|Gaye's personal/political tract surprises with its mellow tones wrapped around stinging lyrics. He never sang or wrote better than this. A brilliant effort, and my nomination as the best album of the Rock era.
039492472X|5.0|willy wonka is a wonderful book, you need to read this to you children or to your-self!  i read this over and over again. read this book and go into the wonderful world of willy wonka!
B000002UAO|4.0|After a take of &quot;I'm Down&quot; featured on Anthology Vol.2 Paul laments &quot;plastic soul man plastic soul&quot;. This album reflects their attitude to the music, not being rock'n'roll anymore, and not yet  fully fledged Art a la &quot;Pepper&quot;.<br />The Beatles were astute enough  (with George Martin's firm but gentle encouragement) to explore new musical  sounds based on contemporary West Coast styles (the Byrds, Beachboys) and  exotic Eastern offerings (Ravi Shankar). But this new musical foundation  doesn't completely compensate for some below par songs - &quot;The  Word&quot;, &quot;What Goes On&quot;, even &quot;Drive My Car&quot; (saved  by a strong groove), weak lyrical &quot;sampling&quot; (&quot;Run For Your  Life&quot;; see Artur Gunter's &quot;Baby Let's Play House&quot;)and tired  playing &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and &quot;Wait&quot;. But its best  are brilliant, opening the door to imaginative and inventive Rock  structures which consigned the three minute format to strictly Top 40 pop.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I think that this cd is way better thatn anything Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock or Korn could ever do. This cd is definitely a must have.
B000020617|5.0|I have been a fan of the Foos from the start, but this new album is certainly the most enjoyable Foo effort to date.  The album still rocks, but is has a more mellow tone.  That makes the music palatable to my wife,  who now has even become a Foo fan too (and lets me play the record in the  car).  I'm sure this album will be disappointing to Foo fans who want all  hard-edge alternative rock (the album has some of that too).  But for those  of us who love rock, but want a more mature and refined sound, this album  is the best!  &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; is a classic to be.
B000008LH5|4.0|I saw Ten Years After early in their careers at the Fillmore in New York. Then I saw them at Woodstock and then at The Arc in Boston. They are one of the greatest rock acts ever, live or in the studio. The unfortunate thing  about this album (and this is only my selfish opinion) is that the  engineering (overall sound) quality lacks here. For the most part Alvin Lee  fulfills his role as one of rock's greatest guitarists. &quot;Choo-choo  Mama&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot; and &quot;I Can't  Keep From Crying&quot;  knock me out. &quot;Help Me&quot; was the first TYA  production I ever heard. It's up to par here. I have to say that their  signature song, &quot;I'm Going Home&quot; is not the best on this album.  The Woodstock version remains the best rendition I've ever heard. That's  not becuse I was there but it is just so complete in terms of defining the  group's rock and roll abilities. As I said, if you like TYA, buy this disc.
B000002J1M|5.0|Recommended for anyone who enjoys great prog.  This is a cornerstone for your library.  &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; is simply the best Genesis song ever written.<br />The sonic quality is not great (it was a low budget  recording), but the performance is simply breathtaking.<br />A must for any  Prog collector.
0312117337|5.0|The design and messages contained in this deck and book lend themselves to be used less for prediction of the future and more for revelation of inner experience.  And, wow!, does it ever do that!  A fantastic and fun tool for  self reflection and discovery, offering the opportunity for self  transformation.  I highly recommend the Osho Zen Tarot for anybody open to  receiving valuable insights and who is ready to become a more beautiful  person.
B00000AFGM|4.0|This is a very good cd with several good songs, but if u want his best work you should but antichrist svperstar it's much better.  With songs like dope show, rock is dead, i don't like the drugs(but they like me), come  white, andbig white worls this cd is a worthwhile buy if u like manson and  i recommend if your a big fan or a first timer this is a good cd to buy.
0790729407|5.0|Excellent movie with excelent cinimatics, deffiantly worth the price. Watch, learn, and enjoy.
B0000025D0|5.0|First of all, let's set the record straight: &quot;Darkness&quot; is not better than born to run, it's just different.  Gone is the youthful naivete found on its predecessor; it has been replaced by a hard-won maturity and  acceptance.  This album says that life is tough, but life is not something  to run away from.  The answers are not just across the county line or in  some far-away fantasy world; they exist in the individual.  For the first  time we see Springsteen embracing reality, not trying to create some  fantastical universe where the guy gets the girl and they live happily ever  after.  In fact, I remember Bruce saying something about how in his  previous albums the guy always got the girl and they rode off into the  sunset...but this was the first album where he began to question,  &quot;Yeah, and then what?&quot;   Well, this album contains every kind of  &quot;then what&quot; you can imagine.  Throughout the album, Bruce  acknowledges the difficulty and pain we experience in life, but he says  that we must keep going (&quot;Badlands&quot;).  Going for what, you say?   Well, &quot;The Promised Land,&quot; of course; and in this song he says  that he believes that life is still worth living, despite shattered  illusions and broken dreams.  The people who give up are also a constant  force on this album, especially on songs like &quot;Racing in the  Street&quot;.  On this song, Bruce divides the world into two types of  people:  those who die a little bit more every day, and those who go home  every night, get dressed up, and go racing in the street.  Unlike the  characters in &quot;Born to Run,&quot; it doesn't even seem to matter if  they find the fulfillment they are looking for.  What matters is that they  continue to search.   I haven't even begun to talk about the music, either,  have I?  Well, the recording of this album ushers in a new Bruce; there is  no Wall of Sound, no jazzy, funky E Street Band jamming.  This album is  full of twisted guitar solos by Bruce, and it is the first time his guitar  skills are completely realized.  This may be the most &quot;guitar&quot;  album he's ever done.  But don't get me wrong: you still get the rest of  the E Street Band in full force: Max Weinberg and his thundering drums,  Clarence Clemons with that saxophone.  This album has a certain stark  quality to it; however, it is not nearly as stark and simplistic as later  efforts such as &quot;Nebraska&quot; and &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad.&quot;   It's a great rock album, but it's not JUST a great rock album.  Bruce  become a philosopher here, the prophet we disciples followed into the next  decade with the release of its sequel, &quot;The River.&quot;  And if Bruce  is a prophet, this masterpiece of an album surely must be our guiding  light.     In many ways, &quot;Darkness&quot; is better than &quot;Born to  Run.&quot;  It surely is more textured and somehow throughout the record  Bruce establishes a connection with his listener like he never has before.   On previous albums, he played for us; on this album, he preaches and  instructs us.     Bruce Springsteen changed tremendously, both musically  and personally, between 1975 and 1978.  As he sings in &quot;The Promised  Land&quot;:  &quot;Mister, I ain't a boy, no, I'm a man, and I believe in  the Promised Land.&quot;  On this album, he takes us there.
B000001OAA|5.0|Shirley Manson is a great vocal talent.  Her songs are wry, witty, and hauntingly beautiful.  They talk to you using cyber-music, hard rock, and her amazing lyrics.  The best songs: Queer, Only Happy When it Rains, Dog  New Tricks, My Lover's Box, and Fix me Now.  Especially Fix me Now, a  beautiful, wonderful song with great music.  Get this CD.  Is Garbage  coming out with another CD after Version 2.0?
0394720288|5.0|Wodehouse is in my opinion the most underrated author in the englich language. He is too often dismissed as merely writing 'amusing' and escapist  fiction which offers no insight into our soceity or the lives we  lead.  I would like to point out to the advocates of so called  &quot;serious literature&quot; that Wodehouse invokes in us the most basic  feeling we can experience...laughter. I cannot help but be overcome by  Wodehouse's unbelievably adept use of the english language to create the  most hilariously subtle situation comedy ever written. I cant recommend  this book strongly enough. Wodehouse exhausts all superlatives!
B000002AGB|5.0|I've been a Who fan since a teen in the 60s, listening to 45s such as Happy Jack, I'm a Boy, Magic Bus, and later into the 70s. In 70-7l Live at Leeds was issued, definitely one of the finest live r&amp;r albums ever.   This Isle of Wight material lay in the vaults for 25 years, only to see  day's light in the 90s. It is an awesome, exceptionally outstanding  performance as well. a number of the cuts are on Live at Leeds, but this  double CD also contains material from Tommy. all in all a fantastic record,  with superb sound quality as well - many of these songs on this double CD  can be found on the &quot;unofficial&quot; Who LPs and CDs (the booltlegs),  but the quality of the bootleg materials is at times not the finest.  This  Isle of Wight disc may not be for lukewarm or part-time fans of Who music,  but for those wanting to hear the live concert history, this is a must!  also exceptional liner notes.
B000002MZ6|5.0|Absolutely beautiful....great mood music !
B00002MZ2C|3.0|It's an old Rage question, but one their fans and Rage's members have never answered: this band works for Sony/Epic. They allowed themselves to be part of the hideous, digusting spectacle that was Woodstock '99, and no  amount of &quot;Well, they criticized it while they were there&quot;  rhetoric seems to absolve the them. A smart Spin review fudged all this in  an admirable attempt to defend the band; but they're unquestionably  corporate, when there are other paths (see Fugazi, Ani). Though this album  is a blast, I'm finding the gulf between their leftist posturing and the  way they conduct themselves pretty pathetic. Free Mumia? Free yourselves...
6301174240|5.0|This movie is a biographical look into Michael's life as a pop icon. Even now, people love and respect him... even if the media doesn't. He is a legend and is a GOD!
0790736942|4.0|Watching The Exorcist in the present day, comparing it to other movies, I want to say that it would be considered &quot;sloppy filmaking&quot; in today's standards.  Some of the editing throughout the film is atrocious, and the sets and wardrobe look understandably dated.  But not in a good way  unfortunately.<br />There are many long, drawn out scenes of boreing dialogue,  usually concerning Regan's condition.  Too many of these scenes in fact.   The whole first half of the film is leading up to what we all REALLY want  to see...Regan going beserk as she is being possessed by the  devil. The scenes of Regan tied to the bed, spitting up pea soup and  cussing like a drunken sailor on payday more than make up for the sluggish  pace this film.  It is so ultimately disturbing to watch how evil takes  over this child's entire body.  To watch every facial movement and reaction  of Linda Blair's performance is incredible.  She convinced me!
B000002UZ1|5.0|Although you are probably better off buying the Beatles later albums to get a better sense of their later years, this collection is great as an overview and an introduction.  Although some of the Sgt. Pepper tracks seem  lost outside of the context of that fantastic album, one can overlook that  in this collection.  The Beatles continued to change the face of music  until their breakup and created some beautiful songs.  Alas, all good  things must come to an end, but what a great thing and what an end! Also  recommended: Abbey Road, White Album, Let It Be, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely  Hearts Club Band and Magical Mystery Tour.
0446525537|3.0|A fast read, reasonably good but with little depth.  Sweet, Funny, Sad, and Predictable come to mind to describe the story and most of the characters.  What it does do, is allow the reader who lived during the  1950's to recollect what young love was about then as opposed to what it is  perceived to be now. Clearly a reasonable value at the retail level, and a  bargain thanks to the Internet.
B000002UYZ|5.0|The Beatles took American rock and roll and brought their British sound to it and made it something really special.  Everyone writing rock and roll music today owes a debt to the Beatles.  All the songs here are pop music  at their finest. There are great love songs &quot;And I Love Her&quot; and  &quot;She Loves You&quot;, heartbreak songs &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;  and &quot;Ticket To Ride&quot;, plus a glimpse of the Beatles' strangeness  to come: &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and &quot;Paperback Writer.&quot;    Also, &quot;Yesterday&quot; is arguably the best song of the last centruy.   Some things are missing, like their great covers of &quot;Twist and  Shout&quot; and &quot;You've Really Got a Hold On Me&quot;, but those point  to the past, not to the Beatles' future.  This is a great introduction to  the Beatles and should not be ignored by any music lover of any age.  John,  Paul, George, and Ringo changed the world with their sweet harmonies, and  the world still thanks them.
B000021XS0|5.0|This album is awesome.  Very complex, and some of the most beautiful melodies I've ever heard, yet still being progressive metal, very odd.  The only way you might not like this music, is if you are expecting something  as shallow as KoRn (no offense to KoRn fans).
B00000J6AG|5.0|moby has done excellent with this album...i cannot get enough. it moves me inside, my heart is in my throat, it brings joy and sadness at the same time. this album is very spiritual, on a musical level.
0783221487|2.0|I can't imagine how anyone who hasn't read the book could possibly even make the slightest sense out of this movie.  And it's one of the worst book-to-movie translations I've ever seen.  They couldn't even get the  costumes right, much less the characters and story.  Let's all hope next  year's six-hour TV rendition is vastly better than this mess of a movie.
B000002UW1|5.0|Ranks right up there with U2's &quot;Achtung, Baby&quot; and Led Zeppelin's &quot;IV&quot; as a historic album and one of rock's greatest examples.  Every song on here is strong--with funky rhythms, ingenious  songwriting, catchy (but often deep) vocals, gorgeous ballads, and  perfeclty-placed touches like horns and keyboards.  A breakthrough for REM  and a cherished musical masterpiece for the rest of the world.  What more  can I say?  Most R.E.M. albums are excellent.  This one's perfect.
B000002L7G|5.0|This early Dire Straits is one of their best, showing the range of the band and the enormous talent of Mark Knopfler.  Some years ago it made a Dire Straits fan of me, and I keep coming back to this album.  A must for  your DS collection.
0399143904|2.0|I have been a Tom Clancy fan for a long time, ever since the release of &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot; which was by far the all-time best of Tom Clancy (as well as the movie! ) I was sadly disappointed in Rainbow Six  for more reasons than I can list here.  The book is entirely too long for  such a limited storyline. The details strayed far from the well researched  &quot;techno-babble&quot; that I'm used to from Mr. Clancy; who cares about  every little movement the character makes, or breathes or sighs? Well I  don't, it gets VERY boring. I read the hardcover...and it was hard! Hard to  hold...darn heavy and I'm no weakling it's just bulky, but it's great for  the collection and in the event I need a large prop. I have a feeling this  book was written to compliment the computer game... not the other way  around.  Come on Tom, you can do better than this.
0679601910|2.0|I don't know what all of you are talking about. I found this book to be boring, bourgeois and completely unsympathetic. I can not imgaine anyone relating to any of these characters, unless you are extremely rich and live  in 19th century England.It was, however, well written.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage does not pull any punches on this one.  Mic Check offers a unique vibe I have not heard on the previous two.  Testify is a fitting start that sets up the album nicely.  They have progressed subtlely on this effort.   The best bands are the bands that do not force change(U2) but rather go  with where they are truly at as a band.  Can't wait to see them live.  Seen  them 4 times and it is easily the most powerful rock and roll show out   there.
B000002W5J|4.0|Dude, I like to wander in cow fields with this album on my head phones.  But that dern White Knight always talks backward, and the Red Queen's &quot;Off with her head!&quot;  &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Embrionic  Journey&quot; are nice, but I like the live version of &quot;Somebody To  Love&quot; on &quot;Bless It's Pointed Little Head&quot; better than the  one here.  Remember what the door mouse said, &quot;Feed Your Head.&quot;
0792842723|5.0|Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond ever.I was so bored when I watched Licence to kill and The living daylights I almost fell asleep.Pierce  gave life back to Bond.He's the greatest of them all...
B0000062FJ|4.0|This is my favorite Santana album.  Being their first, it is not as diverse or exploratory as others, but its consistency is solid.  I am a huge fan of blues music, and this album is Santana's most outwardly bluesy  album. &quot;Persuasion&quot; and &quot;Treat&quot; are wonderful.  And the  Woodstock cut of &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; was absolutely one of the most  intense renditions of any song at that concert.  And Jimi Hendrix was  there. Now, to even come close to Hendrix, one must whip-a**, and  &quot;Soul Sac&quot; does just that.  Check the drum solo.  Whoa.   &quot;Fried Neckbones&quot; also teems with bubbling intensity. And for you  Top 40 pop rocker dudes, &quot;Evil Ways&quot; should keep your  unadventursome ears off of the radio for a while.  Along with &quot;The  Doors,&quot; &quot;Are You Experienced,&quot; and &quot;Led Zeppelin  1,&quot; this album is one of the finest debuts of the 60s.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This album shows the immense growth in RATM's musicianship.  This is their best album from first to last song.  There are more subtleties to the music and the funk level has been cranked to max+1.  Calm Like A Bomb and Mic  Check will groove you into submission while Born of a Broken Man and New  Millenium homes will hit you full on with their heavy riff attack.  Zack's  MCing in Maria gets a flow on like few MC's in the hip-hop world.  Educate  yourselves and get rocked in the process.  This album comes highly  recommended.
B00000JCOV|4.0|This album is very intense. I do hear some Korn influence in the music but the song writing is much different. Where Korn is melodic and hip hoppy, Slipknot is heavy and death metal like. I like the change from the  mainstream and it's an enjoyable album. The only downside (the reason I  didn't give it 5 stars) is that there is a lot of useless noise using up  space on the disk. Forget the stupid synth and sample intros and get to  good stuff - also the production could have been better. Worth a  listen.......
0792833686|5.0|When I say this film, I almost died laughing. The talking lessons, the first &quot;talkie&quot;; they were the most hilarious moments in film I have ever encountered. 'Nuff said.
0446525537|5.0|This book was the best one that I have read in quite a while...one that I just could not put down until I was finished.  And then, when I was finished, I felt disappointed that it was over.   Once again, Nicholas  Sparks has done a wonderful job and my only regret is that I have to wait  for his next book.
B00000294R|5.0|The hip-hop culture has lost one of the illest along with the great ones gone before our time. Just imagine a hip-hop concert in heaven with Big L, the Notorious B.I.G., 2-Pac, ,Eazy-E, Freaky Tah as the hype man, and Scott  La Rock as the d.j. The show would feature the 4 emcees freestyling over  Buffy's  beat box. A ticket for that type of concert........ priceless!
B0000028VT|4.0|Considering that Mariah Carey drifted more and more into rap and &quot;screaming&quot; without sense, &quot;Music Box&quot; is seemingly her last really good album. &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Anytime you need a  friend&quot; and the cover &quot;Without you&quot; are great songs and  clearly among Mariah's best. Some other songs on this album are  &quot;fillers&quot; - that's why it didn't make it to get 5 stars.  Otherwise a good album!
0783229887|3.0|This was an all right movie, but I thought the other ones were better.  The Child's Play series is getting corny, starting to be a spoof on themselves.  &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; was more funny than it was scary,  but there're not really supposed to be scary, are they?  I recommend that  you rent it first, and see how you like it.  A true Child's Play fan would  probably want to buy it, but it's safer to rent.
B000002LGQ|3.0|This album of Madonna contains a bunch of excellent songs - including the title track which is probably one of her best songs ever - but also a too large quantity of &quot;fillers&quot;. To enjoy this album simply skip the  fillers - but is that worth paying the price of a full album?
6300248550|5.0|Great adaptation all around! There is not one actor miscast, not one word superflous or missing. Zealah Clarke is gentle, kind, modest but strong and independent Jane Eyre, and Timothy Dalton is dark, melancholic, but kind  and passionate Rochester. I adored Mr. Brockelhurst--great performance,  Mrs. Fairfax--perfect portrayal. All of the cast had the grasp of the  manners, language of that time. Beatiful!
B0000028P8|4.0|This album is from the good old days when Mariah still sang beautiful songs with her beautiful voice. It's a great live performance and very pleasant listening experience. Especially &quot;Vision of Love&quot; and  &quot;I'll be there&quot; are fantastic. Why only 4 stars then? Because  first of all it's very short (only about half an hour) and secondly, well,  not every song on this album is really that fantastic. Still, it's one of  her best albums and highly recommendable!
B000006045|5.0|I continue to wait for MA's next album with baited breath. Mezzanine is arguably their best, even though it is quite different from previous offerings.  All the tracks meld into each other and it is possible to get  lost in this feast and not even notice the time slip by.  When its over you  just want more!  Teardrop is a song that will haunt the recesses of your  mind and could be described as alien in its form.  One of the best albums  of the nineties (Moby's Play in close contention).  Buy it before Y2K in  case the electricity stops flowin'!
B000002N3J|5.0|This album is about as good as Madonna can get! A wonderful collection of ballads, simply perfect! However I usually skip the first track - it's being repeated at the end in a much nicer version. Still, this album is  indeed &quot;something to remember&quot;!
B000003S09|5.0|Who knows where Fripp, Lake, Giles et al would have gone...perhaps it is difficult to go anywhere when the first album you release puts you at the top.  I have been listening to this cd again now, having purchased this  anniversary edition, some twenty-odd years after I first heard the vinyl  edition and wondered just where were these guys coming from and how was  anyone supposed to 'label' such different music.  But in the end I realised  what any crimson fan does eventually...Crimson is not about labels its  simply about about listening and enjoying.  I wonder what else this version  of the band could have done...imagine three or four more albums from this  band...but then we might never have had 'Larks...' and 'Red', and we would  be much the poorer for it.  As ever Crimson needed to move on...to  evolve...and to remain relevant.  Still I invite you...buy this cd and  embark on one of the great musical odysseys' still available...if you've  never heard Crimson then man are you in for a treat...or on the other hand  if you are like me and simply wondered how this music would stand up after  all these years...as the man says...do yourself a favour...and return to  the time when the mellotron was king.  Comparison wise?...I don't like to  compare KC albums...but if I must its on a par with Larks and these two  stand above all others I think...but not by much.
B000001AKM|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of Lionel Richie's greatest hits. You can listen to it over and over again and it never fades. Get it!
B000002B35|5.0|This double-CD set contains a substantial number of my favorite songs, performed well live. Gilmour's vocals have improved since DSoT. &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; sounds stronger to me than the studio  recording(s). &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; stands out. &quot;Run Like  Hell&quot; has a more fierce sound than the studio cut. Of course, covering  such a large body of Floyd work, I will not have space to comment on the  quality of all recordings. As for this whole deal in which people show off  their patriotism for Roger Waters by giving the performance one star and  pretending it doesn't sound good, posting something like &quot;Not Floyd  with no Waters,&quot; I believe this is a rather dishonest way to present a  review of a CD. A balanced and rational personality would at least give a  realistic, medium review, rather than giving it the lowest possible rating.  (Really, if the rating is that low, I would think that either the  songwriting must be abominable, or the musicians are untalented. Take your  pick.) Giving the album a one-star rating on account of Waters' absence is  a polemical reaction inspired by fear that some people might actually  *like* the way the CD sounds. (Gasp.)
B000002BQK|2.0|While there are a couple of acceptable songs (including the title track) on this album, overall it remains a clear disappointment and cannot live up to Mariah's early works. It seems that the rising amount of flesh visible  on the album cover is negatively correlated with the quality of the music  (see also &quot;Rainbow&quot;). Less &quot;screaming&quot; and rap and more  quality ballads would suit a singer with her potential better.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|Playing By Heart has recently replaced Singles for me as my favorite movie.  It absolutely blows me away.  Just to see Sean Connery and Jon Stewart interacting with Scully (I mean Gillian Anderson's character  Merideth) was worth it! Kudos to Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie, and  Dennis Quaid as well.  This movie has the uncanny ability to make you cry  with sadness one moment and happiness the next.  This is definitely  tremendous movie-making.  Oh, and the ending - you will never have seen it  coming.
B000021XR5|3.0|&quot;Purple&quot; is still the best CD that STP has cut.  This CD is a little bland, with just a couple of tracks that really stand out.
B000021XS0|5.0|I was and I am amazed by this cd when I ordered on amazon. These guys did a great job recording this cd. I've been reading some of the reviews other people wrote about the cd. I agree with some.With others,I don't.I espected  James LaBrie to soar high with his vocals,but he didn't. But hey...the rest  of the band did a GREAT job and a MAGNIFICENT performance. The  &quot;story&quot; that sorrounds the entire production is 5 stars  anywhere;from &quot;regression&quot; to &quot;finally free&quot;.All those  Dream Theater fans should listen carefully this cd.At the  end.....maybe....you will like it.For me..it's one of the best cd's Dream  Theater has to offer.
0393317552|4.0|A very provocative book for the unintiated. For those with a curiosity for the history of the world but with little more than a host of opinions to work with, this book is a lightning strike. Although repetitive by the end,  the book states quite clearly a very compelling thesis for the reasons the  world is the way it is today. Short on sociology (why the Spanish conquered  South America has to do with more than their ability to do so; why did they  feel the need to conquer and destroy as opposed to just discover and  co-exist?) but gob-smackingly long and precise on entho-biology and  -geography, this book will please and thrill the open-minded. I highly  recommend it.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|New RATM cd means great songs: - Mick Chek - Amazing Excellent guitar - Sleep now in the fire - One of the best ever - Maria - No words - Born of a broken man - I cant wait for the life version - All of them are  incredible..... I think that Battle is not the best album , but it's better  than Evil Empire. Not enough songs for me, I need mooorrreee............
B000002NJS|2.0|While it should be credited to Madonna that she has proven to be very versatile and often tries something new, this time she didn't really hit the bull's eye. A couple of songs (mainly the hit singles) on this album  are pretty okay but the rest is really horrifying. This overly electronic  music makes you nervous! There are many better albums in Madonna's rich  opus. The best about this one here is the pictures in the booklet. So if  you care about the music, you better buy another Madonna CD!
B00000JMQC|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about eight years old and I have loved it ever since.  It's different from the Wizard of Oz, but has some similar contrasts.  The imagery and symbolism of this movie was just amazing.  I  was finally able to purchase the movie from Amazon after an endless search  for years of trying to find it.  I love the characters- Tic Tock, Gallina,  the wheelers, Princess Mumbe with the collection of heads and of course the  gump.  This is one movie that won't disappoint anyone.  I would recommend a  parent watching it with their children however because it can get scary and  ackward at times!
6300213714|5.0|I'm David Shaber's daughter, Sam, (Samantha.)  My father wrote the screenplay for The Warriors, and I'm hoping this &quot;review&quot; gets printed because he just passed away on Thursday morning, November 4th, of a  sudden burst anneurism. With so many &quot;Warriors&quot; fans out there, I  thought you would want to know.  I'm incredibly warmed by these wonderful  comments about this film and I know that if he read them (although he had  barely learned how to search the internet before he died) he would chuckle  in his lighthearted way and say something like &quot;Oh, well isn't that  nice,&quot; all-the-while refusing to take credit for any of it.  But I  know he deserved that credit, having taken a dark, psychological study of  gang warfare and infusing it with a classic but clever and topical, good  vs. evil story.  (And maybe I shouldn't admit it, but my dad didn't really  like the baseball face-paint idea which I believe was one of Walter Hill's  additions - he thought that was too unrealistic and  &quot;Hollywood&quot;...)  Anyway, I do hope the movie is re-issued with  the extra scenes at some point, and for those real &quot;followers&quot; I  just discovered that you can find a complete list of his produced titles on  the Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com) if you want to check it out.  The  Warriors is indeed an AFFECTING picture, whether you love it or hate it.   So thanks for your comments and take care,  -Sam.
B000002I25|5.0|This album is the great debut from the group. It's more psychedelic than their last LA Woman album. It's personally my favorite with &quot;Strange Days&quot;. You shouldn't only focus on Morrison. All this music is so  perfect and will give you the famous &quot;strange mood&quot; that the  other music couldn't give you. Really unique. Love it.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix combines elements from Alice in Wonderland, Dune (the book, not the awful movie), Terminator, the Borg from Star Trek and various other movies, to create a sci-fi masterpiece.  Oh yeah, the effects are stunning  too.  I would turn up the volume of your sub-woofer to really experience  this movie in Dolby Digital!
0783231032|4.0|I am sorry to hear that so many people did not like this film.  It would have to be one of my all time favorites.  Yah, there's a lot of screaming.  Yah, there's a lot of running around.  Yah, there's a lot of overacting,  but this is what makes it so great.  No thinking needed.  A wonderful sit  down-eat a snack-drink a beverage of your choice movie.  Don't expect a  high quality movie, but do expect a comedy that can leave you laughing.   Some great names in there as well.
0380973464|5.0|Easily characters to identify with.  Great dual-timeline plot that ties both today's business and technology with the science/math advances of WWII.
0425170349|4.0|I ENJOYED THIS BOOK, ALTHOUGH IT COULD HAVE BEEN SHORTER.  CERTAINLY, SCARY....A MUST READ IF YOU ARE A CLANCY FAN, OTHERWISE, READ HIS OTHERS FIRST.
1573225517|3.0|A good book on modern man in his thirties. A very easy read, with some intelligent wit. As I was reading it, I thought it seemed perfect for a movie adaptation...which is in the process now.
B000002UEB|5.0|I'm listening to the CD at work right now. Still a great album. A lot of the metal albums I loved 12 years ago are unlistenable now, but this album has stood up well.
B000003N7K|5.0|This short CD contains the most soothing, mellifluous collection of jazz standards ever. I have nearly worn my CD out from playing it during countless dinner parties, romantic dates, and bubble baths--not all on the same night, mind you!
B00000IMTF|5.0|This album is so superb, it prompted my 11 year old son to declare that Richie Blackmore is the greatest guitarist and made Rainbow his favorite band! In fact, it has heavily influenced his guitar playing and increased  his enthusiasm for the instrument itself. RISING is their finest moment and  as my son says, &quot;they don't makem like they used to!&quot;
0767817478|1.0|this movie needs for Godzilla to fight other monsters and there is the fact that in most other Godzilla movies Godzilla protects the human race by fighting other monsters in this movie it goes way far from other Godzilla  movies by saying Godzilla was formed from an iguana while the closest story  to this is Godzilla forming from a giant dinosaur.
B0000062GK|5.0|As I read the reviews for this incredible CD by professional journalists, I find myself scratching my head in bewilderment. With all of the hip hop, MTV, sampling and the hit parade from hell, you would think critics would  be wetting their pants over artists who actually are massively talented and  play their own instruments - as well as writing original material. But let  Puff Daddy sample \\"Every Breath You Take\\" or Steely Dan's \\"Black Cow\\" and  rap over the lyrics, and the critics will fall to their knees with  sickening praise. There was once a time when musicians played their  instruments. They developed and blossomed as artists. The record companies  cultivated musicians and creativity was saluted. <br />This CD is a prime  example of how I remember guitar rock was - loud, aggressive and  passionate! Turn off the damn album rock radio that is programmed by  marketing twits and turn up \\"Crystal Planet!\\"
044022425X|5.0|This is, by far, the best series of books I have ever read!  It is extremely difficult to put them down.  A person can't help but fall in love with all of the characters, especially Jamie Fraser.  It makes one wonder  if there are any men out there that can compare.....I know I will be  impatiently awaiting book number five!
0684867621|2.0|I am an avid King fan however this book was sort of boring from the start.  It was hard to continue reading it at times.  The story line seemed not to move to fast.  I had a hard time concentrating on the book and pushed myself to finish it.  Not the great bizare type of book you expect from Mr.  King. Sort of disappointed.
0380973464|5.0|This book is everything a geek wants, and written well to boot.  Although I found his digressions into the intricacies of Unix system administration fascinating, not everyone might.  But if you know what I mean by &quot;Unix  system administration&quot; you'll love it.
B000025APX|5.0|this cd is easily the equal of once sent from the golden hall.  It's probably the best viking metal cd released to date.  My only complaint is the length.  the cd is only 36 minutes long.  The songs contained within  these 36 minutes however are terrific.  I've never heard something so heavy  yet so melodic.  the only thing which comes close is Opeth or in flames.   The new drummer more than adequatley fills in for Martin lopez and the band  is now actually a full quintet.  I reccomend this cd for anyone who likes  metal especially those who like WAR
6304411448|5.0|This is a great curl-up with bag of popcorn when your all alone movie. Sam (Jonny Depp) is just about irresistible. Every woman can see a little of them selves in this movie and every woman would love to have a guy like Sam  around to clean house, make dinner, and then turn in to Jonny Depp and take  you to bed.
B0000025RI|5.0|I'am a huge Michael Jackson fan and this is my all time favorite album done by him!  Whoever commeted that the album is a waste of money HAS TO BE ON DRUGS!  Let alone he is the greatest entertainer to ever walk this  planet!  Much love to the greatest human alive THE KING OF POP Michael  Jackson!
B000002LQR|5.0|this is a superb album that virtually every song is excellent. under the bridge is a modern masterpiece that everyone deserves to hear at least once. this album is immense!
6305537798|2.0|I'm going to disagree with all the 13 year old swooners that reviewed this film.  This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever laid eyes on, it's lone redeeming qualities were Larry Miller (Kat and Bianca's  father, who is pretty much hilarious in everything he does) and Joseph  Gordon Levitt.  Every character in this film was one dimensional and there  was no developement at all.  Kat was the WOMAN POWER! male hater (She would  have made a good pro choicer in Stephen King's &quot;Insomnia&quot;, but  that's another story).  Bianca was the bubble headed ditz, Joey was the  chisled Italian jock whose range of emotions went from arrogant...to  arrogant...to arrogant...to arrogant...to, well you get the idea.  I  suppose the rough australian punk (whose name I've completely forgotten)  was a decent character in his own right as well.  But Gordon Levitt's audio  visual friend is the stereotypical geek who ends up getting a girl by the  grace of God on high at the film's climax.  To even put &quot;The Taming of  the Shrew&quot; in the same sentence with this movie would be a grave  injustice.  The only reason I gave it two stars is Miller, Levitt, and the  out takes at the end.  Those were pretty hilarious.
B000020617|5.0|Poor Grohl, do you ever think you'll be able to get out of Kurt's shadow?  There's not much to say except this is a great album to add to your  library. It isn't like Colour and the Shape.  There's a moderate and  interesting twist to their style and Dave's vocals.  My only whine is that  some of the songs don't hook quite as strong compared to Colour and the  Shape... but that's just by a little bit.  Regardless, it looks like the  Foo Fighters will stay one of the very few mainstream bands that I enjoy.  You can't deny their talent... They rock, plain and simple.
0345347951|5.0|A truly incredible book, in my opinion Clarke's best ever.  Great characters, great ideas, great plot twists.  Makes you laugh and cry.  Read it. :)
0446525537|5.0|I loved this book!  I have read Message in a Bottle and seen the movie several times.  This book was so awesome and I loved how Sparks brought in the spiritual aspect and did it well.  I have not read The Notebook yet,  but intend to do so in the coming days!  Keep them coming Nicholas Sparks!  It is so cool to see a man who can write this way....I love it!
6305313687|5.0|I'm amazed at the impact this film had on me. Edward Norton is dead on in his portrayal of Derek Vinyard; he makes the dramatic shift in his character's thinking very believable. Prior to seeing this movie, I had  trouble keeping Edward Norton and Edward Burns seperate in my mind. Not  anymore! Norton's performance in AHX will stay with me for a long time.<br />A  word of warning - the flashback to the event that lands Derek in jail is  one of the most disturbing things I have ever seen. There are several other  scenes that are difficult to watch, as well. Stay with it! It's worth the  effort.
0684803356|5.0|This book has had more of an effect on me than any other I have ever read. It is deep in imagery and in meaning. If anyone is to ever read a book, this is the one. But be careful ,young children, the ideas presented may be  too difficult for you to grasp. Recommended for experienced humans! You'll  go nuts at the end!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|This a good album. Tom Morello can play guitar like no bodies buissness. At time you wonder if thats a guitar at all. Message-wise you may not agree with everything thats said, but its good to see a band that has the balls  to say it.
B00000JZC4|5.0|With each listen this CD only gets better. Each song blows me away...I literally can't pick a favorite song. This CD is rich in variety, great melodies, hard-driving rock songs, even a great ballad. Who would have  though Filter would do a ballad (&quot;Take a Picture&quot;)!  Put this CD  in your player and blast off!
B000002A3T|5.0|This recording is proof that The Pink Floyd is musically still The Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd does not suffer without Roger Water's depressing and cynical lyrics.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|the 1st time i listen to this cd i thought it was goo with the exception of guerrilla radio and sleep now in the fire.  but i decided to listen to it a couple more and now i think its actually good.  my basicm rate of this cd now is better than evil but not even close to the 1st.  ratm 4ever!
0788811002|2.0|I give this movie 2 stars because it IS Disney and it IS Pocahontas. I am one of the few people who love Pocahontas 1. Now before we go any further I would like to say that all those people who are talking about the story being untrue should SHUT THE HELL UP!  This is a children's movie NOT a  history lesson. If movies have to be educational then we would have NO  movies left. For example where is the historical correctness in Titanic?  Does Star Wars even have a serious massage other than fairytale and other  unrealistic things? Any movie which tries to tell a story which happened a  long time ago WILL have something that can not fit. I mean it happened a  long time ago. Who knows what really happened? And to those people who dare  say that Pocahontas was ugly. Where from do you know that? And just what is  beauty and ugliness? The concept of beauty has changed a lot since  Pocahontas's time. (I happen to know for a fact that Pocahontas was  considered a very beautiful woman in her time! ) Besides no animated movies  could ever be made after a real story if it should be oh so correct. What  kind of parent would for example take his child to see Hercules if the  &quot;real&quot; story was told? The &quot;real&quot; story of Hercules is  so violent that the movie would be R rated. And besides history is  something that the children learn in school NOT in the cinemas because if  they do then we have a problem. Our &quot;poor&quot; kids would go around  believing that the Russian Revolution was in the wrong year (Anastasia),  that Iron Giants visit Earth from outer space (The iron Giant) and that  there is an alien on Earth by the name of Superman (from Superman). Give me  a break. Our kids are not THAT stupid and neither are I believe our  teachers whose responsibility history lessons are.  About Pocahontas 2: The  good things: - As always good songs and good animation. - Fine voices. The  bad tings: - The characters are out of place.  - Especially John Smith, a  character who I just loves, was terrible misused. He changes personality so  completely that it can not BE the same man.  - As I have argued for above  then a cartoon is NOT a history lesson. The story should be true to  Pocahontas 1 not the &quot;real&quot; story. Pocahontas and John Smith's  love was forever and nothing can change that. Pocahontas should stay with  John Smith. He is so much better than John Ralfe is. - Where is the love in  this story? What ever happened to: &quot;No matter what happens to me, I  will always be with you - forever!&quot; And now Pocahontas falls in love  with John Ralfe, unbelievable! John Smith and Pocahontas belong together.  They love each other. Not Poca and Ralfe. That is all wrong.  Basically  this video looks like Disney's attempt to please the critics of the first  movie. But apparently they are not pleased that easily. I believe that it  was a mistake to try to please the critics. Just make the movies the way  YOU want to (Disney) and forget about what people will say. The basis line  is that you should always: STAY TRUE TO THE STORY THAT YOU FIRST MADE. If  you (Disney) had done that this could be a fantastic movie. As of now I am  still not over the shock of seeing Pocahontas with another man. How could  she?  How could you?  Pocahontas and John Smith forever!  There, that's  much better.
630446651X|4.0|If you're at all a fan of science fiction, you should be amused by this film.  My buddy Daryl, whom I got this for as a birthday present, and I also like it for its many great puns (witness one of Dark Helmet's lines to  Colonel Sanders! LOL!)  The merchandising gags are great as well.  My  favorite scene, though, is Dark Helmet and his henchmen watching the  &quot;instant video&quot; of Spaceballs!  That one takes the cake!<br />One  caveat: Parents should take the PG rating SERIOUSLY, as some of the humor  is off-color.<br />Also a technical note -- if you get the widescreen  version, be aware that it's in the 1.85 to 1 format, not 2.35 to 1 as it  says on the tape.  Also, snap it up quickly, the folks at one widescreen  advocacy website note that MGM seems to be phasing out their widescreen VHS  tapes in favor of DVD.
B00001QGPS|5.0|This album is definitely one of the, if not the best to enter the hip-hop charts this year.  E.D. &quot;The Green Eyed Bandit&quot; and the Rza came through.  Both of them bless this disc with beats that will make your head  &quot;bob to this.&quot;  Anyone out there who thinks that the beats are  lacking might as well buy a No Limit record.  Ask yourself one question.   Whose beats are better?  These two go together like peanut butter and  jelly.  Red and Meth are the best in the hip-hop game and will not leave wu  banger's or Red fans disappointed.  To all the head bangers out there, go  pick up this album, twist one, sit back and let your mind fall out of  funkiness.
B000002BFZ|5.0|The Rolling Stones' critics have always been unfair to Pearl Jam's work, because they don't accept the fact that a band that does not like the glamour is simply the best existing rock band and probably the best, most  versatile and mature band of all time. Spin critics don't even know the  meaning of the word music, so let's not take them into consideration. The  CD is awesome, it reveals a different side of the band, and it proves that  they can make rock n' roll so melodic and hypnotic, without leaving their  grunge style aside, as many ignorant people thought they did. Smile is a  classic and emotionant song, a masterpiece. Hail Hail is a great song as  well with all the others. Congratulations Pearl Jam for such a great CD.
B00000DGUG|5.0|This album doesn't top &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; but it is still brilliant.  Alanis sings with so much feeling. Her works are so personal and so unashamed.  I love her.  I can't wait to see &quot;Dogma&quot; to  see Alanis as God.  That's going to kick!
B000001DTM|1.0|I think rock bands like Pearl Jam should teach U2 some ROCK. They are too pop. It is pretty sad.

B000002HRE|1.0|................SELL-OUTS................... Don't buy this cd these people don't know what there talking about. As is apparent by the cds they buy: Megadeath, Korn, Nirvana(no taste here) and tool.
B000009SFR|5.0|I don't think theres a single CD I have listened to this much! I can play Songs From The Big Chair 500 times in a row. There will never be anything like it again. I get chills with the Working Hour. This is somthing only  Tears can do for me. If this album was released again for a third time, I  would buy it again!
0060171936|1.0|For those intrested in this book. Please read the document in &quot;dumbartung.org.au/report1.html&quot;. Then if you still want to read the book, sell yourself out by all means to the money hungry, disrespectful  modern-day exploitation people that she represents.  &quot;In Marlo  Morgan's \\"experience\\" she never learnt an Aboriginal value respect. Respect  for Aboriginal people, Elders, our spirituality. She just shows what most  white people have always done - exploited Aboriginal people, culture and  our life&quot; - Marlene Chisholm
B00000AFFI|5.0|I didn't like &quot;To bring you my love&quot;, but this is a return in my opinion to the soulful bleeding heart on sleeve and mesmerizing lyric PJ that so many of us loved on &quot;Dry&quot; and &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. Of  course, absent the guitars we all love, but the melodies I think are BETTER  than the last release and the dark moods more subtle, artful and  intriguing.  Great head candy from one of the greatest.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|I'll admit the new rage CD was not quite as good as the first.  But Zach reaches a new level of lyricism where he draws less on cliches (listen to Born of a Broken Man.)  Neither their sophmore LP nor this one reach  revolutionary heights, but despite the fact that the CD doesn't go to any  completely new places, it is by no means a retread.  My only real complaint  is that this is one short album (about 45 minutes) I may have to get Live  and Rare just so I have more Rage.
6305546797|5.0|The restored version of Halloween ... what a God-sent. The best horror movie ever made just got a little better. The picture quality is unbelievable compared to the earlier versions. As far as the sound goes, a  little THX goes a long way. Actually, if you're a purest like I am, you can  always choose the original mono soundtrack, because the THX track is  slightly modified (the music sounds a little different, which really threw  me). But I highly recommend this version of Halloween (hell, I recommend  ANY version of Halloween). The second disk with the added footage is ok ...  it's good for true collectors to have, but it's obvious by watching it that  Carpenter knew what he was doing by cutting those scenes out of the  original.
B00001R3HX|4.0|This CD is the most under rated one in the Porcupine Tree catalog. It features some extremely solid tracks including Synesthesia, Always Never and Fadeaway, in addition to instrumental standouts Burning Sky and the  title track. In my opinion, a stronger album than The Sky Moves Sideways.
B000000H4V|5.0|I am writing this review after the release of the garbage &quot;Against&quot; (without Max).  I own all the Sepultura CDs and I think Chaos A.D is the best and &quot;Against&quot; is the worst (If you still  consider Against a Sepultura CD without Max!). This is an excellent DEATH  METAL album! Better than any other Death Metal band like Slayer, Fear  Factory....You will feel like you are in hell when listenning to this CD!  Buy It!
B000002GB9|5.0|This is the best CD Styx has ever made (and will ever make). Shaw's Fooling Yourself and Man in the Wilderness, DeYoung's Grand Illusion, Come Sail Away and Castle Walls, and JY's Miss America are all Styx classics.  It's just a shame that DeYoung decided he wanted to be the next Barry  Manilow and write all ballads (Babe) because he was capable of writing some  decent progressive-type songs.
630170648X|5.0|I find it exasperating that so few of Ernst Lubitsch's films are currently available in either video or DVD.  By any reckoning, he is one of the few absolute masters of the cinema (he even makes Andrew Sarris's list of  Pantheon directors).  A few of his best films (this one, HEAVEN CAN WAIT,  NINOTCHKA) are in print, but several others are not, while lesser films  like ANGEL, BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, and THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER are.  (A very fine film that Lubitsch began but was finished by Frank Borzage  because of Lubitsch's illness is also available, DESIRE, with Marlene  Dietrich.)  I have no complaint that these movies are available, but when  superior films such as ONE HOUR WITH YOU, THE LOVE PARADE, and, my own  personal favorite, TROUBLE IN PARADISE, are not, then something has gone  wrong.  I would also like to see MONTE CARLO, DESIGN FOR LIVING, and LADY  WINDEMERE'S FAN rereleased.<br />Ernst Lubitsch was the unrivaled master of  the film comedy, no less than Hitchcock was master of the suspense  thriller.  Both managed to transcend their own chosen genres to make  numerous screen classics.  We deserve access to all of his films.
B000002LPD|2.0|This is by far the worst of the discs with Hagar as singer. With the exception of RIght Now and Top of the World, the rest of the disc is just plain boring.
0451196716|5.0|My first King book was &quot;The Stand&quot;.  From that day on, I've been a huge fan.  &quot;The Long Walk&quot; was exhausting for me.  It felt as if I walked every mile with the boys.  Many people disliked the ending, and  at first, so did I.  However, after further thought, it made sense.  Ray  couldn't have done anything but keep on going.  Thank you Mr. King, for  writing such incredible, unforgettable books!  I can't wait to start the  next one.  By the way, I am anxiously awaiting the next in the Dark Tower  series!
B000002MUQ|4.0|Without a doubt, this is my favorite Van Halen disc. Eddie's playing is superb, especially on Don't Tell Me. I always wondered what a follow-up with Sammy to this CD would have sounded like...
0446525537|5.0|Once again, Nicholas Sparks has won me over!  The first book that I read of his, &quot;Message In A Bottle&quot; was just fantastic and this book, &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; is just as good.  Gives you that warm,  loving feeling.  Lots of romance!  I can't wait to receive my copy of  &quot;The Notebook&quot;.  Way to go Nicholas!
B0000027I6|5.0|This is Roger Waters' finest solo work and the best thing he's been involved with since The Wall. Unlike the dreadful Pros and Cons of Hitch-Hiking, which abondened melody in favor of the lyrics, and Radio  KAOS, which had decent tunes but a bad plot, Amused to Death hits on all  aspects. The music is incredible (especially the final 3 songs) as is Jeff  Beck's guitar playing. And Waters lyrics are excellent in most cases.
B000002UAU|5.0|Can anybody say songwriting?  Melody? <BR> Stan : Who says change is good?   Things got heavier, but the songwriting for a large part got worse.  I wish music would take a 180 myself. <BR>Also, it is true Dylan is not a  &quot;good singer&quot;.  But I would rather listen to him than a lot of  people.  He is expressive in his singing, and brings out emotion better  than most anybody else I have heard.<BR> Those are just my opinions though.   (I do like Cream, LZ, BS, and Hendrix but... I would not say they were a  step ahead of the Beatles or Dylan.)
B000002A3T|4.0|This album contains quite a few strong songs, most notably Coming Back to Life and High Hopes. <br />My only complaint with Pink Floyd is that they've become too formulaic. So many songs go &quot;vocals-guitar  solo-vocals-guitar solo-end&quot;. It does become quite boring after  awhile. But that being said, Gilmour and co. do it very well.
0790732521|5.0|This film brings home to us that the loser of this war was (and is) Ireland herself.  &quot;Michael Collins&quot; is art, and it does all that art can do.    <br />I'd like to address something a thoughtful viewer wrote  here: &quot;I am always skeptical of love interests in  historical/biographical films of this sort.&quot;  OK, I buy that.  But  Kitty Kiernan, Mr. Collins's actual fiancee, becomes in this movie the  symbol of Ireland herself/itself.  The Irish people traditionally have seen  their beloved land as mother, sister, &quot;Dark Rosaleen&quot;... and Miss  Roberts's role never panders to viewer's prurient interest.  She is the  Ireland that both warring &quot;brothers&quot; love, and fight for, and the  Ireland that loses them to each other... that's a tragedy of war, this war  and others... <br />    The end of the film brings home to us that the loser  of this war is Ireland herself.          Film cannot *be* life; in that  sense it can never be totally accurate. Film can only convey to us what we  the audience can recognize.  The flags, the accents, the love  interests--they are not history but devices to convey history on a flat  screen in two hours.
B0000025ZF|2.0|It's not whether or not you &quot;get&quot; Roger Waters, it's the fact that, aside from the title track, Every Stranger's Eyes, and Sexualy Revolution, this is an utterly tuneless album that even Eric Clapton can't  save. It's a good thing that Gilmour and co. chose to do the Wall instead  of spending time on this lame excuse of a CD.
0767836286|5.0|I again watched Arlington Road this past weekend and found it to be a very intense, well done and action packed movie.  Though I had seen it before, I did have the pleasure this time of viewing it within the confines of my own  family room.  The effects on a big screen TV, coupled with Dolby Digital  surround sound with this movies sound effects will definitely take you off  your seat.  Amazing intensity.  Even during one of the scenes, it literally  woke my dog up.  Fantastic movie! I would highly recommend its viewing.
B000003JDA|1.0|After falling in love with Dot-com I went back to give this one a few listens. My worst fears confirmed- not one song here is as good as the worst song from Dot-Com.I keep it just to have their full collection.Nice  cover though.....
B000002J1M|5.0|This LP hit the stores in '72 on the heels of \\"The Yes Album,\\"  T.Rex's \\"Electric Warrior,\\" and Bowie's \\"Ziggy  Stardust.\\"    If you had a powerful sub-woofer (back in the day) the opening track would have blown your doors off! This was ominous stuff, full of what Peter Gabriel then referred to as \\"cautionary tales.\\" With other groups, like Roxy  Music, who released their debut the same year, the British rock scene was taking a detour into the bizarre and fantastical! A lot of experimentation with sound, structure of songs, instrumentation, and message is evidenced  here. One of their strongest earlier efforts, albeit a little inaccessible and dense lyrically.    To this day \\"Supper's Ready\\" stands as a crowning achievement. Woven together with a magic that became so much more evident in \\"live\\" performance, this suite of inspiringly surreal numbers can still masterfully transport one to a dazzlingly different plateau.     After all these years this record is still one of my Desert Island Discs!
B000002MI4|1.0|Sorry, this is one to avoid. I give him some credit for trying something different, but there are really no songs that stand up with his best.I have all of his cd's, and this is the one I like least.
0380973464|1.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book, but then this. The plot is lame, the characters lack any depth, and Stephenson's normally superb writing style is at its worst. Only halfway through the book, the general  idea becomes clear. After that you hope for something to happen but the  story doesn't take off. The worst thing is that dozens of pages are devoted  to absolutely irrelevant topics (eating cereals!). The only good part about  this book is the good explanation of crypto-systems but then you don't buy  a novel to read about technical details. Conclusion: Don't buy this book.  Go and read Zodiac, Snow Crash, or Diamond Age, they are a lot better.  (Hopefully Stephenson's next book will rise up the old level of writing.)
B000002NHN|5.0|This is a wonderful CD!  I heard it while browsing in a store and had to come home and purchase it.  I had no idea that it was the same artist that sang the Mummer's Dance.  You have to admire a woman that writes her own  lyrics and music and on top of that has a voice like an angel.  Dante's  Prayer is beautiful...I listen to it over and over....Take a chance and  order this CD; you will not regret it.
B00002EPJH|5.0|This is a CD that will stand up to many hours and many years of listening. The piano speaks as well as sings. Lucky us. Thank you, Keith Jarrett.
0201633612|5.0|If you were to buy only one book from Amazon.com this year...this would be it.  Lots of examples in C++.  It sometimes refers to smalltalk which I could care less.  You can gain years of programming 'experience' from  reading this book.
B00000K19E|5.0|THE MATRIX IS THE WORLD THAT HAS BEEN PULLED OVER YOUR EYES TO BLIND YOU FROM THE TRUTH. THE MATRIX HAS YOU 6/12/99 <br />IT WAS FUN,ACTION-PACKED AND SEXY  THE BEST DAY OUT I'VE HAD IN YEARS
0060254920|5.0|I stumbled upon this book while looking for a good Christmas present to buy for my little cousin of 2 in Australia. The moment I saw the cover, I completely remembered how fascinating this book was for me when I was  young, and I'm 20 right now. Definetely would recommend it.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This movie might be my favorite of all time. SFX, spiritual biblical parallels, Sci-fi, Action, love. I have not met anyone who has not thought it was outstanding.<br />Spiritual parallels= <br />The Matrix= The world and  it's slavery to sin Morpheus= John the baptist Neo (the one)= The one  messiah (The Lord Jesus Christ) Zion= The body of Christ? Isreal? Heaven?
B000001DTM|5.0|I first listened to this CD when it was released as 14 year old. It's really defined my adolescence and guided me through my life. If I could only own one CD, this would be it.
B00000K31V|4.0|Excellent movie - to be taken with a big grain of salt - Jennifer Jason Leigh is outstanding - her typical unusual characterization - thought provoking.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper isn't the Beatles best album(that title would have to go to Abbey Road), but it easily gets a five.  Anyone who gives this album a one hasn't actually listen to the album.  Any album with Sgt. Pepper(original  and reprise), Lucy in the Sky, With a little help, and the truly monumental  A Day in the Life would get a five even if the rest of the tracks were four  men snoring.  Anyone trying to bash the album needs to realize no one did a  better job at bashing this album then John Lennon.
B000000OE7|5.0|This CD truly brings out some of the best in Queen. It has some of the greatest music they have ever made. This CD has something for everyone; Queen fan or not! God bless Freddie Mercury!
B000002UB6|4.0|The songs &quot;Let it Be&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot;,  &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, and &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; make this album a four.  Could easily be considered the best album by lesser groups but being that  they are THE BEATLES you kind of expect more.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I absolutly love your C-D!   I love every song, especially &quot;all  the small things&quot;.  I  even have the lyrics of every song hanging on my wall.  IF you're buying this C-D i highly reccommend it.  It has  GRRRRRRRRRRREAT songs!
B000021XS0|2.0|After reading so many favorable reviews of Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory, here on Amazon.com, I became intrigued enough to pick up the CD.  I must say, this CD does not live up to the hype.<br />First off, any  comparison between Metropolis Part 2:Scenes From a Memory, and  Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime are just plain wishfull thinking on the  part of overzealous Dream Theater fans.  <br />This CD, while musically  superb, is completely devoid of passion.  Most of the blame for this should  be laid at the feet of singer James Labrie.  Labrie's vocals are  consistantly boring.  He almost sounds uninterested in the songs he is  singing.  The rest of the band, however, is not without talent.<br />The  guitar player and keyboardist (forgive me for not being familiar with their  names) are excellent.  Unfortunately, Dream Theater's sound is much too  derivitive.  At every turn they either sound like Queen, Rush, Styx, or in  the opening song, Pink Floyd.  <br />The concept for the CD is solid.   However, I don't believe that any of these songs will stand apart from the  whole.  <br />All in all it's an OK CD.  You could do worse, but you could  certainly do much better.
0385495315|5.0|This is a great book. I was not able to put it down until I finished. I did not know anything about Crptography before I stared this book. The way the author chronicles the history and the science behind cryptography is  fascinating. I am soo impressed, I took the unusal step of rating!
B000002UAX|5.0|Okay... I'm a mega-huge Beatles fan and I admit that this album showcases some of their more ridiculous recordings. However, speaking as a music lover in general, I would much rather spend my time listening to the  Beatles' worst material than to even the best work of 99.9% of the artists  in the music industry today.
B00000AFGM|5.0|When i first began listening to Marilyn Manson, it was because of the moshing beat and the goth appeal. But after awhile, I began to concentrate on the lyrics and was stunned. in this cd, manson even more demonstrates  the philospher genius he exhibits.Being backed up with inventive and catchy   guitars, he churns out vocals spewing with very questioning lyrics. The  media, christians, the whole lot of them judge him by his image, but never  really take the time to LISTEN. He is questioning athourity, observing the  media, culture, and the american life,and doing it in an amazing way. This  cd, though different from his goth/death rock Antichrist Superstar, is far  better musicwise and lryicwise. Yes, there are some heavy songs like the  dope show and rock is dead, but the band slows down in coma white,  dissassociative,and fundumentally loathsome. Dont listen to the christians  or the media.the christians dont know what they are talking about. yes he  makes comments, but he doesnt have to be banned fromliving!  and THEY make  up those sick rumors, so who's the sinner now?trust me, pick this cd up,  head bang, swoon, sing along, and have something to think about. all from  the greates man on earth, Brian Warner,(marilyln manson). one note:dont  hate goths, theyre not all bad.dont judge on appearance,but the inside.im a  goth,and am hated.marilyn manson forever
0151003084|5.0|you should buy it.....i'll probably let my kids read it when i have kids.....it will probably help them learn the alphabet......
0385493622|5.0|This is a non-mathematical mathematics book regarding one of my favorite puzzles in math, FLT, and is probably one of the best that describes the chronic events of this 365-year enigma. This is also a rare book which you  cannot put it down once you start to read it.
B0000296SI|5.0|This is the best CD I ever bought, though it is the first CD i bought by Blink 182.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I HAVEN'T YET HEARD ALL THE SONGS ON THE CD YET, BUT IF THEY ARE ANYTHING LIKE THEIR LAST CD &amp; THEIR NEW SONG &quot;I KNEW I LOVED YOU&quot;, I'M IN LOVE WITH THEM ALREADY!  THEY TOUCH MY HEART WHEN I HEAR THEM SING  &amp; THEY ARE VERY CUTE!
B0000028SU|5.0|It doesn't have the E Street Band.  It doesn't have a lot of songs about cars and girls and factories and battling working-class despair (all worthy topics Springsteen covers exceptionally well elsewhere in his catalog).   What _Lucky Town_ has is ten of the most honest, moving songs ever recorded  about achieving maturity, gaining perspective, starting a family, and  discovering that redemption and renewal can be found in the simplest things  in life.  This album came out a year after the birth of my youngest son and  expresses better than I could ever hope to what it means to be a father, a  husband, a man.  Thanks, Bruce.
6305558167|5.0|This is an amazing movie, but it's the soundtrack that really does it for me. It just adds to the richness of the characters and their storylines. The fight scenes are so much more intense hearing Wagner's music in the background.     Excellent acting job by Nigel Terry portraying King Arthur at 16, all the way to his death as an older man at the hands of his only son. The rest of the cast was equally good including many film newcomers such as Liam Nisson, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren and Gabriel Byrne. All very popluar actors today and they can all credit this fine movie as their stepping stone.    I was particularly impressed with Sir Launcelot's character, portrayed by Nicholas Clay. In my opinion, he captured the true essence of what I pictured Launcelot to be. A pure of heart hero, with a fighting ability 2nd to none in the world, and whose soul is forever tormented because his one true soul mate is marriad to his best friend. A great tragic story. Excellent acting.     This movie has always been one of my favorites, even when I had first viewed it as a young boy many years ago. To this day I still consider it one of the best.
6304698658|5.0|I am geting it on DVD this time, we have already worn out two VHS copies!   Gets funnier everytime you watch it, Cousin Eddie is a riot!  Watching National Lampoons Christmas Vacation has become a christmas tradition in  our home.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I was a fan of Fiona's after her first CD, but this sort of genius was unexpected. Every song in creative, original, and captivating. From start to finish, this is by far one of the best CDs I've bought all year, and  Fiona has officially moved to the top of my CD collection. I wish I had  some sort of talent to compare with hers.
0783233477|5.0|What a great film!  There are so many interesting scenes -- It's non-stop fascination for three hours.  <br />It starts out like a Hitchcock movie with this huge lighted mansion engulfed in the mist.  While trying to sleep  Hopkins hears voices...  Then there's the helicopter scene with Hopkin's  telling his daughter Susan to wait for lightning to strike and find her  true passion and love in her life  - as the helicopter starts to approach  Manhatten Island.<br />The coffee shop scene is classic with Brad Pitt - what  a charmer!  Susan is swept off her feet after just a few minutes.  Then the  departure scene - sooo sad... the look on Pitt's face as he watches Susan  (Forlani) walk away.  Like something from Romeo and Juliet.<br />The scene  where Death meets Hopkins (Bill) and tells him &quot;how it's going to  be&quot; is spooky.  The following dinner scene is hilarious with everyone  watching this &quot;stranger&quot; encounter dinner for the first time.<br />I  loved the humor that Pitt injects into his part of Death,  the love Hopkins  shows for his family, and Claire Forlani's portrayal of Susan thinking  she's found the love of her life and then possibly losing those she  loves.<br />Death played as a gentle, innocent and amusing character made this  romantic movie light and enjoyable rather than heavy or depressing.<br />I  especially enjoyed seeing Brad Pitt play a character with so much diversity  and play it so well.  He shows a lot of maturity as an actor in this role.   The love scene was so amazing to watch - you feel the intensity of the  moment as first experienced by Death.  Actually all the scenes between Pitt  and Forlani are wonderful.  There's such a feeling of passionate attraction  between these two!<br />The background music for this movie is fantastic, too.   It really adds so much emotion to every scene.
6304539282|5.0|The Star Wars movies are the best movies EVER!  Mark Hamill,Carie Fisher, and Harrison Ford were great. If you don't like them,you're crazy. I get tired of other movies, but not these.Nothing in these movies is  stupid,they're perfect. The special effects were wonderful.I will always be  a fan.
B00002MZ4W|3.0|&quot;When The Pawn...&quot; is similar to Fiona Apple's debut in one respect;  After one listen, I don't care for it at all. And that can only mean that--like Tidal--this is destined to become one of my favorite  albums.  Congratulations to Apple for making a CD that won't burn out the  listener after 4 or 5 plays.  She's going to make you work for it...but,  trust me, it's going to be worth every minute.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is the best action movie I ever layed my eyes opon. It also kan make you nuts if you start to belive. There is not much to tell about this movie, you just must go see it. I have seen The Matrix about 50 times  already twice at the theathere. and also on dvd. its an Actin move of the  highest class ever. And the nev slow motion filming with the moving camra  is just amasing. You'l get this feeling in your guts that you cant explayn  when you see this movie, I promise.
6301562925|5.0|I hate it when people call this &quot;The worst of the series&quot; because it isn't. H20 is the worst (well, tied with part III). At least this was a Halloween movie and not a trendy SCREAM rip-off. HALLOWEEN V is  not as scary or as good as parts 1, 2, or 4, but it is still better than  90% of all other horror/slasher movies. I love horror movies, and have seen  too many to count, and this is one of my favorites. Daniel Harris (who  played Jamie) turned in a performance so good that she outshined most of  the adult actors in the film. Donald Pleasance, as always, was great as Dr.  Loomis. HALLOWEEN V also had one of the most suspensful scenes in any  movie, if you get attatched to the character. I love this movie, and anyone  who calls themselves a HALLOWEEN fan should love it.
6300214540|2.0|I found the whole male macho thing annoying.  I do like traditional 'guy' movies, but this one lacks class, the main roles are spoiled little boys.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Perhaps the greatest rock album of the decade. In my book, up there with Abraxas and Clapton's Crossroads collection. Carlos is arguably the greatest living guitarist in the world today! With the teeny-bopping  garbage that's out there right now, this is a greatly welcomed respite.
B00000JZIK|5.0|This is one of the rare films that gets better and better as time goes on.  There are jokes, clues and situations that you notice more and more as you watch it.  As always Kevin Spacey is the best.
B000002L9M|5.0|This is unequivocally the greatest DM album -- ever!   My boyfriend first played this tape (what's a tape?) for me in 1988, and twelve years later, he's my husband and these songs NEVER fail to bring back those blissfully  irresponsible high school years!   Each song has its own powerful sound and  message, although &quot;Dressed in Black&quot; is a little weak.  &quot;Fly  on the Windscreen&quot; and &quot;Stripped&quot; will always be the  defining songs of our now nearly 30 (gasp!) generation -- and although I  did not dye my hair black, it was a brilliant purple!
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is the best album that I have ever listened to.  It contains beautifully layered and complex music that is almost trance-inducing.  Billy Corgan also writes very emotional music that touches my soul.  A  definite must-have.
B000002A33|5.0|Why is it that anything that places substance over image and packageing doesn't sell? I probably shouldn't complain. If this album sold a gazillion copies who knows what kind of horrible commercialized fate this band would  have met. I only hope these guys are in the studio makeing a recording as  brilliant as this one.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple has come back with this alubum that really won't dissapoint. The lyrics and the music are orignal and I just have to say Fiona Apple is a genius. Thank you for letting this album be exposed to the world. This is  what people need to hear as well as experince. Her last album was good and  this one is just great.
B000008GEF|4.0|If you liked George's first album, &quot;All things must Pass&quot;, you're bound to like this one as well.  It has a very similar sound.<br />This album went to number one in the year of its release, but over the years has  been kinda forgotten.  It's not even available domestically anymore.  But  it's actually a much better album than what John and Paul had to offer that  same year (well, to be fair, Paul did put out &quot;Band on the Run&quot;  in late-'73, but I was referring to &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;).<br />If  you're not particularly religiously inclined (like me), some of the lyrics  can get a little preachy-- for instance, &quot;The Lord loves the one that  loves the lord&quot;?  But overall, this is a solid set of melodic,  thoughtful songs.

B000002UD1|2.0|the title track is good, &quot;out the blue&quot; is good as well.  but overall, this is a poorly produced album (it sounds cluttered and messy) of mediocre filler material from one of popular music's greatest.  Lennon's  singing isn't even particularly engaging on this one.
0783225849|1.0|This film is so boring and in the shower scene it was obviously Bates the wig even from shadow was awful. SEE THE REMAKE FAR MORE ENTERTAINING!
B000002UCE|4.0|This is a very, very good album.  I hesitate to say 'great', or 'classic' because when compared with &quot;Plasic Ono Band&quot; (released one year earlier in 1970) it's not quite up to that level.<br />Some of the individual  songs, however, are classics.  The title track, of course, is one of them.   But &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; is as good a ballad as Lennon ever wrote, which  is to say- great.  I do feel that the album is marred somewhat by the  inclusion of &quot;how do you sleep?&quot;, his infamous attack on his  former partner Paul McCartney.  It's just a downright mean song, and  probably something that would've been better off being a much-sought-after  bootleg rather than publicly offered on a collection of mostly lush, gentle  music.<br />Speaking of 'lush', this album is a tad over-produced I think.   With the &quot;Lennon Anthology&quot; box set as evidence, I would argue  that the title track and &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; for example would've been  better off without the strings.  Again I must evoke the earlier  &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; album because of it's raw, sparse sound.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Okay, I'll concede one point right up front... the title is a little pretentious.  But once you get past that... this is an awesome CD! It is different from her last one in that it is more experimental and diverse...  but it shares a few things in common with Tidal.  The lyrics are  fascinating - sometimes sweet, sometimes very sour, sometimes full of  submissiveness, other times ragingly angry.  The songs here are typically  Fiona - very inventive musically, and, as I said, very interesting  lyrically.  Try not to love the lyrics to &quot;Limp&quot;, in which an  extremely creepy male gets a dressing down from his newly empowered female  friend/lover.  I would reccommend this CD to anyone who loved Tidal... and  anyone else just looking for a CD that is cleverly written and extremely  diverse and inventive in content.
0553571338|3.0|This book was an excellent book, for a while.  The begginingwas a little hard to understand, but it was cleared up soon.  LoisLowry just DESTROYED the ending, though.  It was so confusing, it might as well have been written in Greek!  The end made me want to stop reading.
B000002LN9|5.0|This is EC at his best with a group of fantastic musicians, Robert Cray, Buddy Guy pitching in. 'Wonderful Tonight' version on this CD sends chills down my spine. A Great CD to enjoy. EC is the master of re'packaging old  material, coming out with new CD's with the same redone tracks, however,  this live effort is worth the investment and better versions of any of his  previous work.
B000000OPZ|4.0|David Coverdale said once that'John(Sykes)and I sat down and rewrote rock history in 15 minutes'.Far from being a bombastic statement this summarizes a rock album now legendary-those who called Whitesnake a Zep clone are  oblivious to the fact that Coverdale comes from the same blues tradition  -while those who want to see how it's done,they'd better listen to this!
B00000IL1K|5.0|I used to hate opera, but now Sarah Brightman has totally erased the stereo type for me. I first heard her song Time To Say Goodbye, fell in love with it, and bought that CD. Then I bought Eden, and fell in love all  over again! Sarah's great, I adore her voice!  She's my idol when it comes  to music!
0385495315|3.0|This book has some deficiencies, in that it truly only talks about the breaking of the ENIGMA cipher from the British perspective, and does not pay tribute the incredible work of the Americans during WW2.<br />There are  new books on the market, such as one by David Kohnen of The Mariners'  Museum, which describe newly declassified US documentation about the  breaking of the 4-rotor German Naval Enigma machine, which the British  never really mastered. Singh takes the perspective, that without the  Bletchly Park operation, the US would not have successfully broken the  Enigma code, but that is just not entirely true. The more true statement  would include that the British turned over vital information early in the  war to the US, which assisted the US in creating faster and better BOMBE  machines, and that the advances made by the US were then never matched by  the British throughout the war.<br />I would consider this book as telling  only part of the story, and David Kahn's works on the subject as being much  more authoritative on the historical perspectives anyway. For more truthful  and factual information about the breaking of the 4-rotor Engima machine,  Kohnen's &quot;Winn and Knowles&quot; (published by Enigma Press in Poland,  1999) publication is clearly a better choice.
B000002PF4|5.0|Gaucho is a spectacular work. The musicianship is phenomenal, the melodies and arrangements are spellbinding -- almost heartbreakingly wonderful -- and the recording itself is rich, bright and a technical triumph. Steely  Dan fans won't be disappointed by the lyrics, most of which are typically  arcane. If you don't like it the first couple of times (I didn't!), keep  playing it. You'll come around.
B000003AEB|5.0|All I have to say is if you don't have this, then who are you?  This is a classic, probably the best album ever made.
6305095566|5.0|This is a great movie.  It has horror, comedy, action, and suspense.  Evil Dead fits all the criteria for a perfect horror movie.  And anyone who is a Bruce Campbell fan has to see this movie. Anyone should!
0790740443|4.0|The main attraction for buying the DVD is that given the low price one gets some very interesting added features, namely the audio commentary by the director and producer. Ultimately this is their film and it succeeds or  fails due to their influences. One of the great drawbacks is that the lead  character has very little dialogue with which to convey some complex  psychological issues. If not for the competent performance of Kurt Russell  as Sgt Todd (and the physical charms of Connie Nielsen) the film would fall  flat on its face. Notwithstanding, the action, special effects and  cinematography are sufficiently admirable to keep the sci-fi buffs  entertained. The movie begins on a good premise although I would question  the wisdom of placing the setting in the contemporary period when a more  futuristic treatment would seem more likely. But by far the greatest  deficiency originates with the lacklustre script, which is hard to  understand given thefact that the same pen which inked this mess wrote  Blade Runner. At some point it should have been realized that for the  audince to make a sypathetic connection with Sgt Todd he would have to  undergo an emotive transformation from a heartless killer. That aspect is  never successfully explored. Even Jason Isaacs declares on the audio  commentary that at times one screams out for Sgt Todd to say something but  he never progresses beyond the monosyllabic. One problem with the scenario  is that it seems pieced together from movie classics. The beginning evokes  memories of Conan the Barbarian then proceeds to emulate Shane while the  ending is clearly purloined from Rambo. There is no great shame in  modifying the works of others to suit ones own purpose, after all James  Cameron has become &quot;King of the World&quot; by utilizing this  approach. There is no forgiveness however for a poor script, especially  given the writer's credentials. I would have given this film three stars  out of five but due to the harshness of some previous reviews I have tried  to make ammends. With a slightly different treatment this movie could have  been a classic instead of standard fare. Nevertheless, the audio commentary  for this DVD is quite revealing about the film making process and is worth  the price of purchase.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Is there such a thing as obliterating the famous &quot;second album&quot; curse?<br />Well, Fiona Apple has.<br />This is one of the, if not the finest, record this year.  Almost every note of  &quot;When the pawn...&quot; is  inventive and fresh and she achieves this without deserting the sound she  developed on her first album.<br />This is an artist who grew from her  strengths and learned from her errors.<br />One listen to &quot;Paper  Bag&quot; and before the end of it, you are already reaching for the repeat  button and that is not the only song you do that to on this album.<br />I have  a feeling we will have another &quot;Fiona moment&quot; next year at an  awards show as we did a few years back at the MTV Video Music  Awards.<br />However this time, Fiona won't be holding a moonman in her hands.  She'll be holding a Grammy.
B000002BSV|4.0|Though I'm more of a punk/ska type of guy, i enjoy listening to the British rock band known as Suede. I love &quot;Beautiful Ones&quot; because it displays the cynical mood of the band. &quot;Lazy&quot; is a song of  tranquility and peace. Personally, one of my favorites is  &quot;Filmstar&quot; because I laugh at their satire towards a  stereotypical celebrity.  I also love their British voices and I always say  that &quot;you can't buy that kind of voice.&quot; I love listening to this  with my friend because it makes us laugh.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|this album comes close.  I can't really find anything bad to say about this band.  I've been listening to their die hard riffs, guitar innovation, and intelligent, well-spoken lyrics since 94 and I plan to listen until my  hearing goes bad from all of this loud rock-and-roll music and I need a  walker to get my a$$ around.  Though this album and Evil Empire can't top  their first album, who wants them to?  Their debut is a classic and always  will be.  I recommend this one to any music fan.
B000021XR5|4.0|Stone Temple Pilots have always been one of my favorite bands. This is one of their worst CDs, but it's still great. I reccomend buying this CD if you like rock or your a fan of STP.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I am 15 years old and this is cd that gets played non stop in our house! The rythm is wonderful! It allows my parents and I to play music with out wanting to change it! We finally found something to agree on!  What a  wonderful collaberation between artists! I give it 5 stars all the way!
B00000IPAX|4.0|Blink 182 is a band that some people i know consider it pop and others consider it punk rock.    Even though I didn't hear Blink 182's Dude Ranch, i'm still convined that Enema of The State is their best one.  &quot;Whats  My Age Again?&quot; and &quot;Small Things&quot; are awesome songs but I  thought some of their other songs should get more recognition on the radio  like Track 3 and Track 9.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is by far Dream Theater's greatest accomplishment. I'm not even a huge Dream Theater fan and I think this in a complete masterpeice. I think replacing Derek with Jordan is a great choice. Derek is a great keyboardist  but Jordan is by far the best of the best, and I'd take Jordan Rudess over  Kevin Moore anyday. Anyway... just buy the album, even if you're not a DT  fan.. this is the greatest progressive album this decade.
B00000JCOV|5.0|SlipKnot is one of the best and most creative metal bands ever. They are VERY heavy. This CD is a must have for anyone that likes rock or metal.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I HAD SEEN THIS CONCERT LIVE AND THIS VIDEO REPRODUCED THAT SAME SENSATION I HAD WHEN I SAW THE SHOW LIVE.

0399128964|1.0|Time after time I've seen Dune acclaimed as one of the masterpieces of SF. It consistently tops the charts when readers are asked for the best SF novels. Being a SF reader myself it was almost heretic not to have read it  before, so after more than 30 years I decided to give it a try. Awfull, is  the word that best describes my experience. I couldn't find any sense of  wonder or anything else for that matter that justified such high praises.  To compare it to The Lord of the Rings is to commit a crime. This novel is  a fraud, a naked king pretending to be wearing the finest clothes. Forget  the hype, this is a complete waste of time.
6305268843|5.0|I saw Firelight last year during its all too brief big-screen run and was stunned.<br />But even though it is a visually perfect film, the two lovers are more than simply exquisite - they have breadth and depth. They actually  take on dimension and draw us into their world and time: we share their  fears, denials, passions, and the joy they ultimately find in their  love.<br />In addition, the scenery (bleak outdoors, lush in) and weather  (winter) were mesmerising because they were deeply a part of the context.  Even the ancillary characters (Connie and Lord Godwin especially), were  well-played and endearing. Real.<br />This is absolutely one of my favorite  movies. It is a definite MUST HAVE for every lover of romantic period  films. Particularly if you like them sensual and erotic without  coarseness.<br />Firelight is a kiss from William Nicholson that touches and  warms the skin beneath the lace.
B000002I27|5.0|If you want to understand The Doors, just listen to the first track of this album : Strange Days. This track is everything. For those who think that &quot;The End&quot; is the ultimate masterpiece from The Doors, they  have reason but i think they missed something from the phenomenon. You can  check for the &quot;Wainting for the sun&quot; album. It's a psychedelic  masterpiece and the last excellent album of the group.
0767817710|3.0|...and The Quick and the Dead is at the top of the list.  Yes, the script is rotten, storyline implausible, acting basically one-dimensional, camera angles distracting, and gunshot effects ridiculous - who cares?  The same  descriptions could be used to describe most of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti  westerns.  Whether intentional or (my suspicion) unintentional; this movie  is a delicious parody of those westerns.  And you can't help getting  wrapped up in the story and rooting for the good guy (girl).  Don't expect  &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, but if you're a fan of spaghettis, watch this  movie and have a good time.  The music is dead-on-perfect.     Confession:   The primary reason I watched this movie twice in one day the first time I  rented it was 'that guy who played Cort'.  I'd never heard of him, but he  was gorgeous!  When Russell Crowe picks up his Oscar next March for The  Insider, I will cheer a deserved recognition for his incredible acting  ability - not particularly noticable in the Quick and the Dead, by the way  - but the thought of the extra fifty pounds and thin grey hair he was  decked out in still makes me wince.
B000000HZT|3.0|For fans of classic Genesis (1969-1975) this first solo album by Tony Banks would seem a Godsend. Let's start with the highpoints....all of the instrumentals are great, especially &quot;From The Undertow&quot;.  &quot;From The Undertow&quot; is based on &quot;Undertow&quot; which  appeared on the first post-Steve Hackett album by Genesis aptly titled  &quot;And Then There Were Three&quot;. What kills this album.....and I  really mean kills......are the songs featuring vocals. The vocalist Kim  Beacon is an incredibly week attempt at a merger between Phil Collins and  Peter Gabriel. Beacon lacks the soulfull intensity of Peter Gabriel and the  smoothness of Phil Collins. If you're looking for a good solo album by Tony  Banks, look no further than your own backyard. &quot;A Trick Of The  Tail&quot; the first post-Gabriel release by Genesis is the ticket. Banks  either writes or co-writes all of the music on this album. It's an  incredible glimpse of what our man is truly capable of.
B000020617|5.0|Foo Fighter's new album is superb.  I wouldn't say it's as much of a complete album as The Colour and the Shape, but its still a great one.  If you liked Colour you'll like this one too.  Ain't It The Life is a classic  &quot;middle of the album&quot; Foo Fighters slow-dance.  Very, very  enjoyable.
B00001MXXG|5.0|I just rented FERRIS BUELLER this weekend.  Wow!  I cried!  Seriously, I cried.  Call me emotional, but I LOVED this film when it came out.  It brought back so many memories that I cried.  Back in the 80's I worked in a  movie theatre and watched the &quot;Twist &amp; Shout&quot; parade scene  hundreds of times.  This is the first time I've seen it since then. I think  it's a great movie.  It's hilarious, and unlike so many comedies these  days, has great character development in the midst of it's lunacy.  Sure,  it's a light comedy.  But the feelings about leaving high school and moving  on are in there too.  And of course, &quot;Twist &amp; Shout&quot; is  deliriously entertaining.<br />As far as the DVD goes ... it's a good job.   The menu is colorful and easy to use. There's not a lot of bonus stuff, but  I found director John Hughes' commentary fascinating.  Yes, I actually  listened to the entire film with Mr. Hughes commenting!  For film buffs, it  is very interesting to learn things about how films are shot.  Mr. Hughes  shares stories about how they tried to make L.A. look like Chicago; how  they filmed a certain scene quickly, and didn't get it quite right, because  it was threatening to rain; how &quot;Cameron&quot; had problems keeping  his eyes wide open because it was so bright.... etc. etc.  Very interesting  stuff.<br />Thanks Mr. Hughes!  You made some great comedies in the 80's and  this is a great one! <br />P.S.  You can't mention FERRIS BUELLER without  praising Matthew Broderick's performance.  He's charming, cute, and  hilarious.
0782008372|1.0|This is a GREAT film, with a pathetic transfer. It's like they would have had to WORK to make it look as bad as it does. I have tried to contact THX and find out how this disc got their certificatioin, but they haven't  responded. Simply put; this is the worst DVD I have ever seen. I love this  movie, and what they did to it with the amazing level of grain on this disc  is just plain wrong. I have an old video tape, recorded off cable, that is  FAR superior to this cut. Don't buy this disc.
B00000G3I2|4.0|I saw THE BIG CHILL in high school.  I loved it.  Strange, considering my age, but it helped me imagine my high school friends and I getting together at age 30 and having a good time.  I just watched it again this weekend on  DVD, and still consider it a good movie.  Don't let the big budget and big  names fool you.  It's a small film about interesting characters.  The only  &quot;action&quot; is when Sam tries to jump into Nick's car &quot;J.T.  Lancer&quot;-style.  Mostly, it's character study.  And Mr. Kasdan cast an  incredible group of actors.  It's a good film.<br />Now ... for the DVD ... I  think the picture is good.  For instance, this is the first time I noticed  the mint-green walls of the church in the opening scene.  But, the rest of  the DVD pales in comparison to others on the market now.  Like another  reviewer said, the &quot;Trailer&quot; included is for SILVERADO (? ).   Where's the BIG CHILL trailer ?   The documentary is very well done --  lots of current interviews with cast members (Glenn Close reveals a lot).   The cut scenes are interesting too.  ** BUT where are the flashback scenes  filmed in Atlanta of the cast in their 60's clothes ?   I thought for  sure we'd get to see those!  Nowhere to be found ... Disappointing.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is Nirvana's best, and probably the best CD of the 90's. Even though it came out in 1991, it's in my CD player right now! It's punk-rock at it's best, TONS of great songs. Some of my favorites are: Breed, Lithium, Teen  Spirit and In Bloom. There aren't any mediocre songs on the CD, they are  pretty much all good. If you don't have this CD yet, GET IT!
0783222734|1.0|In a fair world, this film would've been the biggest flop of Spielberg's career, but naturally it wasn't, because the timing was right. So what's wrong ?. The characters are boring, the story's boring, the whole thing is  just one big disappointing bore. But why ?. Well, we came to see the  creatures, didn't we ?. So where were they ?. The island should've been  full of life, but you didn't get that feeling. It's almost like Spielberg's  making fun of the audiences who flocked in hordes to the theaters; giving  them suspense but no release. -Or a dino movie with no dinos. Neat. If they  were so proud of their CGI effects, why didn't they show us more ?. -Ray  Harryhausen at least gave you monster value for your money, with superb  stop motion animation for all to SEE. I'd much rather watch good old stuff  like &quot;King Kong&quot;, or live lizards in &quot;Journey To The Center  Of The Earth&quot;, or even those rubber things in &quot;The Land That Time  Forgot&quot;.
B000002KO3|4.0|Nearly all of these songs are good but &quot;The Great Curve&quot; is awesome - it alone is worth the price of the CD. It's a shame this didn't get the attention and the airplay it deserved.  I suppose this was too  avant garde for a time when most rock stations were playing bands like  Journey and Foreigner.
B000002UJQ|5.0|. . .and that would be Automatic for the People, REM's masterpiece.  And this is a close call.<br />Not that it matters.<br />Automatic and OK Computer are, far and away, the best CD's ever recorded.  So far above everything  else it's scary.  I buy/listen to everything under the sun.  The drop-off  is steep.<br />The high water mark may have been reached.  If you really get  into this record, everything else - even decent stuff - sounds lame by  comparison.<br />Get this now.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200, just go  get it, listen, and marvel.
6300263673|5.0|I think that dance &amp; love stories is a great combination.  Diry Dancing is the greatest in both of these catagories!
006017322X|5.0|When my husband and I moved 3 years ago, we moved over two tons of books (according to the moving company).  Of all of these, Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is the one that I would save if the house was on  fire.  This is THE book that reminds me why books are written--not merely  to tell an entertaining story, but to encourage the reader to see the world  through the eyes of someone else.  The story is probably the best teacher  of the ugliness of racisim--in a very quiet and yet powerful way.  The real  power of the story for me, however, is the bond that I feel with Scout each  time I read the book.  Like Scout, I too equate reading and breathing, and  believe that the school system should have held more than several years of  boredom.  I cannot praise this book enough.  If there was an Atticus  Finch/Boo Radley fan club, I would hope to be the president (or at least  the club historian.)  Please read this book.
B00000JPHD|1.0|There was never a need for &quot;New Coke&quot; and the same goes for &quot;New Dracula&quot;.<br />  This film although a bit stagey, is a classic.  Lugosi is Dracula, the film's gothic legend and immortal star.  Unfortunately someone at Universal forgot this basic fact and cranked up  the new music so loudly it distracts you from the dialogue. What is the  point of watching The Great Lugosi and Dwight Frye if you cannot hear  them!<br />Whomever is responsible at Universal for this travesty, I can only  wish that you take a coach to Borgo Pass at Midnight.<br />By the way...  I  am waiting with a stake for your heart!
B000021XR5|3.0|I really hope that STP will go back to their roots of CORE, because thats the BEST one they ever did and will probably ever do. Too bad :(
B000002HPV|5.0|Bjork is one artist whose albums are always anticipated with bated breathe and more often than not, they don't disappoint but thrill instead. The latest Homogenic contains such visionary and futuristic ditties like  Hunter, Joga, Bachorette and All Is Full Of Love. and of course the  complementary visuals of her fantatsic videos. EXCELLENT! One glitch  though, Bjork is probably one of the least recognised talent around,  acieving very little success in the US than many untalented artists out  there. But in Iceland, UK and Europe, she is in high demand!
B00002MZ2T|4.0|Darren Hayes' voice just gets better everytime I hear it.  The opening and title track &quot;Affirmation&quot; is enough to buy this great album.  The  lyrics are very true to life and all about relationships.  Mostly  genderless relationshipd which personally I prefer.  No doubt that &quot;I  Knew I Loved You&quot; will become the new song for wedding couple of all  sexes and &quot;Chained To You&quot; will be a big club hit.  There are a  few &quot;yawners&quot; towards the end so i wouldn't give it 5 stars.   However, if you liked their self titled album, I bet you'll really dig  &quot;Affirmation.&quot;
0812550757|5.0|i was kinda turned off at first when i saw all the language use and had the feeling there weren't going to be any more 'battle room' scenes, so at first, i was sceptical. after i got through the first couple chapters and  started to understand the story, it got much much better. the characters  are very elaborate, the language issue does nothing but enhance, and the  story was written expertly. very, VERY nice. at least as good as ender's  game, which may be the best sci-fi i've read.
B000021XS0|5.0|I will not add any more adjectives and kudos that have already been mentioned. This is THE album for DT fans. For those who say &quot;where are the soaring Labrie vocals?&quot;, they are there, but he has pulled back  the throttle to enable us to understand the lyrics. I have long felt, at  times, the extra range of Labrie has gotten in the way of the listener  being able to understand the lyrics, which hampers the understanding of the  message. All through Part 2, James gives us the great vocals we are used  to, but also makes sure the message is being heard. Jordan Rudess, contrary  to some of the reviews I have read out here, is given a very big spotlight  throughout the CD. His style is different from the previous keyboard  players, and he is given plenty of complex, and delicious compositions to  introduce himself to DT fans with. As always, Petrucci and Portnoy push the  limit on the amount of notes contained in one line of music, and John Myung  adds the wall that the others lean on. This is a CD that you can not be  content with just listening to. You have to sit back, with the lyric sheet,  and let yourself be taken into a story. I think that is where alot of the  negative reviewers out here have made their mistakes in listening to this  CD. This is not a CD you pop in the player for mood music, or background  music. This is a CD to be enjoyed in much the same way people enjoy going  to musical plays and theater. It truly lives up to the bands name, Dream  Theater.
B00000J2KT|5.0|This great movie STILL sets the standard for war films.  A stunning achievement, Full Metal Jacket is the best of the Vietnam movies and in the top five war movies ever filmed.  Right up there on my own list of  favorites right beside the novel THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY and THE BRIDGES  OF TOKO-RI.
B00000K19E|4.0|One of the classic sci-fi/cyberpunk storylines is that our perceived reality is actually an illusion. Those who have enjoyed variations on this theme (Total Recall and Brazil come to mind) will be on familiar ground here. What makes The Matrix so enticing is the latest use of  computer-generated and -assisted special effects, particularly bullet-time  photography.<br />Not since the dogfight sequences in the final battle around  the Death Star of Return of the Jedi have I been so bedazzled by the latest  FX technology. With bullet-time, slow-motion has never looked so flawless  and witnessing the 3D pan around the action made my heart race. Like the  dogfights around the Death Star, I was giddy.<br />I will always prefer to  watch movies in big-screen cinemas with the best sound system available.  Otherwise, watching a fun movie like The Matrix at home on a big-screen TV  with an equally excellent sound system makes it just as worthwhile. The  added benefit of commentaries, behind-the-scenes material and other stuff  makes it moreso. I've also played this DVD on my Mac and had just as much  fun, although the picture could be bigger. :-)<br />Speaking of Macs,  I would never know your review had anything to do with the movie. The only people I know who speak  so ill of the Macintosh are Mac-ignorant and PC-arrogant.<br />For the record,  DVDs are cross-platform; there's no such thing as a PC-only DVD (I  certainly haven't seen one). Anyone who is having problems playing this DVD  on their computer either doesn't have a DVD-ROM or you need to apply a  software patch or upgrade.  As for Macs, OS9 will take care of everything. Otherwise, go to  for a  workaround.  on playing The Matrix on any computer. (I swear, I have no alliances with  PCFriendly.)
0425170349|2.0|Rainbow Six is a good story which is badly written and disastrously edited.  The characters, whom we've met in previous Clancy works, are stunted; their dialogue stilted; and their emotions stereotypically trite.  The book's cumbersome, redundant prose is peppered throughout with  grammatical gaffes.<br />A strong blue pencil might have debulked this book,  rendered it more readable, and reduced its price to that of its  better-edited peers.<br />All-in-all, this is Tom Clancy's worst offering to  date.  He gets two stars for the story and none for the storytelling.
6302732875|5.0|If you can manage to get your hands on a laser disc player (they still exist, y'know) then buy the Collector's Edition of Glengarry Glen Ross.  Not only is the presentation in widescreen (as every movie should be), but  you can hear Jack Lemmon and director James Foley give running commentary  on alternate audio tracks.  That will give you even more insight into a  masterful film version of this masterful Pulitzer Prize-winning play.  Incidentally, I managed to get Ed Harris to autograph my laserdisc jacket  to this movie.  This movie in no way got the credit it deserved, and the  absence of any Oscar wins (or more numerous nominations) for the cast  undermines the credibility of the Academy voters, in my opinion.
0671027344|5.0|About 1/2 way into this book I had a sudden thought that it's not something I would want my kids to read--if I had any.  But then I realized that it is exactly what kids should be reading. The Perks of Being a  Wallflower is full of love, compassion, understanding, acceptance and  realistic situations.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The new Rage kicks.  No other band out there can properly merge funk, hip-hop, and metal like RATM.  On Battle of Los Angeles, Zach finally shows his potential as a vocalist.  I thought he took a step back with the  release of Evil Empire, but he makes amends here.  His lyrics and rappin'  have never sounded better.  Again, Tom Morello proves just how innovative  he is.  He definitely gets my vote for best guitarists of the '90's just  for being creative, not to mention he flat-out rocks.  My favorite tracks  are Guerilla Radio, Calm Like a Bomb, Maria, and Born of a Broken Man.
B000002ADT|5.0|A testament to the beauty created by musicians who knew what they were doing. Perhaps no other album fully captures the grace of jazz and the  indisputable genius of Miles.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Supernatural contains 13 absolutely incredible songs! If you really appreciate good music of any kind, you will definitely love this CD! It's a must for any music collection and it will be very soon considered a  classic. Carlos is the best quitar player ever!
B00001U0DP|5.0|Life is Beautiful is a truly beautiful movie.  Roberto Benigni captured my heart through his amazing love for life and people.  Seldom do movies portray such a harsh event in history while making the audience smile  through their tears.  The tender moments between Benigni and his family are  priceless.  The movie makes you want to be a better person.  Benigni forces  the audience to look inside themsleves to find the beauty of each of their  lives.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I owned Santana, and Abraxas and Caravanserai in the 70's and haven't listened to Santana for years.  Sort of like - been there, done that.<br />But, I LOVE the blend of contemporary artists with Santana's  longtime sound. I have been listening to this for weeks now. Bought it  because of &quot;Smooth&quot;, which is the ultimate, but with repeated  listening I am hearing other gems in there, like &quot;Love of my  Life&quot; and &quot;El Farol&quot; and &quot;Migra&quot;.  What a totally  beautiful album.
B000002ADT|5.0|I bought the smithsonian collection of classic jazz a while back in LP format and one of the songs on it was &quot;So What.&quot;  Last week, my sister wanted me to buy her some good jazz for her birthday, so i figured i  would get her this album because of the one song.  After she got it, i  listened to it and LOVED it so much, i ordered it for myself and it is  GREAT.  Anyone who enjoys jazz will LOVE this album.  Its well worth it!
B00002MZ2T|4.0|They are a good duo.  Maybe not fantastic, but at least they write and understand their own songs.  This is a decent album, and I Knew I loved You is a pretty darn sweet song.  Good work.
6303579515|5.0|I think this is one of the most charming movies I ever seen, the performance of Liesel Matthews is outstanding, capturing your heart with the spirit of her caracter, no doubt that more movies like this should be  made. the scores are also something worth to be heard. no matter what kind  of person you might be, A Little Princess will kinddle your heart and leave  a pleasant memory within for the rest of your live, for reals
0440219078|5.0|...that is what Lois Lowry has created.  Right down to the hair ribbons and buttons, this world is all about sameness.  It's hard to believe people could be happy living like this.  Lowry is a master and she makes you think  about and cherish the important things, like snow, sunshine, uniqueness,  choice, and love.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Yep, She has done it again. Even better than the last album! If you like real music amd need some umph in your life, you must have this album. Being a man I don't know if I am in her target audience but I can totally relate  to the lyrics and I love it! This album has a much more up tempo vibe and  each beat goes so well with her sexy, steamy voice. The lyrics are great  and the music is so smooth. A must have, period!
0446525537|5.0|As a regular Sparks reader, I think Sparks is at his best in this book. It is easily read, heart warming and extremely beautiful. I will hardly wait for his next work. Mr. Sparks, please keep up the good work!
0679735909|5.0|A difficult read, but well worth it
B000002ADT|5.0|Couple weeks while I was in St.louis I stepped into a record store and asked for a good,all around jazz cd, the gave me KIND OF BLUE, he continued to say that this was Jazz101.he was so true
0380778556|5.0|This was a great book.  One of my very favorites.  The movie was good, but the book is oh so much better!  I really liked that we never get a glimpse of the beauty of Rebecca, it is left up to our imaginations, and contrasted  with the second Mrs. DeWinter, we only know her by that name, nothing else.  This story is sometimes light and at most times chilling. Do not cheat  yourself out of a great book!
B00000K3UU|4.0|I don't think this movie was as funny as Happy Gilmore or even Billy Madison. This movie has more of a serious type of story to it much like the wedding singer did, yet still funny. The kid in the movie paired with  Sandler make a hilarious couple. Must have on DVD, along with my hat that  says, &quot;Big Daddy&quot;.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I'm honestly not sure which CD I would rank as the #1... Affirmation is simply amazing, however a couple of the songs just havn't captured my attention yet. When I bought the CD, I popped it in and was shocked to hear  a more pop-like track hit me straight off... however after a short while I  found myself singing along with the songs as if they were old friends. The  slow songs are gorgeous, pulling feelings of regret and pain out of even  the peppiest of my friends. The faster songs are a great break, while still  keeping the despair level constant. Excellent CD, excellent band.
B00001OH7N|5.0|My first Bowie record.  I bought it after hearing someone play &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; for me.  I stll think when Bowie was with the original Spiders he made his best music.  And with Eno too,don't get me  wrong.  Simply, a great record.
B000000WFZ|5.0|I would say that this movie soundtrack is one of the very best of Ennio Morricone and one of my favorite in my soundtrack albums collection. It is always a joy to listen to this gem of music. I highly recommend to buy it.
B00000K19E|5.0|To fully appreciate the Matrix, watch it on DVD with ProLogic.<br />Excellent script, acting, effects, stunts. Jackie Chan meets Hackers. I found it reminiscent of Dark City and perhaps Total Recall, in that things are not  always as they appear...
630529142X|1.0|This was the worst film I have ever seen done by Adam Sandler.  I was appalled he had anything to do with it.  There was nothing funny at all about the poor character and where were the morals to this story.  It's not  okay to make fun of people who are different, and it's not okay for them to  change to suit the way their preppy friends think..  JUST NOT FUNNY
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I was deeply moved when I heard I Knew I Loved You on the radio.  By then, I knew I needed to have this cd.  I have their first one and I have to say that this a very good follow up.  I've never heard of a voice more angelic  than the lead singer's.   Just beautiful!
6304056958|5.0|This MGM classic features a divine Norma Shearer as a loyal wife, trumped by ace-in-the-hand Joan Crawford's husband-stealing trollop. Thrill to a witty, scathing playscript penned by Clare Booth, originally a Broadway  smash-- made better for the screen! This picture is a no-holds-barred,  acid-tongued henhouse brawl, with stellar performances from everyone  involved. You'll be sharpening your claws and dipping into your own bottle  of Jungle Red by the time the picture wraps-- after all, &quot;pride is a  luxury a woman in love can't afford!&quot; Don't miss this Hollywood  bonanza!
B000000W5F|1.0|One of the best bands of the sixties hits the bottom. Having sucessuffuly made the transiton between their blues roots to rock, now they get lost in their transiton to Las Vegas and Broadway. They start to forget the music  and concentrate in the stage lights and hip movements. The muzak mediocrity  of &quot;Start me up&quot; makes us miss even the Hermman Hermits and the  Partridge Family .
8185300453|5.0|a wisdom without compromise, beyond any concept. Clear, easy and logical it deals with and leads to deepest spiritual insight. Since I have this book I really dont need any other (Amazon wont like this statement, ha  ha). Every day I read in it and every day it is a fresh source of light  touching in the dephts of my being. Only for those who feel a link to  jnana-yoga.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Alien 3 is the darkest and most emotionally driven of the series.  Yes, I loved Aliens (which is my favorite) and the relationships between Ripley and Newt &amp; Ripley and Hicks(see the director's cut), but I feel very  strongly for some of the characters as the movie progresses.   Ripley  feeling satisfied that the Aliens were destroyed only to find out that they  are back and still controlling her life.  Finding an adopted daughter and  possibly romance from Hicks only to wake up with them dead.   <br />The  performances are great, Weaver's, Dutton's and especially Dance's.  Visually, this one is the most striking and contains the most beautiful  ending in this series.   Still there are some problems.  Everybody's  favorite complaint is how the egg ended up close to the cryo tubes.  All  they needed was a shot during the opening credits of two eggs behind the  dropship's landing struts.  The CGI effects were usually unconvincing, but  I can understand why they were need for the Alien to run across the  ceiling.  The film also suffers from the gross overuse of the f-word in the  second half.  Many people complain and wish to know why the Alien looks and  moves differently.  Simply put, it was born out of a dog.  The writers were  trying to establish that Aliens born from organisms other than humans will  be different.  When you think about it, the only Aliens we ever saw were  born from humans.  We never saw the Alien that was born from the  &quot;space jockey&quot; in the first movie.  I also wish that the movie  would have gone into more depth with the prisoners' adoption of religion.  Yes I am a knitpicker, but I think this is a great film and logical ending  to the series. What am I hearing about a director's cut to this one.  I  know about the Special Edition of Aliens, but could someone say how I could  get the director's cut of Alien 3?
B0000203YT|5.0|Words almost aren't enough to express the profound joy I experience each time I see this film.  For anyone who loves Shakespeare...who loves the  theater...who loves the written word...this film is a celebration of art,  love, and life.  I cry at the end every time, not because it's sad  (although it is, sort of), but because it's just so wonderful.  This film  is more than a romance, more than a comedy - it's a love letter to the  arts, thrown gloriously up on the screen for us to marvel at.  Ok, enough  gushing - Go out and see the film and judge for yourself!
B000002UCQ|5.0|I am 16 and bought ALL THINGS MUST PASS when I was 15 and it is absolutely fantastic, I believe it is definitely on of George Harrisons best masterpieces, I actually think he writes songs which are relevent to  everyday life and emotions such as All Things must Pass, and other such  relevent songs like &quot;Circles&quot; off of the album Gone Troppo.  George Harrisons music can either leave you feeling depressed or in a  really cheerful mood, I absolutely love all the songs off this album and I  recommend to anyone who is considering buying this album to do so  immediately. George Harrison was always the more underated Beatle but in my  opinion he is the best and always will be, I have been a Beatles fan all my  life and have virtually every album each one of them have done solo except  Ringo Starr, and I also have all the beatles albums, but whats interesting  about George Harrisons solo albums is that they offer a completely  different style to the actual Beatles, which is a good thing because he has  chosen to individualise himself, which can only be a good thing. If anyone  wants to contact me and chat more about the beatles and George Harrisons  work, please do e-mail me: daniel.walton@lineone.net
B00002E285|5.0|Over the years, I never understood why so many people would equate this movie to drug-use.  To me, it is more personal and emotional for that.  This movie deals with basic human emotions, needs, and hurts.  And Bob  Geldof pulls off an wrenching performance.
0195067142|5.0|This book is not to be missed.  This is one of the few works that approach Guy Sajer's magnificent work FORGOTTEN SOLDIER.  Anton Myrer's ONCE AN EAGLE comes close.  As an exMarine myself, this book redefines the notion  of glorious combat.  Mr. Sledge's obvious intelligence shows how necessary  a military draft is to having a force truly representing the people.  Read  also Michael Herr's DISPATCHES.
B0000029DD|5.0|Without question, &quot;Grace&quot; is a must have on anyone's top ten list.  If you only had time enough to listen to one album before a gigantic comet smacked into the earth...This is the one.
0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse-Five was the best book I've ever read. Vonnegut brilliantly shows his views of the worthlessness of war through the story of Billy Pilgrim. And for those of you who say, &quot;Where's the plot?&quot; some  books are rooted more on theme than plot. To include a stronger plot would  deter the reader from fully understanding Vonnegut's messages and themes.
B000009RC2|4.0|The remastered sound is a vast improvement of earlier releases. This is a cd where great musicians really show their abilities, and they can really play fast. The problem is there is so much high speed, frantic playing,  with little development or build up to the searing levels. When they settle down and play  together it sounds great. Not that I want elevator jazz or Kenny G  background music, but a little more group playing like that found  on their next supurb release Birds of Fire is preferred. For pure jazz  fusion lovers, it probably does not get much better than this (unless of course  its Birds of Fire). I love MO early work and this is a 5 star release, but in comparison with Birds of Fire, it is only a 4 star.
B000002WYT|5.0|This was my first DMB cd. I got it just before I went to Australia last summer, and I ended up listening to it on repeat the entire plane ride! I still listen to it all the time, and it's already started to skip. I love  their use of instumentals, and Mathew's voice is oh so wonderful to listen  to. I could't choose a favorite if you forced me. They're all great!
B000002UZ4|5.0|A great CD brings back the songs that made them what they are...&quot;West End Girls&quot;, &quot;Being Boring&quot;, &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;, etc.<br />Great CD has it all....I don't think anything  from &quot;Nightlife&quot; will be going on a greatest hits CD any time  soon.<br />Buy this one, if you are a PSB fan...You won't be disappointed.
0140186409|1.0|As if it weren't bad enough that _The Grapes of Wrath_ is an example of naturalism, it's even worse that it is *bad* naturalism laced with tear-jerking propaganda. John Steinbeck was a well-known leftist. So what?  So was Victor Hugo, but Hugo was a bonafide romantic writer. Steinbeck  couldn't even devise a plot, aside from the weary, disconnected journey of  a destitute family.<br />Aside from its nauseating politics, the entire novel  is filled with filthy characters doing nothing in particular save a  near-constant whining about their sorry &quot;fate.&quot; And the end is so  unspeakably stomach-turning that any virtues _Grapes_ might have had are  dashed for a cheap gross-out.<br />Save your minds and stomachs. Read Hugo  instead.
B0000029AL|5.0|this is quite possibly the best album i have ever heard. i bought this album on vinyl years ago.i love this album. from the crunchiness of joe perrys guitar on mama kin, to the haunting sounds of steven tylers vocals  on dream on.. this album rocks. if you have any brains you will buy this  cd. you will not be dissapointed .the boys do a rendition of walkin the dog  that will blow your socks off.  BUY THIS ALBUM
B000002B35|3.0|I've given it 3 stars, but would have liked to give it 2,5 stars were this possible on the ratings system. This expensive live double-album (10 of its 24 tracks have appeared before on previous live release 'Delicate Sound of  Thunder') is listenable enough in places, but hardly a substitute for the  albums from which these live tracks were culled** The live performance of  'Dark Side Of The Moon' - which makes up the bulk of Disc Two - is largely  forgettable when one is familiar with the original and counts, in the end,  as a kind of passing novelty item. Disc One offers the most enjoyment, with  its mix of the old and the new. Stand out tracks include 'Astronomy  Domine', 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' and 'High Hopes'.    Doubtless the  remaining members of the Floyd plus guest musicians are very accomplished  musicians; doubtless, too, that the live show documented in the incredibly  lavish (but ultimately pointless) booklet was awesome to behold, but  there's very little here in the way of surprises: on the whole the tracks  sound like well-executed, but all-too-familiar copies of studio originals  and therefore, despite the enjoyable moments and the good mix of material,  one cannot shake the impression that 'Pulse' stands overall, as a sometimes  pleasant but rather bland and overblown introduction to a great band.  **  As to the albums in question, 'A Momentary Lapse of Reason' and 'The  Division Bell' do not, to my ears anyway, surpass in scope or brilliance  'The Wall', 'Piper At The Gates Of Dawn', 'Dark Side Of The Moon' and 'Wish  You Were Here', but they do feature between them a handful of memorable  songs, some of which are included here - &quot;Learning To Fly&quot;,  &quot;Sorrow&quot; and &quot;High Hopes&quot;.
B000002B30|3.0|I've been a huge Bruce fan for years, but I find listening to this CD frustrating.  It's obviously not meant for existing fans -- we already have most of the tracks on the original albums, and the four new ones are hardly  essential (although &quot;Murder Incorporated&quot; captures a small taste  of the old magic, probably because it's a leftover from the days of  &quot;Born in the USA&quot;).  But is this really the album to make new  converts?  Hardly.  The selections are skimpy and obvious, and some of the  omissions really hurt -- how can a collection of Bruce's  &quot;greatest&quot; singles not include &quot;Tenth Avenue  Freeze-Out,&quot; &quot;I'm On Fire&quot; or &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;?   Beyond that, any real Bruce fan knows that many of his best songs were  never released as singles, such as &quot;Jungleland,&quot; &quot;Racing in  the Street,&quot; &quot;Reason to Believe&quot; and &quot;Downbound  Train.&quot;  It's a measure of Springsteen's greatness as an artist that a  collection containing this many songs still feels as if you're only getting  the thinnest layer.  My advice to old fans: Don't bother.  My advice to new  ones: Try almost any original Bruce album instead.  This one is a good  addition to a bar jukebox, but not for anyone's personal collection.

0783211856|5.0|Steven Spielberg has captured in this film the story of a man who at first decided to capitalize on the misery around him during WWII and the German occupation of Poland.  Liam Neeson, as Oskar Schindler is perfect as the  womanizer, and neer-do-well.  He is unscrupulous in starting his new  business and yet discovers his own humanity, to the surprise of himself as  well as his friends and family.  He risks everything to save hundreds of  Jews that work in his factory from the death camps, when everyone else was  either complicit or turning a blind eye.  The story also captures the  essential elements of the Warsaw ghetto and how the final solution was put  into effect.  The part of the Camp Kommandant, is played with brilliance by  Ralph Fiennes...a drunk, a zealot, a coward, and ultimately a  monster...shooting people in the camp with a high powered rifle, simply for  the sport.  This film has been criticized, but it is the only film which  faces the Holocaust without turning away, or making some kind of lame  excuse.  The scene in the ghetto where the Jews are being rounded-up for  extermination, or shot on the spot, while one of the SS troops plays  Mozart, will stay with me for the rest of my life.
B000002LQR|5.0|If you are thinking twice about getting this cd... DONT, ok this is like soooooo good. Every song is so different, and unlike alot of there other stuff there isn't a lot of repatition and it's all very interesting. There  are a lot of bridges (speaking of which under the bridge is on this cd and  that's like the best sond ever) in the songs and every song is very  different all the way to the 14th song (that's the last one). there is not  one bad song on the whole cd and you seriosly have to buy this cd... ok  cool, go but it.
B00001U0DP|5.0|months after seeing it for the first time, just the music in your cd player makes you cry.  I've been a Benigni fan for over 10 years and was always amazed at his comic genius.<br />With this film my love for him and his  work grows.  And listening to the cd in my car still makes me cry, ask the  toll booth attendants that always ask if I'm okay...<br />Happy, sad, joyful,  enraged...these are simple words to describe the emotions Benigni made me  feel...'Enthralled' describes my entire state of being in regards to this  film..
B000002WYT|5.0|DMB has done it again!  With Dave's beautiful voice and the band's great instrumental talent, this CD is awesome from beginning to end!

Take it from a DMB fanatic, buy this CD, you'll  absolutely love it! ......Good Job Dave Matthews Band!

B000002UDV|5.0|I'm young (26) and had always thought of the Beach Boys as kind of a tired, hear-it-while-you-shop-at-Kmart type of band. I only bought their Endless Harmony CD to hear &quot;Heroes and Villians&quot; because the lead  singer of one of my favorite bands (Barenaked Ladies) claimed in the Wall  Street Journal that the above song was one of five songs he felt most  influenced by.<br />On this same CD was a rehearsal version of &quot;God Only  Knows,&quot; and I was, well, MOVED. I rushed out and bought Pet Sounds and  began to explore this un-Beach Boys album.<br />I really fell in love with the  super-personal level of the lyrics, how Brian Wilson expressed his  insecurities and wishes for safer places, and how the album seemed to use a  metaphor (in the form of an audible train) to get across the idea that he  was on the inevitable path to growing up, and how he'd have to leave any  childish longings behind.<br />The last song on the album, &quot;Caroline  No,&quot; is as personal and moving to me as any piece of music I have ever  heard, especially after reading about the life of Wilson.<br />Pet Sounds is  certainly Wilson's goodbye to childhood, and, unfortunately (in my opinion)  his goodbye to writing and producing such beauty.
044100590X|5.0|The environmental pictures painted are peerless.  The characterizations are excellent.  The religious intrigue, while not mystical or deep, is nonetheless captivating (especially if you're a fan of messianic,  &quot;Chosen One&quot; tales).  And the story is wonderful!  If you like  fantasy, sf, or great novels in general, check it out.  (But be sure to get  this new Ace edition; it certainly can't have _more_ typos than the Putnam  hardcover.)
B000002LND|5.0|Yes folks, I was not much of a Madonna fan before I bought this CD.  But that has change.  It is a take-no-prisoners type of CD with nothing to put you to sleep. Check out Vogue--that is a first class song. A great  collection to remind you that 80s music wasn't as bad as today's female  angst garbage.  Now if only Madonna can stop some of those excessive stage  antics!
6305388458|5.0|Those things that are your most sacred are the things that you should burn! A very smart person said that and this movie may be a prime indicator that it is a good tenent to follow.

0385474547|4.0|This story moved me.  Without judging anyone (and there are few characters in this book one would judge sympathetically) this tells the story of a man before and during the beginning of British colonization.  My major  disappointment is that although the story and characters are compelling,  the writing is dismal.  If you would like to read novels set in Nigeria  which have really good writing, try Ben Okri's Famished Road.  In short,  this won't be the most exciting read of your day, but it is certainly  enlightening and moving --- but far from uplifting.
B000000ZGO|5.0|&quot;Walk On By&quot; was my first make out record at 15. I don't know what got worn down more, me and my boyfriends lips or the vinyl on the record...<br />Seriously, you want a nice, slow sensual evening with somebody  special who can appreciate the late 60's/early 70's soft soul grooves, then  pick this up. You won't be disappointed.
0790734850|5.0|This movie is the reason that I bought my DVD player.  This was the best movie of the 90's.  I still can't believe that TITANIC beat it.  <br />What I get to be the message of this movie is &quot;perception.&quot;  No one is  who you think they are.  Bud White is not just a thug with a badge.  He  actually has a brain.  Exely is not as straight laced as he first appeared.   Jack works for a television show, which is all lies played to be the  truth.  The idea of perception is best shown in the hookers who are  &quot;cut&quot; to look like movie stars.  They may look real, but they are  not.  <br />Watch this movie and see how a movie is supposed to be made.
B000002UA9|5.0|It's a mistake to compare this album to any other in their catalog. Of course it's not Seargent Pepper, thank God. Nothing against that album, but I bet Lennon listened to this one a whole lot more than Pepper. And for  good reason. I disagree that this album sounds primitive. The Beatles had  plenty opportunity to polish thier act in Hamburg and the Cavern. Their  youthful, exuburent vocals shine all the way through this disc. Lennon's  vocals, particularly, amaze. I don't know if he ever sang better. I've  always thought that this album &quot;sounded&quot; great, probably because  it was mastered directly from the 2-track session tapes. It kicks much  harder than their next three studio albums. Anyway, forget all the rubish  that begins &quot;not as good as.&quot; If you love pop/rock/vocal, you'll  love this album. And don't feel guilty when you reach for this one instead  of 'The White Album.' There's good reason
0517122707|5.0|I have never been to New Orleans; I have, on a train between Boston and NYC on a Thanksgiving week-end cursed all overweight Americans for squeezing other people from the seats they were entitled to; I have no  sympathy for the redaers who gave this book 1 star; I'm pretty sure I'd be  embarrassed by most of those who swear this book is THE GREATEST EVER! ;  but unlike people books are never embarassing, they are good or bad, they  make you turn another page or shut them to oblivion, and I can assure you  that the Confederacy of dunces is a page-turner, especially for those who  (without having to go down the author's extreme path) still feel they lost  something he day they decided to stop ranting at the world's mad ways from  the sidelines to step into it.

B00000ILE6|4.0|While some movie purists do not like the extra footage added to this special edition of the movie, I think it makes it better for the following reasons: 1) the footage of the colony as an active and bustling place  before the colonists are all wiped out provides a stark contrast to the way  the colony complex looks when Ripley and the Marines arrive, and 2) the  Remote Sentry scenes are good because they add to the pressure that Ripley  and the survivors are under.  The aliens are a constant threat. In the  original version, the aliens are not seen or heard from for nearly an hour  after the escape from the processing plant.  All in all, the extra footage  makes the movie even better. The real flaw with Aliens is having Ripley in  hypersleep for 57 years, which really strains credibility.  They could have  rewritten the story so that she was in hypersleep maybe for 5 years.  After  all, why would the company executives punish her for something she did  before they were even born?  The writers could have eliminated any  reference to a daughter of Ripley's, or, to add to the dramatice impact,  she could have died in an accident while Ripley was still in hypersleep.   This would have made Ripley's maternal instincts towards Newt even more  powerful.  The only thing I would have liked to have seen added is another  glimpse of the colonists in a beleagured state, and maybe Ripley coming  across Hudson with a face hugger on him while she searches for Newt, and  Ripley kills Hudson to spare him any further suffering.  Otherwise, apart  from the aforementioned plot flaw, Aliens is a great movie and one of my  favorites.
B0000060NA|5.0|I was there when this album first came out and decades later I still play it like a new found religion.<br />I CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF &quot;AS&quot;, it sounds as fresh and inviting, and overwhelming and hot! and inticing and  true as ever. Preachy, real, poetic, soothing, and intense, I just  surrender to it everytime I hear it.<br />THE BEST MAN movie could not have  picked a better song. Stevie is still Hot! And I will love him Always...
B000002I2I|5.0|I've been listening to this regularly since 1970, worn out three LP's, two casettes, and even an eight track, and I'm still not tired of it.  This album is what I think of when I think of The Doors.  Not the classic radio  tunes like LA Woman, or Riders on the Storm which I have grown tired of,  but hard bass thumping bluesy rock from a simple guitar band.  The music  and lyrics more typify that late sixties early seventies generation than  any other.  The anger of &quot;Peace Frog&quot;, cynicism of &quot;Ship of  Fools&quot;, the search for love and meaning in &quot;Queen of the  Highway&quot;.  Can't help but think of Eric Bourdon and the Animals in  &quot;The Spy&quot;.  And if you love that throaty voice of Jim Morrison,  you gotta love Maggie M'Gill.  One of my all time favorite albums.
B000020617|5.0|If you were like me, and didn't think &quot;Learn To Fly&quot; deserved a #1 spot on the airwaves when compaired to their earlier stuff, Don't worry, the rest of the album more than makes up for it. Don't get me wrong,  &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; is a great tune, but not as strong as the rest. I  think &quot;M.I.A.&quot; would have made for a better single (I'm sure it's  to come next) and would have shaped my impression differently about the  album had I heard that song first. While being a mellower album that their  first two, it does not dissappoint. Although, I do suggest listening to it  about 5 times through before making up your mind. &quot;Stacked  Actors&quot; shows that they haven't forgot that loud music is what makes a  rock band go 'round. David, you're my hero, and great job on &quot;New Way  Home&quot;. Wow, what a tune. Long live Foo Fighters.
0345308239|5.0|The book is a penetrating analysis of the collective madness that overtakes governments, causing them to act consistently, wittingly and willingly in a manner inimical to their own interests. This process is  illustrated by a collection of essays on the wooden horse, the Renaissance  Popes, The British loss of America and the Vietnam War. An excellent read  and a book that I, as a consultant, have given away a number of times to  clients who were similarly hell-bent on self-destruction - with excellent  results.
B000009ED0|2.0|I bought this album after hearing and seeing Bawitaba and Cowboy, because they were great songs at the time. You listen to this album for a while and  it really starts to get older... and older... and older. For just about  everyone, no matter how big a Kid Rock fan they are, I bet you'll wake up  one day and look for a CD to play, and suddenly Devil just won't appeal to  you whatsoever. Kid Rock's &quot;white trailer pimp trash&quot; image is  humorous and fun for a while, but wears thin extremely quickly, I guess  maybe because it all is just a show he puts on. His bragging about how much  he drinks and smokes is enjoyable for a little while, but just gets old  fast. Maybe if he quit relying on all the rap so much (because he's not  good at it), quit putting on a show, and put a little depth and feeling  into his music and element (the guitar is great), he'd be worthy of  contending with a REAL rock band, like Tool.
0800136586|5.0|I don't know how people can say that this is a bad movie, I think it is just great.  Annie sang just right, and she was the perfect part for the Annie orphan.  I watched the new version that just came out and don't get  me wrong, I liked it, but it just wasn't the same as the first Annie was, I  liked the first Annie much better.  This is my favorite movie, and will be  for years to come.
B000002BFZ|4.0|As virtually every other review here states, this album is vastly underrated.  If you're only a fan of &quot;the hits&quot; i.e. Ten, or the PJ's radio singles, this may not hit you right at first.  Give the disc a  few listens before casting it aside.  I had shelved it for about a year and  a half, but now it's one of my favorites.  A few of the songs have a Neil  Young sound (probably because they had just worked with him the year  before, in 1995).  All around strong songs - I cannot figure why this disc  never got its full share of accolades.
B00000K19E|5.0|My favorite genre is romantic comedies (aka &quot;chick flicks&quot;), so I was amazed at how much I liked this movie.  The performances were all great - I think the other folks who criticized them were watching some  other movie; the special effects were beyond astounding, and the storyline  was brilliant and highly original.  If any of my family/friends are  reading, BUY THIS DVD FOR LISA FOR CHRISTMAS!  =)
B000009FJL|5.0|This has got to be my favorite of all early Genesis (except The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway). From Looking for Someone to Knife , I can listen to this repeatedly . My only question is that although this has got to be one of  the best , why has the record industry failed to release this in a  digitally remastered version as they have for all the others ..... ? I'm  still waiting !
B000002C4J|5.0|I love all the songs and I can't wait for the new CD called ALL THE WAY to come out in stores on November 16, It's sure to be a smash. I heard the single &quot;Thats the Way It Is&quot; and saw the video on Vh-1. It rocks.
079215228X|5.0|If you want to see a romantic story you'll remember forever, this is the one. A DVD FORMAT IS URGENTLY NEEDED for making it a real Classic.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Duran Duran as we all know it has been one of the best music groups from the 80's. This album is just incredible! amazing! it will knock your socks off! dont miss out because this is one of those albums that you will listen  to for the rest of your life! buy now! at amazon.com, you will enjoy every  single song in it! I swear!
B000002U82|5.0|Nuff said - this disc is da bomb - the classic of all classics.  Hey planet boy - forget about it - REM will never touch this.
0446525537|5.0|I was born in the 70's, and this book was a great one. It will be on my shelf for a long time. How could one be disappointed after reading this? How shallow and heartless! Where is their sense of caring, giving and of  course love? Life isn't etched in stone as we all know. One may need to  read it again if disappointment was the feeling the first time. Think about  your first love then maybe reality will set in...Mr. Sparks, keep up the  good work.  I am a loyal reader after this one!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This album has only 10 songs, and every single one is excellent. I didn't expect much from this album, but I was extremely surprised by the overall quality of the album. I highly recommend it.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|The new CD from these guys had a lot of expectations to live up to from me... and it's surpassing all of them!  Ever since I got the last CD, I've been in love with Savage Garden, and I went to see them in concert last  year.  They're really talented, and the new CD is great.  I love it!
0784011796|5.0|When i first saw this movie i was stunned by it's concept. How to make an interesting movie with a theme like numbers. It's both magical, mystereous, and religeous. Religion has got nothing to do with God (or Gods), it's the  obsession of the subject.<br />Welcome to the religion of numbers
B000002VRZ|5.0|This is a compilation of hits by the southernest rock band that ever hit the radio. Their lyrics deplicted the images of the stories our papa's papa's told us, time of the wild southern east. Backed by some the most  classic riffs and jams of rock. The Outlaws are timeless. I remember  sneeking into the Twain( or maybe 49th st.) with my older uncle to watch  them rock the night away. If you've had the pleasure of wadeing the flats  of Tampa Bay hunting Redfish and Snook at sunset, you know what &quot;Green  grass and tides forever&quot; is all about. Hats off to the Outlaws!
B000006T0D|4.0|I first heard EAT TO THE BEAT on the radio twenty years ago, and that night I decided to take Blondie seriously. Of course the songs are catchy, everybody remembers &quot;Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Atomic.&quot; But the  singing and musicianship were utterly top notch, even in the year that gave  us Joe Jackson and the Pretenders, along with Elvis' GET HAPPY!, and the  production put it over the top. Every note on this album is HUGE! Who would  doubt it if he were told Phil Spector had a hand in it? The songs are just  as good as those on PARALLEL LINES, with a little less cuteness, and the  whole set sounds much more unified without all sounding the same--sometimes  dreamy, like &quot;Shayla,&quot; sometimes driving, like &quot;Living in  the Real World,&quot; and always sounding exactly the way it should. It's  great that almost all of Blondie's work is available in one set; but this  is such a tight and of-a-piece set that it's a shame it's so hard to  experience it in its original form. Buy it and see.
0783233477|5.0|Anthony Hopkins is approaching his 65th birthday, when he is visited by Death (Brad Pitt), who decides to hang around and get a taste of what living is like. This film is top-notch stuff: Quality script, excellent  acting from everyone, particularly Hopkins and Pitt, and the whole thing is  filmed so artistically that your DVD player will look like a million  dollars. It's three hours long, but it never drags, and has the greatest  emotional peaks and troughs. Sumptuous, thought-provoking and sensitive.
6304346107|5.0|This British (A&amp;E) version of Jane Austen's Emma is so much more skillfully done than the Gwyneth Paltrow (Hollywood) version. Kate Beckinsale is incredible as Emma. She plays the part so realistically and convincingly, while Paltrow almost makes a joke out of the story. The A&amp;E version is also so much more true to the book than the Hollywood version. (I have noticed that it is often this way: the Brits end up outdoing the flashy, but unfortunately shallow Hollywooders.) Along with all that, the music is beautiful, the scenery, unforgettable. This is definitely a must-see for anyone interested in Jane Austen or that time period in history!
6300182266|5.0|Yet it has managed to survive in the minds of many science fiction fans even after over 20 years.  (Yes, I am a BG fan, but not fanatical enough to say &quot;yahrens.&quot;)  If it has lived this long, it certainly must  have some redeeming qualities and not be just another Star Wars  ripoff.<br />This movie -- the pilot for the series -- and a number of other  episodes including &quot;War of the Gods,&quot; &quot;Experiment in  Terra&quot; and &quot;The Long Patrol&quot; showed what this series could  supply at its best.  Let's all hope there is a new BG movie or series  coming out soon, as the revivalists predict, because we (the fans, as well  as the fanatics) deserve one.
B0000041DZ|5.0|I have never heard anything like Alfred Brendel's recording. It is absolutely the best Beethoven I have ever heard. Alfred Brendel is the best Beethoven interpreter in the world and this is the definitive recording.  The slow movements, in particular, are interpreted beyond comparison. I've  heard Barenboim, Schnabel, Ashkenazy, and many others, but none compare to  the supreme beauty and passion that Brendel puts into his interpretation.  The fact that they're digital makes it all the more worthwhile to buy this  glorious cycle. Don't be daunted by the price, believe me, it will be among  the very best, if not the best purchace of a recording you will ever make.
B000021XS0|4.0|Dream Theater has returned the sound they developed on &quot;Images and Words,&quot; but at last without the pop-metal influences.  LaBrie's clean vocals are the biggest indicator of this . . . as well as the musical  motifs borrowed from the first part of &quot;Metropolis&quot; on I&amp;W.  You can still hear the hard-rock DT of the last two albums in the back,  however, so they haven't lost their edge.<br />I like Jordan Rudess'  keyboards--I wish he would stand out more.  He sounds a bit like Kevin  Moore in spots.<br />The feel of this album is like a more technical version  of &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot; (instrumental bits added).  I'm not so  sure the concept holds so well together, but the way the album is  constructed is quite solid.<br />Overall, not bad.  A step back in the prog  rock direction.
0425170055|3.0|I'm a great fan of Clancy and have read every one of his novels, however I've always harbored doubts about his mental stability. With this book, there are no more doubts and it becomes pretty clear that he's slipped over  into the deep end. I don't have any brief for radical environmentalists  either, but to concoct a plot where they're conspiring to use an engineered  virus to exterminate the entire human race in order to save the planet?  This is too much. The best parts of this book are the accounts of the  military actions executed by the Rainbow Six team against three terrorist  missions in the early chapters.  These scenes are top-notch vintage Clancy,  but since they are only indirectly related to the main storyline, they too  only add to its disjointed nature. As always with Clancy, character  development and dialogue are pretty shallow. The climactic action at the  end of the book where Rainbow Six takes down the eco-crazies  in an  effortless turkey shoot comes across as little more than a childish revenge  fantasy on Clancy's part, wholly unworthy of the warrior ethos he generally  represents in his work. Clancy was a his best in his early books where plot  and character were incidental to the military action. He's trying to do it  the other way around now, and he's out of his depth. He's still fun to  read, but he could use a strong editor rein him back into his zone of  competence.
B00000J7J4|5.0|The guy who wrote the review of this album for amazon.com was way off about the collaborations.  Maybe they are just ways to attract younger listeners, but it works so well that both young and old Santana listeners  can enjoy them.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple has done it again.  She is an absolutely beautiful and amazing person.  &quot;When the Pawn...&quot; is outstanding, some of my favorite tracks are &quot;Love Ridden&quot; &quot;On the Bound&quot; and &quot;Fast  as You Can&quot;
0451196716|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST WRITING STEPHEN KING HAS EVER DONE.THE MOST GRIPING TALE IVE EVER READ. I ORIGINALY READ THIS STORY IN THE BACHMAN BOOKS MANY YEARS AGO.  I GAVE THE BOOK AWAY AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR  &quot;THE LONG WAlK&quot; EVER SINCE. THIS STORY WILL KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE  OF YOUR SEAT AND YOUR IMAGINATION!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I have been a closet &quot;Rage&quot; fan for years.  I've loved their other albums, but this one takes the cake.  EVERY song is a good song.  These guys never let up.  Their energy is incredible.  This album  definitely catapaults them to superstardom.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|I have to admit that I was clearly shocked by this album. It is no longer songs about her former partners and men who she mistrusted. It is actually something that I can listen to. No more crying and screaming about us bad  bad things... men.
6302994063|5.0|I typically like &quot;ugly duckling&quot; movies, and as an amateur ballroom dancer, I really loved the movie's take on the competitive ballroom dance scene.  This is one of my favorite dance films.
0345347951|5.0|This book is extremely deep. Its plot has intricate development, and yet goes at a pace and simplicity that is followable.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Lighten up, pop open a bubbly, suspend all belief and have a good time. This is the sort of movie you watch just to have some mindless good fun. Sure the 'science' is laughable. Sure the characters are two-dimensional  cardboard cutouts. Sure the dialogue is sophomoric. So what? Enjoy  yourself.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona's new cd is awesome, I love the song &quot;Get Gone&quot;, I love the whole cd.  She is such a talented writer, pianist, and singer.  She could've had a 1000 word cd title and I would not have cared because she  has the talent to back up everything she does.  Simply amazing.
B000002UR7|5.0|I got this awhile ago and I'm listening to it so much, I think there might be something wrong with me.  I liked OK Computer and The Bends instantly, the first listen, so I was dissappointed with my first listen to Pablo  Honey - I thought it was unremarkable.  After a couple of more times, I got  hooked, and it's now my favorite.  All three CD's are brilliant.  My  favorite tracks here are You, Thinking About You, Ripcord, Vegetable, I  Can't, Lurgee, Blow Out, basically the whole thing, and the ones I didn't  mention are good too.
6302610702|5.0|One of the greatest motion pictures ever. Wonderful. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, James Caan and Diane Keaton along with Coppola and Puzo's adaptation from the novel are perfect. If you own one video, it has  to be this one. It's an offer you won't refuse.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It not only has great special effects, it has great combat!   This is the movie that you can't stop watching!  It is really cool!
0553108034|5.0|Of all the fantasy series on the market, only three, to me, combine page-turning plotlines, characters you could cry over, solid writing--and believable worlds. Martin joins Robert Jordan, Tad Williams, and early  Katharine Kerr as the best of what modern fantasy has to offer. I know how  popular Salvatore, Eddings, Feist, et al. are; but read them again, and  what you get is good story with junior high school-level writing ability.  Terry Goodkind spins a good yarn, but he's too derivative of Robert Jordan  (why no copyright infringement lawsuit?) and his writing is average at  best. Martin's series, though... wow. Tad Williams remains, to me, the  best-written of all series, Jordan's plot is perhaps the most captivating,  and early Kerr was so real you could smell the horse and steel. Martin is  not the best in any one area, but he does it all so well you'll find  yourself staying up all night turning pages. My only anger is the year-long  wait until the next installment. I know some will chafe at the fact that  this second volume is mostly build-up, with just about nothing getting  resolved. But what a build-up; the tension gets so thick you want to scream  at the characters to get a clue and see what's really coming. If your idea  of fantasy is two-hundred pages of improbably-named Dungeons and Dragons  cliches killing monsters plagiarized from Tolkien, go back to your  Salvatores. But if you're into believable worlds crafted by authors who  obviously have done some homework into late medieval history to flesh out  the details, and characters who are _human_, with human failings, do  yourself a favor and buy A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings. Better  yet, wait until the series is done before you start, or you'll find  yourself in agony, like I am now.
B000021XS0|5.0|'nuff said.  I've been a Dream Theater fan for years, and this album blew me away the first several times I listened to it.
B00000JGOH|5.0|This movie was very nearly perfect on every level.  The sets are fantastic, the costuming is first rate, and the dialogue is beyond compare.  Snappy, witty dialogue is what makes comedy for me much more than physical  comedy or stupidity (which seem to be the order of the day).  If you are  looking for a great movie that honors the tradition of Shakespeare and  keeps you laughing with some of the best dialogue I've seen on screen in  years, you will love this film.  It is more than deserving of every single  award that it won.  If you miss this movie, then you will have truly missed  out.
079073804X|5.0|Warner did a wonderful job restoring this film - the image and sound are stunning.  Yes, this is one scary horror film, but it's not the eye-popping visual effects that scare (they're a tad tame by today's standards - and  I'm not saying today's standards are necessarily better - fake CGI being a  current cinema rip-off) rather, it's the quiet moments of shame, guilt,  fear of the unknown and the testing of one's beliefs that make for the real  horror.  The soundtrack is unsettling throughout the film underscoring the  nervous nature of all the characters.  Most frightening is how accessible a  battle between good and evil can be:  right in anyone's bedroom - little  Regan is no more different than any of us.  The films demon chose its  victim at random and turned the lives of all those involved into a real  nightmare. Also unsettling is the mysterious rustling heard by the mother  in the late hours of night - as explained by the director on the commentary  track - is the creepy beginning of some supernatural presence within the  house.  Turn down those lights and enjoy.  Oh yeah, a word to those who  challange this film to scare and say things like &quot;at the end, I  laughed!&quot;  I dare you to go swimming way out in the ocean by yourself  with the soundtrack to JAWS playing on your headset.  Scared yet?
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This is a great CD for all the Fiona Apple lovers. She's got a slightly different sound but a few of the songs follow in the direction of Tidal (Her last CD). Don't hesitate...get it as &quot;Fast as You Can&quot;!
0783235380|1.0|We have three romantic comedies starring Sandra Bullock, &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Hope Floats&quot;, and &quot;Practical Magic&quot;, all of which we enjoyed.  We looked forward to &quot;Forces of  Nature&quot;, but found the plot very silly.  If the groom-to-be couldn't  get from New York to Savannah by plane, he had many reasonable options  other than the foolish choices in the movie.  Furthermore, there didn't  seem to be any chemistry between Affleck and Bullock, and Bullock's  character was very poorly drawn.<br />The worst aspect of the picture was the  camera work.  There were far too many tight closeups. Too many scenes were  set in garish surroundings, and too often Bullock and Affleck were lit with  blue lights. So visually the picture was unattractive.<br />The final nail in  the coffin was the frequent loud and obstrusive music, and for a PG-13  rating, the use of the &quot;F&quot; word.  Our copy of this movie will be  available for sale.
6302820448|5.0|Hollywood is so wedded to 'formula' plots that a truly original story like this is a welcome change. Not only is the plot great, but it is a very romantic tale as well about an egocentric man who learns about true  happiness.
0201633612|5.0|Design Patterns is required reading for all object-oriented designers, developers, and architects who want to improve and streamline their design skills.  This book will open your eyes and teach you how to utilize widely  accepted and standardized design patterns to implement efficient solutions  for frequently encountered design challenges.  You'll immediately recognize  multiple instances within your own projects in which design patterns would  have improved efficiency and reuse within the architecture.<br />The authors  take a very methodical approach to describe every aspect of each design  pattern including applicability, structure, collaborations, and  consequences to name just a few.  The book is extremely well organized  making it easy to refer to the catalog for a refresher on various  patterns.<br />One of the best OO books I've read.
B00000J2KT|3.0|This is one of my all time favorites,  I couldn't wait to get it on DVD, what a disappointment to find that it is totally in mono !
4789004546|5.0|This book is the best resource I have encountered in all my years as a language learner. It is clear and concise with many examples. The follow up, intermediate edition adds to and compliments this edition. Why Amazon  says its out of print is beyond me. I have seen it in many shops including  Maruzen (in Japan)
630460291X|3.0|I thought they should have included the Bryan Adams single that was on the laserdisc version.. my boy Bill loves that song.
B000020617|5.0|. Waaaa!  Why is everyone harping about Aurora and Next Year? This is the Foo Fighters, not Berry Mantilo (notice I probably spelled that wrong). The slow songs are the low points of the cd. But even a Back Street Boys song  couldn't ruin this record. Generator is very likely the best song Dave has  recorded. The nicely overdriven guitar is there at just the right places.  The bass keeps beat and smooths it up. And the drums in the song are as  good as they could be. It has got ENERGY. Gimme Stitches is also a ROCK  song. The way we can hear the feedback between strums in the chorus is what  rock is all about. What's this about Dave's singing? He hasn't improved. He  didn't need to. He simply used some techniques he hadn't used before. He  was already great. Headwires is another song that people should be  mentioning more. He takes a mellow verse and somehow makes it interesting.  The drum transition into the chorus is brilliant. The chorus, with the  simple B-A-G progression over the new wave style drumming, is terrific. The  vocals in the chorus may be the high point of the bands recording history.  There is no good reason to whine about this cd. But please, like the right  songs!
6305609721|5.0|The movie was great.  It had all the elements of a great movie, humor, action, and a great plot line.  I have been a fan of Star Trek all my life, this one ranks as one of the best.  Why is paramount so reluctant to put  extras on the DVD.  Looking forward to the next Trek movie on DVD.
B000002JOH|1.0|YES WE HAVE A MATCH FOR THE BACKSTREET BOYS NOW.BOTH BANDS DOUND EXACTLY ALIKE.EVERYONE PROBABLY AGREES WITH ME TOO.BUY THIS ALBUM ALONG WITH ALL THE REST AND ADD IT TO YOUR'E BACKSTREET BOYS COLLECTION.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Her breathy vocals, the haunting piano...much like her debut, Tidal, however, &quot;When the Pawn Hits...&quot; continues where Tidal left off.  This is a must have for the Fiona and non-Fiona fan alike.
0780622553|5.0|It is dark &amp; confusing, it is as it should be. The influences are being overplayed upon in these reviews, it is very unlike The Matrix, even &quot;the first half hour&quot; where the birth seen occurs, that looks to  be torn from the pages of an H.R.Gigger book of prints (I hope he was paid  &amp; credited for his work, or the marvels theft of it), D.C. relies  little on Gigger's bio-mechanical stile.  It has a Kafka feel in meny ways  but is fantasy SciFi based, where Kafka has a more hard science fiction  base, more like 1984 then um hell, I can't think of a counter part for the  men in black in this analogy. As for Blade Runner I cannot say, saw it  once, a wile ago.<br />These people missed the oveayis exstream similarities  to City of Lost Children (which I also will give 5 stars), so stop reading  our thoughts, lot of them seem to not know of what they speak.<br />So stop  reading our opinyins, buy or rent this, the effects alone are worth the  time &amp; expense, &amp; unlike The Matrix, the lead in this movie can  act. Oh, cant spell &amp; word check has not a clue, w/ meny words (like  &quot;meny&quot;), sorry about a few spellings in their.
6305657947|5.0|It was hard to see how the original could be bettered and perhaps it hasn't, but it has certainly been equalled in a modern version.  Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway have contempary peers in Brosnan &amp; Russo and  the direction and effects of the film are just stylish as the earlier  version. The original now looks a little dated with its split screen  effects and the clothes of the time, but it still manages to look good.  What is wonderful about this, well I suppose it is a remake, is that is not  a remake.  It stands on its own and comparison with the original is not  relevant, to be familiar with the original is a bonus as there are a number  of very clever and subtle connections made, even to the &quot;Windmills of  you mind&quot; theme running though a number of scenes, most notably the  very sensual dance which replaces the only erotic chess game I have ever  seen. The writers and director must have had a soft spot for the Thomas  Crown character who gets off with a much happier ending than the McQueen  version.  This is also destined to be a classic film that one can watch  again and again and I suspect pick up new subtleties at each viewing.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is the coolest band ive heard ever. They have 9 frigain members. The thing i like the most is the melodic guitars and singing. The guitars are awesome. This isn't much that i can say about this cd except that it is  HEAVY!
B000001EL3|3.0|Arguably KISS's DESTROYER has the best album cover (Even though on the original vinyl version it looks like the word 'DESTROYER' was written on with a typewriter.) I've been marching in the KISS army for almost thirty  years since the beginning, but I don't listen to this one much. First of  all I never got into 'Beth'. I'm sure it's sentimental to Peter and others,  but to me it always sounded like the lyrics were written on a cocktail  napkin, in an elevator of a Holiday Inn. You can always tell whether or not  people are into KISS or not because if the first song they mention is  'Beth', then you can figure they don't know much else. Detroit Rock city I  never really got into either. The music is good and the lyrics are OK, but  it was never one of my favorites. God of Thunder is probably the best tune  on the whole album, but doesn't get proper justice until the ALIVE II  version. Shout it out Loud is the only other song on the album worth  mentioning, a typical sing along KISS anthem. The rest of the album is  mediocre at best. King of the Night Time World, Sweet Pain, and Flaming  Youth will get you by, but Do You love me is really bad. The worst song  ever put out by KISS is on this album too by the way, and that's Great  Expectations. We've all heard Gene time and time again say that he's never  gotton drunk, used drugs, etc., but this song makes me wonder. He should  have saved this ridiculous tune for his solo album. Gene really dropped the  stink bomb on this one. Anyway some will swear this is their greatest album  ever. Personally I think their first three blow this one away.
6305426651|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in years! Finally, a movie that portrays a positive outlook on the human spirit in hope, commitment to family, love. It is a movie I can watch and enjoy and be touched to tears.  It is a movie with good values--not all of us like the violence, vulgar sex  and language, and so-called &quot;reality&quot; of the movies made today.  This is a highly recommended production for all!  Thank you, Roberto!
B000000OE7|5.0|Made in Heaven is a miracle in itself.  When I listen to it, and think about what condition Freddie was in while recording, it makes the songs that much more emotional.  It is surprisingly uplifting and optimistic  throughout, with only an occasion glimpse into what must have been going  through his mind.  Only &quot;Mother Love&quot; (recorded a scant month  before Freddie's death) and &quot;Too Much Love will Kill You&quot; seem to  shine a light into the unimaginable pains he must have been facing.  Every  song is emotionally overwhelming, and I defy anyone to say that it is not  amazing to hear what Freddie sounded like, while so close to his death.   This is a must for any and all Queen fans, if only to have their final  album.  This is a supreme swan song for the quintessential frontman,  Freddie Mercury.  His presence forever living on in these songs, as well as  those in earlier records.  Amazing, wonderful, not to be missed!
6305014140|5.0|Ninja Scroll will keep you on the edge of your seat from begining to end. It is a vivid mix of plots and sub plots! Not for children,this is as good a Japanese animation as you can get. Very worth while, and a must for any  collection.
B0000024RZ|5.0|Bob Dylans The Times They Are A-Changing is what I would call a stepping stone into the full body of his work. Through this album, people unfimilair with Dylans music will get an idea of how politically important he is. In  the song &quot;WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE&quot; Dylan examines the irony  surrounding the strong belief in God most Americans have and the war-monger  mantality this country embodys. &quot;ONLY A PAWN IN THEIR GAME&quot;  illuminates the problems surrounding political power and race. &quot;the  south politician preeches to the poor white man.. You got more than the  blacks ,dont complain.....you're better than them, you've been born with  white skin, he explanes... and the negros name is used at his pain, for the  politicians gain, as he rises to fame, and the poor white remains on the  caboose of the trains, but it aint him to blame, he's only a pawn in their  game&quot;..........&quot;the poor white man is used in the hands of them  all like a tool, he's taught in his schools,from the start by the rules,  that the laws are with him, to protect his white skin, to keep up his hate  so he never thinks straight, bout the shape that he's in, but it aint him  to blame, he's only a pawn in thier game&quot; Knowing that this album was  put out in 65' shows just how foward thinking Dylan is. Buy this albus and  digest every word, You'll be a better person for it. other great Dylan  albums: Desire, Blood on the Tracks, Another side of Bob Dylan, and Bring  it all back home.
630439845X|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was in its original release in the theatre.  I didn't care much for it then.  It needs to be revisited.  I just watched it on video (rather reluctantly) and I loved it.  It is about  anyone who has ever felt repressed, isolated, and without a voice.  And the  joy of expression that can come when one person really touches another.
B000021XS0|5.0|With their Powerful Medal riffs mixed with melodic harmonies, This is truely classic Dream Theater. Let this 77 minute long musical story about a young girls murder, followed by her assailants suicide, take you away from  your ho-hum life. From Scene One: &quot;Regression&quot; (Pink Floydish),  Where a Hypnotist takes a man (The Witness) into his past, right through  Scene Nine: &quot;Finally Free&quot; Where the Spine Chilling Musical Jam  Pulls you into the murder scene......GREAT STUFF !
B0000203YT|1.0|The allegedly ingenious and highbrow humor of this film is based almost entirely on the gimmick of contriving to have \\"real life\\" references for things ultimately stuck in Shakespeare plays, and then a cute idea in SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN.  Here it just seems stupid.  What really drove me nuts was certain members of the audience were laughing hysterically every time it happened. Yet there is no real cleverness applied to the technique, merely the humor of recognition.  I felt the audience members were laughing excessively in order to prove how \\"literary\\" they were for recognizing the HAHAHAHAHAHA !!!! You see WE know NOW that it became Romeo and Juliet ! Get it ?  And it was MARLOWE ^V who might have written Shakespeare's plays - who gave him the idea for the final title.  Get it ? GET IT? <br />Neither do I.

0790745399|5.0|WHAT IS THE MATRIX?  Within this question lies the very essence of the movie.  &quot;Mind-blowing&quot;?  Today's special effects thrillers toss this and other extreme terminology around loosely.  But what of the first  movie since the Star Wars Trilogy to actually EARN this description?  This  is it, friends, an out and out mind-blower!  The cast, plot, and effects of  The Matrix combine to make this the film achievement of the decade.
6305169195|3.0|While it has its melodramatic moments, Armageddon aims to be a fun, action packed movie that largely succeeds. It was better than I initially thought it would be, and is superior to the dreadful &quot;Deep Impact&quot;.  The  main flaws of Armageddon is its occasional lapses into excess.  Was it  really necessary to have MIR blow up.  It seemed like just an excuse for  some action and explosions.  I would have had two Russian cosmonauts on  MIR, and one of them sneaks onto one of the shuttles, but that's just me.   Steve Buscemi is funny, and I loved him in Fargo, but he kind of gets  ridiculous at the end of Armageddon.  And why do they have that machine gun  anyway on the shuttle anyway.  I also thought that scene where Ben Affleck,  the Bear character and the cosmonaut were bouncing around in that rover was  silly.  I found I had to watch the movie two or three times because some  things were incoherent, but overall Armageddon is an entertaining movie  that you will enjoy if you do not see it with unrealistic expectations.
630522577X|5.0|This is an incredible film. One of the best screenplays every written, this is a true classic. Everyone involved with it's production does a superb job, and the movie is a joy to watch again and again. (In fact I  bought the DVD version because my VHS tape was starting to wear-out.)<br />To  make things even better the DVD version is superbly done. Colors are  vibrant, and the sound is terrific. WB finally did a DVD translation right  with this disc and it shows. It's presented in full &quot;letterbox&quot;  widescreen which captures all the elements missing from the VHS  tape.<br />Best of all the disc is packed with extra features! You can watch  and hear Audrey Hepburn do her own singing in two of the movies songs  (Wouldn't It Be Loverly? and Show Me) and she does supprisingly well for  someone who's not a singer. Running commentary is included, as well as the  theatrical trailers. Amazon's price for this disc is a steal, so don't  hesitate!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I'm a big techno fan.  We are talking BT, Aphex Twin, and Paul Van Dyk stuff here.  Nine Inch Nails is my favorite band though.  So my friends  were shocked when i came to school talking about Fiona Apple's new album  (i've had it for about two weeks on mp3, but YES i bought the album too).   My friends were like &quot;God Ryan, that skinnny chick who whines about  being a criminal&quot;.  Hopefully they will at least give When the  Pawn.... a listen because i think it's amazing.  &quot;Paper Bag&quot; and  &quot;Limp&quot; are my favorite songs, but there is not one bad song on  the album.  I'm going to see Rage on the 19th, which i'm really looking  forward too, but I hope Fiona tours because it would nice to go to a show  at least ONCE where I don't get to kick anyones A** or get my A**  kicked.<br />I don't want to sound like a little Backstreet Boy fan but next  to heather graham, Fiona Apple is like the cutest (wicked opinionated  personality too) woman in the world!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|When I first heard &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; on VH1, I thought Savage Garden has worked their magic once more.  In a music world where love songs sound more like lust songs, it's good to hear tunes that talk about love in  an upright, purely emotional position.  The album arrived at my home  yesterday, and I listened to it nonstop.  I used to feel ashamed for liking  pop music, what with a world that's innundated by alternative and hip-hop  acts (which I happen to love, mind you.  I did buy releases from Creed and  Chris Cornell).  The fact remains that their songs are not mindless, catchy  brain glue, but well thought-out, beautifally-written tunes that just  happen to have a helluva beat.  I say congratulations to Savage Garden for  winning me over as a lifelong fan.  I know they won't be like a lot of pop  acts that simply fade into obscurity.  Their chemistry is so great, that I  think a break-up would be all but impossible for Darren and Daniel.  If you  liked &quot;Savage Garden,&quot; then you'll love &quot;Affirmation.&quot;
0425170055|4.0|I loved Without Remorse, so I was looking forward to reading Rainbow Six when I learned it was about John Clark.  Over all, it was a great action book. Sure, the character development was shallow and predictable, but if I  wanted the emotion cluttering the adventure, I would read a &quot;Chicken  Soup for...&quot; book. But as for action and techno-spy toys this was  great. My only complaint is the ending. Really now, Tom, is this the best  you could do? Overall, an entertaining read.
0385484518|5.0|I picked this up through Amazon.com after a co-worker suggested that I &quot;run, don't walk&quot; to the nearest bookstore to buy it.<br />What an amazing story. In a largely cynical and angry age, Mitch Albom's simple yet  remarkably affecting style cuts to the heart of what's really important in  life. Call it divine providence, call it luck, call it what you  will...there was a reason Mitch and Morrie renewed their friendship at the  end of the latter's life. A gentle and touching book you won't soon forget.
0767836286|1.0|I've never written a review, but after seeing this movie, I just had to say something about it.  This movie attracted me, because I live in the DC area.<br />Robbins, Bridges and Cusack are all wonderful actors.  Robbins  acting abilities were great in this film, Bridges is a bit on the wooden  side and Joan was wasted since her part is a small one.  You see her quite  a bit, but the part was minimal compared to the guys.<br />I kept looking  for the character to sympathize with in this movie and there just wasn't  one.  I didn't like any of them.  The photograpy was really bad with a  forties feel to it with cheap horror movie shots.  The plot would have been  a decent plot had the writer presented it with a better story line.<br />As a  rental, at least you are only out a small amount.  I do not recommend this  movie to anyone for purchase.
B00000BKDV|5.0|If you are just discovering Maiden or have never heard this album do not delay in hearing it! Maiden grabbed the music scene by the balls with Number of the Beast and with Piece of Mind, they pulled...HARD! Iron Maiden  in my opinion epitomize everything Heavy Metal could be and this release is  a perfect example of ideal Heavy Metal (I guess you could call me a fan! )  The nitpicking I have read in the other reviews are silly.  &quot;Icarus&quot; is not 100 percent accurate to the story?   Since when  do musicians (or writers or any artists) have to stick with the original of  anything? These are'nt Cliff's Notes they're rock songs! &quot;Maiden were  better with DiAnno?&quot; Everyones got their opinion but then again there  will always be contrary persons that long for the bad old days just to  complain and appear to know something the rest don't. If you really rather  listen to Dianno over Bruce, I've got a butter churn and a steam driven car  that you'll probably love compared to the sucky new contraptions that all  us suckers are using! Up The Irons!
B0000203YT|2.0|Well, who even reads these things?  But maybe I can offer a little counterpoint.  Sure it's dull.  Sure, it contains every Hollywood cliche (follow your dream, don't let people get in your way, sex between people is  good as long as they are attractive).  Sure it panders to people who would  like to look intelligent while they knowingly chuckle at the in-jokes.  This is Titanic for the I-graduated-from-college crowd.  Doomed romance,  lots of creeps in the way, a passionate man (so passionate he abandoned his  wife and children) and a ditzy female who looks great naked.  And yet, the  portions of  R&amp;J (carefully edited so we never see the early portion of  the play where the dingy Romeo is smitten with Rosalind) are exquisite,  making me realize yet again why Shakespeare is a writer for the ages and  Stoppard is not.  Every good line in this film is Will's.
B00001OH7U|5.0|This album signifies the start of Bowie's brilliant, groundbreaking &quot;middle&quot; period.  Gone are the phony glam or &quot;plastic soul&quot; poses -- in their place: Bowie as Grade-A Genuine Weirdo, making  music that still sounds ten years ahead of its time.  How anyone can write  songs as original, obtuse, and engaging as &quot;TVC15&quot; or  &quot;Golden Years&quot; is beyond me.  This album, along with  &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;&quot;HEROES&quot;&quot;, &quot;Lodger&quot;, and  &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; are absolutely essential and flat-out stunning.
1570424632|1.0|The tech stuff was weakly done (many errors), and the whole plot was uninspired.  The dailog was incredible (in the negative sense), and the people stupid (except when the plot required otherwise).<br />With regard to  the reader, Mr. Duke's delivery was stilted and distracting, when not  outright corrupting of the meaning (e.g. misplacement of pauses).<br />Only  finished it 'cause I'm a captive audience in the car...
0792156684|3.0|The movie has good scenes but the least they could do is make a movie today strictly about Titanic only.I was mad when the story was mostly about love but the titanic scenes like the sinking was very good.I suggest A  Night To Remember it is black and white but is good and it is all Titanic.
B00000J8EK|1.0|*sigh*  This cd.. is just awful.. I have a wide range of musical tastes, love the Chems.. but.. they've sold out.. Sure everyone overuses that term.. but honestly... this is horrible.. it's made for children... put 3  or 4 basic layers of music together badly.. overlay repeating annoying  vocals for a few min.. and you have Surrender... Let Forever Be has the one  nice little riff.. but is bad.. Orange Wedge and Surrender are the 2 best  songs on here.. love them.. but you have to skip all over to find them..  ick..   if you like Backstreet Boys type techno.. or bad dance remixes of  Titanic songs.. then you should like this.. it's childish horrible stuff..  the poor Chems.. *sigh*
B000002J1I|3.0|This is the last of the 70's output for Yes and it is, at best, a mixed big.  The cuts Future Times/Rejoice and On the Silent Wings of Freedom are by far the strongest cuts and are equal to anything on Going for the One.   The lyrics of Arriving UFO and Don't Kill the Whale are not up to Yes'  standards but are musically solid.  Madrigal is a strong balad while Onward  is not.  Release, Release is Yes' response to New Wave and is awful.   Circus of Heaven is equally miserable, Wakeman's keyboards on this cut only  make matters worse.  Throughout, the other musicians perform  admirably  particularly bassist Chris Squire. So this disc is not essential to your  Yes collection but is not without merit...Simon
B000006IUQ|4.0|Anthony Hopkins is a wonderful actor.  And sexy too.  This movie was suspenseful, and well-written.  In my personal opinion, it would have been better without Alec Baldwin.  He just doesn't draw the crowds into theatres  like some other actors do.  If Anthony Hopkins could have been paired with,  say, Tom Cruise, or Bruce Willis, I think this movie would have done better  at the box office.  If you think about it and add things up, Alec Baldwin  isn't much of a draw.  But wasn't that bear scarey!  Run, Anthony, run!
B00000JKOF|5.0|Well let's see. A great cast. Good spoofs on grad school, bureaucrats, the occult, politicians, religious leaders and accountants.<br />It just keeps coming, and it's all well done.<br />Watching Macy's Thanksgiving parade will  never quite be the same again.
B000002MH5|5.0|This is their masterpiece. The peak of their songwriting, the height of their music. Every song is a classic. Strap yourself in and listen, damn you, listen!
B00000J7J4|5.0|I was in 'Nam in '69 -- missed Woodstock, but heard about Santana.  Jingo drove me nuts when it came out.  The 70's were still young when EVERYONE's list of the five best guitar players included Carlos. He's still one of the  best and still CREATING music -- not just playing it. Every track on this  CD is great -- even the track with Lauryn Hill (I'm really tired of hearing  about her kid, Zion, on every song she does). The really great thing about  this CD is that Carlos introduces talents like Rob Thomas, Dave Mathews,  and Eagle Eye Cherry to older Santana fans like me who might not otherwise  hear these people. His music is timeless and the last track with Eric  Clapton lets us hear the two best living guitarists on the same song. Ole,  Carlos!
B00002MZ2T|4.0|After I first bought their first CD before they came mainstream, I ended up liking every song on their disk. I wouldn't need to skip through any of them. <br />Their new CD is excellent. Very good! This disc has something that  appeals to everyone. I don't care that much for the slow songs (although I  listen), I like the faster dance mixes. This one has a few slower songs,  although all of them are superbly (sp?) written.<br />Something for everyone.
0671578278|5.0|Since my intoduction to Miles in Warriors Apprentice, I have read all of the books in the series.  Each book is different, which is necessary, because the character grows up and changes in each book.  In Civil  Campaign, the author has set a new high.  Miles has outgrown his past and  has settled into his new life and he has a new love.  The only problem is  that he has told everyone about his plans, except her.  Miles, being Miles  has a great plan, but he has forgotten that great plans can be disastrous  if they don't work!  Predictably, the plan fails and that is the last  predictable thing about the book.  This book has everything from sex  changes to the sins of countesses long dead and it all fits together. This  is the best book yet.  But a word of advice, read it twice - you miss too  much at one reading.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This album is great! I predict it will bring still morre fans to the Savage Garden fold. Darren and Daniel have written some incredible songs that will really touch people, but most especially &quot;I Knew I Loved  You,&quot; and &quot;Two Beds and a Coffee Machine.&quot; This CD will  please just about everyone and is just as good or better than Savage's  debut album.
0453007902|5.0|I'm a big fan of Steinbeck, but had never read this book before listening to it on audio tape in my car. I came close to tears a couple of times. Steinbeck made a career of lovingly and vividly describing both animals and  people in pathetic circumstances.The story is really moving. Sinise's  array of voices is both deep and broad. If you didn't know better, you'd  think there were three or four different readers, each with a clear and  deep understanding of the character he was reading. This audio book is  really an excellent value.
B00000J2KX|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  It is not to be appriciated for a horror film -- if you're looking for cheap Haloween thrills, then this isn't want you want.  This is an intelligent look at the  psychological breakdown of a man in a haunted hotel... <br />This film should  be regarded as a masterpiece on its own, seperate from the novel.  It is  wonderful to see a horror film without cheap suspense and silly thrills.   This film is terrifying on a much more intellectual level...<br />It has  subtle humor and twisted psychology, but lacks the traditional gore  associated with the horror genere.  Get this film today!
B000002J20|4.0|Tales From Topographic Oceans came out at the height of modern acid rock opera.  There was Emerson Lake and Palmer's \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\", Pink Floyd's \\"Dark side of the Moon\\" The WHO and many others.  I hate it when  people listen and get too technical with music like this and not put the  piece in context to its intended purpose and time period.  It is like  watching the Three Stooges and saying that the hitting looks fake and  unnecessary.  OF COURSE IT DOES AND IS but that is not the point.  The  three stooges are not for everyone because everyone has a different taste  or definition to what entertainment is.  I want everyone that did not live  in this period, at least as a teenager, to understand that this music was  to be used as a trip to get away.  To put your mind on a journey and used  with some good drugs or alcohol did just that.  We use to get drunk on  boonesfarm wine smoke grass, watch silent movies while listening to Emerson  Lake and Palmer's Trilogy or Yes's Tales From Topographic Oceans.  I want  to roll one just thinking about it but that is in my past now and life must  go on.  Memories are what this music brings out of me today.  We wanted to  kiss the earth, smell the flowers, help everyone and mostly love each  other.  What a contrast to kids today but that is another subject.  If this  music has made you think or put your mind on a trip then it has done its  job.  I read one review that said this was put on a list of 50 worst  albums.  Obviously that person has never reviewed rap music.  I know I am  probably missing something with rap music but I will put this against any  rap music made.  It will be fun to see how much RAP MUSIC is re-released  after 25 years.  I will make you a bet that this music will still be heard  or rediscover 25 years from now.
0060922583|4.0|Talbot opens up some fascinating doors to understanding the duality aspect of man's physical nature.  Man as both a separate solid person and a \\"wave person\\" connected to all the rest of the waves in the universe. This is  consistent with the dual nature quantum theory of the subatomic particles:  electrons, protons and photons out of which man appears to be composed.   After introducing us to the holographic model formulated by Bohm and  Pribram, Talbot then proceeds to take the reader on a whirlwind tour of  every abnormal event listed  in the Britannica.<br />Talbot started down the  runway on solid ground for 100 pages and then left planet earth for a more  dreamy flight into an array of meandering minds.  We are given glimpses of  aura peepers, clairvoyants, distant viewers, ESP, LSD trippers,  materializations, multiple personality disorders (MPD), near death  experience (NDE), out of body floaters (OBE), phantom limb sensations,  psychokinesis (PKE), stigmata, psychic channelers, psychic healers,  precognitive dreamers, reincarnations, remote viewers, schizophrenics,   shamans, religious hallucinators,  and and then whisked far into the  Swedenborg stratosphere of biblical interpretation.  Obviously there was no  height the author would not reach for to escape the boring tranquility of  90% of mankind. However to fit all of this into one holographic model takes  some stretching. Talk about someone who got caught up in the material,  Talbot closes the dramatic script with the suggestions that scientists  become participatory in their studies instead of mere observers - take the  LSD, take the Out of Body trips, sign up for the Near Death Experiences and  line up for a UFO abduction.  What would any of this prove except the power  of mass hypnosis and the silly putty nature of one's dreams.  Illustrating  that when the mind reaches a dead end, escape into fantasy waits  patiently.<br />Author a prodigious note taker (700 notes in 300 pages) and  name user. Hundreds of names got their 15 seconds of fame here.  What  started out as reasonable survey of the efforts of Bohm and Pribram (a  neat, compact metaphor of the hologram as organizing model of man's  perceptions) steadily, chapter by chapter, leaped into the skies of  speculation.  Certainly a mind expanding read but bring along a parachute.
B00000J8EK|5.0|AS a new listener--this CD has blown my mind! A fully hypnotic, sensual escape into your own mind. I recommend installing it in your favourite cd player whether it be in your home or car and crank this up really loud! If  in your car-open the sun roof or put down the top, drive through the city  or on the open road and see how the world revolves around this music. The  tracks &quot;Let forever be&quot; and &quot;The Sunshine Underground&quot;  are particularly sensual tunes! I recommend this Cd for all ages. I'm 34  and my husband is 48 and he loves it too!
B000002LEM|4.0|&quot;OU812&quot; might not rock as hard as its predecessor, but it's arguably a more mature work.  There's something for everyone here, from keyboard-laden ballads to pounding rockouts and even a blues song for a  closer.  Most of the songs are unforgettably crafted, with the  male-chauvanist &quot;Sucker in a Three-Piece&quot; managing to justify  lines like &quot;sweet little wishbone, yeah, don't wanna break her in  half&quot; by just plain ROCKING.  It sounds like an easy thing to  accomplish, but many albums get it wrong.  Van Halen were champions in  their day, and considering the sorry state of the band right now, I deem  this oldie essential.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I really liked &quot;Tidal&quot;, I was amazed by it's mysterious yet tranquil sound quality. &quot;Tidal&quot; was a great showcase for Fiona's talents, &amp; now comes &quot;When The Pawn&quot;, which in itself is  almost better than her work on &quot;Tidal&quot;. Fiona is blessed with a  beautiful voice, her voice is comforting and at times sexy. She also writes  poetic and fascinating lyrics, and the music fits with her voice like a key  in the lock. &quot;On The Bound&quot; is a very neat song, &quot;Fast As  You Can&quot; is excellent as well, I love all the songs on this record.  Fiona thanks for your hard and clever work on this CD.
B000002L99|5.0|Blow-the-roof-off 80's hard rock, Van Halen style.  That's what &quot;5150&quot; is all about, rich in unforgettable hard rock melodies which, half the time, manage to match their loudness with that good ol'  lovin' feeling.  The title track is arguably the best Van Halen song,  period.  If you consider yourself a hard rock and fan and don't own this  CD, better grab a copy before someone notices.
0375408282|5.0|Fifteen year-old Michael Berg contracts hepatitis and is helped home after vomiting in the street by Hanna Schmitz. She is beautiful and she seems to possess a strength of purpose that Michael lacks. Though Hanna is more than twice his age, Michael falls in love with her.  The exquisite economy of  author Berhard Schlink's style draws you in to the love affair between  Michael and Hanna, framing all with the sight, sound, smell, taste and feel  of life.  Secrets both innocent and horrible abound in this book. Michael  and Hanna meet years after their affair in a courtroom where Hanna is being  tried for a terrible crime. You may think for a time to yourself, ah!, this  is what I would, or wouldn't, have done. But as is true in life, and  underscored in this marvelous book, good and evil have fuzzy edges.  The  Reader is a book of mirrors: horror and joy, compassion and cruelty, often  intermingling. You won't avoid seeing yourself here.  Words like atonement,  epiphany, and forgiveness come to life in this book- and hope. The book is  a classic to be read and studied for years to come. Carol Brown Janeway's  translation is masterful.
B000001IQH|5.0|Wow...I didn't realize so much punk grit could be packed into one CD.  While their earlier CDs showed signs of promise, this album realizes them 100%.  Nearly every song is catchy and invigorating, showing that even  radio-friendly punk can be bone-crushing--and stick in your head forever.
0805047905|5.0|The simplistic style, large pictures and repetitive verses, I think, are what grab and help keep the attention of the younger readers.  This is an excellent choice for babies.  We started reading it to our daughter at  about 3 months.  It's her favorite (hands down) now at 11 months.
B000005YZM|5.0|We've all heard Pet Sounds, Revolver, Sgt. Peppers, Village Green P.S., Piper at the Gates of Dawn, etc. Here is their long-lost peer. There are a lot of lesser lights who are experiencing retroactive acclimation for their status as \\"lost masterpieces,\\" when really, that means they were solid and interesting and deserved a little more recognition in their time. Well, the Zombies are more than that; in the sunstroked kaleidoscope of 60s pop, they should be up there with the Kinks, the Who, and the Beach Boys, and at their best, could rival even the Beatles. This is a timeless pop masterpiece neither important nor innovative--just one of those gems that slips between the cracks, which you'll be listening to all your life.
0060930349|1.0|No, Edison did not invent the telephone.  No, Stonewall Jackson was not shot in the back.  No, Norman Rockwell is not America's greatest artist. And, no, Richard Nixon's major flaw was not that he had, &quot;a passion  for public service that masqueraded as a lust for power.&quot;  He wasn't  that tricky.  If you have any decent knowledge of American history, you  turn Johnson's pages  wincing over his numerous factual innacuracies and  laughing as he struggles with obstinate facts to create the Gospel  According to Thatcher, wherein the irredeemable demons are people such as  FDR and Kennedy, and the holy and wise are Harding, Hoover, and those poor,  misunderstood robber barons.  Where a biased selection of facts or events  doesn't serve this purpose, the author constantly imputes motives to  individuals that he takes no pains to substantiate, motives which are, as  Barbara Tuchman has said, pure inventions not worthy of an honest  historian.  I don't think that other great historian, Newt Gingrich, went  so far as to see Lincoln's wit eclipsed by the one-liners Reagan stole from  Clint Eastwood movies or read off teleprompters after they'd been prepared  by Peggy Noonan, et al.  Paul Johnson, bless his true-believer's heart,  does.  This book will warm the heart of other such true-believers, but it  is &quot;history&quot; only in form and structure.  More accurately, it is  an ideological tract masquerading as history; it should be labeled as such  in big letters on the front cover.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana is the best ever! This album, although it may have a number of songs which were overplayed by the usual bunch of irresponsible DJs, it is still a very powerful album that revolutionized the way we listen to music.  How could you not love this album? Nirvana is a gazillion times better than  Live. Peace out
B000001FS3|5.0|This is the only album I ever owned in which I wore out the vinyl copy AND the cassette and so had to get it on CD.  I was always a U2 fan going back to &quot;War&quot; and &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, but I know that  a lot of people see this as their watershed album which, of course, it was.   However, I also think the more recent U2 albums have been unfairly  compared to this one, which if you think about it is silly since we should  appreciate bands that don't stick with a successful formula just because it  works and this album is as much of a departure from U2's early work as  &quot;Pop&quot; is from this one.  All that aside, this is why you should  own this CD:<br />1)  The production of Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno - listen  to &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name&quot; and &quot;I Still Haven't  Found What I'm Looking For&quot; with headphones and you'll hear what sonic  layering can be in the hands of masters. 2)  An uncanny match of lyrics and  music - in the liner notes it says that &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; was  written upon a friend's death.  I would like to think that if I were ever  in a similar situation I could come up with something that would evoke half  the emotion that song does. 3)  No bad spots - when was the last time you  bought an album that was completely listenable all the way through?<br />I do  think it's a shame that U2 has not been able to recapture the overall karma  of this album in their subsequent years (not that they haven't tried) but I  think the biggest testament to this album is that I have bought it for  friends and relatives ranging in age from 45 to 17 and they all love it.   That's one awesome album.
B00000K19E|5.0|this sci-fi treat has a bit of everything for everyone: philosophy, special effects, carrie ann moss for the gents &amp; an incredibly sexy keanu for all the lucky ladies out there. i'd recommend this to everyone :)
6301871952|3.0|Gremlins 2 is a goofy film that has none of the horror element of the first Gremlins movie.  It is a series of gags, with only a bare sliver of plot to hold them all together.  This movie is very funny, although  definately inferior to the first.  The special effects are cheesier, and  there are &quot;plot holes&quot; in what little plot the film has...but  this movie is definately worth seeing if you liked the first film.  The  worst part of this movie is, in my opinion, Mohawk (the black Mogwai and  the Spider Gremlin).  He is SUCH a Stripe wannabe.  He tries to be  impressive and evil as Stripe is, but he fails utterly.
B000002P6R|4.0|It's certainly not The Who at its best, but there are some outstanding tracks on this album, particularly &quot;Another Tricky Day,&quot; which is probably the band's most under-rated song. There's no way to recapture the  Who of the 1970s, but Face Dances does present a mature, forward-looking  band that is still committed to making poweful music. While the lyrics are  overly personal at times, they do reflect the outlook of grown men, not the  effort of aging rockers clinging to their teenage longings. In that sense,  the Who succeed here at aging gracefully and maintaining a commitment to  rock-and-roll. Give it a try -- after a few listens you might be surprised  at how powerful, catchy, and subtle some of these songs really are.

B0000004V2|5.0|Not to be redundant but simply put this is one of the  best albums of all time...I got into Stone Roses when they debuted in '89...There was a period when I wasnt listening to them for a while--just into other stuff..I picked  up my CD the other day and just remembered how great this album  is...Haven't put anything else in since then...Too bad they are  done...There isnt one bad track on this album --- My favorite has to be  &quot;I am the Resurection&quot;
B000021XR5|4.0|This CD is great! Don't pay attention to the negative comments from others. Despite Scott's drug problem, the band has come together and released an album that grabs you with the very first song &quot;Down&quot;,  then continues to rock all the way to the end.
6300216039|5.0|Romeo And Juliet - No Ordinary Love Story...<br />Franco Zeffirelli's Oscar winning 1968 masterpiece was filmed in Italy (Verona, I believe though I'm not 100% sure of that).  The film is rich in costume and scenery and the  performers are simply extraordinary.  Olivia Hussey (Death On The Nile; It;  Psycho IV: The Beginning; etc.,) shines as sweet Juliet, Leonard Whiting's  (Frankenstein: The True Story; The Legend Of Young Dick Turpin; Rachel's  Man; etc.,) portrayal of young Romeo is unparralled and of course Michael  York (Logan's Run; The Island Of Dr. Moreau; Austin Powers; etc.,) is  outstanding as fiesty Tybalt.  But the true shining star in this film is   the delightful, Ms. Pat Heywood (Who Slew Auntie Roo?; Root Into Europe;  etc.,) The Secret Garden; who steals the screen with each moment she graces  it.  She plays Juliet's Nurse and does so with such power, whimsy and  conviction that you simply must love her.  Pat Heywood gave the commonly  droll Nurse character life and vibrance I have yet to see in a performance  of this play live or filmed.  The scene where she goes to the church to  meet Romeo is absolutely side-splitting!<br />My sole complaint with this film  was that there was a bit of trimming done to the original script.  Some of  the dialogue was cut down, but only true, hard-core Shakespeare fans would  likely notice.  You've tried the rest?  Then watch the BEST!<br />Concerning  the ages of the stars:  I include this mainly as a side note, for it's been  my experience that there is always some confusion, question and  disagreement concerning the age of the young stars.  Here is their birth  information in hopes of settling any debates.  Hussey was born April 17th  1951 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Leonard Whiting was born June 30th 1950  in London, England, UK and Michael York was nearly ten years their senior  (May 27th, 1942 - in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, England, UK).  <br />Not that  it's ever been a debate -- as far as I know it hasn't-- but I do not know  Ms. Heywood's birthday...Just for the record  :)
B00002MZ2C|4.0|This cd has some good songs, some very good songs, and average songs (for Rage against the Machine).  I don't think it is as good as Evil Empire.
B000009QPQ|5.0|This is my favorite CD of all time. The wonderful harmonies, the great music, it all blends together to make a magical event. Please try this CD. Also buy their other CD's. You won't be sorry. The Jayhawks are a wonderful group. I promise you'll love them as I do.I hope you're found this CD somewhere.  I see it's not available on amazon.com anywhere.  The Jayhawks do have a new CD out now; Rainy Day Music, which I believe is just as good as this one though.
B00000IPAX|2.0|I'll admit it... before I got this CD , I didd'nt liston to Blink..or Punk altogether. I got Enema..loved it..then got Dude Ranche..and it was tehn that I realized how lame Enema was. It seems like Blink got obcessed with  making money..and lost all interest in the fans. Sure- the songs are  great.. all the tracks are equal to any new One Hit Wonder's song..and  thats the problem. I recomend this album to a beginner Blinkiot..more then  Dude Ranch- although the latter is a lot better . Blink 182- What about the  fans?
B000021XS0|5.0|As music in general has been reduced to lip syncing blondes (Spears, et. al.)with music that has no instruments (instead computer generated &quot;beats&quot;), to bands with marginal musical talent, named after  veggies, or those bands that hide their talentless-noise behind bland  political statements (rage against what?)something interesting happened on  10/26/99: Dream Theater's Met.2 was released. Not since Fates Warning's  &quot;A Pleasant Shade of Gray&quot; has such an ambitious CD been  realized.  DT creates a 77 minute story full of deceit, love, death, and  dishonor, and weave this into the most extraordinary instrumental playing  to come out. Currently, there is not a better band out there. LaBrie (who  seems to only be liked by other singers, these days-prob. because they  understand his technique) and company make no effort to restrain  themselves, and blast the listener with many different musical ideas.  The  CD sounds excellent, with all instruments coming thru the mix (we can  finally here Myung!)...Comparison to OP:MC aren't justified, as Mindcrime  wasn't progressive, and simply is overpowered by the DT beast...Scenes is  the Magnum Opus, a perfect closure to the musically talent-free 90's (also  known as MTV)...so why isn't anyone listening?
B00000AD94|3.0|I was not impressed with the Spock's Beard.  There are actually only 4 songs on the CD, but each with several indisticable parts.  I was hoping for a more modern flavor, but was disappointed.  While I will admit that  they are talented musicians, I just didn't think too much of their work
B00001OH7N|5.0|It's a close call with Hunky Dory but this really is his best album and musically superior to all his others.  I love it.  All the instruments are perfectly proportioned and the musical themes that run through are  delightful.  This is a true album and not like today's releases that are  like a bunch of singles thrown together.   The Width of a Circle is just  fantastic, taking us through some wonderful chord sequences and  transforming halfway through the song.  All the Madmen is such a beautiful  song and kind of existentialist.  The skill of the percussionists is top  quality, never becoming too prominent.  The Man Who Sold the World is a  wonderful song.  When Kurt Cobain covered it he was good enough to imitate  it and not try to improve it, perhaps as a tribute to the fact that the  song couldn't be any better.  The percussion gives the song a wonderful  texture and is perfectly proportioned.   This doesn't really sound anything  like anything else Bowie did.  It would be hard to follow up this one.  One  of the most under-rated and under-listened albums in the world.
B000002UCQ|4.0|If you like the beatles music, you will really like this albu

B000003TSP|5.0|i bought it, slapped it into the trusty dusty cd player, turned it up a little higher, and BAM hello good music listening again!  this is a classic, just fantastic, i just hope the next is just as good. its in my  top ten for sure. now lets go listen to some pink flyod like you know we  should.    SNAP! SLAP! ( mister edds' hand guisters from david lynchs'  movie lost highway)
B000001F76|5.0|The music I grew up listening to on the Zenith record player at my mom and dads ..Dad being a country boy from Alabama and a picker and singer himself could never be without Hank playing on the recordplayer on the  weekins...This sure does take me back....lots of good memories yet to  come...Time to set back and listen and remember.Bonita
B000021XR5|3.0|Being a huge fan of the band, I preordered this CD from Amazon.com and anxiously awaited it for the next week. There are some very good songs here, particularly Sex and Violence, but some of them seem kind of bland,  like Church on Tuesday, and MC5 is horrible. But I think anyone who is a  fan of the band will like this one overall. Hopefully it won't take as long  as last time for the next one.
0380973464|5.0|A great story, great characters, and an amazing way of looking at the world.  I thoroughly enjoyed this; it's Stephenson's best yet.
B000001FS3|5.0|Too much has already been written concerning the technical aspects of the  juxtaposition of music, production, and lyrics on The Joshua Tree.  More significant to the album is the way that with every song, and indeed,  through the course of the whole of the album, it seems U2 has attempted to  establish a sense of both physical and emotional place through the use of  the aforementioned elements, an attempt which has clearly been satisfied,  giving the listener a clear sense of the grandeur, urgency, and beauty that  characterize the landscapes they have attempted to create.  I have not  heard another album which has been able to vividly and effectively evoke  recurrent images and emotions with both desperation and grace the way The  Joshua Tree has.   Listen to it while driving through the desert at night,  or in the middle of the city.  It doesn't matter what your location is.    This album not only seems to add poignancy to your locale, it takes you  elsewhere, to a place where things seem to matter more, and where life  takes on the sort of urgent reality that it ought to always have.  Good  music, in any form, can either make you forget your cares by taking you  away from them, or can somehow give voice to or characterize those cares.   Rarely is it possible for music to combine the two, but with The Joshua  Tree, U2 has created an album which removes the listener from their mundane  surroundings, and yet will not allow them to forget so many of the very  issues which exist at the heart of our human experience.  This in mind, The  Joshua Tree is ultimately an album with depth, atmosphere, and passion  unparalleled.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This is quite simply a brilliant, wildly original album.  It is reminiscent of the brilliance of Prince in the early 80's before he flipped out and declined faster than Martha Ray's looks.  Fiona has created an  album which will surely go down as one of the top dozen or so rock albums  of all time.  Deep, dark, thick and wonderful music!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|It is too bad that more bands don't take the time to take it to another level with each release.  RATM has been my favorite band for a while now and this album provides more tear your face off riffs and thought provoking  lyrics...
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna's greatest hits are featured on this popular complilation, which should really have been a two-disc set. Omitted are some of her biggest chart hits and her most charming songs: &quot;Angel&quot;  (No.4),&quot;Dress You Up&quot;(No.5),   &quot;True Blue&quot; (No.3),  &quot;Who's That Girl&quot; (No.1!) and &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot;  (No.2). The tradeoff is that these songs sound simply spectacular. Already  magnificent songs like &quot;Live To Tell&quot; or &quot;La Isla  Bonita&quot; sound gorgeous. Her earliest hit, &quot;Borderline&quot; is  the largest improvement. I have always loved all of her songs, pre-BEDTIME  STORIES, but I feel this compilation deprives the listener of hearing some  of her most brilliant work. I give it five stars anyway, because, I mean,  c'mon, this IS Madonna.
B000001FYL|5.0|I'd have to agree with Edwin in Singapore.  I think I was 16 when I first heard it.  I think Sante Fe and Bang a Drum are my favorites also.  I originally bought it on tape and finally wore it out.  Decided I'm gonna  have to get a CD.  Just wish I could find some MP3's.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This CD was awesome! Every song has an irresistable beat, that only Carlos Santana and his collaborators could create. I highly reccomend &quot;Smooth&quot;, &quot;Maria Maria&quot;, &quot;Put Your Lights  On&quot;, and &quot;The Calling&quot;. The guest stars on this album are  some of my favorites! Like Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20, Eric Clapton, Dave  Matthews of The Dave Matthews Band, Everlast, and many more!  This CD will  make you turn it on, and never turn it off!  BUY IT!
B000006NPY|5.0|Anyone sick of Korn, Creed, Silverchair, and all the other mediocre bands should enjoy this album.  The Pumpkins went the extra mile to deliver their most progressive and daring album yet - not to mention one of their very  best.  They are certainly making their case that they belong in the  more-elite class of Rock and Pop artists.  They are no longer among the Foo  Fighters, and Goo Goo Dolls.  They have joined the upper-ranks including  U2, Bowie, NIN, and Radiohead.  I can only hope that they are not finished  yet.
B000002U9Y|3.0|I really never thought I would be the one to run down a Floyd cd but............ This album really was a big dissapointment to me.  I am fairly new to the floyd machine but I believe I am qualified enough to  judge this.  My first honest thought of it -- Is this the Beatles and what  the hell is this ?   I gave it a three based on the fact that it is not a  bad cd in any way other than it does not stand up to my expectations of  Floyd.  Now bare in mind I set Floyds standards well above nearly every  band ever in existence so I hope ya get the point.  I actually believe  there are a couple of tracks that are up to my normal expectations and they  are --&quot; Set the controls for the heart of the sun &quot; ( obviously a  waters track ) ( God bless him ) and the title track &quot;saucerful of  secrets&quot; .  I like every song on the album but then again I like alot  of albums--I guess to sum this up-- The beatles are great and this sounds  like the beatles for the most part---- I like the beatles, but I love  Floyd.  I dont love this.
B00000K19E|3.0|It always seems as though the same concept gets sold to a variety of Hollywood producers at about the same time &amp; a race is on to get out a product.  Last year two big rocks came to hit the Earth in two different  movies, for example.  The current big trend is Cyber-Space or alternate  reality.<br />Three movies have been released at almost the same time about  this theme: The Thirteenth Floor, eXisTenz, and The Matrix.<br />Matrix is,  admittedly, a lot of fun, even if it lacks the maturity of eXisTenz or the  more pure Sci/Fi attitude of Thirteenth Floor.  Matrix plays more towards  an action/adventure crowd and makes frequent use of the same type of  special effects as can be seen in those pants commercials where the kids  are dancing, then seem to freeze in mid-air.  Kind of neat, but we've seen  it before, and soon it will go the way of &quot;Morphing&quot; which T2  brought to a whole new level but isn't used too often anymore because of  the been-there, done-that attitude.<br />Also, Keanu Reeves' final showdown  with the Computer Agent felt contrived.  He had a phone to catch, after  all, and the fight with these bad guys could have waited until the  sequel.<br />Many have commented on the &quot;what-if&quot; our life is just a  computer program.  Kind of like what if our life is just a dream of the  fantasy and science fiction novels of not so long ago.  It isn't new, and  Matrix, rather than try to make the idea new, turns it into the starting  point for a story of a comic book hero.<br />Most disturbing about this movie  is the scene where the heroes walk into the lobby of an office building and  shoot all of the guards.  This was overly reminiscent of the man who walked  into the lobby of the Capitol and opened fire.  I found the scene difficult  to applaud.  This is in contrast with a scene in T2 where Arnold, after  being told not to kill anyone, takes careful aim and shoots out tires and  lights rather than people.  The scene in Matrix might have played better if  the heroes were given more fanciful weapons.  Luke Skywalker had his  lightsaber, Indiana Jones had a whip.  These were pretty cool toys.  Keanu  Reeves, in the computer generated world, should have been able to come up  with something similarly fantastic.ve played better if  the heroes were given more fanciful weapons.

B000009DUY|5.0|This music, and its movie, summarize all the speeches, all the stories, all the fiction, and everything else designed to instill in us a rightful appreciation for the sacrifices all our veterans have made.   I know the  movie and the music were created to rightfully honor WWII veterans, and  this is appropriate.  However, when you listen to this, please remember all  our veterans of ALL our wars.  Death is the same; fear like you can't  imagine (and I hope you never have to) is the same. Thank you.
B00000253N|5.0|Geez... what do I say in order to convey what this album means to me?  Our hearts beat to Blood on the Tracks...<br />This record, more than any other I have listened to captures what makes us human...  As we make our way in  this world, we tend to cover our basic humanity with layers of walls which  we use to protect our humanity from the &quot;cruel&quot; and  &quot;callous&quot; world.  What this record does is pierce all of that and  speak to our innate humanity...<br />This record is the closest i've ever come  to glimpsing into something completely and truly beautiful... Think of it  this way... It's a mother's love and a mother's heartache captured in  musical form! <br />Enjoy!
B00000251N|5.0|This cd is awesome, It offers excellent music. After many years of listening, I continue to enjoy this gem. In my opinion this is the best CD of Neil Diamond.
0385495315|5.0|Until now I was aware only of the codified worlds of Sherlock Holmes and his fellow clones in detective literature. Mr. Singh has made it plain enough for me that the universe of semiosis as well as the things that  transpire between a sender and a receiver can be of unprecedented  complexity. I read his book almost in one sitting and what a pleasure it  was to read. Despite slight difficulties in following certain technical  parts the book is really excellent in sheer scope, ideas and information. I  am grateful to Mr Singh for proving that there are no dull subjects, only  dull writers, and he certainly in not a dull one. Congratulations!
6301773551|4.0|While Star Wars launched a string of sequels that probably has not ended yet, this movie is complete on its own terms.  Even if no sequels were ever made, this film would be a classic.  While I don't think it is quite as  good as Empire Strikes Back, it is a close second.  I first saw this film  in 1977 when I was 8 years old.  Luke Skywalker embodies the dreams and  desires of all young men who want to break out of their provincial  surroundings and experience the wider world (or in this instance, the  universe itself).  Alec Guinness is perfect as Obi Wan Kenobi, and with  Peter Cushing, provide Star Wars relatively young and unknown cast with a  solid veteran presence.  Star Wars - A New Hope strikes the best balance of  all the Star Wars films in its appeal to both children and adults.  I just  have one curious observation though: when the Rebel pilots are shown  getting ready for takeoff, they're all wearing brand new blue striped white  helmets, yet during the attack on the Death Star, they're all shown wearing  multicolored helmets that look like they have been kicked around a lot.
B000002C1W|5.0|Say what you will about this being &quot;Too 80's&quot; or &quot;A David Gilmour solo album&quot;, but this album is awesome. I, for one, love 80s music, and I love the awesome sound of that era: singers with great range,  layers of guitars, loud drums, keyboards, etc, and I think the 80s did  wonders for Pink Floyd. I feel the layered, melodic guitars and the heavy  synthesizers/keyboards greatly enhanced the sound and added beautiful  texture to each song on this album. I think Pink Floyd's sound fit in  perfectly with the 80s. Now don't get me wrong, I love &quot;The Wall&quot;  and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Those are classics, but this album  should have been a classic too. Many will disagree with this review, but I  could care less. Pink Floyd and the 80's rule!

B000021XS0|5.0|I have seen some pretty bad reviews of this album, and you know first I got mad about them, but then I thought it was good, obviously Dream Theater is not a band for everyone and I think we the Fans love that about them,  and I say their not a band for everyone couse they are too challenging,  intelligent, beautifull and Heavy on their music.  This is progressive  metal made for inteligent listeners not for the &quot;i want a catchy  chorus&quot; type.   I love every Dream Theater album and even i really  love Fallin into infinity  im sure glad as hell they returned to their  heavier side with metropolis 2.  This album is just awsome, a truly piece  of art, and well I really liked Kevin Moore style but I have to say that  Jordan rules hes great and he fits in the band pretty well. This album is  great, heavy and intelligent and a must buy if you are an intelligent  listener, but if you are not  dont worry you can always go and buy load  from Metallica or something like that.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|OK, FIRST OFF, U GOT THE BEST GUITARIST SINCE HENDRIX (TOM MORELLO) WHO IS THE ONE I DECIDE TO PRAY TO INSTEAD OF GOD. SECOND, U HAVE AMAZING LYRICS THAT STICK OUT LIKE NEEDLES. STICKING IT INTO UR EYES LIKE U CANT  IMAGINE....U CANT ESCAPE THE WRATH OF RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE. THEY HAVE  NEVER SOLD OUT AND NEVER MADE A BAD ALBUM. THEY HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF MAKING  AN ARMY OF KIDS TO SPEAK OF WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN AND I THINK THEY ARE ONE  OF THE BEST BANDS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED IN THE HISTORY OF ROCK N ROLL. CUZ  THEY SAY THAT THE &quot;MESSAGE IS THE THING THAT CLICKS IN MUSIC&quot;,  WELL RAGE HAS TONS OF THAT. JUST LISTEN TO ANY OF THERE SONGS, ITS  INCREDIBLE. THE SCREAMING ZACK, THE BASS OF TIM, DRUMS OF BRAD, AND OF  COURSE THE CRY AND MANY OTHER MOODS TO TOM MORELLOS GUITAR. RAGE IS ONE OF  THOSE BANDS THAT IF U KEEP THEM AS A WHOLE THEY ARE OUTSTANDING, CUT THEM  INTO FOUR PIECES THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD INDIVIDUALLY. THIS IS WHAT MAKES  RAGE SO GOOD AND WHEN U COMPARE THEM TO BANDS LIKE LIMP BIZKIT......RAGE IS  THE BIRD AND LIMP BIZKIT IS THE WORM. I THINK RAGE HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR THE  YOUTH OF AMERICA AND TAUGHT KIDS HOW TO REBEL ON WHAT THEY DONT THINK IS  RIGHT AND HOW THEY SHOULD BECOME MORE INVOLVED. THEIR THREE CDS ARE LIKE A  TEXTBOOK ON THE STUFF UR HISTORY TEACHER WONT TELL YOU ABOUT. THAT IS A  GENIUS. IF THEY WENT TO TRY TO BE HIRED BY A SKOOL TO BE A HISTORY TEACHER  THEY WOULDN'T BE EXCEPTED BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY PLAN TO TEACH. I CONCLUDE  THAT IF YOUR GONNA GO BUY SOME RAGE CDS. MAKE SURE U HAVE ENOUGH $ TO  PURCHASE ALL THREE.  BOW DOWN TO RAGE AS A FAN, DISCIPLE, AND A WORSHIPPER.
B00000IL1K|5.0|A friend mentioned how great this CD is.  I fully agree.  Since listening to it I had to get the video.  Now I'm purchasing the CD as gifts for my friends.  I am more than impressed with the powerful flexibility of this  great talent.
B0000011AP|5.0|the guitarist is great I had the chance to meet him he is the best guitarist I ever heard so many people mistake him for eric clapton.This english guy is a knock out I can't wait to see him play   again.He even  played in many popular bands and here in the states.
B000002IGV|5.0|To me, listening to TS's Stay Hungry is similar to eating that midday Snickers,low on substance and completely unnecessary.  Yet, somehow it's 100% self-satisfying!
0553573403|5.0|This book and its sequel are, quite simply, the best fantasy novels published in the past 20 years.  In fact, the only other fantasy stories I enjoy as much as these two are Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser tales (these books are better than Jordan's!).  The character development is  superb - Arya Stark and Tyrion are two of my favorite characters in  fiction.  Even the minor characters (Bronn, for example) are better  developed than characters in many fantasy novels.<br />  If you read  the reviews on this site for this book and its sequel (A Clash of Kings),  you'll find a few people with two major criticisms of these books: 1) too  much sex and swearing and 2) negative portrayals of women.  Ignore them.  They're wrong.  This is a realistic novel; this stuff happens in real life.  At no point in these books are such incidents graphically described; the reader  always hears of them after their occurrence.  In fact, I would say Martin  is far better at portraying realistic female characters than his  contemporaries.  He's certainly better at it than Jordan, who's females are  all annoying shrews.  Arya Stark, for example, is arguably the best  character in the book.<br />  Don't let the puritans and feminists prevent  you from reading a great book!<br />  And to those of you who've  read the books: my bet's for Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen ( it seems  so obvious, even before hearing the rumors).
B00002MZ4V|5.0|I was ecstatic when I found this CD, which contains a wonderful collection of Williams' best---from classic favorites like &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, to sure-to-be classics like &quot;Duel of the  Fates&quot; and &quot;Hymn to the Fallen&quot;. I was also pleased to hear  some of his other non-cinematic masterworks like the Olympics themes.   Overall, it is a fantastic compilation of a variety of music, which pays  tribute to Williams' considerable range as a composer.
B00002MZ2C|2.0|It's been 3 years since Rage delivered their last album, &quot;Evil Empire&quot;, and although that may seem like a short time, it's pretty long in the standards of the music industry.  So you might think that these  guys would have mellowed out, over the years, in their political activism  lyrics but &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot; proves their rage is even  stronger this time round than any other time before.  And not like that's a  bad thing but the &quot;Battle of Los Angeles&quot; seems to be just the  latest advertisement of human rights (released on Election Day is not a  coincidence-my point is proven.) Therefore  with this album, these  Ragesters are trying to emphasize their  political point. And although they  score with emphasizing their political point, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;  doesn't always reach it's musical high point.  Now don't get me wrong, Tom  Morello's guitar work is brilliant and Zack de la Rocha's rapping is at  it's best, yet what makes this album a dissapointment, is the lack of  cohesiveness as a band.  &quot;Los Angeles&quot; sounds or more or less  like interesting noise rather than singable or hummable songs with the  excepton of the single, &quot;Guerilla Radio&quot;, and &quot;Mic  Check&quot;(although incomparable to older songs such as &quot;Bulls on  Parade&quot; or Killing in the Name&quot;).  Other songs like the 2  &quot;Born&quot; songs (&quot;Born of a Broken Man&quot; &amp; &quot;Born  as Ghosts&quot;) just come out garbled.  The rest are listenable yet don't  stand out as anything spectacular.  Although a valiant effort, you'd be  better off spending money on either of their previous albums rather than  wasting your money on this one.  &quot;The Battle of Los Angles&quot; is  just a battle not worth fighting for, it is a lost cause and a false hope.
0780625129|4.0|Absorbing tale of neo-fascism in Venice Beach,California and its harmful effects on two close knit brothers  Derek &amp; Danny.The story opens with Dereks release from prison after 3 years for the brutal slaying of a black  teenager attempting to steal his car.This flashback scene is not for the  faint-hearted. Within the stark reality of the prison walls and confronted  with the hypocrisy of fellow idealogical inmates he had thought to rely on  Derek eventually reaches his epiphany.All is not as he has once thought.He  comes out determined to set his life straight,starting with his family and  especially his impressionable younger brother Danny.Enough said.<br />This is  a disturbing tale which i found totally engrossing.I especially liked the  flashback scenes in black &amp; white which works quite well here.To those  two Edwardians Furlong &amp; Norton must go much of the credit for what  would otherwise have been just another ethnic gang related story. Many  critics have been scathing of the one dimensional supporting  characters,Nortons exceptional performance notwithstanding.But this still  does not devalue it from being one of the most outstanding films of the  past year.We could also take a leaf from its theme of co-habiting together  despite our wide and varied differences.Abraham Lincoln said it  best...<br />&quot;We are not enemies but friends.We must not be  enemies.Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of  affection.The mystic chords of memory will swell and again touch as it  surely will be by the better angels of our nature...&quot;

6303149200|5.0|The first time I couldn't turn out the lights after watching a horror movie was when I saw &quot;Psycho&quot; for the first time in Aunt Val's flat in London - slept in the day room with all the lights on. This film  was the second time, and I wasn't interested at all at first. It's the  final sequence that gets you - it's not at all your typical terror tale,  with maniacs running around with axes or strange creatures from beyond the  grave/the Black Lagoon/the director's last hangover or whatever the latest  craze is. This movie sneaks up on you, posing as a simple little suspense  tale about a policeman doggedly doing his duty, aware but oblivious to the  stark, raving weirdness that surrounds him. But that's how it sucks you in,  playing on our tendency toward &quot;yes it's strange, but it won't hurt  you&quot; when it comes to anything other worldly. Agatha Christie once  said the scariest monsters were the little old grannies with their poisoned  knitting needles - this movie will not only make you believe that, it will  have you wondering, even just a little, about just how charming some of  your friends' idosyncrasies really are. I dare you to watch it all the way  through the end.
0790731924|5.0|This is a great sequel to an action classic. Riggs and Murtagh are back, and this sequel is where we first meet Joe Pesci's character Leo Getz, who constantly goes on about being conned(putting it politely) by the  drive-thru, hospitals, and so on! Plenty of great action scenes and laughs  as the two out-of-the-ordinary cops bend rules to go after South African  drug lords who have diplomatic immuntiy . . . and the  bomb-on-Murtagh's-toilet scene is hilarious. You can't help but laugh!
0451160916|5.0|This is the only book I have ever read where I HAD to put it down I was so scared. No  kidding!  I was home alone and I had to STOP and wait till my husband got home. I'll never forget it.  I was with Danny all the  way...WHAT A RIDE!<br />Advise: Do NOT even bother with the movie or judge the  book by the movie. The  movie was a disgrace. Jack Nicholson was perfect  BUT everything &amp; everybody else was  dead wrong.  It didn't jive true  with the book.
0792151712|5.0|The Venerable James Cameron's epic tale of love in the direst of circumstances proves one essential thing: great moviemaking is not lost in American Cinema. Winslet, the prodigy stirred by Emma Thompson's consummate  tutelage, is more breathtaking than the revelry of Cameron's fascination  with the enormous SFX. Many have derided the film as not  &quot;realistic&quot;, but fail to mention the film was a love story  against the backdrop of a tragic antiquity. In fact, shades of epicurean  brilliance lance the film throughout--with Winslet as the centerpiece.  Kate's nude scene was perhaps the most artistically driven, rather than  purient, in cinematic history. Backed by James Horner's mystical (Irish  here and so was the operatic music he composed and the delectable Celine  fable) music create an emporium of tooled majesty and passionate desires  while capturing the very heart of love: Innocence. 11 Academy Awards should  prove Cameron is supreme to most and a $1.5 billion box office proves class  is immeasurable even in Hollywood. Of course, Cameron did violate some  Victorian prominences by being too &quot;modern&quot;. I really could have  done without the SFX at the beginning since the torrent of emotion between  DiCaprio and Winslet was as masterful as it gets. Otherwise, the film,  without their love, would have been another &quot;waterworld&quot; with a  $230 million pricetag. Billy Zane, always in his vicious element, was also  consummate. My hat is tipped, much like Winslet's, to Cameron for having  the austere courage to forego his salary to finish a film that will be  loved or hated...but admired, publicy and privately by all that saw it. The  love scene, again shades of magic, was just Amore. If I was Cameron, I  would try to cull some long forgotten novel from antiquity and try  diligently to follow-up this masterpiece. ...with Horner as Maestro, a  Celine performance, and an effulgent love story that would bring more Art  to an Industry in desprate need of it. &quot;...Cameron, I think you can  rest your melancholy and be at peace with this masterpiece.&quot; Felecia  Constance Rowe, Teardrop Films, Executive Producer. P.S. - David Warner, a  crafty character, was a leading star in a Titanic movie filmed long ago.  Just a little history. Did anyone notice? I did!
0783211856|4.0|Yes, the score was beautiful and haunting, yes the dialogue was good, yes the acting was good. However, good film-making is not so much the assertion of a truth as it is the making of that truth more evident to us. I failed  to see the humanity of Schindler because Spielberg just doesn't know how to  portray characters well. He is good at canvas but not depth (eg saving p.  r.) Watch The Rules of the GAme (1939) or Come and See (1985)- which has  very similar subject matter- as well. This film should be viewed, but it is  not surprising that it is one of the best films of the 90's considering  that the 90's are cinematography's worst decade. Good- but not a  masterpiece. Spielberg is just too Jewish to make a film about the  holocaust. Someone more detached could probably make the Holocaust more  relevant on film because an outsider would present the humanity of both  sides- and thus show that any human is capable of atrocities.
B00000JCB2|5.0|The best cd i've ever heard I just wish Limp Bizkit would make music videos for the 2 best songs on the album,Break Stuff and 9 teen 90 nine
B000006NPY|4.0|This cd is probably the most mellow and slightly sleepy ever to be slapped with the Pumpkin stamp of approval. It is composed of only a few songs that you'll automatically attach to- allowing them to echo through your psyche  for days on end. My favorite track would have to be #3,  &quot;Perfect&quot;, because it reminds of some of their earlier work,  which outshines anything on this album. Still, it manages to stay afloat  with Corgan's meaningful lyrics and strained vocals. Smashing Pumpkins it  may be, however toned down to a deaf mute.
0790731983|5.0|What a marvelous movie this is. The mise en scene is gorgeous and the performances sensational. Certainly one of the finest american movies of all times.
6305451591|5.0|I watched this movie last night, and it still moves me to both smiles and tears.  Benigni succeeds in drawing to their absurd, comic conclusions the principles of both racism and anti-semitism.  Just 2 examples: When asked  to tell a class of Italian pupils about the racial superiority of the  Italians, he exposes his navel and is proud of what an Aryan navel it is.   Or when his little son asks why certain stores now forbid Jews and dogs, he  tries to protect his son by saying it is the personal preference of the  shopkeeper.  Why, some vendors, for example, forbid Ostrogoths and spiders!   (His son doesn't like spiders).<br />It was a razor-thin, high-wire balancing  act to try to bring humor to an insanely evil period in humanity's history,  but he succeeded.  <br />Unfortunately, many still take their absurd  assumptions seriously even today -- leading to the cases of evil we  witness.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I love this CD.  After wearing out all my McLaughlin CD's I thought I wouldn't find anything comparable, but then Dido came accross the airwaves and I bought the CD.  What a relief
B00001U0DP|5.0|Okay, a few folks have said they did not like this film. Fair enough, I didn't like Good Will Hunting.<br />But let's take a look here. If you know what this film is all about, then the first half of it will astound you. I  mean, egg on faces? It comes startingly close to Benny Hill for 'want of a  laugh track'.<br />Ahh, but the warmth grows on you, and then...<br />The second  half.<br />Few scenes are as emotional as when Guido has to reassure his son  that the Jews 'aren't going to be made into soap.' The film takes a turn  for the harshness and doesn't let up.<br />Schindler's List was a phenomenal  film, showing the utter horror of the holocaust, but it missed one thing:  the notion of hope. No one in Spielberg's masterpiece continually believes  that 'life is beautiful'. All we see is the horror, the downfall, the pain.  And while that makes for a fantastic dramatic punch, it negates any humor  or spirit the prisoners may have had to blanket themselves from the  harshness, and this humor surely existed.<br />Guido knows very soon that he  is going to die. But, the love for his son outweighs the need to DISPLAY  hopelessness. If nothing else, he must protect his son. So he convinces him  it's all a game. Simple, buffoonish...<br />and damn identifiable. Who here  can honestly say they wouldn't do anything they could to protect their  sons/daughters from knowing the biggest evil on Earth? Guido manages to  keep his son involved in 'the game' while he himself knows it will most  likely end according to an evil thought.<br />The end scene, where Guido  realizes he is going to be killed, and yet does a goofy march to make his  son laugh, is one of the most powerful sights to ever be associated with  the trauma the Nazi's inflicted on the world.<br />If you didn't like this  film, fine. But don't say it mocked the Holocaust. If anything, it's a  tribute to the flame of life that wouldn't be blown out.<br />Laughter seeps  into any tradegy, if the love for life is there. Anne Frank said something  to the effect that 'in spite of all this, I still feel people are good in  heart'. She had hope.<br />She knew life was beautiful.<br />-CS
B00003BDXG|5.0|Oliver stones's Natural Born Killers was a turning point in modern cinema, he stood as an iconoclast for a new breed of shock, violence and social commentary people had seen before...but never like this. The film, at  first, is a chaotic mess, a rambling discourse into the mind of attention  deficient madness. In retrospect, it becomes clear, the film is a  commentary of the times, and while in a few years (or now for that matter)  it may seem dated or trivial, it will always stand as a sign of the times,  the turn of the tabloid revolution, the consumation of nationally  broadcasted trials, the lack of morality. The film is out of control and,  in turn, cathartic. Those who found it to be a glorification of senseless  violence missed the point and the irony depicted in the film, a film that  keeps your eyes wide open, unblinking, untill the final credit has passed
B000002NJS|1.0|This has some of the the worst so called electronica music I've heard. It so dated and lifeless I can't undertand how anyone would think it is different or original. One song has that old flying saucer sound they use  in those old Godzilla movies. Also, the song writing is poorly done. It's  painfull listening to Madonna try to hit the semi high notes. This is  especially evident in ROL and To Have Not To Hold.  There is also alot of  echo vocal layering on POG to make it sound like she has a better voice  than she does. Sad thing is it doesn't work that well.
B00000K31V|2.0|Well, all the &quot;makes the matrix look like child's play&quot; and &quot;thumbs up&quot; dont really apply here... I mean - it's a nice movie, completely weird and it really gives you no clue or room to speculate on  what's going on; but then again it doesnt show anything new...
B00002MZ2C|4.0|A suberbly strong album that will satisfy most Rage Fans.  I particularly like the fact that the album doesn't give into some of the musical expectations that we have of Rage's music.  An expample of this is with Mic  Check, the first time I listened to the song I kept waiting to here a ball  drop in the song and I must say that I'm very happy to hear the they didn't  give into &quot;set&quot; musical paradigm. Morello, great inovation, Tim,  bass is used  more for instrumentation than support (awesome), Wilk, nice  variations and Zach nuff said.
B000000OU6|5.0|Don't listen to those guys who gave the one star reviews, this album is class. Slash is one of the best guitarist ever and to insult his playing is just stupid when he is such a well regarded musician.
B000002TPS|5.0|This album is great! The lyrics are deep and the music just keeps getting better all the time! I give this album an A+!
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is a must see for everyone.  The horrors of war and the persistance of the human spirit mixed with a unique blend of humor.  One of the best films I've seen in years and a must have for the video collection.
0783216084|5.0|Jaws was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I consider it more of an adventure movie than a horror movie even though some parts were truly frightening. I wonder why this movie is not on DVD. It would be great to  hear the directors commentary. For some reason Spielberg movies are not  released on DVD except for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; maybe that will  change now and all his movies will be released on DVD.
B000002J03|5.0|Ah, this is the Zep we all know and love!  From the first chords of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; to &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, which contains one of the best intros ever, this is a perfect album.  Even the slower songs like &quot;Thank You&quot; are still impeccable.  I love  &quot;The Lemon Song,&quot.  All the fire, and passion we know as Led  Zeppelin are here, and I believe that Jimmy Page does his best work.   Someone in an earlier review mentioned something about &quot;fluency,&quot;  and that is absolutely true.  This album flows like nothing you've ever heard.   At first, I didn't like it as much as &quot;Houses of the Holy,&quot;  but I believe now that this album is better and more consistent.  Like Zep  when they rock hard?  You'll love this album, I promise.  Even though it was  made just a few months after the first album, it sounds completely different.   The whole blues sound is very muted here, which is part of the reason why I  think it's so good.  It just rocks, plain and simple.
0800137884|1.0|It was truly painful to sit through this movie.  You couldn't get me to watch it again.  Bram Stoker's Dracula was one of my first books, so I read it over and over again.  It is a classic horror story.  I am beginning to  believe that it cannot be translated to film.  I guess I knew from the very  first act that the story was being perverted.  Christopher Lee's Dracula  evoked more horror than this cheesy version, who at times looked like  Liberace,John Lennon and a pathetic werewolf.  The lovestory ruined it for  me.  It dominated the whole movie.  I liked Frank Langella's sexy Dracula  more.  If you're looking for &quot;vampires who have sex&quot;, The Hunger  is a much better movie.  It bothers me to think of all the time and money  that was wasted on this colossal flop.  It evoked no emotion in me at all  other than to wish it was over sooner.  Read the book.
B000021XR5|5.0|Listen up, folks.  Forget those &quot;nay-sayers&quot; out there who are crying &quot;oh, this isn't 'Core', we loved 'Core'! &quot;  No, this isn't Core.  Yes, Core is an unbelievably powerful first release.  But  w/&quot;No. 4&quot;, the band not only continues to show off their  tremendous musical ability by producing yet another different sound to  their style, but Scott Weiland really opens up his heart on this album.  I  defy anyone to listen to the tracks &quot;I Got You&quot; and  &quot;Atlanta&quot; and NOT be moved!  Half of this album is simply PURE,  damn good Rock N' Roll, and the other half is touching, moving ballads  about a person's  real feelings.  If you're any sort of fan, this is THE  album to own!
B000002LUB|5.0|Bottom line, from the anvil being struck by a hammer(Computer God) to the last punch of &quot;Time Machine&quot; (Wayne's World version)shows of the classic Sabbath riffs of past, the trade mark Sabbath tempo changes, and of  course the most powerful voice in rock n' roll history!  It is all Wrapped  up in one big package Dio's vocals, Iommi's guitars, butler's bass and  Appice's drumming.  Not like &quot;Mob Rules&quot; this album moves foward,  never trying to duplicate their sucess of the past.  A must have for any  metal fan!
B00002RAOU|5.0|A shocking movie, probably the most original and bloody italian &quot;giallo&quot;. Friday the 13th copied it. Sex, nudity, incredible murders, you must absolutely see it!
B000022TSF|5.0|Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN is a brilliant achievement in film noir. Do not miss this new edition on DVD in its original 2:35 aspect ratio with a new dolby digital remix quite superior to all other releases. A collector's  MUST and certainly one of the greatest American picture of the seventies.
B00000K19E|5.0|The DVD rocks, people, if you are a sci-fi fan you will love this movie. The picture quality is so high that I thought I have the original footage from Warner Bros. - A bonus on the DVD is the making of &quot;The  Matrix&quot; which is very long and sophisticated. They have interviews  with the directors, the special effects supervisor, the cast and the  fighting scenes supervisors. All this is well designed and put in a great  menue. A must for every DVD collection.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Jennifer Lopez has talent, looks and great song writers. If You Had My Love is a spohisticated, sensual love song that topped the charts just like Waiting For Tonight. Everyone seems to think that there is no one on the planet who thinks its possible to be a great actress and singer. Why not?  Why are you keeping them from doing more than one thing? Most of the songs  on this album are totally great. I love this CD. Its a mix of  R&amp;B, latin and pop fun and danceable songs. The five best are, If you  had my Love, Waiting for Tonight, Should have Never, Its Not That Serious  and Could This Be Love. Get this CD and don't listen to the idiot reviewers  who say Jennifer can't sing.
B000001F6T|2.0|For once, trust the critics!<br />How Ten Years After came up with this disaster is beyond me, particularly since it was sandwiched between &quot;Undead&quot; and &quot;Sssh&quot;, two of their hardest rocking and  best albums.  Let's face it, Ten Years After was basically no more than a  vehicle for Alvin Lee to drop jaw-dropping guitar riffs on your head.  As  long as they appreciated this and stuck to this pretty simple (albeit  limiting) formula, they were pretty swell.<br />On this album, they completely  lost their way.  Been listening to too much Pink Floyd/Moody Blues or  otherwise &quot;overindulging&quot;, I guess.  They seem to be going for  some sort of trippy psychedelic blend of Brit-pop, blues, and classical  rock.  Alvin and the boys just don't have the songwriting talent or vision  to pull something like this off.  What we are left with is a mess that is  mildly interesting in a historical context (think of the Stones  &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; for a parallel, but this is much  worse).<br />&quot;Gonna Try&quot; is about the only decent thing here, and it  sounds like it was patched together from 2 or 3 songs.  Each member gets  their &quot;own&quot; track (think Ummagumma) with mostly embarrassing  results.  'Nuff said, this is bad.<br />If you are unfortunate to have heard  this as your first exposure to Ten Years After, disregard this as a  temporary loss of sanity and get &quot;Undead&quot;, &quot;Sssh&quot; and  &quot;Cricklewood Green&quot;, all of which are excellent.
0783228457|5.0|Cronenberg has a real way with film, the fades in and out of hallucinations in this film were beyond belief.  Great testament to the fear that rival underground factions will develop an undetectable means of  controlling and mutating people in order to get the edge in their games.   The best expression of my opinion comes from Woods' supposed technical  assistant when the truth about his role in things is revealed.  We ARE  getting soft, and the rest of the world IS getting a whole lot tougher.   This is a film for anyone who worries about the future, even beyond their  own demise.  If you are not sure about this one, just give it a try.  You  will have a hard time trying to find this for rent anywhere, so have an  open mind and let this nightmare seep in.
B00000JCOV|4.0|Slipknot is a strange crossbreed of metal new and old. I obviously pegged it for a Korn-alike right away. But after listening to the whole cd the comparisons drifted apart. The confusion of a new sound disorientates the  listener the first few times around. I saw origins of Slayer, Sepultura,  Pantera, and of course the ever present Korn. They have a distinct new  sound that actually sounds better the more I listen to it. I give this cd a  high replay value which is hard to find among the sea of BS today. I would  definantly buy Slipknots second cd if it were to appear. Track #11  &quot;PROSTHETICS&quot; is a good adrenaline rush from hell.
B000002J1B|5.0|I've been a Yes fan since 1972, the year before I graduated from high school.  To me, their music never gets old and their best albums have stood the test of time.  I think the best Yes period began with The Yes Album and  ended with Going For the One.  Each of the albums the band made during this  time is different and outstanding in its own way.  However, if you held a  gun to my head and said &quot;pick the best Yes album, you clown&quot;, I  would have to choose Relayer.  This album is an all-out assault on the  senses, pushing the listener to new levels of musical appreciation.  It is  also truly a group album with the band, not individual members, receiving  songwriting and production credit.  The one photo contained in the album is  of the entire band and there are no photos of individual members as there  are on Close to the Edge and Going for the One.  Gates of Delerium never  ceases to amaze with its complexity, beauty, and driving rhythms.  The  music is alternatingly experimental and traditional, harmonious and  dissonant.  Buy Relayer.  Appreciate it, get unnerved by it, experience it.  It's a challenge worth accepting.  You won't be sorry, my friends.
6304775636|4.0|I saw Hercules for the first time in London in the cinemas. I think it's a great little flick. Good design, great Menken songs, great comedy writing. Disney have taken just the same liberties with the greek myths as they did  with the Arabian Nights to make Aladdin. The Genie was a bully who had to  be tricked back into his lamp in the original legend...but get Robin  Williams to do the voice and suddenly he's the perfect good-guy sidekick.  Why should Hercules be treated with such self-righteous vitriol just  because it borrows from many legends to create a fast-paced, entertaining  story? Does it ever occur to the Herc-haters that kids who watch this movie  will not necessairily be tainted forever about Greek mythology, but might  actually have an interest sparked to adjourn to a library to learn more  about the Greek gods and legends? As we saw in Tarzan and Hunchback, Disney  are perfectly capable of toning down the slapstick and doing a 'straight'  story as well. If we wait long enough, we might actually see a character  bleed sometime!<br />The muses were my favourites too...but oddly, to me they  seem to work better on their own...I just feel that the 'Halle-LOO-ya!'  black gospel attitude just doesn't say 'Ancient Greece' to me &lt;g&gt;
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This album so rules.  Every song.  I actually like it more than Tidal, but to be fair I've only been listening to it for a week.  It is smart, strong, beautiful, complex and delicious.  Just like Fiona herself.  Buy it.  Now.
0792156684|5.0|This is the most wonderful, breathtaking, romantic, amazing, sad movie i have ever seen in My entire existence.  The burning passion between Jack and Rose, The horrible reality that haunts you the entire movie: the ship  is going to sink. It's amazing how anyone could not like this breathtaking  tribute to the doomed ocean liner and the thousands of people who went down  with it.  And, In the final hour of it, you begin not only crying over jack  and rose, but all the others as well.  The first and second class people  who were refused passage off the ship just because of social standing,  The  Brave and truly noble men who went down with the ship, and the lucky few  survivors, who had to leave loved ones on board.  I never thought a movie  could touch me like this, but it did.  and after the lights go back on and  your leaving yhe theater, it doesn't matter, if you are thing about how  jack and rose were really kate and leo,  They just represent the real  people on that ship, many of which were like them.
6305041156|5.0|&quot;Ran&quot; which a Japanese friend of mine translates as &quot;Coup&quot; or &quot;Upheaval&quot; sums this film up perfectly.  The story is of a Warlord who wants to slow down in old age and give the reins  of leadership to his oldest son.  Almost immediately, the Weak minded  eldest son gets pressured by his vengeful wife to betray his father's  trust.   The resulting war is as beautiful as it is graphic.   Think  &quot;Braveheart&quot; in Japan.   I do have one problem with the DVD  however, and that is lack of features.  It is not very easy to use chapter  search as there are only a few chapters included, so finding scenes is a  little hard.  Features are bare-boned, but the film more than makes up for  it.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|Fiona Apple has a great voice and listening to  this second effort everything about her is really brought out to shine. Very crisp, and very different music than what young people her age are into, but that's what  makes her music special to me. Her music takes you places that a dance/rap  number will never go.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is the best album I have ever bought. If you liked Savage Garden's first CD you will love this one! The songs &quot;Two beds and a coffee machine&quot; and &quot;Gunning down romance&quot; are my two newest  favourites. If I could give this album 15 stars I would, because that is  what this album deserves! Darren and Daniel are doing the best ever!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is a great album...!  A must buy...their song 'I knew I loved you' is just like my boyfriend and I...&lt;I knew I loved you before I met you...&gt; the lyrics are so beautiful... I love their songs... their first  album's &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; is my bf and my song... :) We both  love Savage Garden very much..and enjoy their music as much as we like  them... :0) They are great! Hope they will have another album out soon...  cant wait!  I ordered the CD before its released in US and I only have it  on my hands for barely 2 days..and my little sister took it and since I  know she would NEVER return it to me (she loves SG too) so I bought another  one online again... hehe, and my bf listens to it over and over again....  all in all, this is a must have CD!  :)
B000002C1X|5.0|Genevive Williams' opinion of this record is not one anybody should accept. Remember folks, this album was performed live at the tearing down of the Berlin wall in 1990. This recording is a must own.  If you've never  heard it, be ready to play it a thousand times and that goes for the kids  too.  Genevieve, I disagree 100%.
B000021XR5|5.0|Thank God STP have returned to salvage 1999 musically. This CD proves that no matter what personal problems this band suffers through they still have the chops to produce what amounts to the musical highlight of the year. If  you have been waiting for a collection of powerful lyrics and sounds wait  no longer pick this up NOW!
6304490119|4.0|This movie is by far one of my favorites.  However, Kurt Russel was a horrible Colonel O'Neil.  Richard Dean Anderson, by far and wide, brought more to the character in SG1 than Russel could possibly have. If this movie  would have had the cast the SG-1 series has, it would have been much  better. Regarding the DVD, it's limited in it's extras, I was really hoping  for some deleted scenes or makings of's.  It's the earlier release, so I  guess that's their excuse.  Get the Special Edition for a few bucks more,  it has some extra stuff that this one doesn't.
6304510861|4.0|After reading many of the comments below, it's obvious that many viewers think this film is either total nonsense or that it's all in Fred's head (his own view of things, and that he has killed his wife).  <br />I have seen  &quot;Lost Highway&quot; only twice, a few years apart, yet both times I've  arrived at an alternate interpretation...  What if this is some Faustian  tale with Pullman at the mercy of some devilish character?  Yes, I'm  getting farfetched, but it makes sense.  There is something sinister, even  supernatural, going only here.  Blake's man in black is entirely scary,  something straight out of a nightmare.  That party scene with the cellphone  where Blake is two places at once is very disturbing.  At first I wondered  if Blake was merely a figment of Fred's imagination, but ruled this out  because of the shot of Blake talking with another party-goer shortly  afterwards, and of his later interaction with characters like Loggia.   Consider Blake's monstrous appearance.  The character even looks  diabolical.  Deathly pale, with these evil black eyes.  He doesn't look  human at all, he looks dead (and I did toy with the idea of his being a  personification of Death)--and devilish.  He has this creepy dialogue about  meeting Pullman before and having &quot;been called&quot;... it had this  Faustian aura to it, like Pullman had made some devil's bargain and then  forgotten about his end of the deal.  (Conversely, I can see how some  viewers would, instead, see Blake as a mental evil alter ego of Pullman's  murderous side.)  <br />Patricia Arquette's character is like some sultry  seductress, ensuring Pullman's (and Getty's) damnation.  Notice that really  quick shot of her face at the beginning, before Pullman turns on the light,  when she is actually Blake!<br />When Pullman morphs into Getty in the prison,  I kept wondering if the movie was about &quot;lost souls&quot; and if both  Pullman and Getty were pawns of the mephistophelian Blake.  (I neverconsidered that Pullman and Getty were one and the same person.  Pullman is  too cultered, too artistic, to be the hoodlum Getty--who also is very  disturbed by Pullman's sax music)  Notice that Getty's character is,  initially, quite dazed--as though he has returned from the dead-- and he  has a wound on his forehead suspiciously like a bullet hole (this  disappears over time).  Getty's parents avoid discussing what &quot;has  happened&quot; to Getty--tears in their eyes--and I immediately figured  that Getty had died horribly and been returned to them...  The parents are  so grateful to just have him back (notice how blase they are about his  choice of friends and all-night outtings)that they don't question anything.   Getty's character is also told by Blake that they have &quot;met  before.&quot;  Again, I wondered if this were a Faustian pact.  In the end,  Pullman returns, ever at the mercy of a persuing Blake (tormenting him with  videocam) and flees, futilely down an unending highway into damnation (?)  or insanity.  His face deforms as he screams, as though a mixture of all  the lost souls, or of his body switching rapidly from Pullman to Getty and  back?  Or, is it all just insanity?  <br />Does it really matter?  <br />The  whole atmosphere of the film (and its mind-blowing full-circle ending)is  remarkable and disturbing.  There is some great humor too in the film  involving Loggia (the road-rage scene, and Loggia's eerie phone call to  Getty, &quot;I'm glad you're doing fine...&quot;)  Damn creepy.   <br />&quot;Lost Highway&quot; is a must-see.  I still don't have all the  answers and I know they'll never come.  But it's the mood and eerie visual  images (the reverse shot of the exploding cabin, like a premonition)that  make this film so brilliant (and some awesome music tracks).  This film  will haunt you for years to come.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I buy lots and lots of CD's all year long.  To be quite frank, most are a disappointment, a few good tracks (if we're lucky) and the remainder is filler.  NOT THIS ONE!  This could be my all-time favorite CD of the year.   Get over to your listening stations and you'll hear what I mean.  One  listen and you can't stop.  BRAVO MOBY!   To everyone else, ENJOY.
B0000214F4|5.0|Anthony Hopkins is surely one of the greatest actors alive today.  Add to the mix Brad Pitt and the incredibly talented and beautiful Claire Forlani and you've got one great movie.<br />At three hours, this is a movie that  requires your full attention.  Otherwise, you may miss some of the great  details.  Every scene between Pitt and Forlani is fantastic.  Just sit back  and envoy this one.
0440219078|5.0|I am going to put in my two cents, even though there are already 682 reviews. I thought this book was brilliant.  I read about 10 pages before going to bed, and then I read the rest of the book the next day.  It was very powerful!  I am 32, and I read it, and it blew me away!  It isn't just  a young adult novel. Lowry creates a utopia, and then her viewpoint  character is the misfit, the one set apart within that utopia.  I won't sum  up what happens, because others have already done this, but if I were to  teach a Science Fiction class, and could choose only a few books for my  students to read, this is one of the ones that I would choose. It reminded  me of Robert Cormier's The Chocolate War, in some ways. I have read through  a few of the reviews, and they say it was a good book until the ending,  which they didn't like.  I thought the ending was the most powerful, poetic  part of the book.  The ending was perfect.  It was nebulous, and we aren't  sure what will happen, but Jonus has won, whatever he finds at the end of  the hill.  Everything doesn't have to have the hollywood, or New York  bestseller neat resolved ending.  And this is the end of the book - there  shouldn't be any kind of sequels, because that takes away power from  Lowry's ending. Pick up this book!
0920668372|5.0|Don't read this with just your eyes--open your heart.  I picked this up off a stack when I was working with a 6-year old boy at our local school.   He and I giggled all the way through, but I had a hard time staying  composed at the end.  I bet his mom would too!  This is not about  perversity or codependence.  It's about love. The purest, deepest, most  enduring love between parent and child.  That's it.  And it's just plain  beautifully done.  Hats off to the author who dedicated it to his stillborn  babies.  He knows love.
6305076626|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  It was very different from your regular run-of-the-mill Hollywood.  I am a 'drama freak' in school, and am one of many who can't stop singing Time Warp!
B000021XR5|5.0|STP are my favorite band, and ofcoarse i was expecting alot from their newest release.  It took me some time to get the feel of it, but once i did i fell in love with it.  In it, the band experiments with many forms of  music, reflecting many of their influences.  As a result, it doesn't have  the feeling of togetherness, like its a mixed jumble of tracks.  It is  little likely to succeed in the modern world of hip-hop and rap-rock  popularity, but I salute it as probably their second best album after Tiny  Music.  Some natable favorite tracks of mine include Pruno, No Way Out,  Church on Tuesday.  I strongly suggest that any fan of STP or rock go out  and get this album. I've read in other reviews people complaining that STP  steal off of other bands for this album, please email me if you know  directly how, I have an open mind.
B000002KON|5.0|It is ironic that &quot;Arthur, or the Decline &amp; Fall of the British Empire&quot; may be the Kinks greatest album, and is also their last great one. The Kinks albums after this (beginning with &quot;Lola&quot;) all have  chestnuts, but they still represent the &quot;decline &amp; fall of the  kinks&quot;. The music on &quot;Arthur&quot; was looser and  &quot;stoned&quot;. The songs were getting longer. Dave Davies guitar  accompaniment to tunes like &quot;Yes Sir, No Sir&quot; &amp; &quot;Winston  Churchill Says&quot; are free-form noodles. However, sort through these  less attractive elements, and you'll find the best songs Ray Davies ever  wrote: &quot;Shangri La&quot;, &quot;Driving&quot;, &quot;She's Bought a  Hat Like Princess Marina&quot;, and &quot;Some Mother's Son&quot;. And  despite the occassional forays into &quot;typical late 60's music&quot;,  this collection of songs demonstrates Ray Davies intelligence and  independence. He may have been a &quot;rock star&quot; at this point (a  roll he really embraced in the 70's to embarrassing effect), but he seemed  to eschew the trappings of pop culture, fashion, &amp; self-importance.  <br />&quot;Arthur&quot; shows us (for the last time) Ray Davies as a  sensitive and wise young man who cherished tradition and the collapsed  world of the British Empire. These songs show him struggling to find  meaning and direction in a world where idealism and innocence are lost (as  he lamented on the &quot;Village Green&quot; album). It is sad to consider  that the only solution which seemed to occur to him was escapism, as in  &quot;Driving&quot;. Of course, this is not a judgement on Ray Davies. In  fact, just look how far we've drifted into isolation and complacence in the  intervening years...
6304147589|4.0|Over the years this film has become synonymous with Hollywood overindulgence and excess.  What it should be synonymous with is grand, epic storytelling in the David Lean tradition.  This is one of the most  beautiful, elegiac films I know.  Sure, it's slow at times, but it unfolds  like a rich, complex novel.  There are three or four set pieces, including  the Harvard graduation at the top of the film and the shoot-out at the end  that are simply some of the most magnificent film making I can remember.  Judge it for yourself and prepare to be pleasantly surprised. WARNING: DO  NOT SETTLE FOR THE SHORTER, EDITED VERSION.
B00002DE2L|5.0|Anne-Sophie Mutter, the Valkyrie of the violin, leads heself and a band of Norsemen thrugh Vivaldi to Valhalla. <br />I usually smile when I hear the  familiar strains of Vivaldi's &quot;Spring&quot; secton of the four  seasons. I listen mostly to jazz and only dabble in classical music. I was  only vaguely aware that there were in fact four seansons, not just spring.  But listening to Mutter's exciting and passionate rendering of a summer  storm completely beguiled me.  To trespass into another genre, it totally  rocks! And I was drawn into a complete year's worth of seduction from the  vixen virtuoso.  Each season has its charm and even if you have your own  favorite, none are to be missed.  That include the fifth season which here  is Tartini's contribution.<br />  I completely agree with Mutter's assessment  that a smallish chamber orchestra like the Norwegian Trondheim Soloist  brings out the vitality of Vivaldi better than a large symphony orchesta  could.<br />This is music that is so well done that it pull a jazz listener to  classical.  I was seduced, but not abandoned.
B00001QEE9|3.0|First off, let me say that Pinocchio is my favorite of all the Disney animated films.  Which makes it all the more frustrating that it was treated so shabbily in this DVD release.  While the video and audio quality are decent, they are not nearly as good as they should have been, given the  state of the technology.  And, frankly, the &quot;supplements&quot; are a  joke.  A picture on the disc is a feature?  Get with it, Disney.
B00001ZWTT|2.0|When you go to see a Will Smith movie, you expect it to be entertaining and fast-paced. A movie with Kevin Kline might have your expectations leaning more in the direction of cerebral, tight-knit &amp; solid entertainment. If Salma Hayek is in it, well ....at least you expect a  flick with visual appeal ...1, 2, 3 STRIKES...Wild Wild West STRIKES OUT!   TALK ABOUT DROPPING THE BALL ! Will Smith, whose laid-back,  street-wise-cracking veneer,usually hides a well-focused on screen in-  tensity that is both impossible to miss ordislike ...seemed to be  sauntering through the film, feel- ing embarrassedly like a walking  anachronism, con- sidering the &quot;Old West&quot; backdrop! Kevin Kline,  on the other hand, who usually brings a certain air of bravura to his  oft-times eccen- tric characterizations, seemed to display a marked  inability to take himself seriously when in drag, (Which, unfortunately, is  during a good chunk of  the film)lapsing into a pathetic sort self-parody,  which, considering the script, may have been the only way he could stomach  the role !  Salma Hayek, for whom no one is exactly holding their breath  for her to win an Oscar as Best Actress, seemed OBSESSED with getting her  lines out with as little accent as possible...Despite the fact that she was  clearly cast as Mexican in this film...(As opposed to her bit part in The  FACULTY!) You could almost imagine &quot;La Mejicanita&quot; standing  there, during shooting, with her Accent/ Dialogue Coach, just out of camera  range! Salma... concentrate MORE on your ACTING, next time, O.K.?<br />As far  as Barry Sonnenfled´s Directing is concern- ed...well, here we could  imagine him running around frantically, till the last minute, editing &amp;  re-editing, trying to decide exactly what it is he was trying to do with  &quot;WILD&quot;....and of course, not even coming CLOSE to getting it  right!<br />The ONLY reason I rated the movie 2 Stars (as op- posed to 0  Stars!) is because of the scope &amp; the<br />novelty of the Special Effects.  The idea of seeing all those well orquestrated, and at times visually  stunning effects against an Old West backdrop was the only refreshing &amp;  original element in the film ...If you are not a diehard Special Effects  buff, I can think of absolutely no reason on earth why you would find  anything at all worth seeing in  this pathetic excuse for a Blockbuster  film !
1558807381|1.0|Tom Cruise. Running through an inexplicably glitter strewn forest. Wearing shorts. Made of leaves.<br />I am a tremendous fan of the sci fi/fantasy genre  and I think Tom Cruise is a really good actor but this is one film I CAN'T get into.<br />The plot basically revolves around a diablos-esque villain  plotting to block out the sun by killing unicorns. (There are a few basic  plot holes here. I mean don't we need the sun to uh kinda... live? Even  evil horned red-skinned devil children need their vitamen D!)<br />The  hairbrush-challenged Jack and his innocent (read: stupid)girlfriend, Lily,  live in a forest world populated by (apparently) one peasant and about six  forest children.<br />When our pointlessly evil villain steals the last  unicorn and kidnaps Lily, it's up to Jack, Gump, Screwball, Oona... Brown  Bottom... Ok ok, so maybe forest children would have names that silly but  what I can't explain is why they are running through a snow (and the  obligatory glitter) filled forest dressed like they're heading for the  beach.<br />The forest children decide Jack is their champion. To aid him in  the fight against evil, they give Jack a sword and armor (but no pants!) A  not so epic quest begins.<br />If you are looking for a sweet, wonderful,  beautiful fantasy, this is not it!  The actors really wasted their time  on this messy Tolkein wannabe<br />PS, when Jack is looking for Lily in the  woods during the blizzard, check out his cape. To the left of his lantern  you can see a HUGE safety pin!
0800136586|1.0|What an AWFUL movie adaptation of such a fun, charming musical!  The film is so syrupy, it oozes along at 2 mph.  I loved the original musical &amp; have the Broadway cast cd, I saw it on a 1979 National Tour, and in a 1987 DC-area production, I played Cecille the maid, a &quot;lovely Boylan  sister&quot; and Frances Perkins in The White House.  So I'm very familiar  with the original musical.<br />First big mistake:  John Huston as director.   BAD CHOICE.   A lot of good songs like &quot;We'd Like to Thank You,  Herbert Hoover,&quot; &quot;Annie&quot; &amp; &quot;NYC&quot; were cut, and  their replacements like &quot;Sign,&quot; &quot;Let's Go To The  Movies&quot; &amp; &quot;Dumb Dog&quot; are much worse!   This musical is  supposed to be set in December 1933.  It's The Depression folks.  So why  set it in a movie set that screams sunny, small-town California!   The  5000 or so orphans that climb out of the woodwork of the orphanage:  what  were they - finalists in the Kiddie Olympics?   Everybody is doing  difficult flips &amp; huge leaps &amp; tumbling.<br />Albert Finney was  miscast.  He could not sing in the movie musical &quot;Scrooge&quot; and he  cannot sing here.  I suppose that's a big reason why the songs Daddy leads  or solos like &quot;NYC&quot; or &quot;Something Was Missing&quot; were  deleted.  He looks &amp; sounds VERY uncomfortable in the role.   Carol  Burnett does nothing with the Miss Hannigan role.  How original to play her  as constantly drunk &amp; constantly vamping the men.   Tim Curry is  absolutely too creepy as Rooster.  Just a few years after playing the  bizarre cross-dresser Frank-N-Furter in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show,&quot;  that's all you can think of when you see him in this (he can do better,  folks.  I saw him do a wonderful job as the lead in the musical &quot;Me  &amp; My Girl&quot; on tour and he was NOT creepy there).<br />Bernadette  Peters once again plays a ditzy vamp here, which is pretty much the only  role she canplay, and it gets old.  <br />A previous comment mentioned that  the orphan girls kept flashing their underwear.  Add to that the maids in  Warbucks' mansion flashing their slips, panties &amp; garter belts in  &quot;I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here&quot; &amp; &quot;We Got Annie&quot;.  Ann Reinking is a better dancer than singer, songs were transposed to a  lower key to fit her husky alto, &amp; the director gave a millionaire's  secretary implausible &amp; gratuitous dance numbers to give her something  to do.<br />The movie has a goof somebody should have corrected:  if it's 1933, why are they showing the 1937 film &quot;Camille&quot; at Radio City Music Hall?  A great film choice for a 10-year old kid, too...<br />In the musical Annie is supposed to  be 11, but is always cast older to convey the street-smart grit needed for  the role.  Aileen Quinn was 10 when cast, and no matter how well she  tap-danced &amp; sang for the audition, she was too young &amp; naive in  the role to give Annie any real scrappiness or depth.  Her performance only  adds to the cloying sweetness.<br />In sum: a waste, a movie &amp; soundtrack  to be avoided.  Instead, PLEASE buy or rent the 1999 Disney television  movie.  It is MILES better, much more faithful to the musical, better cast  &amp; MUCH better directed!  Or even better, see a local production of the  original musical.  See what you are missing...
B000001F5A|5.0|I first purchased the record when it came out. It was a Japanese cut as this was the only version available at the time. After listening to the record I could easily imagine myself being surrounded by snow and ice.  Relaxing music with which you can dream away. Then I wished for the CD  version to come out. As soon as it did I bought it and still enjoy  listening to it as much as I did when I first heard it.
6303471730|2.0|Words cannot express how disappointed I am by the quality of this tape.  Expecting the wonderful movie that so many know and love, I purchased this video only to discover on the back of the video sleeve that this is an  edited version of the original.  That's fine, but what these people did is  unacceptable!  They deleted all the original music, including background  music, plus they deleted voices, and background sounds and replaced them!   I could not even recognize John Wayne's drawl, (I don't think it's even his  voice) and Maureen O'Hara's brogue has been replaced with the voice of  someone else!  On top of that, the timing is way off!  I ended up turning  the sound off and watching the movie in silence.  Still a wonderful view,  but for someone who went so far as to name her daughter &quot;Kathryn&quot;  after the spirited character O'Hara plays, I am thoroughly disgusted.  This  change should be noted in the description for those of us who care about  quality.
B000002UEB|5.0|On a whim, I picked up a copy of OM just before a 5-6 hour ride from Boston to Montreal.  By the time we hit the Canadian border we had listened to the cassette 5 times!  We could not take it out the cassette player.   Not having been a big QR fan to that point, I was totally blown away by the  the vocals and the overall tightness of the band.  There is no singer that  can &quot;hold a candle&quot; to Geoff Tate in the heavy rock genre.   Though there is no weakness on this concept album, the highlights are  Anarchy-X/Revolution Calling, Suite Sister Mary, Speak, The Mission and  Eyes of a Stranger.  If you have not heard OM before, you are going to be  in for one of the most emotional, energizing and eye-opening musical  experiences you've ever had.
0930289455|5.0|What can I say?  This book is simply breathtaking.  In addition to an intence, captivating story and beautiful graphics, we get to see see a POSSIBLE origin for the Joker; whether it's the truth or not is left open.   It also contains an occurance that severely altered the plotline of the  Batman comics (if you want to find out what it is, read some of the reveiws  below.)  I've always simply loved the relationship between the Joker and  Batman, their hatred, their infatuation, and their bond, which is portrayed  beautifully in this book.  If you want to see the Joker at his most insane,  tragic, inhumane, and human, this is definatley for you.<br />(WARNING: This  book contains mature issues.  If you're looking for a Batman comic that's  very good but not quite as frightening, I would highly recommend Mad Love.   Also, if you are a fan of the Animated Series, be forwarned that the  Joker's comic origin is not the same as his &quot;Jack Napier&quot; one.)

6305076650|5.0|First of all, I have only recently seen the movie for the first time.  Halloween on V-H1 because I was staying with an ill friend.I watched it twice that night, then went to rent the movie.  I have never felt a movie  as stirring as this.  I feel like Brad should be me!  Uptight,  conservative, but, Dammit Janet, Frank's just great too.A lot of my  friends, gay and straight, come over to watch the movie with me and talk  about how incredibly cheezy but all out Fun movie it really is!If you want  Horror that's not scary or a Rocky that's not Sly, and you just want to  have fun watching a movie, give it a try!

The Ride of the Valkyries is awesome  as is the whole set.  <br />I love all the negative reviews about Solti.  I'm  sure these people know much more than the experts on conducting, opera, and  classical music- NOT!<br />Get over yourselfs.  It's all petty jealousy.   There's a reason why Solti is regarded as one of the greatest conductors of  all time- and you know it when you listen to this Ring.
0553108034|5.0|Martin keeps it coming in this, his second of his ever growing series. The book has everything that you would expect after reading the first, but lacks in one vital area, Certainty. perhaps it was his intent to leave the  reader yearning for more, but i personally felt that he did not give up  enough and the things that do occur in this book are a bit drawn out. eight  hundred pages later i felt as if very little had happened, and that nothing  had been resolved. however, this book is perhaps eight hundred pages of the  best written nothing ever to come along. the characters and the depth to  which you get to know them is incredible, if not to intimate, and the plot  development is one that would make shakespear look like a hack. this book  as i stress to all who consider themselves fantasy &quot;readers&quot; is  perhaps one of the most illuminating, origional, and detailed fantasy books  to come out since the hobbit. it drops the pretense that good guys are near  perfect and always do the right thing and forgets about the standard cookie  cutter hero mold that i have grown so used to. I can only say that i feel  robbed after reading it. it is soo high of a standard to compare all other  books to, i'm not sure that reading will hold the same intrigue that it  always had.
6304457383|5.0|I learned about this movie when my mom was telling me about the scary movies of her day, and she went on about how it was one of the scariest movies she ever saw, and when she and her kid sister left the theatre, her sister was crying great crocodile tears, claiming she'd never let herself see another movie again.<br />While my aunt will never live that down, my mom is still haunted by this movie, and I can tell why. I saw it on AMC in August at midnight, and that was a mistake. This movie scared me beyond my expectations. Audrey Hepburn was fantastic as Susie Hendrix, the recently blinded woman persued by Alan Arkin, a narcotics dealer who will stop at nothing to get to a stash that is in Susie's apartment.<br />Many claim this movie isn't scary, but coming from a generation that grew up on Scream, Halloween, Nightmare on Elmstreet and other cheap movie's that use gore and `don't-turn-that-bend' suprises for scares, it doesn't mean much.<br />`Wait Until Dark' is so much more than the typical slasher flick, it is a psychological thriller that takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride to hell and doesn't stop turning and tossing until the last frame of film fades to black. On second viewing, if you feel the *sparkle* is fading, just position yourself in Susie's shoes, and you're in for a whole new experience.<br />Praise `Wait Until Dark' - and trust me, if you wait until dark to watch this, you'll be rewarded greatly with a heart-stopping finale!
006020706X|5.0|A few weeks ago i was looking for a copy of this book for my 6 month old cousin, and my boyfriend just happedned to be in the store with me, and he said he had never heard of good night moon. I told him he was seriously  deprived as a child not having read this book, it is a must have for all  children, it will lull them to sleep before you know it. I remeber fondly  my parents reading this book to me as a child, and since that time i have  been deovouring everybook i can get my hands on, but this one always brings  back the magic of our childhood.
0553062182|4.0|I had always wondered why I didn't seem to have as much fun at parties,  concerts, etc. as other people. Was there something wrong with me? Was I  just not a fun person? After reading Elaine Aron's book I realize there are  alot of people out there like me who ARE normal and fun, but just happen to  have a low threshold for stimulation (noisy crowds, bright lights, etc). It  helped me to understand why I feel way I do when faced with excessive  stimuli, validated those feelings, and helped me find ways to avoid those  situations or explain my discomfort to others in non-offensive ways when  such situations can't be avoided. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars  is that I felt it kind of went off into some &quot;psychobabble&quot; at  times. Certainly not enough to invalidate the book, but I did have to skim  a couple of chapters.  Overall a very good book, even for someone who just  wants to understand the highly sensitive person in their life (my husband  is more understanding of me after reading it).

0880381736|5.0|I have read perhaps 20 of the Dragonlance books, and overall have mixed reviews. But I could do naught but rave about THE CHRONICLES, as they certainly deserve all the praise they've received. The first books in the nearly infinite Dragonlance series, they are also the best. I have read them at least ten times in the last fifteen years and am long overdue for another read. The story is captivating, and the characters are real (in that they have flaws and foibles, but definite charm). Be prepared to get sucked into the world of Krynn, for THE CHRONICLES will occupy your thoughts and keep you up late at night reading.<br />As other reviewers have commented upon, I do see some parallels between these books and Tolkien's LORD OF THE RING, but that in no way hampers my enjoyment of either series.  Similar is NOT the same--THE CHRONICLES are well worth reading on their own merit.  <br />The later books in the Dragonlance series don't meet the level of quality evident in THE CHRONICLES, and in THE TALES and THE PRELUDES, for example, conflicts in history and plot become evident.  Unfortunately such contradictions seem inherent because so many different authors are contributing to the same basic story--Dragonlance.  But don't take that as a deterrent to reading THE CHRONICLES; the original trilogy truly is a gem.  I also recommend THE LEGENDS, which is also written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman--actually anything they write is worth checking out.  It makes sense that as the creators and genius behind Dragonlance, they can do it best.
0060916540|5.0|Ive done some climbing, traveled and climbed in the Andes and read many climbing books and this book is outrageous.

B000003ER4|4.0|This late romantic opera has its flaws, but it is a poignant story about love, loss, and ultimately, letting go of the past.  This performance is solid all around.  The music is evocative and at times exquisite.<br />If you  enjoyed the music from THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD or THE SEAHAWK, give  this a listen.
0767836286|3.0|I began watching this film not knowing what to expect, other than what I read on the short blurb on the back of the DVD packaging.<br />Initially I was intrigued, only to be disgusted by an improbable sequence of events at the  end. Without giving away the ending (which is rather interesting), I can  only say that the final car chase is a ridiculous sequence of events that  could probably never happen in D.C. without someone getting caught by the  police. Furthermore, how the movie's antagonist could have set up this  chase to lead to the movie's unpredictable end result is also  puzzling..<br />For what it's worth, this film was enjoyable, a good romp I  suppose, with a very bleak message at the end. It did keep me guessing most  of the way through.<br />Sound was moderate, nothing special even in Dolby 5.1  with a home theater system. Picture quality was nice and crisp.<br />For those  of you who own JVC DVD players, be advised, accessing the special features  section of this DVD can lead to some strange hardware malfunctions. When I  tried watching the &quot;Alternate Ending&quot; my player froze, then would  not play this movie at all.<br />I finally had to hard reset the player in  order for it to work again. (Instructions for this can be found on  [...] under customer support FAQs) This is a known problem  with this DVD and JVC players. Perhaps a later pressing will rectify the  problem, or JVC will release a firmware upgrade.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|You think that SG will follow the common trend of Mariah C., the Backstreet Boys, and so forth.  But listen to this album and you will be completely blown away.  From lost love to leaving an abusive relationship,  this album has it all.  It deals with what people deal with everyday and  that is what makes this album so special.  I just hope that this group will  find the success it so well deserves!
630529142X|4.0|I don't usually review comedies and I am doubly reluctant to grant one 5-stars, but &quot;Waterboy&quot; is right up there with the original &quot;Austin Powers.&quot; There are enough jokes following one on top of  another that you can view this dozens of times and still crack up. I  thought it was a so-so comedy until I watched it with my two teenage  nephews who &quot;showed me the light&quot; on this movie. It grows on you.
0792838068|5.0|This film was too similar to a family tragedy for me to walk away unscathed.  It was a painful experience to watch this unflinching motion picture about the hopelessness and misery of spiritually bankrupt souls.   This is obviously not a film that will be terribly popular with most  people, if for no other reason its grim subject matter and deliberate pace.   To watch these two characters embrace each other when the rest of the  world has shut them out, is to witness love at its most unconditional and  brutally honest.  Sara and Ben are certainly not your typical couple, each  at the end of their rope and living empty existences, but blessed with an  inherent sense of love that, despite their dismal environment, manages to  afford them with a sliver of happiness and normalcy.  A powerful piece of  cinema and one that will haunt anyone who's known the sadness and  destruction brought on by both alcoholism and spiritual resignation.  A  must-see film.  Incidentally, Sting's musical contribution is excellent and  adds immensely to the feel of the film.  Mike Figgis wearing three hats  (director, screenwriter, composer) is nothing short of phenomenal.  One  final note, Elizabeth Shue's performance is more than on par with that of  Nicholas Cage's Oscar winning effort.    A beautifully realized film in  every respect.
0671027344|5.0|This book can never again be compared to Salinger's _Catcher_ This is a  novel about honesty, not about being phoney. Chbosky presents in intimate  detail, not only the trials of teenage life but the beauty of life itself,  that any reader, regardless of age level, can appreciate and learn from.  Never have I read a book with such a beautiful optimism on life despite all  of the cruel things it inflicts...
B000002ADT|5.0|I have never come across a CD that I can put on in the background and just let play.

Miles Davis has secured himself a place in my disc changer for a  long time.
0399143904|3.0|I enjoyed the topic of this book: terrorism and counterterrorism.  It seemed that Mr. Clancy developed the plot....ever so slowly...and then became bored with it and just wanted to end it.  The end of the book....the  last 100 pages or so....seemed rushed and haphazardly put together.  This  book could have easily become a 1500 pager or the same could have been  accomplished in 400 pages.  Overall, I enjoyed it but sometimes it just  seemed to drag on.
0393317552|2.0|In the 1980's film \\"Trading Places\\" Eddie Murphy andDan Akroyd traded places as part of a $1 bet, made by two owners of a commodities trading firm.  One bet that good commodities brokers were born and bred, genetically, so to speak, while the other, equally vociferously argued that it was only training that counted and that genetics and breeding counted for nothing.  The argument was nature vs. nurture and, being the 80's, nurture naturally won.     Jared Diamond's book is to world history what Trading Places was to the nature/nurture debate---a well thought out but highly subjective treatment.  Maybe someday we will be able to dispassionately discuss the issue, but Guns, Germs, and Steel is not the place to get that treatment.     The book is as skewed to the belief that only environmental factors affect success---the society with the most varities of domesticatable plants and animals will, over time, prevail over all other societies---as say The Myth of the 20th Century, the infamous guide to Nazism that pre-dated Mein Kampf, is skewed toward the belief that only genetics determines success. Both are well documented and passionately argued, and equally oversimplified.     Read it, by all means, but don't necessarily believe it all.  The book has its strengths---its historical accounts of Pizarro's conquest of South America is fascinating.  But some of his theories, and remember, this is all theory, are weak.

0767817486|1.0|I know that many of you impressed with this movie. However,let me tell you that you impressed for a movie which is made by people who hate Turkey. Why does the story takes place in Turkey? Do you think it would be different if  you were caught in somewhere else with drugs? I don't think so. I suggest  all of you to visit Turkey, and see what the heaven(not the hell) looks  like. Instead of wasting your money to buy these kind of movies, save it  for a nice trip to Turkey!
B000002UAU|5.0|First. I gotta tell you I've been a die hard Beach Boys' fan since the early sixties. Now I've gotta say that Sgt. Pepper's is undeniably one of the most influential albums ever, period.  To deny the cultural influence of Sgt. Pepper's is to have your head stuck in the sand! The melodies, lyrics, harmonic structure, and production techniques used on Sgt. Pepper's (and Pet Sounds) make the album stand out  against all others. Though there may be nothing new here in the scheme of  things, nothing that hadn't been used by any number of composers in the  past, it certainly brought all these operatives to the attention of the Pop  world. And, if you must criticize, don't forget to put yourself back in  1966 and 1967 and seriously listen to anything else that was available.  These albums represent a progression in Pop music from teenage angst to  serious music that encompassed techniques of something other than pure  emotional thrashing.  Teenagers could choose to listen another kind of  music without the feeling of selling out to previous generations. I am  proud to have had this album in my collection for over 30 years and am  proud to pass this music on to my children as any Bach, Debussy, Goodman,  Miller, Joplin (Scott &amp; Janis), Verdi, Wagner, or any of the multitudes  of quality music compositions created in this soon to be closed out  millenium. And as someone else pointed out, the Beatles too, kept on  progressing, i.e. Abbey Road. They opened the way for Led Zep, Cream,  Hendrix and everyone else you are listening  to . . .
B00001X591|5.0|The quality of performance from Hogwood and company are flawless and near perfecton as usual.  I can fully recomend this recording to fans of Albinoni or Baroque music in general.  Andrew Manze is amazing and I hope  these guys continue to record all the major works of Albinoni on period  instruments.  One thing besides the praise of this album is that both Op.7  and Op.9 have been recorded by Simon Standage and the Collegium Musicum 90  several years ago.  Their performances are just as good and deserve just as  much credit.  Critics probably forgot to mention that this territory was in  fact previously charted.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is one of the best of the 90's.  Very similar to another film called &quot;Dark City&quot;, in the sense that it makes you question what is real.  The special affects are mind blowing, especially if you get to  experience it with high end video and audio.  A must have for anyone who  owns a dvd player.  Great extra's on the disk as well.

0425152251|5.0|Gaarder winds the plot inextricably with the sections of philosophy Alberto Knox (Albert Knag's alter-ego); he uses the plot to illustrate the thoughts of the time.  Don't read this book solely for plot or information  - you have to read with both in mind to receive the full effect.

B000002LND|4.0|Madonnna was never much of an ARTISTE, but after she gained a bit of popularity she was able to procure some talented individuals to help her craft a string of decent and occasionally great hit singles. Those are all  here, with no  obvious ommissions. Shortly after this collection was  issued, the musical landscape started to change and in her furious attempts  to remain trendy, music started to take a backseat to image and posturing.  (Image had always been important to Madonna's success, but through the  period covered by this collection, had peacefully coexisted with attention  to popcraft). As a result, this collection contains not only the essential  Madonna of the '80's, but also the essential Madonna of all time. Any  future best-ofs will certainly be of diluted quality.<br />dap
B000001EAQ|5.0|Hey, I wasn't expecting this.  This album was supposed to suck, wasn't it?  Didn't it get sort of blasted when it came out?  Sure, it ain't old U2, but that's a good thing, because another album of stale idealistic rockers  wasn't what we needed.  In fact, this may have been one of the greatest  albums of 1997.  And it sure isn't techno.  The band shouldn't have said it  would be.  There's really only about 4 &quot;techno-sounding&quot; songs on  here, and two of them (&quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot;)  are actually good.  The other two (&quot;Discotheque&quot; and  &quot;MoFo&quot;) are a bit lame, but ignore them.  There's still 10 good  songs left!  And the lyrics on this are in my opinion U2's best yet.  Good  stuff, from an album that wasn't supposed to be good.  Ignore all that  PopMart-posing; they won't be doing any of that stuff again.  They made  alot of mistakes around the time this album was released, but none of them  really had to do with the music.  Just trust me, buy the CD, and go into  with an open mind.  You'll like it...really!
B00005GL0Q|5.0|Arguably The Beatles best album, \\"Revolver\\" continues to sparkle with innovation, great melodies and sharp lyrics forty years on. From the moment that \\"Taxman\\" demands your attention with the count-in on to the bizarre seagull/laughing sounds (that's a tape loop distorted of Paul McCartney laughing) that open \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" the album features solid slabs of experimental brilliant rock 'n' roll by one of the best and most popular bands of the 20th century.<br /><br />Harrison's \\"Taxman\\" with a brilliant rapid fire machine gun guitar solo from McCartney opens the album. McCartney's \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" continues to be powerful with its strident string arrangement (producer George Martin and composer McCartney were inspired to write the string arrangement by Bernard Herrmann's score for Francois Truffaut's film \\"Farenheit 451\\")comes on stage next with a completely different sound and texture. \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" (which wasn't on the album in the U.S. originally but on \\"Yesterday and Today\\")has a lilting melody and laidback delivery by Lennon. Harrison dives into Indian music with \\"Love You To\\" grafting sitars and tamboras to a western melody. \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" received the ultimate compliment when Lennon stated he wished he had written it (it's McCartney's completely). It's a masterful love song with a brilliant, rich melody. \\"Yellow Submarine\\" gives Ringo the spotlight in a children's song that with all of its silliness acts as a perfect counterpoint to Lennon's closer \\"She Said, She Said\\" inspired by Peter Fonda's inane comments to Lennon.<br /><br />The second side of the album opened with \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" a bright melodic song by McCartney inspired by The Lovin' Spoonful's \\"Daydream\\". It's still a great inspirational song to help you greet the day. Lennon's \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" was slighted by the composer in many interviews but the dual guitar attack riff played by Harrison and Lennon is great. \\"For No One\\" has Paul digging into his own psyche (inspired by his relationship with Jane Asher)it's a slice of life with a brilliant horn solo by Alan Civil. \\"Doctor Robert\\" written about a pill pusher the band knew that could make you right drips with sarcasm. The middle eight with its unusual changes is an example of what made the Lennon-McCartney songwriting team so brilliant. Often slighted \\"I Want To Tell You\\" features Harrison's off-beat melody and experimental vocal arrangements at a pinnacle. McCartney continues to try on every style popular at the time excelling at his songcraft with the 60's R&B inspired \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\". Finally the album closes with Lennon's inspired drone \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (originally called \\"The Void\\" but renamed by Ringo with his typical wit)which consists of one chord and Lennon's voice sounding like he's a million miles away. The use of tape loops here was groundbreaking and powerful for pop music at the time. Engineer Geoff Emerick found the perfect balance between experimental sound and pop music when he engineered this track pulling pushing his creative engineering to the limits.<br /><br />While album is in desperate need of a fine remaster (the releases of \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\" and \\"Love\\" show just how sharp these songs could be on CD) the album continues to be brilliant. The only recent album that can come close to this one in my mind is U2's \\"Achtung Baby\\" which also combined musical styles in a blender for a unique sound.  Highly recommended.is relationship with Jane Asher)it's a slice of life with a brilliant horn solo by Alan Civil. \\"Doctor Robert\\" written about a pill pusher the band knew that could make you right drips with sarcasm.

0783211856|3.0|Since seeing _Saving Private Ryan_ I've been forced to reconsider every Spielberg movie I've seen. While _Schinder's List_ is certainly better than SPR, I think it suffers from the same flaws.<br /><br /><br />Most of the positive  things written about this movie, I agree with. Some of the scenes are  incredibly affective, and the emotions Spielberg evokes don't feel forced.  The Holocaust was simply horrible and to a large degree that is reflected  in this movie.<br /><br /><br />But there are problems. Even in the first viewing I  noticed how, whenever the Germans were doing something evil they spoke in  German, but English the rest of the time, as if to emphasize how inhuman  they were. As others have noted, Neeson has no German accent but Fiennes  does. How stereotypical is that? Spielberg wants us to feel terrible for  the Jews, which I have no problem with, but doesn't want to humanize  everyone.<br /><br /><br />And what's with the black and white? Hey, I have no  problem with it, as a rule, but guess what: in real life, during the  1940's, people lived in _color_! Surprise! It's not more  &quot;realistic&quot; by being on b/w, for God's sake.<br /><br /><br />A strange  movie. But better, I think, to read books about the Holocaust or watch the  truly emotion-wrenching _Shoah_ than to watch SL, if you want to learn  about this period.
B00000K19E|2.0|The movie started with an interesting idea and great promise.  But it turned out to be just another &quot;blow 'em away - body count movie&quot; that Hollywood loves to churn out these days.  I'm not an anti-violence  type, it just gets boring after so much. It turns into &quot;cheap  fill&quot;. The movie had the talent and the budget; they just blew it.
0385484518|3.0|I'm disappointed that it's not more insightful.  There's nothing new in this book about ALS and it hardly touches the ugliness and distress of the disease.  I think it was more a book about the author's reaction to Morrie  and the author's own life.
0800105141|5.0|Tracing the Mahatma's (Godly one) life backwards from his assassination was indeed a directorial masterstroke, as if attempting to explain how he came to meet with such an end. A superb movie, it offers a bird's eye view  on India's war for Independence, a glimpse of forgotten greats in the war  like Gokhale (shown here as Gandhi's mentor), Tilak, Sardar Patel, Kriplani  and many more. Obviously intended only for those interested in India,  Indians, spirituality beyond conventional religion and Gandhian philosophy,  it certainly substantiates Albert Einstein's description that  &quot;Generations to come will find it difficult to believe such a man in  flesh and blood walked upon this Earth&quot;. This movie proves he was  infinitely more than just a &quot;fakir in a loin cloth from India&quot; as  per one of Churchill's poor judgments.

Not only is it insightful, passionate, bluesy, and  intelligent, but each song has its own world. I love, absolutely love, this  CD. It is wonderful and i rate it above &quot;Tidal&quot;.

B000002UAU|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums (this and the White Album).  If you haven't been exposed to the Beatles, and I mean if you haven't sat down and listened to at least 3 full songs then...you have to try it! Trust me, you  will be a fan for life.  When I was 16 I had a friend that loved them and  got me hooked.  It's the only good thing I got from that!  Listen! Love!
B000002L9M|5.0|Yesterday I went to visit an old friend. So I got in my car (Honda 1986) and looked out for a nice tape to listen to. Among all those hi-tec supersoundblabla-looking ones I found a simply black one. I put it on -   and it brought me back the years to 1986. Such a clear and various, deep  and dancable sound. The lyrics so overwhealming and true, and the effects  just on the right point. great. My old car seemed to feel the same and went  a bit slower, so I could listen to the last tones of this wonderful album  before I reached my buddy.
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater have released a masterpiece.  This probably the best concept album released since Pink Floyd's The Wall, and in my opinion, completely surpases it.  This is by far their best album yet.  If you cannot  appriciate it, then I feel sorry that you can't comprehend its genius.  Any  fan of progressive rock/metal should buy this album.  This is also an  excellent starting point for new fans.
6305426651|1.0|I watched this movie last weekend.  I knew very little about it, but thought that Benigni was charming on Oscar night.  I thought Spielberg was a bad sport. After seeing the movie, I guess Spielberg was annoyed because  &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; is a ridiculous movie, and I agree.  I found  it offensive, and pandering to audiences who are tired of all the violence  in the world, that they just want to see a movie and feel good. A lot of  reviewers here mentioned 'Hogan's Heroes&quot;, which I never watched  because it seemed stupid. Some mentioned &quot;Seven Beauties&quot; which  succeeded in everything that &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; failed at.  The  fact that is historically perposterous doesn't not even have to be  mentioned.  The fact that he reduced monumental events to a Marx Bros.  schtick is what I found offensive.  The entire movie made no sense.  In  reality, he would have been shot when he did his first gag while getting on  the train!  And it just got worse from there.  I am not Jewish, I have no  agenda, but I do have a respect for history and people who survive horrific  events, who lived to tell through heroism and force of will.  A buffoon  out-smarting Nazis by sight-gags and double-talk is an insult!  And I do  not think this is his niave attempt to make a movie of value...I am sure  Benigni knew exactly when people would laugh, would cry and how they would  feel when it was over.  There is no visual violence so kids could see it.   And I am so surprised that this movie is considered an antidote to  Hollywood movies, when it uses every manipulative ploy to win over  audiences.  This is not a movie about the human spirit,  it's about a  actor/director who knew exactly how to give people what they want.  I am  writing this for the few other people who wrote negative reviews, because  after I saw the movie I wondered if I was the only one who felt like this.
6302642256|5.0|When I was younger I saw this film.  I loved it, it made my imagination soar.  I want to find a copy of it for my nine year old son.  I know that he would love this.  I can't explain the feeling I had when I saw this  film.  It rates real hi with me.  Other films that can't be beat would be  The Explorers, and The Last Starfighter.  All these 80's Sci-Fi films were  very entertaining.
B00001QEE2|4.0|Constant jokes and asides littered throughout have led me to believe that, although they have thrown out the original myth and revamped it as their own, those folks at Disney at least read the stuff before they set out on  their own version.  Maybe when the kids watch it it will lead them to read  the real Myths.  That's what happened to me as a child after I watched a  barely faithful take on Perseus called Clash of the Titans.
B000002UAU|3.0|Sgt. Pepper may be the most &quot;important&quot; rock album of all time.  It may be the most influential.  But it's far from the best.  In fact, it's among the Beatles' *worst* albums, substituting pretentiousness for  playfulness and creating the sort of pseudo-profundity which has impressed  a generation of high school seniors.
6301969588|5.0|Browning's &quot;Freaks&quot; is not for everyone.  He seeks to show the emotional bond and needs of these side-show attractions.  As a circus troupe considers themself a family, these deformed performers are a family  within the family.  There is actually a &quot;sweetness&quot;, if you will,  when Schlitzy (a male, by the way) is flattered by compliments about her  (his) dress.  Remember, that these &quot;Freaks&quot; were some of the  highest paid live performers of their time.  I rate this classic FIVE  Gooble-Gobbles.
068484267X|5.0|With trepidation, I started reading Angela's Ashes. I was afraid that: 1) I wouldn't get out if what everyone else has; and 2) I'd find a descriptive memoir like this boring. Happily, I am a third of the way through, and I  love the book. I go home during lunch so I can read a few more pages. It's  an incredible tale....by the way, how did McCourt remember all this stuff?  So far, I can say that I love the kid. Thank goodness for his naivete,  which prevented him from realizing how horrendous his upbringing was and  allowed him to find some joy and humor in his everyday confines. Wow. The  religious angle, coming from a Catholic background, is hilarious, too.  There were a lot of thumps on the heads for Frank and his schoolmates. This  book brings out other emotions as well, since it's very hard not to greatly  dislike his irresponsible father and not to feel so sorry for the other  poor kids who starved and had no shoes. I can't wait to get to the end...  which brings me to the word &quot;Tis.&quot;
6302413931|5.0|I originally bought this movie on VHS Widescreen. While I watched the whole movie more than once, it was the attack on &quot;Charlie's Point&quot; that I returned to watch again and again.<br />I sat there  mesmerized watching with friends, who themselves are warriors - US Navy  SEALs, USMC Force Recon, Rangers and the like, while the spectacle of  Coppala's nightmare raged in full surround sound around us. We wore those  23 minutes right off that analog tape. <br />I swore that I would not buy a  DVD player until THIS movie was released in DVD format. Well, my time has  come...finally!<br />While I certainly will enjoy having the player to watch  many other great movies, I have spent over $1000 upgrading my system to  include a top-line player, digital reciever, and a bunch of other stuff I  never knew existed, so that I can queue up that 23 minute scene and watch  thunderstruck, with my friends who have been there, and want to go back.  Indeed, it does and I do so here, glamourize war, but I am young. Oh, the  inhamunity.<br />So I have to say, $1000 later and at the risk of sounding  casual about war, I expect it's worth every penny.
0783225792|4.0|After reading some of these &quot;reviews&quot; I have to just remind these people that this is more than a film. In general, these things happened this way. I lived in Las Vegas during this time, and it was like I  knew these guys. The only problem with the film is it makes them too nice.  The real Tony Spilotro (Nicky Santoro in the film) would have taken Joe  Pescis' character apart for breakfast.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Songs of Freedom is an amazing collection of the music of Bob Marley and the Wailers, spanning over two decades and surely lasting for generations to come.  Whether you are a student of Marley or would simply like to learn  more about his talents, beliefs and love of music,  this is for you.   Though Marley has passed on, this four-disc set takes you along for the  journey he and his Wailers seemed to be on as they evolved into the band we  know them as today.  You can truly feel the vibe that so encompassed Marley  as he wrote and recorded many of these masterpieces.  Songs of Freedom is  yet another example of the outstanding quality and pride Island Records  provides for fans of all musical genres!
0783229887|5.0|Childs Play has always been my favorite series of movies.Not for the great storylines (They are simplistic with plot holes all over the shop)but for the great character of Chucky.The series of movies has finally realised  this and dispensed with the horror.This is basically &quot;The Chucky  show.&quot; And what a great show it is.Every quirky one liner had me  laughing more than any other film i've ever seen.(Including Austin Powers  2.)Tiffany is a great side kick/Straight man.I can't rate this film highly  enough.Role on &quot;Son of chucky&quot;The inevitable sequel.
B00000K19E|5.0|I can only compare it with the first Star Wars Movie.  The characters were believable.  The situation, though definitely Science Fiction, was something that I could see happening if computers got too powerful.  Keanu Reeves is probably one of the sexiest young actors today.  I think he's a good actor.  Laurence Fishburne deserves an Oscar nod for his performance.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I have bought a lot of CDs but out of all of them so far this is the best. The music on this album moves me like no other music has ever done. I highly recommend it.
B000023VR6|5.0|Its hard to follow up classic, especailly when that classic is &quot;The Chronic&quot;, but all I could say when I heard this was, &quot;He's done it agian&quot;. You can gripe about the vocal content, but this is Dre fool  not Rakim
B000023VR6|5.0|This CD is a classic! Just as amazing as the original, my new favorite CD of all time - the dopest producer on earth is STILL DRE! Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre are back together, Xzbit, Eminem, Nate Dogg - it's a great cd. Out of  the 18 or so songs, somethin like 16 are truly addictive. BUY THIS CD!

B000023VR6|4.0|Dr Dre's new album is decent but I was expecting it to be alot more than what it really is, it's not as explosive as The CHRONIC,don't get me wrong the cd is pretty good,song's 2,4,5,10,13,15,and 22 are the best the rest  are decent but to repetitive it seem's like but never the less Dre is back  he is still the man and this cd prove's it.
B000020617|4.0|For all of you who still expect Dave grohl and his Foo Fighters to make a nirvana album, try to get used to the idea that he is no longer in nirvana, that there is no more nirvana, and Foo Fighters are not the reincarnation  of nirvna. Now that we've cleared that up, we can start to think of the  FOOs as a band And what a band When I first listened to the cd, I was abit  worried.  Had dave grohl forgotten what he was? But after immersing myself  in it, I bagan to hear all the great aspects of the album, and I realized  that this is most likely one of the best foo fighter albums, and maybe the  best release of the year.  Its much more mellow and poppier, but not in the  negative sense of the words.  The sound is really cleared up and cleaned  out, but you still hear feedback and screeching at the right moments to  remind you that its a rock album. The best songs may be &quot;Stacked  Actors&quot;  &quot;Learn To Fly&quot;  and &quot;MIA&quot;, but the rest  are still great. One song &quot;Aurora&quot;, is really calm and smoth, but  there semms to be emotion behind it, and you cant ignore the fact that its  a great song. One minus aboiut the album is that in tends to stay in the  smae mood, giveing the album on a whole a repetative feel, and if you dont  know the songs well, you might mix up a few of them.  But all these songs  are real, have energy and leave nothing to be desired.  But when the last  song &quot;MIA&quot; closes, you have a feeling that there should be more,  that you want more. Maybe that proves how good it really is.

B00002R0MC|5.0|This collection spans nearly the entire career and output of Bob Marley (and the Wailers). <br />From their early work at Studio 1 (with the Skatallites as backing band) to some of his greatest material in the later  parts of his career.<br />It also includes some remixes of hit songs that are  worth having as well.<br />This was initially released earlier this decade as  a limited edition set.  Once it was out of print, it was nearly impossible  to get at the original selling price.  <br />I'm surprised and pleased to see  that it's been reissued.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|&quot;Tidal&quot; mostly surfed on soft, sultry melodies, however, &quot;When the Pawn...&quot; takes a completely different route. With the first notes of &quot;On the Bound,&quot; you can tell that she's taken a  change of pace. &quot;Fast as you Can&quot; does not sound like the Fiona  that you were used to, but a newer, more experimental version of her. It's  great.<br />Of all of the tracks on this album, &quot;Get Gone&quot; is by far  the best. It couldn't be better. It is undoubtedly my favorite song to come  from her.<br />Definitely buy this album. It's one of the best of the year.
6301942647|5.0|Dreams is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  This series of non-linear vignettes contains a flurry of lessons, each building upon one another to the point of dismanteling itself in a very Taoist fashion.   Each episode is self contained, but still relative to every other one.   Each time you watch it a new lesson is learned and new imagery revealed.

B00000K3UU|4.0|this movie is very funny. the plot is a bit weak, but the dialague makes it worth the time. the movie makes simple things like falling rollerbladers, peeing on the sidewalk, and a action figure named scuba  steve so very funny. buy this movie. it is worth it. happy gilmore is also  a good sandler movie. see that too.
068484267X|2.0|I really must be missing something.  I am so bored and just want the book to be finished.  Nothing draws me.  I was expecting the lifestyle of an Irish child like stories my grandma tells.  This is a story of a poor boy  with worthless parents.  It has little to do with being Irish.
0790738139|5.0|I cannot write anything that would compare with the magnitude of this movie.  I have seen it over 30 times and never get bored with it.  It has the essentials of a great movie: love, sex, murder, betrayal, sexy cops in  suits and of course a plot that you never lose interest in.  The only thing  I can say is that you will love it and if you do not, send me your copy  because I know my tape is going to wear out any day now.  As someone else  put it, this may be the reason to buy a DVD player.  I also agree with them  when they said they could not believe Titanic beat this movie out for  awards.  I saw Titanic and could not see what all the fuss was about.  L.A.  Confidential is something that will chill you and make you want more.
0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond's book should be praised for tackling the question of &quot;Why is today's world the way it is?&quot; without shrinking from potential controversy.  Mr. Diamond presents a compelling argument as to  why our world has been shaped Occidental civilization.  However his prose  is too dense and can lose readers who aren't willing to wade through it to  find the gems of his insight. Arguably, the greatest strength of this book  is the author's courage to explain our world's recent historical dominance  by the West in the face of a certain backlash.  Kudos also for the  evenhanded treatment of all societies.
B00001OH82|4.0|Why did he do it? Nobody will ever know. His refusal to talk about it underlines the fact that Tin Machine isn't something Bowie is proud of nor his fans actually want to acknowledge. Experimental guitar sounds  remeniscent of Steve Vai and obscure vocals make this an elliptical and  interesting record from the fans point of view. I simply love it and  despise critics who don't know what they are talking about. Four men having  fun.
0316920045|4.0|It is disturbing that many reviewers lump Wallace and DeLillo into the same camp as writers.  Moreover, they'll throw Pnychon, Coupland and the occasional Updike in there.  This is madness I think.  What DeLillo tries  for is the painting of a picture and an overall sense.  Each book of his  explores how to paint this picture.<br />Wallace should be called the opposite  of Raymond Carver.  While Carver seeks to give his readers the absolute  minimal amount of info needed to understand the theme, Wallace challenges  the reader pick the theme out of the extraneous details and the endnotes.   Wallace is not trying for an emotion or a feeling like in DeLillo's case  and he is not trying to express feeling of post corporate angst like  Coupland.  Wallace is a modern day hyper involved Tolkien, whole worlds  spinning at his finger tips.<br />Wallace is the future of modern fiction and  as Wallace points out in &quot;A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do  Again,&quot; DeLillo and Pynchon are a fiction from the past generation.   Modern fiction writers need to set themselves apart in some way and I think  Wallace has done this.
0684171600|2.0|I just read this &quot;classic of children's literature&quot; at age 49, and I found it very hard to follow.  It depicts a number of evil and frightening adults (men), with a boy &quot;saving the day.&quot;  I think  it should be read by teenagers and adults, rather than 9- to 12-year-olds,  since it is so difficult to follow.
6305363668|5.0|With the release of the Director's Cut for this film, it has now attained classic status.  I would argue that those who prefer the original didn't understand the point of the movie in the first place.  Ford's voice over in  the original was directly contradictory to the &quot;who's the hero?&quot;  theme of the movie (by the way, it ain't Ford).  The cheesy ending in the  original also buried this theme.<br />Some have argued that the removal of  Ford's voice over makes the film hard to follow, but the voice over makes  the film *impossible* to follow on the thematic level by burying the main  theme and making Ford look like your typical action movie hero.  So however  &quot;hard to follow&quot; the Director's Cut is, it's vastly preferable to  the incongruent original version.<br />Of course, the original version was  notable for its imagery and cinematography, but if you want to understand  this film, the director's cut is essential.

B00000JMQE|5.0|&quot;Return to Oz&quot; has all the elements that create a movie classic. I have just purchased the film on DVD and have noticed that it has a certain charisma and charm quite different to MGM's version. Return To Oz  on DVD is beautiful, the widescreen element adds to the enchantment and  intrigue. in 1985, the film cost 30 Million dollars to make and it is one  of the last films shot in the Technicolor process. The DVD technology  brings out the vivid colors and the    glorious soundtrack. This picture  deserves an acclaimed place in motion picture history.
006092988X|5.0|This book is one of the greatest books of all time!  I completely relate to Francie, not in an exact, economical sense, but as a 15-year-old girl; I have gone through the same emotional situations as Francie.  She is a  modern heroine who does not rely on anyone except for her own strength and  will to survive.  The lavish descriptions about her family's life will  touch the heart of any reader.  Betty Smith must have been a genius to come  up with such a compelling, heart-warming story in a time when such graphic  images of poverty were condemned.
B00000IBRX|4.0|It's saddening to see a great movie with groundbreaking images and vistas and plot, and then see it brought down by a dumb ending. That's what happens with &quot;What Dreams May Come.&quot; I still give it four stars  considering it's breathtaking from beginning to middle and the story is  moving, romantic and adventerous. Robbin Williams gives a powerful and  convincing performance. Cuba Gooding Jr. is enlightening. The special  effects are astounding, amazingly convincing and thrilling to just look at.  There's so much eye candy that you have to see it twice or more than twice  to get a good look at everything! But after a thrilling and amazing journey  into Heaven and Hell, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; ends unsatisfyingly  with a dumb and illogical conclusion. Still, this is an intelligent,  stunning piece of film that should be cherished for the images it presents  and the romantic story it combines with them.

B00000G3PA|1.0|Easily one of the worst popcorn movies ever made, this movie (and us suckers who saw it in the theaters) demands an MST3K spoof.  It shamelessly rips off much better movies, especially the Dirty Dozen and the Right  Stuff.  And the special effects?  Downright horrid.  I never once believed  I was watching anything less than an elaborate soundstage full of actors  who should've known better than to star in something so awful.  Thankfully,  all the actors (especially Bruce &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; Willis) have  redeemed themselves with better movies since then.  Skip this load of stale  testosterone.  Unlike other great testosterone movies--such as The Dirty  Dozen or the The Lethal Weapon series, or The Rock--this dull movie is no  fun whatsoever.
B00002MZ2C|1.0|I have always liked Rage's music but their political views are too screwed up for me to be able to listen to them anymore.

B000002P5W|5.0|After the fury of Are You Experienced and before the glory of Electric Ladyland, Hendrix put to tape his most soul-searching and beautiful album.  Anyone who sees Hendrix as a guitar-burning, drug-taking, rock god must  listen to this album.  Axis shows what a beautiful songwriter Hendrix was  and how his guitar playing could be quiet and beautiful as well as loud and  powerful.  It also shows what an innovator Hendrix was in the studio.  My  favorite tracks on Axis are Little Wing, If 6 Was 9, Bold as Love, You Got  Me Floatin, and One Rainy Wish, but every track is a gem.  If you are a fan  of Hendrix and only own Are You Experienced, Electric Ladyland, and/or Band  of Gypsies, you are missing out on something truly special.

B000005YZM|5.0|i find it difficult to believe that i purchased this record 30 years ago.  in fact, i bought 2 copies-the original with the misspelling and the regular edition. and the nice thing about it: it still sounds lovely.  the  songs range from the literary &quot;Rose for Emily&quot; to the anti-war  fervor of &quot;Butcher's Tale&quot; (sorry maryland);and there's not  a  bad song on the album.  for those who want to see where the zombies might  have gone, may i suggest argent's first album and colin blunstone's solo  release &quot;  one year&quot;.

It might sound a bit dated, but the album is  definitive Fleetwood Mac.  You can never match Rumours, but his album is  the best of the post Rumours era.
B000002J23|4.0|Three of the songs on this album- Machine Messiah, Does It Really Happen?, and Tempus Fugit, rank as some of the best songs Yes has made. That may not  sound like much, but it's one half of this short 6 song set.  The other  tracks range from passible to lame.<br />Sure, Jon Anderson is somewhat  missed, but Trevor Horn's vocals fill the job very nicely- in fact casual  listeners might swear it's Anderson singing anyway!<br />Technical  perfectionalists take note- the album is remastered, but there are  occasional moments of annoying distortion.  The ending of Machine Messiah  is practically ruined by what sounds like an overdriven mixing console.  I  don't know if this is from the original tapes or the fault is in the  remaster, but it's a shame.<br />However, it's an inexpensive album and those  three songs are WELL worth the purchase price.
0787115045|4.0|The first three quarters of the book were good then the plot sort of fizzled out.  However, when reading a Roth novel, the characters and the plots are not always well developed.

His language is so beautiful  that flaws in characters and plots are not nearly as important as the way  his words fill the page.  He has no equal in that regard.

B000023VTQ|5.0|This movie has now moved into the position of being the movie I have watched the most times.  The more I watch it the more I see.  I don't know what the writer, director and producer intended but I think the muse was at  work on this one.  To me the sceen where Julia is telling Hugh that she is  just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her is the soul  surrendering to the beloved.  All pretense is gone and only love is  desired.  And the love in their eyes at the end of the movie as well as the  sceen on the park bench. The sufis say anything can lead us to the beloved.  This film is doing a real good job of that for me.
B000000OE7|5.0|This is my favorite Queen CD, which is quite remarkable considering it was released 4 years after Freddie Mercury died.<br />The surviving members did a great job with the music, and even on singing parts of the songs (Roger and  Brian sharing a verse with Freddie on the wonderful 'Let Me Live' and Brian  singing the last verse on the dark 'Mother Love.'). It's also interesting  to hear how these songs differ from their other releases (Too Much Love  WIll Kill You on Brian's first solo album, Heaven for Everyone on Roger's  CROSS album, and some of the other's from Freddie's albums). <br />ALl in all,  a wonderful collection of songs (even better than Queen II! ) and the  untitled instrumental piece at the end of the CD is pure magic!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Wow! When did these guys get so good?  What's the massive improvement over their previous records- where to begin?  First of all, guitarist Tom Morello manages to come up with some fierce riffs to match his usual  technical fireworks.  Second, vocalist Zach de la Rocha has developed a  rapping style all his own and has stopped trying to sound like Public  Enemy's Chuck D.  But, the biggest improvement- and most potent weapon- is  drummer Brad Wilk, whose performance on this record places him among the  top drummers in rock.<br />Unlike previous RATM efforts, this record maintains  a high quality throughout.  And these guys finally sound like a band  instead of four guys who just happen to be performing at the same place and  time.  So, dispense with rock-rap pretenders like Korn &amp; Limp Bizkit  and go with the real deal.
B000001Y79|3.0|What I think of this cd is that i use to really like this band but now since im more of punk/ska person i dont listen to it at all. I mean i dont hate the group. This band may be ska but it is no the kind of ska that i  like: Voodoo GLow Skulls, Reel Big Fish, etc.  I would recommend this cd if  u are into female singers(not Shirley Manson) who sing somewhat of ska.  This is for people who also like Save Ferris.
B0000020C4|4.0|I saw the video of the tenth anniversary before I bought this recording. Colm is wonderful as Valjean, Philip Quast who sings as Javert was okay, Lea Solanga isn't as good as Frances Ruffelle in the orginial London cast  recording and I like Patti LuPone ( original London cast recording) as  Fantine better than Ruthie Henshall. The Thernardiers by far are my  favourites.
0002171856|5.0|The British Special Air Service (SAS) is an elite military unit trained for long range patrols,sabatoge and covert operations far behind enemy lines. The U.S. Navy SEAL teams are trained on principles developed by the  SAS nearly fifty years ago. SAS troops are deployed to some of the most  remote regions on the planet and for this reason, must be experts in  outdoor survival. John Wiseman is a former SAS survival instructor, so you  can rest assured that you are receiving the best available information. The  techniques desribed in this book are simple, functional and  extremely  clever, all hallmarks of SAS operations. The section on traps and snares is  spectacular! All drawings are clear and easy to understand and the book is  organized into specific geographic regions according to climate(i.e.  deserts, jungles, etc.). I have spent most of my professional career in the  woods (I'm a biologist by trade)and I use the information in this book on a  daily basis, including training fellow employees in the basics of land  navigation, improvised direction finding, and basic  &quot;woodsmanship&quot;. Additionally, I apply the SAS mindset to daily  problem solving and find that it serves me well. The book comes in two  sizes and I can highly recommend the pocket sized version for your pack or  field bag. I can not say enough good things about this book. I have over  fifty survival books in my personal library and this is the one I use as my  bible. I can also highly recommend the SAS Escape,Evasion and Survival  Manual by Barry Davies. It contains the same high quality info. as this  book plus some additional goodies!
0380789019|4.0|Gaiman does right in my opinion regarding this book.  I couldn't put it down once I started reading.  I would definitely like to see it continued....
B00000AFFF|3.0|It's one thing to admire and emulate your influences; it's another to give yourself over to them so completely that you come off sounding hollow by comparison. Elvis Costello works best whenever he uses his  influences--whether they're George Jones, Motown, The Beatles or Burt  Bacharach--as starting points from which he adds his own unique qualities.  KING OF AMERICA, IMPERIAL BEDROOM, GET HAPPY and SPIKE were all albums that  showed Costello drawing inspiration from those and other role models and  forging some new art from them. But then you get albums like ALMOST BLUE or  PAINTED FROM MEMORY where he so slavishly tries to re-create a style and  ends up with a feeble pastiche. The songs here might well be as classic as  the ones Bacharach wrote with Hal David, but you'd never know it from  Costello's overwrought attempts to be Dionne Warwick whenever he sings.  Since when did Dusty Springfield, Mel Torme or Karen Carpenter attempt to  mimic Warwick whenever they tackled Bacharach? I think there's probably  more here than meets the ear, but I hope that, should this songwriting  partnership gets another outing, Costello will loosen up enough to sound  like himself instead of who he THINKS he should sound like.
B00002DE0S|5.0|I was one of 500 who heard this performance live in Washington DC. Absolute perfection, dozens of colors, precision of instruments, not a note out of place - probably one the greatest recordings ever of these two  pieces - if Zimerman isn't the greatest living pianist today, I'd like to  know who is! Buy this recording immediately, it will probably win the  grammy award this year or next!
B000031XCR|5.0|I am a huge fan of Celine and one of the first people at the checkout stand with a copy!  Celine delivers no less than a stellar preformance.  All the hits are here, with terrific new tracks to indulge the eardrums!  Way to go Celine!
B00000IOSU|5.0|there is no more inspiring moment than getting lost in the music at one of sarah mclachlan's concerts. her beautiful lyrics, personal grace, and wonderfully haunting voice create an amazing experience that cannot be easily translated into words. listening to mirrorball has come the closest  of all those in my collection (including all the formally released albums) to bringing that feeling back. granted, &quot;i  will remember you&quot; was not that strong and &quot;adia&quot; has been  completely overplayed on the radio, but that shouldn't overshadow the  merits of this album.
0440219078|5.0|I loved The Giver-it was an amazing read.  To really better understand the book and its ideas you need to read it a few times.  But even after just reading it once it leaves a big impression and makes you think about your life and how different it could be.  Another great part of the book is that  you could get a great idea of it and its points at any age.  I know this is  a book that I'll keep and read periodicly throughout my entire life.  It  totally deserved its Newberry Honor and I would recommend that any parent  buy it for their child-and also read it themselves!
B000002LUB|4.0|This was a return to form for Sabbath,yet they took the hard way,thus avoiding both sounding like their previous efforts with Dio and also like their more radio-friendly output from the eighties.What many critics  misunderstood is the different thematic of the lyrics which here had little  to do with the 'Heaven and Hell'era and more with the  present(technology,alienation,despair) and also,paradoxically,with the Ozzy  years.Iommi's riffs were darker than ever showing who owned the  copyright,while Dio's vocals showed no signs of aging.Easily one of their  best albums!
B000021XS0|5.0|well...2 b honest DT for me isn't what it used 2 b..i'm a loyal fan 4 4 years but b4 this masterpeice i was drifting away fastely enough from them...i didn't even wait 4 this album...i heared it 1 timme  b4 it was  released officialy and enjoyed it quite a bit but when i bought it and  listened 2 it a bit more i just fell in-love again with the now  a-lot-more-mutuer dream theater..they've grown and this is their best  work...although the lyric sheet looks like a &quot;king diamond&quot;  album..it's nice..but who cares!  the best james labrie album..he's  brilliant here... and i hope finally he will b appreciated...great great  album...thank u Dream thetaer for making a dream come true..
6305587159|4.0|&quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; is not what I had come to expect from the Next Generation crew.  Instead of saving humanity form Borg domination or first contact it is only saving 600 people.<br />Despite that, or because  of that it is a pleasant change of pace.  It tells more of a story all can  relate to not just trekkers.  It is a pleasant and exciting plot that makes  the viewer examine his or her own views on when the good of the billions is  opposed to the lives of hundreds.  <br />Bottom line:  A good, well  constructed film, but not an epic Trek adventure.
0671027344|5.0|I just read this book in 2 days because once you start to read about charlie and his life you are addicted.  you learn charlies intermost thoughts. I wish that everyone would read this, i'm still spellbound by it  i can't even write
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather is just simply perfect. Big, brash, romantic, and honest. If you have a choise between the book and movie choose the book. although hard to believe the book is 10 times more gripping the movie.
B000002UB3|5.0|Well, of course this record deserves 5 stars.  So the Beatles were barely (or not) functioning as a &quot;band&quot; at this time.  So some of the  lyrics (e.g. &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;) are a bit hokey.  So there is no  real &quot;concept&quot; to the mini-rock-opera on side 2.  SO  WHAT?<br />Absolutely amazing music from start to finish, and one that I will  listen to until I die.
0671578278|4.0|I was at first really puzzled by the way Miles was acting.  Like, really pompus and strange.  We're so used to seeing Miles the adventurer or the investigator.  Miles the courter is darned awkward and not very respectful  to his lady.  But I eventually got into the rythm of the book.  Personally,  I loved the bugs.  They are the thread that hold all of the characters  together.  A brilliant move on Ms. Bujold's part.  Still, I can't wait to  see Miles in Adventurer mode again.
B000002UAU|5.0|Albums like this one, that have risen beyond being mere albums to acquire a legendary status, that served to define a moment in time and yet defy the constraints of time, that marked a blueprint for what came next, will  always draw a certain group of detractors that want to debunk the legend  and assign the lowest possible rating.<br />With albums like this, you end up  with a large number of 5 star ratings and a minority of 1 star ratings.   And practically nothing in between.<br />Well, that's fine.  Everyone is  entitled to his/her opinion.  But just the fact that this album continues  to receive responses like this, negative and positive, and continues to be  in many all-time top-ten lists, should tell you that it's definitely worth  checking out if you still have not heard this album in its entirety.<br />This  album will always be one of my favorites.  The inventiveness is incredible,  of a level that we just don't find in the vast majority of today's  recordings.
0793518326|5.0|If you read the reviews below, most people will sufficiently let you know about the minor inaccuracies in the orchestrations, vocals, etc. From what I've seen, however, 99% of the songs are dead-on accurate for the guitars  and bass. <br />If you want to learn how to play guitar, here is a way to  learn from the best! Same with bass....and even piano (though anything  other than &quot;Let It Be&quot; will be challenging for a newcomer to the  instrument). If your band wants to be the next &quot;1964&quot;, here is  their owner's manual! The only thing that this book is lacking is the type  of guitar and amp you should be using when playing the song in  question!<br />Only two things that make my teeth grind: 1) They will show a  C# barred at the 4th fret, go to another chord, then come back to the C#,  but now its barred at the 2nd or 3rd fret (even though the handwritten  chord letter is correect). This is probably not the author's fault, but  rather some lackey forced to write this stuff down. 2)While the  transcriptions are accurate, some are shown as played with a maximum amount  of difficulty. Prime example is &quot;Blackbird&quot;...there is a much  simpler way to play the same notes EXACTLY, without having to make  comparatively difficult fingerings.<br />I would definitely recommend spending  some bucks to get this book...if even to see the transcription to &quot;You  Know My Name (Look Up The Number)&quot;!
B000002UAU|5.0|The remastered edition of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" one of The Beatles seminal albums (when they transitioned forever from as Bob Dylan stated \\"being cute\\" to being \\"taken seriously\\")sounds quite nice. There are always going to be those little things you could quibble about (for example I would have much preferred to see a two disc set with the stereo/mono) but overall the EMI remastering team has done an exceptional job of bringing \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" into the 21st century.<br /><br />The bass is fuller, smoother and rounder sounding capturing what McCartney achieved on the mastertapes with help from engineer Geoff Emerick. Detail is strong although I will admit that because of some peak limiting some audiophiles will be put off by this edition.<br /><br />Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. When Mick Jagger  and Keith Richard(s) heard Pepper they immediately decided they needed to  try something similiar (hence Satanic Majesties). By the time TSMR came out  the Beatles had moved on. Just after the release of TSMR there's a story  that McCartney played Jagger and Richard(s) their next single (Hey  Jude/Revolution) and both were knocked out by the single. They immediately  sensed they needed to return to their roots just as the Beatles had done.  Anyone that doubts the band's musical ability needs to relisten to the  band's early albums which, for all intents and purposes, were recorded live  (they only had four track machines folks). Later, the band themselves  admitted the circus of touring and 20 minute concerts dimished their  playing live, but even on as unadnored an album as The Beatles (aka The  White Album), one can hear the band with little or no overdubbing.<br /><br />Pepper  had a huge cultural and musical impact. Anybody that can't see that impact  is fooling themselves. Revisionist history aside, it wasn't the most  important album of the 60's, but it was the most influential.
0786860707|4.0|It's a great book loaded with pertinent information for animators.  Still, this edition is a reprint of a COPY of the original, as the negatives for the artwork collected in the original edition were lost.  Thus, the current  edition has extremely poor color quality.
6304119046|5.0|A compelling story, fascinating characters, tip-top photography, haunting score -- I really dig this movie.  A classic, but one that doesn't make you feel like you're sitting in church at a funeral.<br />I wish it hadn't topped  the AFI list...now all people want to do is attack it.  Oh, well.  It'll  always be my &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;<br />(And it may shock you, but I like  &quot;Star Wars,&quot; too.)
B000021XS0|4.0|the excitement that 'metropolis part 1' created was due in part to its ambiguity. while i love dream theater, and i feel that this new CD is a great piece of music, it is far too bogged down in the lyrics for me. it  drags in places, though there are areas of genius throughout. the  relationship of lyric to music is an important one, and one that petrucci  might want to explore more. labrie is a great vocalist, but the lyrics were  not tailored to the music well enough. when they came together, it was  amazingly awesome(tracks 3, and 8, 10 and 11), but where they lagged, i  felt distracted. overall the music is a tremendous experience, and in  places the lyrics are inspiring (track 11). &quot;liquid tention experiment  1 &amp; 2&quot; did more for me musically, however. &quot;scenes from a  memory&quot; is a good CD, and a nice experience, but not as beautiful as  &quot;change of seasons&quot;.
B000023VR6|4.0|The Chronic 2001 is exactly what the doctor ordered. This is the return to early 90's rap which should keep true rap fans satisfied. Anyone who likes Puff, Mase, and that whole soft crew should keep away from Dre, Snoop, and  a nice dose of Eminem. If you really listen to the lyrics a lot of it is  really sophisticated and relevant to Dre's life in the rap game. He even  shows love for Eazy E and displays some lyrical genius on several of the  tracks, especially The Message. Still Dre, Forgot About Dre, and Big Egos  are all phat joints with high replay value. Nate Dogg does a great job of  adding comic relief once again, like he did on the original Chronic. This  album grows on you the more you listen to it.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Buy this cd.  it's just that simple.  I loved it from Here With Me to Take my hand.  The songs have independent words and vulnerable music-she combines them well.
0792156684|2.0|The movie Titanic is one of those great movies of all time.  I have a huge gripe with the quality of the DVD.  It is worse than VHS!  The resolution lines are clearly visible, and even though it is not anamorphic, it should  have been way better than this.
B00001QEBQ|3.0|I love this movie, but like the other Di$ney DVDs released - the quality of the picutre and sound (not to mention the complete lack of extra features) is awful.  If you want to see the way animation SHOULD look on  DVD, check out the Prince of Egypt or The Iron Giant, Di$ney's DVD quality  is shameful.
0345410025|5.0|Amazing, how can you improve memory you ask? Buy the book and you WILL improve you memory.  <br />If you practice the techniques you will astonish yourself with what you can do in such a short period of time.
6304078102|5.0|Watching this movie was like reviewing my life - the sights, music, feelings, political atmosphere, and I have carried with me what I consider the theme of this movie, a quote from Lennon's song, &quot;Beautiful Boy  (Darling Boy)&quot; that Richard Dreyfuss sang - &quot;LIFE IS WHAT HAPPENS  TO YOU WHILE YOU'RE BUSY MAKING OTHER PLANS&quot;  With good humor and  emotion, the movie reminds us to love our lives and not miss anything.   I've watched it about 9 times (so far).
006016848X|3.0|John gives an example of a man who washes the dishes for the wife's birthday and instead of getting a thank you, he gets negative criticism, because he does them so rarely he don't know how to do them.  After the  negative criticism the man never wants to dishes again.<br /> I don't see any  Difference when a woman changes the oil in the car as a surprise and does  not change the oil filter and drains the oil in the red oil pan (which is  his parts cleaning pan).  While the oil drain pan is hidden under the work  bench, cause its dirty.  She is going to get negative criticism too and it  will be the last time she changes oil.<br />I did learn something about  myself, If I don't get a positive reward, I will not clean.  <br />Save your  money and read &quot;The Gospel of Timothy&quot; instead.
0767827716|3.0|This movie is great. What can I say! The picture quality is excellent. Sadly, I was disappointed with the 2.0 stereo sound, which makes no use of my subwoofer. On my duntech speakers there was definately something missing  without the subwoofer rumbling the room.<br />If sound does not worry you, buy  this one. It's a great movie.
B000002UB3|5.0|It has always irked me when people refer to Sgt. Peppers as the best Beatles album.  I wonder whether they are completely familiar with Abbey Road, as this album far surpasses Sgt. Peppers in virtually all respects.  Does it matter?  No.  Both are must-have classics.  But Abbey Road is just  such a momentous accomplishment that it seems somehow unfortunate that it  hasn't been properly categorized as the Beatles' crowning achievment.  It  is fundamentally life-altering music, nothing less than that.
B000002JSN|5.0|The album is one of the best ever, and disc 2 is the better half.  Can't understand anyone's dislike of Down By the Seaside, but to each his own.  It is probably my favorite tune, nestled in a 6 or 7 track string of great songs.  Buy this CD!
6304143184|5.0|Of course its boring if you arent coz its not an adults film. DOH! <br />By the way, all you that gave this low marks -<br />Get an imagination and stop watching &quot;The Mummy&quot;
B00002MZ4W|5.0|The songs connect deeper on When the Pawn than on Tidal for some reason. I can't put my finger on it, but it is just a superior album. I cannot get enough of Fast as You Can and Get Gone. Still has a long way to catch up to  Tori with her piano and arrangements, as well as lyrically and vocally, but  she's on her way.
0380973464|5.0|From Neal Stephenson I am used to great futuristic or near-future science fiction.  This is more like current fiction mixed with historical fiction, with a bit of science and family history holding the various stories together.  You would think that confining himself to more &quot;real&quot;  circumstances than he usually plays with might stifle Mr. Stephenson, but  no.  With this novel he proves that he doesn't need to step into the  fantastical to weave some great stories together and convince us that no  matter how intelligent and creative any one of us may be, he can always  come up with something wonderful to surprise and please us.  I can't wait  for his next novel, whatever it may be.
0393307050|5.0|DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.<br />IT IS DANGEROUS.<br />This book is moreaddictive than the tincture of Laudanum that has consumed the lives ofinnumerable poor mortals.  Of greatest concern is that it is just one book in a whole series, with each being more captivating than the last.  The poor unfortunate reader is sucked into a world so vivid that it is almost impossible to return.  Sleep, loved ones, money, vocation all take second place to O'Brian once the first words have been sampled.<br />Heed my warning. Do not read this book if you value your free time.
B0000214F2|5.0|For anyone who wants lessons in Leadership, here it is! This film is chock full of leadership principles. It is amazing how we do the same thing day after day after day and expect different results. Patch Adams breaks the  mold and shows courage to challenge everyday practices and think  &quot;outside the box&quot;.
B00000JPH5|5.0|Jennifer Connelly protrays a young girl named Sarah, spoiled (in my opinion) and unable to accept maturity or adulthood.  After a fight with her parents she wishes her baby brother (Toby Froud)to be stolen by the  goblins and given to their king.  Well, they fulfill her wish and the  absolutely gorgeous ::purr:: Goblin King (David Bowie) tells her that she  has thirteen hours in which to solve the labrynth that lies between her and  his castle beyond the goblin city.  Sarah befriends several creatures along  the way that both inhibit her and aid her in her quest.   Anyone interested  in pure fantasy movies, this is a definite MUST SEE.  All actors portray  their characters beautifully and Jim Henson's creatures are nothing short  of magical.  Please...see this movie. Happy Viewing
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Great cd.  The songs speak from the heart and express true feelings.  very innocent and lovely to listen to.  A must by.
6304345313|4.0|If you want a good family film starring Michael Jordan and the looney tune characters, I think this is it. A little silly but that makes it interesting.
6303168507|5.0|People (below) have been questioning why on earth Spielberg would put a film in black and white when he didn't have to. At least to me, it was pretty obvious that Spielberg knew he was writing on a very sensative topic  and that he could still get his point across without dragging people to the  theaters to see three hours of merciless, blood-and-guts massacring of  innocent men, women and children. In fact, I thought the sparse colour  (seen in only a few points throughout the movie) is used for more evocative  (less brutal) purposes this way. I apologize to those of you who were  disappointed with not being able to see the slaughter of hundreds of people  in Braveheart like colour...maybe you should try another movie.
B00002R0MC|5.0|This is a beautiful peice of work for one of the greatest men, and the greatest musician who ever walked the earth. This is a must for Bob maniacs.<br />Let Jah be praised!
B00000JGHM|1.0|I bought this DVD based upon comments on Amazon. Pacino and DeNiro put in fine performances in an otherwise slow moving movie. The movie would have received possibly 2 or 3 stars if it weren't for the unbelievable shooting  scenes, which I found an insult to a persons intelligence. The plot was  reasonable just too slow, and certainly not worth purchasing.
0783113943|5.0|I don't think this movie would have been have as good if Jolie wasn't in it.  She really brings out the attitude of Gia and makes the charater come to life.  The plot isn't predictable, and you never know what's going to  happen next.  Great movie, great plot, great staring role.  Also the way  they decided to set the story up with personal accounts made it feel real  and up close.  Absolutly amazing!
B000003BDJ|5.0|Hot Rocks is still one of the greatest &quot;Best Of&quot; albums ever, and indeed feels like a coherent collection in it's own right, despite the changes in style along the way. A rock essential, and if someone knows  where I can get the Eurpoean release which has stereo mixes of many of the  songs that are in mono on this release, please let me know. Oh, just for  the record, the Beatles were great, the Stones were great. Stupid to  compare them to each other. Enjoy each for what they and revel in the  diversity of music.
B000023VR6|4.0|This CD is definitely off the hook.  Dr. Dre comes back with a vengeance on this disc.  21 thumping tracks, including some funny skits.  Snoop and Dre really tear it up on Still D.R.E.  And Eminem lays down a solid hook  and verse on Forgot about Dre.  If you are a person who listens to rap, go  pick this up, you will be glad.
B000002UAU|5.0|The recently released Yellow Submarine Songtrack shows how potentially brilliant Pepper could be if remixed/remastered. But don't wait for that. Capital may never get around to giving this great work the sonic detail and  bite it deserves. Buy this masterpiece ASAP.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of Light is Like a Prayer in an electronic mood, which is fine cause in my opinion the best artistic productions raise to the surface when the artists bring their feelings and personal journeys to the surface as well. I've always been a fan of her, and I think it'll carry on until I die...
B000002UAR|5.0|First, I think it is absurd to say that any Beatles album is their &quot;best.&quot; From Please Please Me through Abbey Road, every album is a classic document of where they were at the time (with the obvious  exception of the Yellow Submarine soundtrack, which shouldn't even be  considered a proper Beatles album). Even Let It Be is a great piece of  work. Which album is &quot;best&quot; depends totally on my mood on any  particular day. Sometimes the youthful exuberance of With the Beatles can't  be beat, other times it is the crystalline brilliance of Rubber Soul, or  the awesome production that is Abbey Road. <br />However, if I have to name a  favorite, it would be Rubber Soul. I love Revolver, but there is a haze  around it.  Rubber Soul is pure music, and, though Taxman is brilliant, I  don't personally feel that Harrison's other two songs are up to the  standard of the rest of the album. <br />How could you not like Yellow  Submarine? The great thing about the Beatles is that they never took  themselves too seriously and could always inject good-natured humor into  there work. It's always irritating when this song, Obladi-oblada, Maxwell's  Silver Hammer, etc. get lambasted by people. Maybe Yellow Submarine would  have been more in context as a separate single, but this is the way we have  it, and I still think it's a brilliant ditty, bringing a little world of  its own to life, and giving Lennon a chance to be Lennon. I wouldn't trade  it for 20 Cold Turkeys or 55 Silly Love Songs.<br />All right - this album  does contain some of Lennon/McCartney's best songwriting, some of the  Beatles' best ensemble playing, some of George Martin's best production  (though their production masterpieces are still Pepper and Abbey Road.)  <br />Brilliant, but Rubber Soul and Abbey Road, though arguably less  innovative, are even more brilliant.
B000002KXV|5.0|I often thought about buying this album during the 17 years since its release.  In fact, I made a mental note of &quot;The Nightfly&quot; at the precise moment in 1983 when Donald Fagen lost the Best Album Grammy for it.   The fact that he was nominated was the first thing to surprise me.  The  Grammy's aren't known for awarding those who rightfully should be.  Then  came the look of disappointment on his face and the face of the girl  sitting next to him when the award went to someone else.  I have never been  able to forget that reaction, probably because my instinct also said he was  robbed.  Then again, sometimes records choose you, and who is to question.   In any event, I did recently buy &quot;The Nightfly&quot; and am very happy  I did.  To wait so long to be surprised is a treat.  Of course, I expected  it to not be what I expected, and I was right.  But that has made all the  difference and will keep me playing it.  There is a lot to discover here,  and it takes time to unfold, like a good jazz record.  This explains its  longevity and adds to Fagen's credibility as an artist.  I am also left to  ponder the irony of &quot;Walk Between Raindrops.&quot;  For such a upbeat  number, why do I get teary?
B000031XCR|5.0|As a huge Celine Dion fan, I must say you can't get better than this.  In preparation for her sabbatical, Celine is certainly going out with a BANG on this album.  The 9 greatest hits and 7 new songs are all spectacular!   Her new ballads are truly haunting, while her up-tempo songs stick to your  mind.  You will find yourself learning the new songs quickly as they play  repeatedly throughout your mind.  Certainly done in the best of Celine  style!  This collection should keep Celine from being forgotten during her  hiatus, and supply her fans with new material and old favorites.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I can't believe she is so young to have put out such a complex, lyrical, melodical, talented record. While there are a few songs that sound a lot like the others, on the whole, I'm diggin' the whole thing. I'm picky - and  thrilled to have taken to this one right away!
B00002R0MC|5.0|This has it all and is the best collection of Marley material to date. It came out once and I missed it. Just picked it up, said to myself, &quot;not gonna hesitate if they re-release it&quot; A must have for reggae  enthusiasts.
B000002UUX|5.0|Attention all headbangers!, if you don't already have Rust In Peace in your arsenal (ahem, music collection) then what are you waiting for? You don't know what you're missing. Absolutely skull-splitting metal with  superb production. Buy the CD, stick it in your super state-of-the-art,  megawatt hi-fi system, crank it up full and enjoy!
6302800420|5.0|Well Michael Dorin turns into Dorothy Michaels and winds up a better man for it. So that's the big picture. Along the way there are lots of mini-plots. Like where Jessica Lange tells Dorothy she wishes men were more  forward. So when Michael appears and gives her the line she supposedly  wants, she throws a drink in his face.<br />Great parody of soap operas at the  end.<br />If it was a surefire way to wind up with Jessica Lange, maybe some  time in a dress would be worth it.
B00000DBXL|1.0|After falling completely in love with &quot;Fashion Nugget,&quot; I thought I'd experiment and buy &quot;Motorcade.&quot; After that, it was all over. Cake is hands down one of my favorite bands... right up until  this album. This was terrible execution, abysmal lyrics, it's missing  everything that makes Cake what it is. All my Cake fan friends couldn't  believe this one. BAD JOB GUYS!  TRY HARDER NEXT TIME!
B000002LUB|4.0|If you ever seen Sabbath? If you ever seen Dio? Only one thought comes across,They need to be together!  DEHUMANIZER has a feel all it's own,they will never recapture the originality of HEAVEN&amp;HELL or MOB  RULES,EVER!  When Sabbath got back together with Ozzy for there  reunion.(someone needed some buck's)They blew it!  From the begining of  COMPUTER GOD to the end of TIME MACHINE,This is a rocking cd. This is a  very strong metal cd,and proves just one more time that Tony Iommi is the  riffmaster of the darkness within us all. So if your into(heavy)heavy  metal,get DEHUMANIZER,makes a great x-mas gift too!  But don't look for  HEAVEN&amp;HELL,MOB RULES,part 2 here.just wont find it?  THANK YOU VERY  MUCH!
0425170055|4.0|Couldn't keep myself from the book but thought the author made the characters a little too pro American.  Being pro American isnt too bad, but he portraid them as being very sterotypical military gun-ho type people.   The details Tom Clancy provided were so vivid i got a headache.  It is a  very well writen book and i would recommend it to most.
B00002MZ4W|2.0|I have both albums and adore the first one.  This album on the other hand wasn't that great.  I didn't find myself in love with any of the songs and couldn't even recall one at will.  I think Fiona is much more talented than  what she did on this album.  Better luck next time....
B000002I2M|5.0|great poetry, jim at his best. ray at his best with his jazzy organ sounds, robby and his bottleneck guitar sound great.. and of cource john.. great in L.A. woman.. i am a drummer.. i could never do that!
6305127638|4.0|It seems at times that the Star Trek franchise is getting tired.  The stories are becoming lengthy, (or the pacing is too slow).  Here is a convoluted plot with stock characters.  Unfortunately, the cardboard  cut-outs come from the crew of the Enterprise.  The supporting cast seems  to walk through this story as if they're just as disinterested in the  action on Earth (of past) as we are.  Also, there was no real sense of  imminent danger and an urgent need to get that ship off the ground.  (Which  leads to another issue--how much can a Starfleet Captain break the rules of  the Prime Directive.  It always seems to change with each movie and tv  episode.  Whatever's convenient to give Starfleet the upper hand.)<br />The  real thrill ride comes from what goes on up in the skies on the Enterprise!  The fear and hatred that Picard has for the assimilating Borg is exciting.  Alice Krige is AMAZING as the Borg queen--seductive and grotesque at the  same time.  Who knew?  The meancing Borge gives us the real sense of danger  and suspense, as with each scene they get dangerously close to taking over  the ship and conquering.  Perhaps this contributes to the failure of the  second half of the storyline?  With the great story and plot devices  occurring up in the stars, it's a let down every time the film cuts to the  goings on down on the Earth's surface.  It could be a problem of the  director's (Jonathan Frakes) editing choice, or a problem with the  screenplay.  The viewer gets the feeling that the parallel plot is just an  excuse to get the rest of the actors involved in the movie.<br />In terms of  special effects, this one is amazing.  They just keep getting better and  better.  This is definitely a worth seeing, if not for Alice Krige and her  attempts at seductively taunting Data.
B000002W9Q|5.0|My favorite song is the time of my life.  I loved the dancing in the movie and it made me want to Dirty Dance as well!
6305169187|5.0|For those of us into action movies this is a must for your collection. Not only does it bring together excellent actors,but also the reality that this one day could happen .....and yes..what would you do..? . Those of you who  did not like it....well you must have been asleep.... It has humour some  wonderful moments where you constantly wondering what will happen next..  And yes ...the main character DIES.....how often do you see  that....yes..now your thinking..Hmmmmm. ....Anyway..paid money to see  it...have got it ....will watch it...don't care about those who did not  enjoy it....will send you a Bugs Bunny movies instead ! LOTS OF ACTION  THERE !
6301880447|5.0|This is probably the very best opera production that I have seen on video. This is the Metropolitan Opera at its very best, in my opinion. Overwhelming!
B000021Y7X|5.0|As others have already written, it's a shame that two of the original tracks from the movie have been kept here only as &quot;bonus tracks&quot; (and obviously not remastered for DVD), but the rest of the songs have been  freshened up.  This is the best way to experience the Talking Heads -- as  they themselves point out, their music is very physical in nature, and it  rounds out the whole experience to be able to see them interpreting it  visually as they perform.  Not only is it great to dance to, but my  3-month-old daughter is fascinated by it!
B0000025GW|5.0|It's enigmatic, isn't it?  Suddenly, he writes and performs exclusively Christian material.  Then, just as suddenly, he stops and won't even comment on the whole period.  So what can I say to Bob Dylan for his three  offerings of Christian music--&quot;Slow Train Coming,&quot;  &quot;Saved,&quot; and &quot;Shot of Love&quot;?  Simply this.  Thanks.  I  needed that, and still do.
B00002MZ4W|2.0|I'm one of those that was totally entranced by &quot;Tidal&quot; when it came out; the sensous bad-girl-who-thinks-too-much growling on that cd along with some innovative song-writing made me listen to that cd over and  over. This one didn't exactly jump out at me with anything new. The beats  and harmonies are pretty much standard and the song-writing isn't as  innovatively transcendent. Yet her lyrics are still profoundly wicked and  vulnerable. Still though, without the musical &quot;edge&quot; that Tidal  had , this one just didn't get my cd player repeat performance over and  over...
