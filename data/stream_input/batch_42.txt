B00IU5DYAA|4|People get real bent out of shape when an artist even so much as tweaks their sound. Tiesto is a prime example. This Skrillex album is different to his other work but I dig it. What an awesome musical mind this guy has, and he is not afraid to grow and take chances. Great beats and unexpected music detours that somehow all make sense. Skrillex keeps the good music flowing.
B008TRUDAS|4|Easy read but the story kept you sucked un the whole time...of course you'll root for the underdog and it's so worth it...
B0040T7B2W|5|a great return after 4 years off.  B and S are back to their best. I dont normally write reviews but i just had to for this!     Some of the songs here are classics in particular Come on Sister, I Want the World to Stop and the amazing I'm Not Living in the Real World     I have been a fan for about 8 years and saw them live with an orchestra behind them recently.  It was even better than listening to the album.    Their music is poigniant, soulful and fits any mood.  Not many bands can make you think and want to dance at the same time - these can.    Jump straight in!
B009LQKHIO|5|Great book. I enjoyed reading it and could not put it down until I was finished.  I will certainly continue to read Jill Sanders.
B000JBWWRY|5|I'm so glad we brought Peter Pan.I haven't seen this movie in years. We had our grandson's over, they watched Peter Pan for the first time and loved it..They watched it over and over...So for Easter we got our grandson's Peter Pan DVD, they were so excited.....
B00W6XM002|4|Better than the original
B0093X80VQ|5|This book was awesome, and cool, and exhilarating. I love Roald Dahl books, but Charlie and the great glass elevator was the best
B0028MBKVG|5|Wonderful read - insightful and inspiring. The educational content interwoven with an adventure novel made this a book I couldn't put down.
B00000255F|5|This is the starting point for listening to Bruce Springsteen.  If you don't get it listening to this album, you won't ever get it.  Born to Run is also an essential part of any music listener's collection, and may be the best rock album ever.  It is certainly Springsteen's best.<br /><br />This is a special album, the one you remember vividly where you were and what you were doing the first time you heard it.  The journey starts with Thunder Road -- a simple harmonica underscoring a humble offer to leave the past behind -- and rises to the thundering epic finale of Jungleland.  More than 30 years after its recording, Born to Run continues to evoke new imagery and emotion.
B004P8JPS6|2|I almost cried when the book ended.  Lee Childs has always said that Reacher saw what was coming and left the Army.  He did leave, but the way he left was like a kick in the fanny.  Like he said,  I have a purple heart.  I am assuming it was a honorable seperation, as all the rest of the books say so, but it was sad the way he went. Another impression I had and it does say it on LeeChilds website, that he is blonde, and has artic ice blue eyes.  It is never mentioned in this book.  I liked to read how he looks in each book. I do love him.  I hope there will be a next one tho', I will buy it.  I will probably read the reviews first instead of pre ordering.  Becky Schnaufer
0316228532|5|This story is full of very unlikable people yet characters are so well developed that the reader likes and pities them..good and bad.  There is a dearth of good people herein, and they do shine through the murkiness eventually.  I really loved her  depiction of time and place, as I had never read any Harry Potter stuff, disliking fantasy to the max.  I will read anything else this masterful storyteller writes for adults.
0739316478|4|Grisham is dependable!
B0054JZC6E|5|I really enjoyed this app because you can get 100+games from 1 app! I feel I can safely say this app definitely deserves 5 stars!
B0064MPXFA|5|Love this series! Margulies the actress is outstanding. I am in to the plot, makes you think. And as shows go it is pretty clean.
B00E9PMML2|5|Great Deal! These movies separately would cost you nearly 3x this amount and you get the DVD & Blu-Ray versions.
0525423273|4|I do not want to write a review for Anna and the French Kiss. I do not think I even can write a review for Anna and the French Kiss. Not a proper, professional, eloquent review.    Rather, I want to squeal and keysmash my feelings. Sometimes you find a book that leaves you completely and utterly speechless, and Anna is one of those books.    I had been hearing about Stephanie Perkins's novels for well over a year, and the gushing and raving that were included in every review made me hesitant. I wouldn't call myself a `hipster', per say, but I do tend to gravitate towards books that are less popular, controversial, and even bargain-binned, at times. There's a certain serendipity in finding an unloved book and realizing how much it really deserves to be loved, but after several months of feeling completely out of the loop, I decided to go for it and read a Stephanie Perkins novel, despite their popularity. I was unsure whether or not they were popular for actually being good (a la Harry Potter) or simply because teen girls wanted to pretend they were the main character so they could have her boyfriend (cough Twilight cough). It turns out that Anna and the French Kiss is both.    Anna and the French Kiss stars Anna Oliphant, an aspiring film critic with a bestselling author for a father. Said father decides to send Anna to a boarding school in France, and though she resists at first, Anna soon finds her place in Paris. With a cast of unique characters for friends (Meredith, Rashmi, Josh) and the especially dreamy and original Etienne St. Clair (best friend? boyfriend? first love?), Anna learns what home really means to her.    The first thing I noticed about Anna was that the writing style is beautiful in a very subtle way. The descriptions of Paris were quaint and romantic without being hokey or over-the-top. The characters' voices, too, were extremely original and realistic, and as the book went on, I found myself becoming very attached to the characters. Not only Anna, who is wonderful in her own way, but her friends- specifically Josh- were very likable, and even some of the minor characters, such as Isla, stood out to me distinctly. I was pleasantly surprised at how developed each character was. I felt that they were extremely three dimensional- Anna was a pop-up book where most novels are flat illustrations. It made the book incredibly enjoyable, and I liked that the bond between the characters were realistic as well. I liked that the book showed how relationships take time and effort and communication and often suffer through many misunderstandings. I really liked that Anna and St. Clair were best friends before boyfriend/girlfriend, because too often is the friendship aspect of romantic relationships ignored in chick lit. The characters and the character dynamics in Anna were incredibly refreshing.    Although Stephanie Perkins succeeded in writing interesting characters, she was rather lacking in plot. The book's major twists are predictable. The messages the book sends aren't incredibly progressive. There's a lot of talk about infidelity, and cancer is used as a plot device, and there is teen angst and drama galore. Anna, though she could not be called a Mary Sue because she was well developed and had realistic flaws, did possess some Mary Sue-esque qualities- for example, every boy seems to fall in love with her, and this is something that we see in teen literature far too often. Rarely do normal teen girls have two or three boys pining after them, and it tires me to see this repeated as a plot element over and over again.    Anna and the French Kiss is fun to read and very romantic. I can't help but compare it to First Comes Love, which I reviewed recently as well. First Comes Love is also contemporary romance, but I didn't root for the main characters' relationship at all. Chick lit is never the most exciting, fascinating genre, but Perkins shows that when done right, teen romance can be very fulfilling. Anna is nota perfect book, and it has some very obvious flaws, but it's the kind of book that you'll want to read with a mug of hot chocolate and a snuggly blanket when you're feeling lonely, and it doesn't try to be anything else. For that, I applaud it full-heartedly.    TLDR; Would definitely recommend, to teens who love romance and/or France. :)    More YA book reviews posted at [...]
B0050DIWFC|5|I enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would.  I did not see the end coming
B002VHI8T0|3|I really enjoyed this book as I read it, there were scenes that we're so emotive for many reasons and I really felt for the author.. HOWEVER, on finishing the book, I looked up James Fray and it turns out the story was a lie, he made the entire story up..<br />On face value, it is a good read; but I felt cheated out of the reality I expected it to be..
B000B8QG22|5|One of his best movies.
B000001G53|3|This was my first Parsifal recording and I fell in love with the beautiful voice of Kurt Moll when the Prelude was over. The performance was very good until Dunja Vejzovic's Kundry came in. That and the performance of Peter Hofmann really put me off. At the time I even thought those singers sang coursely. After having bought the Barenboim set did I really start to love this opera. <br />What I also found about this set was that I thought it was boringly conducted at several points in the opera, especially in the first act. Having recordings of Karajan's from 50's, 60's and 70's I think that in his later years he was SO preoccupied with beauty of the score that he forgot about the drama. His Parsifal recording is proof of this.<br />I have tried several times to listen to this set since to make myself think that it was just my mood, or something like that, that was the factor of my initial opinion. But I just seem to lose interest in the middle of the first act, after tolerating the not well sung Parsifal of Peter Hofmann. I just go back to Barenboim set.
B00DURILJ2|4|The actors were very good.  I recognized a lot of the scenery.  A lot of this movie was filmed in my town, and we were all excited about it.  The story was not bad.  I know that boys run around and do a lot of stuff, but those two were pretty young to be out on the river in a small boat.
B008JFURII|5|Loved it as much as the first. Only missed Morgan Freeman, but I guess there's no way to resurrect him.
B0063IH60K|5|This app plays flawlessly on my Kindle Fire. The cards are a good size...as big as feasable on my screen. I have no complaints. There's only the ads that pop up between games but they never occur during play. As good as to be expected for free.
B0042VJ1PI|5|If you like the TV series you will really like the book.  You will be able to spot the characters and envision TV counterparts.  Looking forward to next Castle book.
B0020BUWX2|5|Wow. So good I couldn't even put this down! I didn't want to stop reading. This fast read kept my attention the whole way through. A must read!
B004OKFIYU|5|For whatever reason, there seems to be a group of MFSL haters out there giving all of their recent work poor reviews.  I'm not sure why, but a couple of them also feel the need to cite their equipment to justify their issues.  Okay, fine.  I'll fire back in favor.<br /><br />Firstly, my home is wired for sound.  Before you get any false ideas from that, I'm a music junkie, not an audio snob, but I did make sure my equipment would do the job.  My system is powered by an Audiopro 1200 & a Samson mixer.  The speakers are B & W for what that's worth.  Sorry if that stuff isn't top end enough for some, but I'm no CEO, doctor, lawyer or pro athlete with money to burn, I'm just a guy who loves music.<br /><br />Now that I've dispensed with that, I've owned Piano Man on vinyl & CD before & this version is flat out, no contest the best.  I hear depth, music & layers that I've never heard before on the entire CD.  The clarity has got to be heard to be believed.  It truly sounds as though the band is right there in the room with me.  It has made some of the songs I wasn't as keen on before sound as good to me as my favorite songs on the CD, which are the title cut, of course, Ballad of Billy the Kid, If I Only Had the Words to Tell You, & Captain Jack.  Travelin' Prayer jumps out with new life & bounce with all the new sounds I hear.  You're My Home has greater & more depth of feeling with the clarity & depth from the sound.  Worst Comes to Worst sounds like a totally different song, with the pop & reggae sounds interspersed like never before.  If it's possible, it makes the song even more lively & dancable than before.  As for the above named songs that are my long-time favorites on the CD, well, let's just say I love them now more than ever before!  Bottom line, you cannot go wrong buying this version of Piano Man, I don't care what anyone tries to tell you.  Even on a regular CD player, the sound just can't be topped.  I can only imagine what a SACD player would do for it!<br /><br />I know what I say may or may not influence anyone to buy this CD.  If the extra money, or bad reviews are too off-putting for you, then your mind may be made up already.  However, if you are on the fence about buying this, do yourself a huge favor, especially if you are a Billy Joel fan, or just a fan of this CD:  Be good to yourself.  Buy yourself a present & get this CD.  You will not be disappointed, it's well worth the extra money.say may or may not influence anyone to buy this CD.

B00BHU9DUK|1|i couldnt even finish this movie it was horable. boring. annoying. she needs to eat some food she looks like she is going to die
6305718954|5|I saw this movie in the theater and loved it. Naturally, I bought the DVD, but I noticed that the DVD doesn't have the english subtitles that the theatrical presenation had. I get french subtitles... annoying! I've  selected &quot;none&quot; under subtitles thinking that it would just put  english subtitles for the few scenes that needed it...
B00PTB7B34|4|Very addicting game can't stop playing
B009QU9X44|5|This book has truly been a wonderful experience for me. As an Afro Caribbean woman, Ms. Adichi treats with themes that are so familiar, so much a part of my experience.....that thirst to make a better life in the U.S., and the pain and disappointment that that often brings. Then there is the intensity of high school relationships which endure over time and space. The book is so beautifully written, that I will borrow a turn of phrase of one of the main characters, Obinze, and say \\"This is poetry\\".
B000AOEMXM|1|Star Trek needs to learn to move forward not backwards. I couldn't stand Enterprise. I think this series was a waste of time.
B00M7UTFW0|3|Not a great movie nor a bad one either
B00OKYQZDI|2|Keep having to delete and then reload it on my tablet., because all the sudden it will start to load and then the screen goes black or it goes to where I have the game placed on my tablet. Never had this problem with my other tablet. Almost ready to just leave it off, even though I do like the game.
B00E8KLWB4|1|I tried to get this for my kendle fire HD. After I download it I got a message saying I needed to download more information.  And after a 9 hours it still was not completely downloaded so I uninstalled to bad to it looked like a fun game.
B000HBKCDC|5|Too long have I waited for a Christmas album from this glorious artist. Her voice and the production of her music is well suited for this kind of sound.<br /><br />One thing great about Sarah's music is that I often find myself so anxious for the entire thing that sitting through one track is nearly unbareable. And not because the track is unbareable at all, but because I'm just so yearning for more no matter what. Her music is simply beautiful in every sense of the word. And I feel that Mrs. McLachlan captures the spirit of the season better than anyone since the days of the Rat Pack.<br /><br />Some may argue that this album is too sad for the Christmas season, but if you dig deeper, the music is not about the sadness but the comfort. These songs are very comforting during a season that to some is depressing. I recently lost my grandmother. She was an amazing woman who loved her family and Christmas as well. In fact, we had a Christmas tradition where she would come to our house on Christmas Eve and my sister and I would open our gifts. And this will be my first Christmas without that and I am fearful of it. But this album is making it easier for me, to get rid of the anxiety now and to find the comfort in the season.<br /><br />My favorite songs are \\"River,\\" \\"Song For A Winter's Night,\\" \\"In the Bleak Mid-Winter,\\" and \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas.\\" Each song is wonderful, though. And each person will undoubtedly find their own favorite that will easily relate to their comfort. I would have loved a cover of \\"Somewhere In My Memory,\\" but we can't always get what we want.<br /><br />Concluding, if you're a fan of Sarah McLachlan, Christmas music or just beautiful music period, make sure this album is in your collection. The only negative is that at the end you'll be begging for more.
0545615402|3|it's not about the product, it is about the gift option. i didn't saw my specification fulfilled, i mean, the letter didn't arrived with the product
B00C7TAF3Y|5|I truly enjoyed this game. There were some points that made you stop and think of how am I going to do this next part. Lots of fun and would play it over and over again. I just wish there were more chapters to it because it ended way to soon.
B00F35B8F8|4|Has a very nice drama for who knows the direction of the role in the movie
B004J1DBJI|5|I loved it.
B0044IABFS|3|While it is still enjoyable it lacks the suspense and drama of the previous seasons. I have only 2 more episodes to watch. I have watched all of the previous seasons within the past month. It was so good I couldn't stop.
B007REV4YI|5|Muy buena peli con giros inesperados en un james bond!!! ademas la puedo agregar a la edición de los 50 años y uqe en la caja hay lugar para ella...
B00CNQ7HAU|3|Sycamore Row was an easy read, lawyers courts and the like. I kept waiting for the adventure or ,mystery to begin Didn't happen.
B00H7KJTCG|5|Excellent Movie! Highly reccomend
B000VDDWDS|5|This is one of many of Russell Crowe's great movies. I saw it on sale for 5$ and I could not pass up on this great movie. From beginning to end the movie is very entertaining and you will not regret this purchase. This is a must have in your bluray collection
0440219078|5|I'd heard this book was good but the plot sounded strange and confusing so I picked it up with caution. Within the first couple of pages however, I fell in love with this book! The characters are great, and the book really  makes you think. There are sad parts and the ending leaves the reader to  make up the end for themselves. If you haven't read it already, do so now!
B005ZUR724|1|works great loved it played for hours. Game as to update and will not and cant play it. Up unroll it as for update great game. No way to update game uninstalled game rejbstalle game nothing. Glad I only.pains 99 cents very little money lost. Game will not work asking for update cant not update.
B000SEI230|5|I love the passion between landon and Jamie and his dedication to her in such short notice I just wish she could have lived to be with him
B001OQCV6A|3|The first time I saw this movie, was from a pirated copy. The story line, and action of Robert Downy Jr. is typical Downy Jr., but a far cry different then originals starring Rathbone and Bruce. I bought this copy as an legit copy but I'd rather stick with the old classics.
B00NWLIW0E|5|5 stars.
B005ZB91KY|4|after listening to Jimmy Buffet song, I realized I had not seen the movie.  Glad the comic books made it to the movies this way.
0810983915|5|My 9 yr. old grandson has read all of his books and always can't wait for the next one. I informed him yesterday that the movie is coming out April 2, 2010 and he actually jumped off the couch and was screaming Yes, Yes, Yes!  He wrote down the date and stuck it on the refrigerator so he won't forget! If you want your child to enjoy reading, I recommend all of these books highly!
B005PK57IK|5|Great show.  Interesting characters, intriguing plot
B00P42WROG|5|Once again Mr. King has proven what a fantastic storyteller he is, he is able to be into the minds of kids like no one else. A great story and a quick and easy read, each and every word.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|WONDERFULL!!!!!!!!!!! Great game, lots of interesting levels also music that blows your mind. so much to do. the only thing is more levels other wise GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!
B008FYZIVY|2|Once I watched the first season on Netflix, I was excited to purchase and view the first season again after seeing that I could see the &#34;Original UK Version&#34; which means...nothing. It's exactly the same thing unless there is something I'm not understanding about the DVDs. I can't imagine what that is. Anyway, I'm pretty upset, especially since the &#34;Original UK Version&#34; is exactly the same thing as what was on Netflix. After reading the DVD packaging, I'm assuming the Original UK version means it has added &#34;special features&#34;? I would like to know what the &#34;Original UK Version&#34; means. I'm not kidding. I really want to know.
B005DNPKSQ|5|The Truman Show is a must watch movie. It is not a typical Jim Carrey goofy movie, but one that is quite emotional. It is very unique.<br />My experience with this through Amazon Digital was decent. There were a few times during the movie where there was a slight pause for buffering (I guess). Other than that, the quality was good.
B00DQR26EC|5|I've played through what I can tell to be the entire story, collecting just about everything. I can say that this is a very fun game. It's like if someone were to take the D&D universe, mix in a little DBZ and made it play like Final Fantasy. The game is very long, will keep you going for days with lots of new and interesting things always happening along the way. If you like Turn based combat JRPGs, you can't go wrong here.
0151008116|5|This book is one huge adventure into the life of seeking out. Not at all what it outwardly conveys, the theme is in fact our journey, what most people search out. Tells tales of who we are through characters other than humans. <br />Pi's life is changed in a ship sinking.<br />The ship wreck, reveals our first dive into life, the mix we suddenly become aware of and how we would like to meld in. The dive in can't be manipulated, however we can choose many different routes, even almost to the point of ignoring the journey we are on, a form of spiritual blindness is revealed.<br />We all seem to carry these thoughts around with us all our lives. this book offers real portals which a reader can take great advantage of.<br />As  far as writing style and editing, the book flows amazingly well, there are no characters or events in the book that can be forgotten or confused with, very clear throughout.<br />I have to say this is one of the most intelligent themes I have ever been able to comprehend, a similar book which should be read in conjunction with this is SB or God
0385504209|5|In the same vein as Clive Cussler, Dan Brown has found a way to make history and suspense intertwine.  Yet where Cussler often uses legend, Brown uses mostly facts.  This book is not only a good old fashioned pager turner that you won't be able to put down, but it is worth buying just for the information on PHI, known since the Enlightenment at &quot;The Divine Proportion&quot;.  Read this book.
B007V2UGPE|5|as soon as you start playing you wont stop. good graphics and gameplay! earn coins to upgrade units, weapons, and character.
B00005JOFQ|5|21st Century Film Industry probably witnessed a movie that has so much contraversy, and still survived in the minds of the critics. <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain reveals a side of America that is not so tolerant, despite our values over basic human rights. Still, this movie moved every one of its viewers, and taught all of us to become more accepting. This movie also taught us to cherish true love, which can be seen even between these two cowboys.
B007PT1PEY|5|A definite purchase for all Sherlock Holmes fans.  I like having it on my Kindle to read when I want.  Good short stories.
B00ANA27IU|5|Great book, hard SciFi, thought provoking story and good speculation on how the next stage in human evolution could be, what could mean (or be) God, self enlightenment, our origins, the immortality...<br /><br />I actually had to read the final part more than once and I even went on the web and read some explanations, but in the end I finally got the meaning or better saying, could came up with my own understanding of it!<br /><br />In short, a must read for science fiction fans and also a good option for the ones not so much into it.<br /><br />For me now, the next stage is: &#34;2010: Odyssey Two&#34;.
B002GQMA4A|5|Can't beat the classics!
B008K6HN8I|5|it works well, however I had to order a starter wizard software , go to UGR.com . order acronis true image 2014 for $25, and either down load or get a disk. to install,. This is for a  two UCB port computer. the external drive works great with this USB2 software.
B00867HDTA|5|This game is a Very fun game.  I love flick golf, but so far this js better.  Way to go
B005LZSJ66|5|Following along with kasabian tradition, this is yet another excellent production which houses a unique feel but a familiar beat. It's great for both background music as well as analytical focused listening.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Good story with drama and intrigue. The acting is fantastic and they make the characters very real. The only negative would be if you don't like a lot of blood and fighting this might not be the show for you.
0545123283|4|Overall, it was a good read. I feel like I spent a lot of time in the middle just following everyone through their lives waiting for something to happen but after reading the ending I see why a lot of that was necessary (and it did have a good ending, though there will be a third book now).<br /><br />At first I thought having 4 different people narrating (Sam, Grace, Isabel, and new character Cole) would be confusing, but it actually ended up working out really well.<br /><br />What I didn't like was that the bulk of the story had a HUGE flaw. I won't say what it is, because it will ruin the entire book, but the logic at the end doesn't take into account the time that Shelby broke into Grace's house in Shiver. That, to me, says that the author didn't quite know her story as well as she should have.<br /><br />I'd recommend this as a light read to anyone wanting to continue on with Shiver, but if you're looking for excitement or a book that is really hard to put down, this series may not be for you.
0316066524|2|A lot of hype about the untimely suicide of this promising author, but getting through the stream of consciousness text is very difficult. I'd recommend it only for the really die hard (no pun intended).
B00LDNE3FG|4|Just wish you could start again where you die instead of all the way back at the beginning.
B000NVI1IO|5|GOOD
B003UESJFG|4|Seriously, this film was not bad, but it didn't quite make the \\"great\\" category, either. It is the story of a supervillain, Megamind, who, finally, defeats his nemesis. This one had a lot of potential, setting up the supervillain-superhero epic conflict well, in a humorous manner (funny, at least, in a culture that has suffered through countless superhero stories, few of which have ever been worthy of a second glance)...and then...well, then what? Outrageous can be good, and worked to carry the beginning of the movie...but there has to be more...outrageous has to morph into genuinely funny, and not just because it plays outlandishly off of something that the audience is already familiar with, at some point. Megamind didn't really do this. Certainly, there were a few funny jokes (feeling mulonKULy, anyone?), but it relied too much on \\"see how crazy this is?\\" and too little on actual puns. Also, very little time was allotted to showing us how Megamind actually became bored with his victory (one of the pivotal pieces of the story)...one minute, he's victoriously looting the city, destroying fire trucks, and whatnot...and the next he's having a heart-to-heart with a plastic desk toy. Uhhh, did I miss something there?<br /><br />All of that said, there were moments that were better than others...like, the way the new villain figures out that he's battling Megamind during the final fight scene...and, the film is visually appealing, so kids will no doubt find it fascinating. If you're looking for something mildly amusing in the superhero/supervillain genre, this film will not waste your time. It's not quite on the same level of \\"Despicable Me\\", but it's heads and shoulders above \\"The Incredibles\\". 3.5/5 stars
B0043WHRWA|5|Shows are great as ever.
B00OKYQZDI|4|Fun to play.
B0007TKNII|5|Beautiful performances by all of the lead characters.  Romance sweeps you away with this intentional melodramatic musical.  Beautiful, handsome, sexy... the leads have it all and will take you with them into their fantasy world.
B00594XOZU|2|Kik was great! All my friends had it and we all texted all the time! You could get add-ons and everything!<br />It's amazing...................................but soon we all started getting hacked and found out that this app has had hackers and they are trying to find out our personal information....... I suggest to get this app IF you want to get hurt or kidnapped....... and If you have the app then delete it, that's what I did.<br /><br />After this terrible news you may want to know a GREAT texting app: !it's called text now and it's free!!
B004JN1D2I|4|The writer has a wild imagination of unthinkable brutality that humans can be capable of. Sometimes it's not easy to know how to react, laugh or feel sick! Story can get a little to detailed, you either have to carry on reading or jump several pages ahead to get back to the main story.<br />Overall, its an entertaining story about time and people that never existed.

0307959473|5|I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the background of what decisions were made and why they were made during the Gates era as Secretary of Defense. I gave this book five stars because Gates gives an honest look at why he did what he did. He even tells the truth about the US Air Force and his dissatisfaction with what they were doing. Of course he probably should have done more to fix the structure of the Air Force he does give valuable insight into the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Gates points out the problems with Congress and it's very Interesting to hear from someone who worked under two very different presidents. I really enjoyed this book and its well written.
B000001E18|5|If you want to know what the future is like in a large European city like, say,,,,, Prague.... Put Zooropa in your CD player.  That's what it feels like.  Can I finish?  Can I finish?  Ok.  I'm Finished.
B004RCUJ9E|5|I did play a couple of games before I rated it  and it works just fine.  Seems like pretty straightforward checkers to be.  I wouldn't have paid $2 for it, but it's good for a free app.  And just to join my voice to the chorus....NOT CHESS, like the idiot who wrote the first review believed.
B00J1IQUYM|5|Very talented writer, the story grips you and ending left me wondering and questioning.
B00JGCIMKI|5|Great stuff here by Syd Barrett.
B000FZETKC|5|Best of the 80's
B001PPLIEG|5|Daniel Craig is a stud and one to dream about.  This is so action packed that you cannot turn your head because you will miss something important. I would recommend this to anyone who likes action-packed movies and a stud to dream about.
B008MEM24S|5|A Fun way to waste time time. Worth the .99 Watch your battery tho:-( if your not where you can charge it up.
B001FB55MG|5|I got this for my 3 year old granddaughter, she loves it.
B004SIPAJG|5|I've always enjoyed this film no matter how many tiiI watch it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|One of best books that I have read.  It kept me so enthralled and could not put it down.  Wanted to read, read, read.  I buying hard cover for my Mother.  These are her kind of books.
B00EMXBDMA|4|I was surprised by some of the bad reviews because I enjoyed this book and even thought about it afterwards. It kept my attention, layed the story out in an interesting way, the characters were engaging, and it made me laugh out loud while I was reading. There was swearing in it, but I didn't find it excessive.
B00BFUUMO8|5|I have two sons, ages 6 and 8. Downloaded this for the 6yr old and he can't stop playing the game. Now the 8yr old wants it on his android tablet too.  No more fighting, horseplay, or bickering...because they both are entertained, albeit in moderation, of course, with the Jurassic Park Builder.
B00G5G7EXY|5|My daughter's FAVORITE movie!! On constant replay in our house.
0143034901|4|It seems as if nearly every quote on this book references Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  I've only read One Hundred Years of Solitude but I agree...this book does have distinct similarities.  The lushness of the prose, the larger than life characters, the background sense of  a fairy tale that makes the reader sure that at some point s/he read the words \\"Once Upon a Time\\"...<br /><br />But I detected the whiff of musty rotting lace even stronger than that.  Dickens's Great Expectations seemed to me a much closer relative to \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\".  The sense of the past being relived in the future, the idea that the young characters whose lives are ostensibly the focus of the book being only the newer versions of those who have gone before them...not to mention the constant theme of forbidden love.<br /><br />This book in all senses is a book about time gone by.  It is about passions that are larger than life, all consuming hatred, soul destroying despair.  Nothing is small; no character is simply a bystander, no event without meaning.  The writing drips with color without being too flowery, the words evoke one's senses while still allowing the reader to bring his/her own imagination to the table.  One feels as if this is a story that has always existed, has always been played out...I could almost feel the dust on the book jacket of my brand new copy of this novel.<br /><br />I appreciate, too, the underlying theme of the love of books, of words.  When one encounters \\"The Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\", I felt my hands itching to go there, to see the shelves and shelves of treasures. Books and the power of their words come up again and again, which is an idea I can certainly appreciate.<br /><br />\\"Once, in my father's bookstore, I heard a regular customer say that few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.  Those first images, the echo of words we think we have left behind, accompany us throughout our lives and sculpt a place in our memory to which, sooner or later - no matter how many books we read, how many worlds we discover, or how much we learn or forget - we will return.\\"<br /><br />While being an engrossing story that kept me turning the pages more than taking notes, the story, whose main timeline takes place in Barcelona in 1955, offers a few very prescient views of the future:<br /><br />\\"Television, my dear Daniel, is the Antichrist, and I can assure you that after only three or four generations, people will no longer even know how to fart on their own and humans will return to living in caves, to medieval savagery, and to the general state of imbecility that slugs overcame back in the Pleistocene era.  Our world will not die as a result of the bomb, as the papers say, it will die of laughter, of banality, of making a joke of everything, and a lousy joke at that.\\"<br /><br />(As a side note, the author does pull one of those plot tricks that I am VERY dubious about.  One of those, \\"In seven days time, SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT WILL HAPPEN\\" warnings.  As an avid reader of Stephen King, I have become very wary of those dire predictions...and I still haven't made up my mind whether they improve or harm the flow of the story, though I am leaning towards harm.)<br /><br />The sense of history repeating itself comes up not only in the lives of the characters but in references to the world in general.  \\"Nothing feeds forgetfulness better than war, Daniel.  We all keep quiet and the try and convince us that what we've seen, what we've done, what we've learned about ourselves and about others, is an illusion, a passing nightmare. Wars have no memory, and nobody has the courage to understand them until there are no voices left to tell what happened, until the moment comes when we no longer recognize them and they return, with another face and another name, to devour what they left behind.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" was a wonderful book to curl up with these past few days.  I liked getting to enjoy damsels in distress, mysterious figures in the shadows, deathbed confessions, duels at dawn, the constant struggle of love trying to overcome hate...and an actual villain with no redeeming qualities.  So often the books that I read, because they are generally based in reality, examine all of the shades of grey that make up human beings.  I'd forgotten what an escape it is to very easily identify the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys.\\"<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've read a book with a scene like this that I could enjoy instead of rolling my eyes, \\"When I peered into the corridor, I could already hear the footsteps below, near the staircase.  I recognized the spidery shadow on the walls, the black raincoat, the hat pulled down like a hood, and the gun in his hand shining like a scythe.  Fumero.  He had always reminded me of someone, or something, but until then I hadn't understood what.\\"<br /><br />You can just smell the musty odors, see the dripping candle wax, feel the mysterious breeze go past your face, can't you?<br /><br />This book gives one the sense of a guilty pleasure without giving any reason to feel guilty.

B008AK8FHM|5|Disclaimer from me:  There is only one way to Heaven and that is God's Son, Jesus.  It is with that in mind I offer this criticism: I don't completely trust this account as he could have been fooled by Evil Forces, there is only one name given where under man can be saved, the man:  Christ Jesus. So weigh this in your own mind.  I find that extremely troubling that Jesus is basically omitted in this account.  However, I did enjoy the book.<br /><br />Written by a distinguished brain surgeon, this book and the details of his own near death experience, carry more weight with me as he explains the physiology of the brain and what is and is not possible, according to scientific logic.  It is his personal experience and he explains what happened to him very well, at least as good as you can using mere words.  Many things he experienced were outside his ability to fully do justice in describing the experience.  Yet, he saw things he shouldn't have been able to with remarkable clarity, given the fact that his brain was totally flat-lined, as he tells later after examining the data.  This indicates that there is a spiritual essence to people that science does not and cannot acknowledge or understand.  Many people already know this, but it is validating to have a good first person account from a highly trained and skilled scientific medical mind given from their own experience.  I found it to be uplifting, powerful and a great read.  I would treat it as fiction however.
B005ZOBNOI|3|Oh the hype... I finally gave in. I've read worse, but I've certainly read better. I guess there were moments that my eyes got misty, although that happens to me when I read certain gift cards... so take that for what it is.
B008BQ8VOC|5|I can't wait for the nest episode.<br />The twists and turns are great, tough guys show a soft side. The cases carry into the nest episode keeping you interested.
B00FB13Y74|5|This game is so cool I beat it already I wonder who the new bird/pig will be and the last review was 2 years ago
B0054JZC6E|5|its fun and competitive. my 3 year old plays these games too and loves it. its impossible to get bored playing these games
B00CWY76CC|5|I enjoyed this. It wasn't so hard, just had to think though. I really enjoyed. Can't wait for more levels.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Incredible series.  Sanderson is becoming one of the greatest fantasy writers of all time.  I hope he writes the rest of these as quickly as possible and not stall like George martin!!
B0000029GA|3|Yes Nas' lyricsm on the album is very thought provoking and advanced for 94 but the production just flat out sucks. This album is overhyped. Most of the people who gave it 5 stars on here never heard of Illmatic until Stilmatic came out. The album is too short and the produciton is terrible. There are about 5 solid songs on it but the rest is just garbage. Black Moon-Enta Da Stage is a much better album for the time. Go buy that before you get Illmatic. Illmatic is a pretty good album but it doesnt deserve the five that it got in the Source. Its generally just overhyped. On NAs' part the Album is a 5 but the production is a 2.
B007IXWL2C|5|Like this book the best as it had a lot to it besides the sex which the author seemed to like writing about.  The sex always struck me as a little tooooo much
B009EE6WXC|5|One of the best ever. Based on true story. Classic actng and direction.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Read every word in under 6 hours!! Totally devoured this book!! I LOVE IT! It really is written from a teen angst perspective.
B005C8ENI0|1|I found it very boring. How could anyone  include &#34;Lincoln&#34; in the title of this boring movie - was it to intentionally to mislead?
B0058VW36U|5|This game is very addictive. It has great graphics and is very smooth! I definitely would recommend this game to anyone!
0671042858|5|A simply wonderful book!  Very suspenseful, and impossible to put down.  King made the reader feel as if we were in the woods with Tricia, with vivid descriptions and realistic terror.  I especially liked the realism this book offers.  This story could actually happen exactly as written.  The ending is great.  I would highly recommend this book.
B0083Z614S|5|I'd seen the movie once or revival I figured being the book worm I am instead the book. I devoured it in 2 days. A must read!!
B004CURZFC|5|GREAT MOVIE
B00IYAG7DM|5|What hell going on I can not play my game the last two day and loss me off. I really like this game it fun and just got my game right were I like it.<br />Please get up running again. I really  want to play my game again. So do something about because it really cool game to play. Why do have go throw this all time.
B002CMQS1O|5|I taught a heavy metal unit in Sociology, and I showed this and had the students list the elements of metal being mocked in this mockumentary. My students loved it, and the movie is good enough and detailed enough, I didn't mind watching it with the three sections I teach. &quot;Goes to eleven&quot; and the Stonehenge stage set broght down the house every time I showed it. Classic!
0440178002|5|Yesterday, I finished Shogun. Today, I just purchased a tour package to Kyoto and Osaka, Japan for my wife and myself. It's that good.
B000002KO3|5|This is one of those &#34;desert island&#34; albums for me, so when it got destroyed I was heartbroken. This product was delivered before the estimated time and is high quality.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Flappy  wings is fun but hard you'll get the hang of it I just got it and it is awesome
B000ZHBB0Q|5|Husband had never seen it. Well, that was just unacceptable! Situation rectified! Of course, he loved it too. How could he not?
B001DF68MA|5|I love this product it exceeded my expectation, was super easy to install, the quality is very high and its very sturdy, my daughter love sitting in it the padding is very comfortable for her, I highly recommend it, I also prefer the position its placed on the bicycle in my opinion its better than having her sit at the back end of the bike.
B000FC1KGG|5|Took me away from all my problems and isn't that what we really want from a story.  I didn't stop until I had read the whole thing.  Highly recommend this story.
B003XF1XOQ|4|I thoroughly enjoyed this last book of this trilogy. The characters were really fleshed out here, and I found the plot to be fast-paced and exciting. I was pretty sure where it was all headed so there wasn't a lot of suspense, but getting there was fun, with enough twists and turns along the way to keep things interesting. I don't often read books more than once, but this trilogy might be added to those few that I do.
B007SGLZP8|5|Classic Grisham.
B000002KMY|4|Perhaps the pressure was too great for our heroes to follow up on Heaven and Hell with another masterpiece, so instead they put out Mob Rules, a respectable though hardly life-changing release.  Perhaps Dio was right  when in an interview it was like the band was trying to repeat what worked;  they never stoop to self-parody, but the disc never quite touches the soul  the way its predecessor does.  &quot;Turn Up The Night&quot; is like  &quot;Son of Neon Knights,&quot; and we can make other comparisons, but  Vinnie Appice sounds right at home, Tony's solo in &quot;Over and  Over&quot; is one of his best ever, and the bass lines are (as usual) just  mind-blowing.  Get it.
B004ZJZPXO|5|The series was as compelling as this movie. Great writing and directing. If only they had continued on with the T.V. series.
B004SJ3BCI|5|great game hours of fun. It keeps my girls ocupide while and quiet. loved it and will recomend to all i know
B00CNQ7HAU|4|I enjoyed the entire book but just felt that the story ended too quickly.  I felt that all of a sudden it was over and I wanted a bit more explanation of the wind up of the case and characters.
B005804N4Q|3|Keep in mind that my review is for the Japan import SACD version of this album.  I bought this based on rave reviews by others, but I find the sound quality to be rather anemic...in fact, it is nothing more than a clone of the DVD-Audio version, as they sound the same.  Even the art for the case is the same.  Seeing this was recorded on an earlier digital system, there is no advantage to releasing this as a DSD title.  (Playback is through the Oppo BDP-105.)<br /><br />Musically, though, this album has been a desert island disc for me since the day it was released.  And there are plenty of reviews here on Amazon about the music.  Truly one of the high points of Fagen's career!  I just wish this others hadn't led me down the wrong path on this SACD.  For others who never had a chance to get the DVD-Audio version, I'd recommend getting this, and soon, before it goes out of print. Otherwise, you'll gain nothing by owning this over the DVD-Audio version.
B000002H2Z|5|This has so many great songs! I remember when I saw The Cure live a couple of years ago and didn't know a single song, when I heard 'Push' from 'The Head On The Door', I was like &quot;Wow, that is SO good!&quot;. Then I bought the album and discovered little jewels like 'Six Different Ways', 'Close To Me', 'A Night Like This' and also 'Sinking'. My boyfriend is mad about 'The Head On The Door' and he was not a Cure fan when I met him. So this album is very accessible, more than their early albums. From A to Z you won't be bored a second with 'The Head On The Door'!
B0087JTAKW|4|I started reading this book and while it was easily readable I struggled with whether I enjoyed the book or not.....I kept reading because I wanted to know how this all fell together in the end. I really enjoyed the ending and it was worth reading in the end.
B00991TCOG|5|I thought it was very well made and it was a great composer on the true greatness of the violin
B002SAUCBC|5|Come on get your walking shoes on and join me as we walk. The journey will be worth it. To learn about how far you can go and not lose yourself. So real and yet didn't want it to end.
B003V5CFV8|4|was good and had some moments. brought some comedy and gave an insight to what life was like during the depression era. would recomment it to others to watch
B0002Z1EG2|5|Excellent compilation of Shania's most popular hits from The Woman and Me, Come on Over, and Up! albums.  PLUS 3 new terrific songs.  A must have for any Shania fan and for anyone interested in finding out about Shania!
B00JQHON74|5|I just saw the band in concert and they played two tracks from this, their latest work -  Believe Again, and The Game, and I really liked them live.  Thus I decided to try the album and I love it.  Please know that Tales from Topographic Oceans is my all time favorite Yes recording.  That said, I fully get why musicians of this calibre and diversity desire to stretch and try different musical forms and directions as they move forward.  I can feel and hear the Yes spirit throughout this recording, and  it is now at the top of my playlist for the foreseeable future.
B0054JZC6E|5|A lot of fun<br />We enjoy the variety.it gives us each something to play and if you get bored you can change games and still keep your points
B009C7JS14|5|Best weather app out there. Wouldn't it be neat if they added more features or an advanced version where you could see what's behind the scenes? But at that point you're a meteorologist buff, and it's your job anyway...
1444737112|5|I really enjoyed this book,especially his picture. He has a lot of character which many cats do.<br />Do you want my name?<br />It's Janet Kohler
B002MQYOFW|5|Amazing book could not put it down once. Of course it's better then the big screen version. It's a must read
630179513X|5|The three films have to be watched one after the other. They are a whole. They are first of all and above all a marvellous piece of entertainment with two elements that come back as salient characteristics. First Biff and his transformation in time according to various accidents in the time line. A bully remains a bully even when circumstances tame him slightly. The second is a reference to Clint Eastwood in the funniest possible way. It is crucial in the end, but you have to discover the twist. The first film's trip to the past is kind of pulpy because it is an intervention in the parents life, when they are teenagers and the question is how can the son help the parents get together and become the progenitors the son needs to exist. A trip into the past that changes slightly the present, but with no serious consequences. The second film is heftier in that sense that a trip to the future causes a twist in the time line that requires a new trip to the past to correct the twist. Funny because the three time periods are mixing in the most hilarious way. The third film is for pleasure. It is about the retrieving party that is supposed to bring Doc back to the present from his very distant nineteenth century past. He will not come back, except for a visit later on. The time machine will also be destroyed and things will come back to normal, except maybe for Doc Emmet Brown, but he likes the change.<br />This film deals with time, the present, the past and the future and beyond the entertaining aspect it is deeply reflexive. First, time must not be changed in anyway without tremendous consequences. We must not play with time. Second, the travels in the past show how things have changed from one period to the next, from the past, no matter which, to the present. Some of the questions are serious, like the future of black people in 1955. The answer is in 1985. Just as serious is the fate or future of bullies if by any chance they get power, that is to say money. We must stand our ground in front of them to keep them in their place, the margins of society, a tolerated existence and not a dominant position. Just as serious is also the question about heredity : one generation always reproduces what the previous generation has done. A bully has to be born from a family of bullies even if circumstances can guide the realisation of this bully-ness. Then the position of science in our society is extremely fragile because it may disturb the flux of history with some unforeseen and unforeseeable invention that is the result of some crazy imagination in some mad scientist. We must both trust and question science in our society. The films are optimistic provided science is kept in its place, that is to say the margin of history, otherwise catastrophes can occur. Finally, travelling in time is funny and the stories of such travels have to be hilarious and the films are superb.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUnd our ground in front of them to keep them in their place, the margins of society, a tolerated existence and not a dominant position.

B000QRIGLC|5|Excellent depiction of a horrible american tragedy and the courage expressed by one of Americas elite war fighters. Thank you.
B000FGGE68|5|Milla Jovovich is superb in this action si - fi movie the coloring is great very much worth seeing the eye candy and the effects
B0092D1V5Y|5|Which is nothing!  Read the 1 star reviews and the description and I had to laugh and try this app. Yes, clearly says pretend to hack a system....and it sure does.  Cheap thrills for one or two sessions, then DELETE.
B000002H33|5|yeah, score!  this CD is beast!  its the best mtallica album out there, thought its like 13 years old!  buy you wont regret it!
B001F2W4Y2|4|There are some real gems on this album,like: \\"Rock N' Roll Train\\", \\"Big Jack\\", and \\"Rock N' Roll Dream\\". If AC/DC were ever to release a Greatest Hits ablum, then the aforementioned tracks would have to be on it. Also good are \\"Smash N' Grab\\", \\"Spolin' for a Fight\\", \\"Wheels\\", and \\"Money Made\\". \\"War Machine\\" is starting to grow on me. The remaining tracks, \\"Skies on Fire\\", \\"Anything Goes\\", \\"Decible\\", \\"Stormy May Day\\", \\"She Likes Rock N' Roll\\", \\"Rocking All the Way\\", are fine, but just don't hook me like the others. And then there's the title track, \\"Black Ice\\", which I can't even listen to; which is, in my opinion, just a filler-track. All in all, though, I like the ablum: it's musically more adventurous than their last two albums and yet still has that classic AC/DC sound and groove.
0385474547|4|I read this book as part of an assignment for a cultural diversity course, and it really makes you think about the spread of Christianity and non-Christian religion.  The title is very fitting, as you read, you see the life of the main character fall apart, no matter what he tries to do.  It is also an excellent view into tribal African culture.  Very easy to read, and not too long!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I recemend that all the flalfy bird fans. this game is so awesome I won't stop playing on it...<br /><br />@@@@@lololololololololol.
0553296981|5|Although I read this originally in seventh grade English class, re-reading this as an adult was even more moving. When I was twelve I didn't know what words like 'Gestapo' meant or 'The Third Reich'...in fact, I hadn't grasped the magnitude of The Holocaust until I was much older. There were so many ways that at twelve-years-old I could connect with Anne Frank, but as an adult (although the same pre-teen connections were there),  my perception of who Anne Frank was changed drastically. I had been fascinated by her diary since I was twelve, and visited The Secret Annex in The Netherlands twice in an eighteen-month span. I strongly recommend to anyone who had a fascination with Anne Frank when they were younger, to read it again as an adult.
B00CWQ5Y3S|1|Don't use it much
B0050DIWFC|4|Great read.  Start to finish.
B005LAIIMG|5|Best Zombie movie ever.
B000F0UV0E|5|This album has come to be one of my favorites(listening to it as I type this).  Already being a huge Dire Straits fan, I came across Mark one night during health class thanks to one of my fellow classmates.  I love Marks voice, its a mix of masculinity and softness.  Pair that with Emmylous feminine vocals and the combination is a winner.  This album is great because you can get the sense that the songs written really mean something to both Mark and Emmylou.  I am really glad that my fellow classmate told me about Mark because it gave us something to talk about and I have come to really enjoy his music.
B00BD99JMW|3|I loved the first two books in the series, but this one kind of drug along for me. However, I am glad I continued to read it because the ending was great!
B00957T6X6|5|Fantastic Series - Fantastic Price!
B00005JKQZ|5|A Beautiful Mind is one of the most amazing and intriguing films that I've ever seen. It keeps your attention without skipping a beat and concludes most fabulously, with mathemetician John Nash played brilliantly by Russell Crowe. The story will keep you thinking for days, and you will see the world in a different light.
B00HMJT5VW|4|This is a classic movie.
B00HY7VU60|3|I only watched the first episode.  I thought about watching others but decided it was not worth the time.  We have seen the drama of royal family power struggles before....  The White Queen did not bring anything new, except for perhaps some random boob shots...  All told, I give it an 'eh'
B003XF1XOQ|4|The ending was not what I was expecting. I expected a better ending for katniss. I do like who she ended up with in the end. But still, the ending just seemed to downward spiral from all the action in the book. A little disappointed.
0553384775|5|Great read.  Greed greed greed!
B00J3V97NS|5|As far as I know, it's better than her first album. Her co-labs are top notch and the song which is the album title is the best collaboration known to the human world.
B00FAPF5U0|4|fun,challenging game. it really makes you focus. 1 less star because you should gain more than 5 lives for your purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5|Subway serfers is #1when it comes to games like temple run and southern games like it.I give subway suffers a 5 and you'll know why when you get it.

Love Ebay because of all the individual sellers and little things, and Amazon is my go to for name brands, books and the like. These two sites are dangerously awesome and alluring!!!
B007EW9ISM|4|Love the responsiveness.  A little on the heavy side for me.  I have small hands.  Would like to see it a little lighter and just a tad longer and thinner, but it definitely works.

B00G32QIEG|4|I don't like to compare movies because it takes away from each experience. I enjoyed watching RIPD. There was the light-heartededness around the two alpha characters figuring out how to get along. The intertwined love story didn't take away from the action (thank goodness).  I thought it was a fun watch.
B003HC8I5M|3|Phil Collins has never been in better voice than he is on \\"Going Back,\\" his valentine to the musical influences - namely, Motown and soul of the 60s - that informed his early years.<br /><br />True, he rarely breathes new life into these songs. It would be a lie to say he transforms into a full-on song stylist. The core audience for these tunes, however, is not looking for that, and the rich, well-informed voice he uses to navigate the record is still a damn fine pleasure to hear. His enthusiasm and vivacity cover the album like wallpaper.<br /><br />The song selections are also excellent. \\"Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me for a Little While)\\" (The Doobie Brothers) rolls and tumbles with excitable energy, and the slightly overlong but well-arranged \\"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\\" (The Temptations) has a fine-honed, frothy disco-like flavor that throws an interesting curveball to the proceedings.<br /><br />He can't fail with the likes of the swashbuckling, boundlessly frenetic \\"(Love Is Like a) Heatwave\\" (Martha and the Vandellas) and the timeless \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\" (Stevie Wonder). This is pop music as it should be - a great singer with great songs to sing.<br /><br />Of course, new material would be welcome from Collins, who has not released a record since 2002's uneven but enjoyable \\"Testify,\\" so in light of that \\"Going Back\\" may seem like a disappointment in theory. We all know that it takes only slight thought and little effort for someone like Collins to enter a recording studio and whip-up a CD that sounds more like karaoke than covers.<br /><br />However, that is not the case here. Collins may not re-stylize these songs or cover new ground with them, but he displays passion and dedication to the project through every track. This is not just a vanity project.<br /><br />The only major flaw in the record's execution is that 29 songs are on the deluxe version. 29! There is the standard 18-track CD and the 25-track deluxe version which includes an audio rip of 4 more additional songs on the accompanying bonus DVD.<br /><br />The project would have surely had more focus had Collins chosen to slim down the track listing or possibly released the albums in two volumes. Since there are so many songs there is no thematic focus, giving the album sudden dramatic changes in mood, shifting between melancholy tunes like Stevie Wonder's \\"Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer\\" and more boisterous material like \\"Standing In the Shadows of Love\\" (Four Tops) in slightly jarring fashion.<br /><br />It certainly would have been a much more noteworthy project had Collins chosen fewer songs and taken the time to rearrange, reinterpret, restyle - in short, try something new - with them.<br /><br />\\"Going Back\\" will dissapoint fans who want new material, but it is a well-wrought, slickly produced, ear-pleasing collection of tunes. It may not be particularly remarkable, but it is certainly welcoming to hear Collins' honeyed voice again.g bonus DVD.

B00DXLO0D6|5|I dreamed of owning this box set and now I do , Thanks for making this DVD collection Affordable I am gonna enjoy reliving all the wonderful fun episodes .
B0002OERI0|3|alright, i got this the first day it came out thinking it was gonna be completely kickass, well, i thought it was for a long time, my favorite song was \\"Blvd. of Broken Dreams\\", that is before it got a video and was played on MTV, MTV2, VH1, and Fuse 24/7, along with \\"Holiday\\", \\"American Idiot\\", and \\"Wake Me Up When Sept. Ends\\" (which sucked from the begining), there are some pretty badass songs on here like \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", \\"Homecoming\\" and \\"Give Me Novacaine\\"...\\"St. Jimmy\\" is an alright song, but it gets annoying...everyone is ranting and raving about this album, even old Green Day fans are, well i am an old Green Day fan and i was, but not anymore....\\"Bullet In A Bible\\" made me kinda loose all respect for them...plus you see people wear there shirts left and right, ....everyone LOOOOVES this CD....well if you want a f*ckin badass CD then go listen to Dookie or International Superhits, or Nimrod, all great classic Green Day albums....they were kinda in an out of the shadows with every album, Dookie was out, and they were pretty popular, Insominac came out and not soo popular, Nimrod came out and was pretty popular, and then Warning..then Shnagains (however you spell it) wasnt even really meantioned, but it was an alright CD \\"Haha, You're Dead\\" was on it, and thats a good song overall, if you dont have it, you are probably the only on in the world that doesnt, and dont get it....its waaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy over-rated
145162445X|5|In \\"A Universe from Nothing\\" Dr. Lawrence Krauss, with his customary wit and clarity takes on the ultimate question and accomplishes three important goals:<br /> 1. Redefining out traditional view of `nothing'<br /> 2. Explaining the froth of virtual activity in what we thought of as the void, and<br />3. Perhaps most importantly, closing the final gap, and eliminating the need for a mythic supernatural Creator of the universe.<br />Dr. Krauss shows that there is not, and cannot be, what we have until now thought of as `empty space. We have learned that in interstellar space, or even perhaps the vacuum we create in a bell jar in a lab, there is approximately one elementary particle per cubic meter, and the remainder of that cubic meter holds nothing at all.<br />Quantum theory now tells us that concept is invalid, and that the remainder of that square meter contains myriads of virtual entities popping into and out of existence in extremely short periods of time.<br />Surprisingly, also, among the entities that can pop into existence from `nothing' are universes, and to our certain knowledge, at least one, which we inhabit, has done so.<br />The importance of this is that it eliminates the need for a `first mover;' particles and universes, under the influence of nothing more than the laws of physics, spring into existence without the need for a `Divine watchmaker'.<br />\\"A Universe from Nothing\\" is an absolute must read for everyone interested in physics, cosmology, and the dichotomy between science and religion.
B00005221M|3|This is my all time favorite movie, but I was so dissapointed in the DVD version. There were some scenes that were cut out that should have been left in. If you have never seen this movie, I reccomend the VHS version, it is by far better than the DVD.
B001I82RVS|4|I bought the two-disc Blu-ray release of this movie and I was a little disappointed with the picture quality. I am watching it on a 32\\" LCD TV, and maybe I don't have my adjustments right but I think it could be better. The blu-ray comes with several extras; I haven't perused through them all yet, but there are several trailers. The audio options are for both English and Japanese, in both 2.0 and 5.1 digital sound. Not anything spectacular, but definitely not a bare-bones release either. The second disc, which contains a \\"short film\\" collection comes with several shorts, so no shortcomings there, but the picture quality is worse here. I can't say to stay away from it, but be careful.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, here goes: I never really was a big fan of the excessive gore and violence on film; I always found it distasteful and ridiculous. That being said, I loved this movie. The movie doesn't have much of a plot or character development, but the point of the film seemed that it was trying harder to be disgusting and bizarre than to be a great film. And it delivers rather well, in my opinion. The music, while nothing special, was at times quite eerie, and lent to the gruesome feeling of the movie.<br /><br />I've seen several complaints from uppity film snobs who believe that every movie in existence should be of nothing less than pristine quality to be enjoyed, and if otherwise, they have no business being made at all. Pfft. Then stay away from stuff like this. If it's a slap to your face when something like this comes on the market, you need to grow up. These movies aren't meant to win academy awards; they are meant to be bloody and gory and freakish, which they do quite well. Broaden your horizons; it'll be a lot easier to be entertained.<br /><br />I hope this review helps everybody; I was moderately happy with both the disc and the movie itself, and if you are capable of viewing films on levels other than \\"pure greatness or nothing,\\" you might just be happy with this one. Now, off to The Machine Girl...to The Machine Girl...
B008JFUOWM|4|I cannot really rate this other than it came as described.  I bought this for a gift and the recipient really enjoys this kind of movie.

B000002UAU|5|reading all the reviews i keep on wondering if you don't like the beatles why by the c.d. at all. or the reviews that say to buy a zepplin c.d. instead you can't compare because both are 2 differnt types of bands. And for the people who say hendrix and cream made better albums should check out the fact that hendrix and clapton hung out with the beatles (as well as the stones) and watched what they did closely. I love all those bands and im a stones fan as well but stones fans are quick to point out teh negatives of the beatles and think everything the stones did is gold. the phony tours and albums they do now is digusting. stones fans should be appaled that their heros sold out. i'm off on a tangent getting back to the album. I dont think everything the beatles did is gold and am a beatlemanic. \\"help\\" is ther weakest album. 'sgt peppers\\" is a masterpiece for it's time. But so is \\"pet sounds\\" \\"exile on mainstreet\\" \\"blonde on blonde\\" etc. it does define a time and an era. I think the problem is that it is to overanalyzed. it is not the first concept album. that title belongs to sinatras \\"in the wee small hours\\" but it brought th idea to rock and roll. as a whole the album works. not just the effects but the arrangements as well. I know i'm not talking about the songs in general because i think everyone knows all the songs. \\"within you without you\\" is not a bad song, ti just could have been edited. Despite this album being a mccartney concept of the beatles as a fictious band this is the one album that lennon and mccartney co-wrote almost all the songs with the exception of the title track \\"fixing a hole\\" and \\"lovely rita\\". this is a great album. overanalyzed not overrated. if you like it I would also suggest \\"pet sounds\\" by the beach boys, \\"the notorious byrd brothers\\" by the byrds, \\"forever chabges\\" by love, and even though stones fans don't like it (im a stones fan as well as a beatle fan by the way) \\"their satanic majesties request\\" by the stones.

B0089LOG02|4|Easy read. Touching stories
B00HGJ18C2|3|Not really something to get excited about... just the basics.
B006885EFE|5|One of the the best WW2 satires ever made. It is great that it is from the perspective of a different soldier every episode, it shows a wider perspective of the war. This series is good reference for someone who would like to understand part of our American history.
B000ZELISO|4|I have been a fan of Harry Potter since the first book was released. I simply love the way JK Rowlings weaves the story through the years, adding characters & enhancing the story as she goes. The movies have done an amazing job of staying to the story line though it would be impossible to cover all of the details. This edition, is simply wonderful. I enjoy the maturing aspect of the characters and the addition of many of the historical details from the written versions. I know I am biased but that is my opinion!
B000R8YC1I|5|A little frayed on the edges of the box but everything else is perfect. I was actually surprised by how good the quality was overall.  A timeless classic with extra features, lots of good fun.
B003VANOFY|4|Not worth it, worst headset of all times, disconnects all the time, battery is broken or the software is glitched which doesn't show you the right % of the battery, if it was full nor empty, no gain option for the mic that it has, buttons on the side sometimes work, sometimes don't, not construable, besides get headphones and a mic, much better audio quality.
B002ZG99QS|5|I remember nagging my dad to take me to the original Tron, and to be honest I was a little dissapointed with it. Yes, the light cycle chases are ace and there was some good stuff in it, but on the whole I found it boring.     Then I was on holiday and watched Tron Legacy on the plane. What a great film this is, way better than the original. Even on a two inch screen the effects are amazing - Tron Legacy is like watching a fireworks display for 2 hours.     The story has all the same problems as the original, and to be honest I think they should make a prequel showing the uprising as that was the most interesting idea in the film.     But, on the whole this is a great film and rekindles some memories. By the way, look out for Michael Sheen doing his best David Bowie impression.
B00B49L7JY|5|Loved this documentary. If you are a music fan, you will thoroughly enjoy this film. Enough said, enjoy you people!
B00HGJ18C2|5|I am an avid solitaire player and I enjoyed this game on my Kindle Fire. It took me a while to become accustomed to the cards moving at a touch.
B003VANOFY|4|I have owned these for about 4 months now and am very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Solid reception - not once have I had an issue here, even when going to the bathroom<br />Mic Mute light - nice to see if I mute in a program instead of swiveling the mic up. (I do wish a shorter distance up muted it so I would see the light on the way up)<br />Clear Sound quality<br />Had some enjoyable antics with the built in voice modifications<br />Charging Cable attached to the USB wireless dongle is nice and convenient - plus I can wrap it away if I want to clear the desk up<br /><br />Cons:<br />Power button is extremely small and takes a good long press to turn off<br />-- I live by myself and only use this when I am skyping while playing or do not want to disturb my neighbors so this can be a hassle if I am trying to quickly switch from speakers to my headphones.<br /><br />Meh<br />Have yet to use the &#34;G&#34; keys for anything
B0000A1HQP|5|One of my favorites. Not for French classes under college age, as it deals with adultery, but nothing inappropriate is SHOWN, just discussed, and only briefly. This film is HILARIOUS. The spoken French is not too complicated, for those who are learning the language.
0143142364|5|audiobook was just amazing, i just listened to Pillars of the  Earth and was so impressed and enthralled. I am now a fan of Ken Follett and plan on many more hours of listening to his other books
B008ASLK8A|4|A Game of Shadows, in my opinion, does a fine job of living up to the first movie. Sure, there are some silly bits, but that's as it should be. This movie contains more action and less of the cerebral intrigue, but it's still good entertainment.
B000002UJQ|5|Ok, first of all, I love this album and it's definitely Radiohead's best ever.  Easily five stars. <br />     I've been reading the reviews, and I'm shocked at the lack of talk and respect for Subterranean Homesick Alien.  I LOVE this song.  It's easily my favorite on the album, and probably my favorite song ever.  It is beautiful.  I'm surprised that there's been this much talk about Let Down, and Paranoid Android, and virtually nothing on Subterranean.  I do like every song on this album except for Fitter Happier, but I'm just surprised Subterranean isn't getting as much credit as it deserves. <br />     Other than that, my favorite tracks are Paranoid Android, Karma Police, and Airbag.
B00CRR5YA0|5|I've listened to this soundtrack nearly everyday since I got it and I can't get enough of it.  This is actually an album I have wanted since the movie came out.

0920668372|1|Rarely have I seen a book so polarizing. The 5- and 1-star reviews combine for almost ninety percent of the over 1000 reviews. By the time you are done reading this review, it should be well and truly clear on which side of the inversely curved bell I sit.<br /><br />The modern classic with which this is often (and ironically) confused is [[ASIN:0763641758 Guess How Much I Love You]]. *That* is a perfect choice for communicating infinite love to a child. There are no doubt many other worthy choices for your family.<br /><br />*This* is not such a book. The cover of this book should be plastered with a warning: Welcome to Creepville.<br /><br />It's not enough that intervention should have been attempted soon after the monster toddler flushed his mother's watch down the toilet, or that the mother's own scream--\\"THIS KID IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!!!\\"--approaches verbal child abuse.<br /><br />No, this book offer much deeper insights into the fractured human psyche. Years later, and on dark nights, we see the mother drive across town (uninvited), climb up into her adult son's upper bedroom (with the aid of a ladder: such activities are known in my town as 'breaking and entering'), pick up her adult son--her *sleeping* adult son--and hold him. Ewwww[...] A more selfish and dysfunctional relationship I have never seen outside the [[ASIN:0890420629 DSM-IV]].<br /><br />At the climax of this sordid tale, the roles are reversed and the son holds his elderly mother, repeating the mantra, \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my Mommy you'll be.\\" He then perpetuates the ritual by rocking his own baby daughter, thus ensuring that the creepy dynamic lives on like some recycled B-Movie villain.<br /><br />In summary, this ranks among the worst children's books I have ever had the misfortune to read. And believe me: I've seen [[ASIN:B000KENMR4 some]] [[ASIN:2894295057 stinkers]]. When I learned recently that the author of Love You Forever has been diagnosed as obsessive-compulsive and manic-depressive, and is in fact a former cocaine addict and alcoholic, everything made sense. Sad, pitiful sense.n fact a former cocaine addict and alcoholic, everything made sense. Sad, pitiful sense.

B008B4KVS8|5|IT A SHAME THAT ERNIST HAD TO BE A BAD GUY IN THIS MOVIE, I KNOW WITH HIS ACSENT AND LOOKS THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT THATS THE WAY IT GOES.
0385523394|5|I loved reading Piper Kerman's memoir. I have always been interested in prison life and reading Piper's stories made me understand it better.<br /><br />As funny as the netflix version is, it can be very misleading as to what prison life is really like. Reading this book before watching the show gave me real insight into piper's experience. Each chapter tells a new story or even from her time in prison. The novel is a fast and easy read and I think everyone should read it. It is important to understand how women live in the penal system.
B00AA0U046|5|I have been a Hendrix fan for years, but this is by far the BEST thing since &#34;Band of Gypsy's&#34; or &#34;Blues&#34;! A must have if you are a fan of any music!
0891419063|5|Great personal view of the worst fighting in the second world war. Horrifying in its intensity.  It makes you wonder how anyone could have survived.  This book should be a must read for all high school students and for all those who are still wondering if we should have A bombed the Japanese.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Great book! I couldn't put it down.  Read it in one day.  It was sad, and funny. Great love story
0975991477|5|Great understanding of how we acquire beliefs by age 5 and act them out as adults, contining to act them out unless they are released from the body.
B005H9B2CE|4|This was a different type of movie than I usually watch. It was ok. I do understand that it came from comics and that is why I watched it.
B003Y3BSTC|1|I'm really upset with the kindle edition of this book. A lot of mistakes in it, and the errata published on their website is really messy to use with the electronic edition of the book (I'm using the kindle app on my ipad). And why should we use an errata with an electronic edition of a book, in the first place ? An extra 1/5 an hour spent by someone anyway compiling the mistakes for the web errata on actually making the corrections in the electronic edition of the book seems like a logic and decent thing to do ... Apparently not. Because of this approach I give the lowest possible rating to the book . It seems like a rip off. It's really annoying spending 1/2 an hour to sort out a math problem and then discover, after another 1/2 an hour of trying to figure out what from the errata goes where on the messy page system of the kindle edition, that  somebody made you pay for yet another gratuitously sloppy product.

B0000028M7|5|The second studio album from Seattle’s Alice In Chains is unmistakably the group’s finest hour, and not only that, but also a true landmark release on the heavy metal timeline. Equal parts Sabbath-inspired sludge metal, crunchy stoner metal, hard rock, and Nineties grunge, “Dirt” possesses a sound that is absolutely unique, innovative, and original. And it is a record that would also prove to be one of the most important of the 1990’s, as it would go on to inspire countless imitators (see: Black Label Society, Staind, etc.), and even some bold-faced clones (Puddle Of Mudd, Godsmack, et al).<br /><br />The highlights on this fine album are abundant. Its handful of hit singles, the churning “Them Bones,” the dreary, acoustic-guitar based (at least for the most part) ballad “Down In A Hole,” the classically catchy “Rooster,” “Angry Chair,” and the closing “Would?”, are five obvious noteworthy mentions. But the standouts certainly and by any stretch of the imagination do not stop there. “Dam That River” is a surprisingly heavy big riff-rocker, and a full on heavy metal song, as is the surprisingly up-tempo “Sickman,” which has energetic and meaty metal riffing coursing through its veins. And the neighbor to the first of these two songs (“Dam That River”), “Rain When I Die,” is also of particular note, as it is a bass-heavy piece complete with an excellent bass intro, and a dirty, heavy, and grungy-sounding bass grumble flowing throughout. It also boasts wailing vocals and insanely hooky, “wah-wah” guitar licks that evoke classic Tom Morello and Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />Elsewhere, a big, Black Sabbath-y sludge/doom metal riff comes lumbering in and smashing through the mix in “Junk Head”; and similarly, the album’s title song is another cut of trippy, droning, moaning stoner metal. “Dirt” then continues this “tripped-out” approach by opting to include “God Smack,” and filling it with weird, effects-laden vocals, wavering and quivering vocal hooks, solid, grumbling bass lines, and catchy, wah-tinged guitar leads. And on the more traditional side of the line, a ripping guitar solo is also included in this song. And then we are treated to “Iron Gland,” a really weird, forty-three-second long track. But despite it being just a quirky little interlude, “I.G.” is definitely still worth at least one listen. And lastly if far from leastly, the disc is rounded out by “Hate To Feel,” a lesser-known, but still absolutely important track that is compliments a Black Sabbath-lifted riff with a sturdy bass bottom, and a terrific, partially jazzy and partially whammy-bar-drenched, but always totally air-guitar-able solo that wails away like there’s no tomorrow.<br /><br />Frankly speaking, folks: It does not get much more essential than “Dirt,” a musical milestone, a classic release that would prove to be one of the best and most important products of the Seattle music scene, and an incredibly satisfying feast for everybody that just so happens to be into hard rock and/or alternative metal.vocals, wavering and quivering vocal hooks, solid, grumbling bass lines, and catchy, wah-tinged guitar leads.

1932100385|1|Is Campbell deliberately lying to us? Or is he merely suffering from an inability to cast aside his own personal prejudices and present a full and objective presentation of the facts, because the facts conflict with what he wants to believe? <br /> <br />The facts, as anyone who actually peruses the data produced by the study Campbell claims to have drawn his conclusions from (which can be found in Chen J, et al. Diet, life-style, and mortality in China: A study of the characteristics of 65 Chinese counties. Oxford, UK; Ithaca, N.Y. Oxford University Press; Cornell University Press, 1990.), show that consumption of animal protein - especially meat - was associated with a 29% REDUCED risk of mortality, not an increased risk, as Campbell claims. For that matter, the study also shows a reduced risk of cancer in those who consume alcohol and tobacco use. <br /> <br />So where did Campbell get his claims? Who knows. Wherever he got them, it's definitely not from the study he named his book after.
0312323859|4|I was very skeptical since I wasn't a fan of Darcy or babies/pregnancies but I was pleasantly surprised!  Her character did quite the unexpected turnaround making it very enjoyable.  I liked the `Something' series so much that I kept finding myself wondering what the other characters were thinking during the different situations.  Giffin kept it interesting and pleasurable.  I definitely recommend reading it after Something Borrowed.

There is only dishonor is not racing because you are afraid to lose.\\"  Denny lived by this philosophy when it came to the trials in his life.<br /><br />We read this book for our book club party and each person shed a tear or two when discussing the book.  We really identified with the characters, especially Enzo, and it was hard not to get caught up in all the struggles, and joys, in their lives.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
B001KVZ6F2|5|So,this is Clint Eastwood's last movie as an actor.He did a very good job in closing out a wonderful career.The movie made me angry about the street gang he takes on and it shows how our youth today are destroying their lives.His character is one person who is not afraid to back down from a threat.I did see some Dirty Harry in the movie.The trailer to the movie was great.Although this is his last movie as an actor and now he is going behind the camera I will always be a Clint Eastwood fan.
B0017SWPXY|4|i actually skipped racing stuff but enjoyed the strength of the characters.  yes, i love dogs; enzo's voice told the story.
B0052UZIFA|5|This is one game that will keep you busy for hours and coming back for more.  With so many levels and features, you never get tired of this game.  Can't wait for Plants vs. Zombies 2.  If they make one, I'll be one of the first to buy it.
B008476HBM|5|A must read. Sometimes the greatest loves begin when and were we least expect it. Jane Austen, one of my favorite writers,surely ahead of her time!!!!!!
0743454537|4|My sisters keeper: a compelling read with a shocking ending! Have you ever looked at a book or read the first couple pages and think it will be horrible? That is exactly what you will not do when you first start to read My Sisters Keeper. When I first picked up this book, I couldn't put it down for days. Jodi Picoult has written and mastered another wonderful book. She has mastered it with another controversial topic and a lesson learned. There are many many challenging questions raised in this story and you will see many point of views about these questions in this book.     How was the book? It was good overall and I would give it a four out of five stars. But some parts in the book were just plain annoying. Especially Sara(mother). Picoult illustrates her as a stubborn, stuck up, selfish person. .She completely ignores her son Jesse like he isn't even a part of the family any more. She sees her daughter, Anna, as a walking donor for Kate who has leukemia. She never even asks Anna if she wants to be a donor. She is so caught up in trying to save Kate that she doesn't take time to see what the rest of her family wants and needs. Also I would have changed the ending. It is so surprising and shocking that it could potentially ruin the book for some people. But overall it was a good book and I would recommend it to other people.
0312995423|5|This was the last Dan Brown book I read, and it did not disappoint!  He is such an amazing writer.  This is another book that you will not want to put down!  I can't wait for more from this great mind.

B00T73ATFW|5|Nothing like her previous work but I am a true fan and enjoy it
B0055B7IPE|5|My daughter recommended this movie.  Though animation, it was so true to life. The storyline was great. What a feat to bring to life this character, Mr. Frederickson. I laughed and i cried. I hurt and i healed. The creators of this film should be commended for so accurately portraying human emotion and spirit on so many levels. Well done.
B0000AM6JI|5|FANTASTIC  RECOMEND IT!!
B00HGJ18C2|5|Loving it!
B0088T3B0G|5|This movie is a amazing tale that you leaves one trying to figure it out when it is over. Things are definitely not a they seem. It is a superb show.
B000KJU182|5|This film directed by Peter Ustinov and staring a very young Terrance Stamp. is a great example of how a moral dilemma has many levels during wartime. That a person might be guilty by law but not in relation to the human condition.
014242417X|2|I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. This book is neither profound nor inspiring. It seems like a great read for young adults, but certainly not over 30.
B0055SWM08|5|This challenging puzzle game is a lot of fun and well worth $1. If your questioning getting this game, you really should!
0765377063|5|Very glad that the english translation came out. Ken Liu did an excellent job at retaining the magic that oozes from every line.
B00BD99JMW|3|This was a fun series to read and I enjoyed Roth's characters.  I understand the character's actions, but at the same time I don't typically enjoy dark endings when reading young adult sci fi and fantasy books.  It was disappointing and frustrating.
B00DPM7TIG|4|The quick \\"summaries\\" of this book did not do it justice.  I was not drawn to reading it until it showed up on so many \\"Best Books of the Year\\" list from so many sources. It convinced me there must be something to it, and there was! It's not just another WW II story, it shares how the Nazis created their soldiers from children, it takes you into the world of a blind child, it has well developed characters, a mystery element, lots of history , and two strong story lines. It's the bouncing across the story lines but more the bouncing back and forth in the time line of the story lines that made this a 4 star for me. At times it confused this reader to the detriment of the flow of the book. My only other complaint is drawing out the ending too long and past when it adds to the story.  Despite those few flaws a great read, highly recommended.
0698118308|4|This book by Eric Carle is a simple book that I believe could be used many different ways.  You could use this book in weather themes, during a cloud unit, or to stretch the imagination. <br /> <br />You could follow this book with an activity in which your children do their own cloud making, possibly out of cotton balls.   <br /> <br />I think that this book is fun and I really enjoy the illustrations.  I would definitely suggest having this book as a part of your classroom library. <br />
B0088WIQBM|2|The show had a lot of the right actors but suffers from a lot of whining and there isn't much adventure.  This show had the right combination for huge potential but fell short due to script writing.
B006OCM0G0|5|its fun and you always go back to it :) its like crack once you start it u just cant stop!
B0054JZC6E|4|never force quits. variety of games<br /> decent quality for being free. ads are somewhat annoying but not during actual gameplay
B000N5F6PG|5|Love the deal and I love Patrick Swayze in is movie...he will never die
B003JTHXOK|4|The reason I read this is because the movie came out and all my friends wouldn't stop talking about the book. Assuming it was a good book, I bought it without hesitation. When I first started reading it I liked it but when I got about 100 pages into it I didn't like it so much and stopped reading it. I made myself finish it and I'm extremely happy I did because this book completely surprised me at the end and left me with a good feeling about the book. I never thought I would say this but READ THIS BOOK! The ending is worth it!
B00957T6X6|4|I enjoyed these books a lot, my husband has enjoyed them for years - I should mention that I usually love long books and really dislike the current trends in historical novels and fantasy that write &#34;books&#34; that are more like movie scripts or outlines.  You can read them in an afternoon and wonder what ended up on the editing floor?<br /><br />This series (for me) has a bit of the other problem, I do want to know everything that is going on but it was so long and so very complicated that while I could keep up, there were times I found it a bit tedious.  As a history major I could get a grip on all the &#34;true to the late Middle Ages) plots and counter plots, but there were times I felt it dragged a bit.<br /><br />Still, great book series and I will buy the rest of them as they come out.
B0054JZC6E|5|great app.love. all of the games. some are super hard. I love the variety.epicness.but I hate all of the damn ads. my fav game is the racing game where you have yo avoid the other cars.
0060005424|5|Lirael, Daughter of the Clayr, is the extrodinary sequel to Sabriel. It's exciting plot is sure to keep the pages turning. <BR>This story takes fictional characters and places, and makes them into something that seems very real. The characters had depth, and personalities of their own. I couldn't put it down.
B00T47ZXIE|4|This movie was really good had lots of action and special effects for the guys and some romance for the women and is something that's appropriate for the whole family to enjoy
B002APU580|5|Loved it because it was updated and not stuffy! Actors did a great job and the scenery was beautiful. Fun entertainment.
B001CEE1YE|5|WHOA!
B001AQO3XS|4|This blu-ray (director's cut) is nice. They have done a decent job in converting the movie to digital, but you can see it is a conversion. There are scenes that the image is not perfect. I will still give thumbs up!
B00AESN8XY|5|Very addictive.. if I would have made a game my self I don't think it would have turned out as well
0307592731|4|During her trek of the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl Strayed provides an unflinching and unvarnished look at her life.  She acknowledges her faults and her strengths as she hikes 1,100 miles alone through some of the most rugged territory in the United States (and with no previous long-distance hiking experience).  Strayed undertakes the journey in an attempt to discover and reclaim herself after suffering significant losses in her life and after acting out with drugs and sex.  Her odyssey from lost to found is beautiful, terrifying, heartbreaking, and uplifting as she describes her physical journey and her spiritual journey.  The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is that I felt that the denouement was a bit rushed and that more time should have been spent exploring the inner changes that allowed her to find peace and true happiness in life.

B008HT4FUW|5|Watched the show on Netflix, and decided I needed to further support this show! Voting with my dollar as they say. It's a quality drama that kept me entertained every episode. Give it a watch on Netflix, or buy the DVD / BluRay.
B000XUBFE2|5|Tremendous book. As with all excellent books, you forget you're reading it and feel like you're  living it.<br /> Highly recommend.

B007ZGO7EM|5|This is a very functional calculator. When it's up and running, it looks so much like the real thing then when holding my device in my hand, it's as if I were holding an actual calculator in my hand and not my phone. Very good job. Now if there were a way to add by means of a flip switch of some sort, perhaps a few scientific functions, it would make it the perfect calculated app. :-)
B00BAXFACO|5|THIS BOOK IS A PERFECT 10 . AS ALWAYS CONNELLY KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. CAN&#34;T PUT IT DOWN
B00B0U2SEA|5|This is one of the most challenging films to review. Not because it's complex or difficult to follow, but because it is quite simply one of the most intense films I have ever seen and the level of emotion is...quite unlike most movies of today.<br /><br />Widely considered Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, Schindler's List is a powerful, utterly devastating and raw glimpse at the horrors of the Holocaust. It's also a profound character epic, transforming a man who prides himself on leisure and his bountiful fortune into one who sacrifices it all to save the lives of many.<br /><br />The first element of note is the phenomenal cast. Liam Neeson leads as Oskar Schindler, and is tremendous. A real, raw, and emotional performance. Ben Kingsley plays Itzhak Stern, a troubled Jewish accountant who helps Schindler in his character transformation. His performance is also incredibly genuine, ever representing some of the best casting in film. Rounding out the fantastic cast is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a sadistic psychopath with nothing but hate for the Jewish people. It's an awesome cast that carries emotional weight and intensity, but written with that signature Spielbergian style.<br /><br />Right off the bat, you can also see the Schindler's List is in black and white. This visual style is striking and refreshing and adjusting to it is remarkably easy. The way the film is shot is more intimate and personal as compared to other Spielberg outings, and the black and white really augments the experience. The sets are recreated with such incredible attention to detail; Everything from the Ghetto at Krakow to the terribly disturbing Auschwitz, Spielberg simply doesn't take you to these places but puts you in them, creating a sense of tangible immersion in these places. John Williams also composed the score for Shindler's List, and is among one of his most original works to date. Straying away from the big and boisterous action packed scores he usually composes, the score for Schindler's List is a more subtle and emotional score, and I was taken away by the beautiful music (the theme is especially memorable).<br /><br />Being a Holocaust film, Schindler's List has no shortage of intense grit and violence. It's worthy of note because of the brutality of it all, recreating some of the darkest moments of human history with nothing held back. I cried more than a few times during Schindler's List because of these scenes; it's so emotionally poignant and it gets the point across with almost blistering intensity, and if not for the transformation of Schindler the entire film would fall apart. But because of the striking visuals, intimate and strong performances, and that Spielbrgian branded style, Schindler's List shines as a near-perfect balance between intense violence and story.<br /><br />I will say that Schindler's initial transformation seems rather sudden, but when between the rock and the hard place that Oskar Shindler was in I can see his change of heart. Other than this seemingly dramatic change of character, This film is a masterpiece.<br /><br />It's all just so incredibly disturbing, powerful, emotional, intense, and violent that Schindler's List becomes ingrained into your mind. And that's a good thing. While all films that win Best Picture are credible in their own right, I can safely say that Schindler's List rises above most for one simple reason: Schindler's List is an important film. In a time when people are denying the Holocaust even happened (for some foolish reason), Schindler's List is a graphic and raw recreation of an event in history that should never be forgotten. Brilliantly casted, well conceived, directed, shot and tremendously powerful Schindler's List is a masterpiece film that, now in 2013, has stood the test of time and will undoubtably remain a classic for ages to come.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Review: Picture quality is surprisingly good, with only one or two moments with obvious visual flaw.  The sharp remaster is somewhat interesting, as I believe that black and white films are better with a softer edge instead of razor sharp HD quality, but this strikes just the right balance of soft edges yet distinct detail.  The audio is as good as it can be. It isn't laser sharp, but isn't distracting either. In terms of a remaster it's awesome. The packaging is in a nice collectable box, and a 3 disc set (2 DVD's - parts 1&2) and 1 Blu-Ray. Digital Copy included is both iTunes (gladly it's HD) and UV.<br /><br />5/5 - A classicemaster is somewhat interesting, as I believe that black and white films are better with a softer edge instead of razor sharp HD quality, but this strikes just the right balance of soft edges yet distinct detail.

0316056863|4|I had the pleasure of listening to this book on a road trip.  I love love love listening to audio books especially when they are read by their own author and especially when the author is funny, interesting and Tina Fey.  I have to admit that once I listen to this book I wanted to get online and post I love Tina Fey stuff all over but I honestly don't know where I would go to do this. So this is a small attempt to do that.<br /><br />The reason I liked this book so much was because I feel that I it helped me to gain insight on a topic that I always really enjoyed, but have never really known why. That topic is of course women in comedy, and one of the many the reasons I like Tina Fey and her women cohorts so much has been revealed through this book.  Women can be funny, feminine topics can be really really funny, this book taught me about how this was not a generally accepted idea and how women in comedy actually had to  work hard for this to become a commonly know fact.<br /><br />I really enjoyed listening to this book. Tina makes it so much funnier than I could ever have made it in my head reading it to myself.  I would basically describe it as advice.  Tina essentially leads you through her life, from childhood comedy to funny trials & tribulations in college, to working in the theatrical comedy improve world. I found the book entertaining and empowering, excellent read (or listen) and it wasn't just me, my husband was laughing out loud as well.
B000099T2L|4|Yes, Beyoncé is well-known and very well-hated.  Envied.  Loved.  Spat on.  But I have to praise her for this CD.  A solo debut from an artist known for being in a popular girl group, and she earns my respect.  I must confess, I was not a Beyoncé fan at first, but the girl does her own thing.  <br />Love.  The dreaded four-letter word by some, but suck it up through a straw and swallow it because every song has that theme around it.  Whether it's obsessive love (\\"Baby Boy\\", \\"Crazy in Love\\"), a love gone astray (\\"Me, Myself and I\\"), or a fun type of love--almost like a one-night stand type of thing (\\"Naughty Girl\\")--you're gonna have an earful.  Beyoncé packs great grooves, powerful vocals, and funkadelic beats into \\"Dangerously In Love\\", showing her full potential.  There are times when you need to take it back...way back...back into time, and she saw the need to do exactly that.  Old school mixed with new school, what a beautiful combination.<br />Finally, Beyoncé can stand in the spotlight and not be criticized for wading around longer than what she needs to.  I foreshadow that my copy of the CD will have millions of scratches on it in a week.  Job well done.  *Standing ovation*
B000078DOH|5|Don`t listen to such people who say things like \\"they hadn`t really found their groove\\" or such nonsense. This is Chili Peppers, and what they stood for in the early days, and it was ORIGINAL! UNIQUE! The Peppers did \\"find their groove\\" After their 3rd album Uplift Mofo, and it was gradually downhill from there. The high experimentation and so-called lack of cohesion of these albums is the very thing that makes them Totems of music. What they did here was 100% unadultered expression with great variety. These 3 first albums are their finest work, all 3 masterpieces! Get them!

B001AQR3MQ|5|good story
B00FKF0F3C|5|I had just finished Arthur Schlesinger's &#34; 1000 Days&#34; focused on Kennedy and while  most informative of the man and his thought process and background on how presidents make their decisions, it lacked the intimate side of the man with a serious sex addiction...among his other ailments. The press knew but did not report. While it did not seem to effect his judgements it was simply dishonest to write 1,000 pages and not cover the truth as Follet dealt with it as time has revealed. I was 200' away from the Rosa Parks incident waiting for my bus in Montgomery on the Plaza in 1956 and the fictional book was accurate by Follet ...even though at the time at 12 years old I had no clue. He presented the Negro side accurately with his characters. We had a wonderful daily Negro maid whose daughter and I played like we did not know there was a problem. We built a neat treehouse and giggled a lot. I spent my 1965  college sophomore summer living with my Time Correspondent brother  living in Gorgetown, DC and drove for several weeks for Averill Harriman in his Record Cab Limo. So much of that time is again..accurate. I relived the 50's, 60's, 70's and all the way to 2008 through his wonderful perspective of Washington, Berlin/Russia, Civil Rights, music of the times, and the continuing struggle of the races. CUDOS!

B00000J2L7|5|An irony here is that if Peter Sellers died from the massive heart attack that he recieved in April 1964, this would have been his penultimate film.  'Being There' (1979) turned out to be his penultimate film and in both  instances here, Sellers was nominated for an Oscar which he failed to get.  That aside, Sellers is at his best here and the use of black and dry comedy  gives us an occasional glimpse as to what Sellers would have been like as a  serious actor in the Guinness mould. The scene where Group Captain Mandrake  finds that his American counterpart is a madman for example. The film  itself is excellent, picking away at the difference between evil paranoia  and justified concern, concerning communism. The style of direction is pure  Kubrick, the camera shots and acting style for example, particually in the  War Room scenes. And if none of this attracts you, it is worth watching  just to see Major Kong go through his check list on the plane he his flying  to bomb Moscow. It had me in stiches.

B00007G207|5|I can't possibly say what hasn't already been said about this movie, nor can words really justify how this movie affected me. It made me laugh. It brought me to tears. It made me think and dream of my own love for literature and for the cinema. This film was poetic, beautiful, uplifting, and it will always remain to be one of the most unforgettable and moving movies I have ever seen.

0316098329|4|I sometimes get tired of reading the same old, same old, and ROOM promised to be something different. It kept that promise. It is a compelling, dark, and imperfect work.    SPOILER WARNING: I can't write this review without giving away plot details, so if you haven't read the book yet, please stop reading here!    For the first 60 or so pages of the book I was afraid the book was going to fall into the same category as THE STORY OF EDGAR SAWTELLE, which I found unbearable. I found myself skimming (never a good sign), because how many times can you describe the contents of an 11 x 11 room as well as the daily routine of playing games, sleeping, and eating? I wouldn't say the narrator, the 5-year old Jack, is annoying per se - but I'm sure many of us have heard children that age telling stories that go on far too long and just aren't that interesting. In life, we listen to them to be polite (or not to offend their parents). In fiction, it's tiresome.    But the situation turned around magically when the Escape from their prison is being plotted and executed. I don't think my heart has pounded like that in any of the last 100 thrillers/suspense novels I've read. When the escape is successful, the book takes its third turn into \\"life after imprisonment,\\" with Mother and Son both having serious adjustments to the world around them. Here, too, Jack is a less-than-perfect narrator, but he's effective enough for the reader to see the point Emma Donoghue is making: how supposedly \\"normal\\" and free people who haven't been through their ordeal can be just as cruel, callous, and selfish as Jack and Ma's captor.  There's the news anchor who asks truly inhuman questions - Ma's father, who can't accept Jack because he's the result of rape - Ma's brother, sister-in-law, and child, who are the typical bickering, overstressed, self-centered family you can see everywhere you go - even most of the people at the clinic are coldly clinical, not seeing Ma and Jack as human beings but rather as subjects on whom they can write their next research paper or get their next doctorate degree.    When I first read about Ma's post-release suicide attempt, I felt angry because so little information is given regarding the reasons behind it. I'm not sure if this is a flaw with the book or if Donoghue intended us to read between the lines. I now think the latter.  Ma had been abducted, held in captivity for seven years, repeatedly raped, and had a stillborn birth. What kept her sane was knowing that she had to take care of Jack. But once she's back in the world, everything that she pushed back to make life seen normal for Jack comes flooding to the surface, and it is A LOT to deal with. Her family doesn't help matters, nor does the media. She also has the intense guilt of now wanting to have a life of her own, to not be an appendage of Jack permanently. In light of all this, the suicide attempt makes sense.    And speaking of being an appendage of Jack, I have been reading through some of these reviews and I just can't believe the number of people offended by the fact that Ma breast feeds Jack until (and after) their escape, as well as their being grossed out by the Tooth.  Folks, in case you missed your biology lessons, that's what breasts are for - nursing, not male pleasure or artificial enhancement with silicone. I know our parents' generation was somehow led to believe that breast feeding is \\"disgusting,\\" but it's time to get past that.  Not only was breast feeding a desperate mother's attempt to stay close with her child, it was also an effort to give him the nutrients and boosted immune system that everyone now knows is a result of drinking mother's milk. For the child it's equally understandable - it's a way to stay close to the mother. Not only that, Ma points out that breast feeding is a way of preventing herself from getting pregnant again by her rapist.  As for the tooth, yes it's disgusting,  but it's the boy's way of being close to his mother whenshe's not there. He doesn't have much, but he has the tooth.  And anyone who doesn't realize that 5-year-olds can engage in some disgusting behavior hasn't spent much time around 5-year-olds.    I do agree with the criticism of Jack's diction and narrative. Sometimes it felt real to me; sometimes, fake. But I think that's bound to happen in any book with a child narrator, especially one who is both precocious and developmentally disabled at the same time.  Overall, ROOM is a good book that I feel I can recommend, but it's not a perfect one, and you do have to grit your teeth to get through the first part of the book before it gets into its flow. For me, the slog through the first 70 pages was worth the ultimate payoff - and the sense, at the end, that both Ma and Jack are going to be OK.
B00CO8D3G4|5|James' writings are amazing. He can really build connections and he understands life. He has suffered everything you and me are suffering right now. Read this book and you will feel empowered and try a new approach
B00FBR8130|5|And perfection once again! I am pleased to say Amazon has done a great job at packaging and as i always say..this matters a great deal to me... So, Thank you and have a great summer!
B004FRX0MY|4|I've used this app for about 2 days now and I'm loving it!  However, I've got some issues that keep it from being perfect, but it's very close!  Keep updating Amazon!    Device: Samsung Fascinate (2.2.1)    Pros:  - Buy music direct from the app  - Save directly to the cloud  - Download tracks easily from Amazon  - Manage existing music on your device directly from the app  - Manage download / stream restrictions with 3G / Wifi    Cons:  - Some tracks skipping during streaming? (Is this is a bug?)  - Stream pausing during calls (The volume seems to have issues getting back to normal after a call stops ringing?)  - Stream quality is questionable at times  - No app volume control (I have to increase the master volume on the phone to get the output louder on the music which in turn made every other sound on the phone loud)
B00SH00N3Y|2|Sucks. Just stupid
B002S8AGZG|5|This is one of the greatest 'chick flicks' that I have watched and could watch it again and again. No bad language that made me flinch and loose interest in the movie.
030758836X|2|This is a well written book, extremely intricate and an unpredictable plot. However, the characters and story line are depressing, sad, and just ugly, unlovable people. Both lead characters you end up disliking and actually repulsed from. It is the destruction of a marriage and the twisted minds of a couple that have pushed each other to the edge, but yet still stay stangely in and also out of the marriage. I finished the book, but I felt empty and sad after reading it. It was well written, but certainly not a fulfilling read.
B000FC2ROU|5|Read this book 3 times and found it deeply touching.  The fictional characters are so real that you<br />come to feel that you know them.
B008Y7X50I|5|My husbands favorite :-)
0451191153|5|Many pseudo-intellectuals think they are geniuses for being able to read a book of this length.  I am no intellectual by far but have read many books on philosophy.  I believe this book to be one of the most important pieces for people of any age.  This book puts life in perspective.  It shows, quite cleverly, that there are rewards beyond materialistic ones.  It also shows that greatness is not necessarily what others believe it to be but what the creator gets out of it.  I first read Atlas Shrugged at the suggestion of my brother.  I read it in about 3 days, seldom putting it down.  I went on to read every novel written by Rand.  I think that she is a very important author of our time and whether you believe in her philosophies or not you must read it.
B000NQRE9Q|5|Well done, well done indeed.
B008X6JP3G|5|Great movie full of action for the guys and romance for the ladies.  Outstanding acting all the way around.  Don't miss this one.
B004XDYJRU|5|this is app is probably the best radio app out there   i live in a place where the radio station isnt that great but i can listen to any city  and state happily  thanku amazon for offering this app and especially in the pro version for free
B00I6IKSZ0|5|Please fix this problem I can't play with my friends it won't let me can you please fix the problem I love this game so much but fix this problem =)
B007VGXS8M|5|For those people who are saying that it doesn't load on kindle fire it does!! You just have to be piacent!!!!
B0006284JQ|1|I didnt listen to the cd and i dont plan on doing it any time soon. This just isnt right, how can anyone release a Best oF cd after only 3 albums(very short albums too). This CD probably has 90% of her songs. This is such a ripoff and britney spears is not an artist. of course her fans will absolutly love this cd
B0054JZC6E|5|Cute quirky game with amazing graphics. not really any storyline but makes up for it in subtly amazing game play.
B007IXWKUK|5|I could not put this book down. It is amazing and mind blowing. I am a full time student, work and I mother of two teenagers and I still found the time to read this book
B005R32L66|3|Skype is an excellent product, however this version from the Amazon store is an older version, we had to uninstall it and download the most current version from the Google Play Store.
B00E8KLWB4|4|It seems okay so I'm downloading it
B002MQYOFW|5|I chose a five star rating because I really liked this book. I thought that it had a great plot/storyline. The main character's point of view was very insightful.
B00004ZAV3|5|This CD is awesome.  Gives you all the number one hits of the Bealtles.  Great album to start your beatles collection.  I bought this album first, and now purcahsed all the others because of \\"Beatles One\\"
0062124293|5|This book is fun, smart and gives modern insight to old, recurring issues. A great read for not only women, but men as well. Highly recommend!
B005IQZB14|5|This was a great book!!  not my normal type of reading, but I joined a book club and glad I read it.  Cheryl's journey is so very empowering!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00VFTD43A|3|Kinda good. Had a lot more potential
B00BQXWH2O|5|Armin never stops surprising me. There is a reason why he is the #1 Dj...<br />Every single song in this album has its own charm. I have not stopped listening to this album ever since I bought it because it is indeed an addictive master piece.
0805062971|3|The first half of &quot;Fight Club&quot; is interesting and entertaining, but the second half of it ruins the book.  Once it gets outside of the fight clubs and into the end-of-the-millenium, blow stuff up type of junk, the book falls apart.<br />Overall, &quot;Fight Club&quot; was interesting enough, but I have to admit - and I usually don't say this - the movie was better.  David Fincher is amazing.  Fincher's direction and Jim Uhls' screenplay add so much more to the book.  Get the special DVD of &quot;Fight Club&quot; rather than the book.  You won't be missing much, yet you'll be gaining so much more.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I enjoy playing this game all the time. It gives different levels and games in one so you don't get bored. I have gotten my friends to play with me.
B004G7UTXG|5|Great Cast, great scenery and photography, distressing story about European lack of ethics in 17th century South America. Two countries contesting ownership of land they don't own.
6305161976|5|There's nothing more beautiful than black and white on DVD.  This transfer is absolutely flawless, and does this great American classic justice.  It's like being in a theater again.  If you're a hollywood purist, get a DVD  player and throw in Casablanca.  The rich details, great performances, and  brilliant sound track will blow you away.
B001PPLKI0|4|I prefer posting long in-depth reviews as seen on the Elvis Information Network. But here is a short review.      Discs 1 to 3 on \\"I Believe - The Gospel Masters\\" feature Elvis' non-secular studio Master recordings in chronological order from his four key religious releases, the `Peace In The Valley' EP plus the albums `His Hand In Mine,' `How Great Thou Art,' and `He Touched Me.' Elvis' three main Gospel recording sessions used very different arrangements and had a very different feel, so collating each era onto individual CDs works very well.    Surprise inclusions on Disc 3 might be the first two tracks 'I Was Born About Ten Thousand Years Ago' and 'Life' - and the real surprise omission is `Miracle Of The Rosary' from 1971. (Certainly a mistake- or was it? See EIN full review)    Disc 4 gathers up Elvis' other Gospel and Inspirational recordings from his movies, the 68' Comeback TV special, other live performances and home recordings. It is an interesting selection and it flows very nicely compared to the similar concept of the final CD of the `Peace In The Valley' compilation. It includes `Down By The Riverside/When The Saints Go Marchin' In' (from Frankie And Johnny), `Sing You Children' (from Easy Come, Easy Go), a fabulous new mix of the `Swing Down, Sweet Chariot' (from The Trouble With Girls) and `Let Us Pray' (from Change of Habit).     The audio remastering by Vic Anesini (`Viva Las Vegas', `Elvis Live') is top-notch with the opportunity now to appreciate every nuance of these all-important sessions. The sound quality is similar to the great work on the `Close Up' box-set with a real richness and full bass sound. Vic Anesini did similar impressive audio work on the earlier `Ultimate Gospel'  so fans who already purchased that will no doubt be enthusiastic to get all these Gospel songs in such magnificent sound.     Of real interest to collectors will be the fact that `Swing Down, Sweet Chariot' here is a very different mix. From the very start it is TheBlossoms female vocal group that take the lead and follow Elvis' vocal throughout. On the previous version - which is the same Elvis vocal track - it has always been The Mello Men doing these gospel backing-vocals.   In Jorgensen's book `A Life In Music' it states that The Blossoms were only there for a vocal overdub on `Clean Up Your Own Backyard' but maybe they also overdubbed this number too. Whatever the reason this track is a real highlight.      Finally as stated in the sleeve notes  \\"Despite all the millions of sales and the three Grammy Awards, what towers in importance is the timeless music Elvis left behind. Church music, inspirational, hymns or gospel - the labels meant nothing to him. As with everything he ever sang, Elvis merged all the elements into his own belief of what music should be, free of any constraints of genre. Elvis' religious music afforded him more creative freedom than any other music he made, as no one had the knowledge to challenge him, and no one dared. \\"    Overall Verdict: This is a quality BMG release with a nice booklet and four well-selected CDs of the best of Elvis' Gospel sessions and at a very reasonable price. The 8-page essay looking at Elvis' early musical influences and his Gospel sessions is of interest and splitting Elvis' sessions into these 4 individual eras works very well. The improvement in sound gives the songs a rich and warm feel, which suits the delicious gospel harmonies. Disovering a different version of the 1968 'Swing Down, Sweet Chariot' will be of real interest to hard-core collectors.   Of course if you did purchase the individual BMG Gospel album re-releases of last year then it is only the upgraded forth CD that you need here. However if your Elvis budget is limited and like me you couldn't afford those at the time then this is the perfect package.   (For the full review please go to the Elvis Information Network [...])
B00FATEJYE|5|F2fff Dr Friday
B0067AC5KA|5|I have been riveted from the very beginning.  Each book led fluently to the next with the same amount of intrigue.
B00AW57L96|4|i enjoyed this book very much, couldn't put it down in fact.  Will definitely follow this author, perhaps more appealing to women than men.
B005J9ZE5I|5|That's right... who's laughing now?<br /><br />Evil Dead II is one of the best horror comedy movies ever made.<br />This one really stands in a category of its own.<br />Evil Dead II is a cult/horror/action/splatter/comedy classic.<br /><br />In brief, a group of friends go out to the woods & stay in a remote cabin for a weekend.<br />The entire situation is creepy from the start.<br />Something is not right & you find out rather quickly what that is.<br /><br />From the moment the group arrived, they experience something connected to another world.<br />This experience is based on pure evil.<br /><br />The group of friends soon discover some prior cabin visitors experimented with opening up portals to other worlds.<br />The key to this experiment is something called the book of dead.<br />Once the evil is unleashed, there is no stopping it.<br /><br />Evil Dead II is full of memorable scenes and quotes.<br />Some of them funny & some of them horrific.<br /><br />Evil Dead II was preceded by Evil Dead I, which is also very memorable, & followed by Army of Darkness.<br />The lead role in these films is portrayed by Bruce Campbell. It was directed by Sam Raimi.<br />Evil Dead II is still held in high regard by horror fans today.
B00008G7UF|5|A charming movie with a stellar cast.
B00BMKH5NW|5|I really enjoyed Eleanor and Park, which is what led me to read more from Rainbow Rowell. This story was just as great.
B006BG7RI0|5|This was a great find and on sale for the holidays, Arrived earlier than quoted date which is always great, everything was in perfect condition and would recomend this to any collector, its a great film and this is a great boxset. thanks for the perfect professionalism.<br /><br />Mr. Ian Hardison
B007DJUO8O|5|Absolutely stunning beautiful music...I have every PORCUPINE TREE album, all of Steven Wilson's solo records and a few OPETH too and this is right up there with my favorites from both groups.  You will not be disappointed to have this in your collection.  Ten Stars!
B00E5Q1LTY|5|Awesome movie!!!
B001VLXNLU|5|Really enjoyed it! The only thing I didn't like about the book was that it only took me two days to read it lol. Don't get me wrong, it kept me interested and hooked through the whole book. But after I finished it, I was left feeling empty, until I bought the second book less then an hour later... ;D
B00BLCHZC2|5|excellent series.i am enjoying everything
054579191X|5|My 13 year old son loved these books he could not put them down until they we're finished!
B005LY4B0A|5|This game is alot of fun to play. I would recommend it for hours of fun. Great for all ages
B00JDKWUCY|1|I'm sure this game would be great... if it were possible to properly control.  Or at the very least if it had an undo button.  But without either it's just as very pretty extremely frustrating waste of time.
B0084IG7KC|5|Your wife will love it. You'll love not having to watch it with her.
0920668372|5|Once a year since the book came out my teachers would read us this book.  When I finally took it home my mother cried.  She buys as many copies as she can gives them to all of the mothers she knows.
B0050PYNP8|5|I am slowly building my DVD library and often I find myself wanting to watch a video that is entertaining, with an excellent script, good acting, pleasing sets, and a strong story.  This film delivers on all counts.  Especially enjoy all the references to other alien films.  This is such a great film, that I bet I have watched it at least a dozen times over the months that I have owned the DVD.  Another aspect of the DVD that I enjoy is the audio commentary.  Get it!
B00BMT9SQA|2|I had high hopes.  It took a good while before we laughed, and the laughter never lasted too long.  Predictable and mildly entertaining is about as good as it gets.
B0067R0APK|1|Save your money-Accuweather the free app has more to offer than this one. I thought I'd have more maps,or something to make it an asset to own, but its a complete dud. Its even slower than the free one!
B0035JRVBO|5|Had the kids watch it for the first time, and they loved it too.  They asked if all the stuff was real (mostly the Bubba Gump shrimp of course!).
B005LAII8K|5|It will keep your attention throughout the duration of the movie.  Husband and I originally saw this movie in the theater.  When we really like what we've seen, we will purchase the blu-ray.  This one made the list!
B005LAIGRS|5|The drama is astounding very good acting something different sometimes mysterious captivating, shocking I would definitely recommend to a friend
B00AAQRNQ8|5|Loves this mouse very high quality for the price
B00ARHAAZ6|5|This is such a fascinating and unique take on super heroes. This is a view taken from the philosophy that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The characters were really fun and engaging, the plot fantastic, and the story-telling had me turning pages far into the night.
0671027344|5|I enjoyed this book very much, and it works to its greatest effect if read in one sitting. The characters are complex, and though some may think this is just another teen melodrama it is so much more. Others believe that it is farfetched, but if it were just a regular story it would be bland and uninteresting. It is an author's choice what to put in a story, and stories are interesting because they are not things that would normally happen, if an author wants to have magic in his story he can, but he puts drugs, sex, and teen issues in and its thought to be clich. The simplicity of the main character is what makes the book good, his innocence and his honesty make it worthwhile and that is what makes this book more than a formulaic story. Books are not supposed to be what normally happens, they are supposed to be captivating, they exploit coincidence to their advantage, and while there may be a level of predictability in this story, it is beautifully strewn together and creates an honest point of view for these situations. This book says in plain English what others do not, or only subtly. It is a wonderful book, I give it a 5 out of 5, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0001GOH6Q|5|Between the cinematography, the story telling and the casting, this is by far one of the best movies ever made. Tim Burton is a visionary, Ewan McGregor is perfect as Edward Bloom.
B0094K1K42|4|Something a little different and interesting for once! I'm glad I watched it and it didn't end happily ever after.
B0001FR3IQ|4|Even in 2004, I am constantly finding more great films from 2003.  This movie is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen.  Everything is unpredictable and that is rare in films today.  Halle Berry is an awesome actress and she plays the insane role really good.  Penelope Cruz also surprised me, in playing a psychotic rape victim.  This film really grabbed me and never let go until the end.  It is as if you took Steven King, and then blended it with a little Alfred Hitchcock.  I highly recommend this film for thrill fans as well as people who love Halle Berry.
B009MO57H6|4|Got the first four episodes as a set at WalMart for only $10.  Now I finally know there's room for at least one more after five.  We'll have to see.
B009UX2YAC|5|You play one time and your eyes are hooked soon u will be sticking it you've out concentrating on the game says I'm loving it with a McDonald's carmel frappe in it hand :)
1572814349|3|I love the card stock, the golden edges and the overall presentation of this deck.  However, I feel the energy is much darker than I expected.  I also found it difficult to pick up on divinatory meanings because some of the cards lacked focus. This is great for collecting, but not for a reading.
B00QUSV9MY|5|Loved it, what a pair!!!
B004H4XDBI|5|Love this book!
0062183591|4|Unfortunately marketing departments understand this more than we do.  Great book for people who are curious about human nature and understanding how we think.
B00AB7HESI|5|This is a cool game
B00881VLCE|4|Just got this recently.  For a free app there are quite a few puzzle choices and options for difficulty.  Haven't tried to purchase any new ones yet but I think it would be worth it.
B001FB4W0W|5|I grew up with The Lost Boys, Anne Rice, Buffy, so I was eager to watch True Blood when it came out in 2008. I watched the series on HBO and then bought the DVD set before I ever picked up the books. Now that I've caught up with all of the books, there are drawbacks to each. I can certainly \\"see\\" the characters better putting a face with the books. I understand that the secondary characters had to be developed to flesh out the rest of the show (i.e., Jason, Tara (who's not even in book one), and Lafayette (who's barely in book one). Bill's \\"child\\" came totally out of nowhere, but I absolutely loved her character on the show, and looking forward to more of her.      I understand that we HAD to see beyond Sookie, I get that, but I hope the development of these secondary characters don't overshadow Sookie. She is the show and for the most part, I like Anna Paquin's portrayal. It will certainly be interesting to see what Alan Ball does with Bill's character  as other contenders for Sookie emerge (she practically has a harem of men). Since he's been cast as a lead, I don't see Stephen Moyer really going anywhere, plus his engagement to Anna Paquin is also setting the stage for more Bill in the TV series. I'm hopeful that Alan Ball will allow Bill's image to get \\"dirty\\" and I don't mean crawling out the ground covered in dirt dirty. His later actions in the books should even up the playing field for the villification done to Eric Northman's character. Alexander Skarsgard lives fully up to his role as Eric, even though we see so little of him in the first season. His second-in-command, Pam, is also a delight both on the screen and in the books, so I was very excited to see she was pushed up to a cast regular!     Anxiously awaiting Season 2 on DVD, and hopeful that I pursuade the hubby to let us get HBO again, so I can stay caught up with Season 3!
B009ZZDNT6|2|It gives you an alarm clock. But it also gives you popups repeatedly asking for the upsell.
0395389496|5|I love the Polar Express story - have seen the movie several times and now read the book. It is a classic for little children.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I love geomatry dash now give me my new charactor!!!!!!<br />cool cool game I really love it and still want my ne charactor even more I really cant wait at all.!!!!!!
B003SWNRU2|5|One of the best, if not the best album in a long, long time....Even four years after its release this album is just raw and powerful. Every song still sounds simply superb!
0156027321|2|I really had to force myself to finish this book for my book club. There were glimmers of brilliance, but overall I do not feel that those were plentiful enough to make up for the rest of the book. It was sometimes gory, sometimes boring...not a good read.<br />I would not recommend this book - and I don't say that about too many books! Try something else. I think you will be happier.
B004XZR63M|5|If you are looking for a how to book this book isn't the one for you. It is a book about thinking and how you need to think if you ever want to be rich. It tells you to invest in your financial education. It's a very uplifting book if you ask me.
B00BD99JMW|1|this was disappointing more  in the twilight world than the hunger games you can tell it was written in school
B00004R99F|5|I got exactly what I want so I can't complain. Arrived quickly just before Christmas so that was a bonus.
B009FZHYKU|5|I love every sick twist and surprise that this season has offered... In fact, I'd say this season is the best yet!
B000FCKC4C|5|Life-Changing.
B00BWBHIUG|3|grand kids love this
B003R50FRI|5|I was totally swept up in this story - and even more into it because I live in Melbourne, where the author hails from. My parents remember the news coverage of his escape from prison here.<br /><br />A true writer, Gregory David Roberts' observations of the minutiae of life, as well as his ability to plot like a fiend make this one book I'll be getting, and recommending, to all.
B0006ZE7G2|5|LOVE PINK FLOYD!!!! :) ANYONE WHO IS A CLASSIC ROCK/ PINK FLOYD FAN SHOULD HAVE THIS IN THEIR COLLECTION! :)
0618002227|4|A Review by Jordan<BR>A young hobbit embarks on a journey to destroy the ultimate ring that will release destruction upon Middle Earth if the true owner gets hold of it. The fellowship meets a raider name Strider and he save them from these dark riders who are after the ring. They join up with a dwarf and an elf to make the fellowship of nine.<br />This was a great book with a lot of details and a lot of imagination. It is a book of might and magic, also friendship and the battles against an evil warrior. I enjoyed this book but I didnt like some of the parts where they got into a lot of detail and little actions. I also couldnt fallow all of the different names sometimes, I found myself flipping back and forth though the book asking my self, what was that again, or who is that, but you get a better understanding of the beginning if you have read Tolkiens first book The Hobbit which is kind of the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series.<br />I would recommend this book for those with patience and imagination. If you enjoyed The Hobbit or you like books with wizards, elves, and goblins then you will love this book.
B007QXWV1U|5|It is an awesome app
B00177Y9ZC|4|[[ASIN:1432715186 A Walk Through Life]]If you fatasize about scaling the world than watch Hayden Christensen teleport to the most breathtaking places!        Following up his blockbuster action hit Mr. and Mrs. Smith, director Doug Liman turns to an entirely new genre -- sci-fi -- for this tale of an underground world of teleporters. Based on the novel by Steven Gould, Jumper concerns David (Hayden Christensen), a young man who quite literally wills himself away from his grim family life by teleporting to another place with the power of his mind. Years later, David is using his powers to raid bank vaults, seduce girls in London, lunch on the pyramids, and surf in Fiji. But he soon discovers that he is not the only one bestowed with this unique gift, and all is not well in the world of jumpers. There are people out there, such as Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), who view jumpers as a threat to all humankind, and have made it their mission in life to eliminate them. After jumping back to Michigan to get reacquainted with his long lost love, Millie (Rachel Bilson), David makes the acquaintance of experienced jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell). Informed by Griffin of a secret between jumpers and a shadowy group that seeks to destroy them, the pair soon finds themselves facing off against a legion of murderous opponents who won't stop fighting until every last jumper has been eliminated.
B0090X4GLW|5|This is a &#34;watch it again and again&#34; type of movie, if you like really good vocal talent!!  I thought the cast was wonderful, and really showed off their varied &#34;pipes&#34;....just their own voices, no musical instruments.  Really loved it.
B00004XPPK|5|Great movie.  Enjoyed every moment !!
B0064X7FVE|5|I consult The Weather Channel often, just to see what's up where I live. Nice to have it available all the time.
B00KA7JIII|5|Enjoyable puzzler with seamless and pleasing artwork.
B00SM3VALA|5|This is a fantastic CD.  Marcus' best CD so far.
0782002064|5|My husband and I have a tradition of watching this movie every Christmas.  While we were watching it this year, the tape broke.  I immediately got on Amazon.com and ordered another one.  We watched it this weekend and were SO excited that it was exactly the same movie we have had for years.  Thank you!!!
B009P3N1GI|5|Brandon Sanderson's novella is a super read.  Well written and paced, with an original take on art and the ideas of originality and greatness.<br /><br />Definitely worth purchasing, and enjoy this light read!
B008K9UZY4|4|Now, I'm not a huge fan of Sonic, but still, this game is amazing. Vivid, wonderful colors, tremendous replay value, and great controls. Why can't the newer Sonic titles be like this?
B00BHMETKC|5|EXCELLENT MOVIE. I WAS INTRIGUED FROM THE GET-GO. MOVIE WAS TO THE POINT AND FAST MOVING. GREAT PERFORMANCES BY ALL ACTORS.
B00006AW2G|4|It's hard to top Beggars Banquet, but they come close. Keith plays most of the guitars so they are mostly a four piece band here. <br />
B000F0UV0E|5|I just wanted to ad my recommendation to those that just loved this CD. This is one on the best Cd's I have listened to in years, every song is filled with intimacy and depth. Most Cd's I get I feel lucky if there are 2 or 3 good songs on them. This CD, every song is a winner. I can'y find a single song I don't like. If you heard a song on the radio off this Cd and your thinking of getting it, you will like the CD even more. Get this CD, you won't be sorry.
B00683JLXA|1|I got this as the FAOTD. GlaI I didn't pay for it. I play one level and it freezes on the nextt.  Ihave to shut it down and start it again to be able to play the next level i
B00BUCXVPI|1|Didn't like movie at all
B00E8KLWB4|3|It's a pretty fun game. Definitely has tested my ability of to be more focused and not rush through things.
B004K4AUZW|5|I may be biased writing this review, mainly cause Lady Gaga is my absolute favourite artist. But objectively speaking, this album was fabulous! I was waiting for Born This Way for quite a while and did not disappoint! When I first collectively listened through the entire album, it was different, I couldn't tell if it was in a good or bad way. However, after a few listens, it occurred to me that this was just a different side of Gaga. The Fame Monster (my favourite album, although it was an EP) was more of a dark and twisty edge to it. Born This Way, at least to me is more of a celebration of who she is, shown especially in Edge of Glory. To people who believe that these songs are commercial and that Gaga has lost what originally brought her stardom--you're wrong!! Who else but Gaga could have a saxophone interlude in her songs and still have it play on the radio. On behalf of all your fans, thank you Gaga for the happiness you have brought to our ears!

0684800713|3|I have to say I was shocked at the gratuitous homophobia, anti-Semitism and racism that Hemingway trots out from the first page on ....OK, so it was written in 1926...still! And the ridiculousness about Jake's war injury making him incapable of making love...puh-lease! Did he lose his fingers and tongue along with his nether parts? I didn't get that impression. I thought the very crux of the book was his relationship w/the proprietor of the hotel where Jake, his pals and the bullfighters stayed. Jake first of all concurs w/Montoya that the pure young bullfighter, Romero, shouldn't be exposed to the decadence of the British officials who invited him to a soiree...Jake and Montoya agreed that the invitation should simply not be communicated to the bullfighter.  Shortly thereafter, Jake colludes in Brett's seduction/corruption of that same 19 year old local hero.  After the bullfighter ends up beaten to a bloody faced pulp, Montoya shuns Jake, obviously blaming him for his part in the whole fiasco. Jake, retreats to France where he waxes on about how good it is to be in a place where people are your friends if you over-tip them; so much simpler and easier to deal with than being in a place (Spain) where the friendships are more mysterious-- alluding, though in not so many words, to his previously valued relationship with Montoya who shared his love and understanding of all the nuances of bulls and bull fighting. I take it as an indication of Jake's cynicism that he doesn't even apologize to Montoya for \\"spoiling\\" the bullfighter...just blows off what had been a special camaraderie.
B001974DG0|5|No matter how hard Koontz tried to write another book as good as 'Watchers', it would be impossible.  I read everything I find written by Koontz and he has some great books but none like 'Watchers'.  You will laugh, cry, fear, worry and even feel pity for the 'evil one'.  I have no doubt that Koontz's dog 'Trixie&#34; is the model for our hero.  This is a book that you will find hard to put down.  Enjoy!
0440217563|2|I really liked the original Outlander book. This is the third book in the series and sadly it's starting to fizzle out for me. The storyline is getting too removed from the historical Highland for me. Also, the lengthy &#34;erotic encounters&#34; are plain annoying and weird at this point - time to fast forward or flip past pages of the usual and predictable scenes that add absolutely nothing to the story. I am currently reading Drums of Autumn and it will very likely be the last book I read in this series. Loved Outlander, enjoyed Dragonfly in Amber - but this book is only mildly entertaining at best.

B0040JHL9U|3|Brooks is one of only a handful of shoemakers that make the 13B size that fits my feet. Unlike Nike, I can depend on Brooks to offer pretty much the same shoe year-after-year so I know what I'm getting when I order. These shoes have gotten very expensive, though. I usually buy last year's shoe at a discount, but no such luck this time. And they're all out of the blue that I wanted, so I had to pay full price for the sucky red.
B00BSBXZDY|4|I wasn't blown out of the water, but it was a very good movie.  The personalities of the characters are awesome - although Hugh Jackman's character can be quite annoying.

The main subject, Pak Jun Do, evolved from a cog in the machine, to an extraordinary individual in a country that will &#34;cancel&#34;  anyone, for anything.

B004J4WLB4|5|I thought this book dealt beautifully  with the broken bonds of love between parents and children. The struggle of learning to love and trust another human being  after the ultimate rejection of a parent. I found this book to be very touching and heart rending as we experienced the life of all the characters in this book who had painful issues, but in the end found healing and comfort through  found hope and found love
B0091REZMW|2|I love hidden object games, but this one is way too complicated.  And, the screens are dark adn the objects may blend into the dark background in some cases.  I see no help buttons, so it is assumed you know what the heck is going on.
B00571F26Y|3|I liked reading some of the history of wheat and learned a lot on how we have changed the genetics of wheat to help grow very strong, but high carbo, plants to feed our growing population.  I do question some of the author's research quoted on his belief that too much wheat can cause mental illness issues. That part of the book didn't seem too well researched and based on very small research.  I liked reading the book, but not sure I will read it again or recommend it.

B000F1IQNM|2|There's no danger of this series ever becoming classic.  I read the books first, which weren't easy to track down (I had to use Interlibrary Loans to find and get them).  The books were atrocious to say the least.  It was not difficult to reason why they were out of print and almost impossible to find.  Why Emma Thompson would pick them to make into films is unfathomable.  Although, admittedly, she did make the first movie slightly more palatable than the books she almost based it on.<br /><br />Barely watchable, it's not a keeper and I've no desire to seek out the sequel or the movie that's supposed to follow it.
B000VK7KVQ|4|I enjoyed the story line.  Robert Downey Jr played a good role, but missed his character at the closing of the movie.

The story involves a really disfunctional family , and wends its way from Afghanistan , to Paris to the states. The characters are fascinating,a and  the places they live come to life as well.
B00PDKFETO|5|How long has it been since you treated yourself to an Agatha Christie? I finished this quick read, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, which is a fun 'fix' for what might be ailing you. Hastings and Poirot are at it again solving a locked door mystery...or was the door really locked? I love this genre of Classic Mysteries, and this one can be added to a reading list for any mystery writing class. This is how it is done!

0783228007|5|After all of the negative reviews, I wasn't expecting much so I was very surprised how much I liked this movie.  I found this far more interesting and compelling than most of Eastwood's westerns.  Robert Duvall played a great villain and the story and scenery were top notch.

030746363X|4|The 4-Hour Body is a great title, and plys into the author's other \\"4-Hour\\" themes.  Whether you can truly live on 4 hours of sleep, or have a hardbody in 4 hours a month at the gym strikes me as questionable - but certainly inticing enough to read about - and maybe even try.<br /><br />The better elements of the book revolve around the need for an intelligent diet program, and an exercise program that is going to get you moving, but not be so crazy as to consume your life.  The diet is a mix of Atkins, South Beach, and other low-carb/slow-carb diets.  There is a focus on measurement that belies the author's business roots.  And more than anything - what gets measured gets managed, and vice versa.  If the approach works, it is as much because of the measurement as the diet itself.<br /><br />The high intensity training (HIT) approach to exercise is both well proven and reasonably well discussed in the book.  Having said that, I am a believer that it is truly effective only with the use of a trainer or accountability partner, as most of us are not disciplined enough to push to failure on our own.  However, something is better than nothing, and Ferriss doesn't make it look impossible to follow.<br /><br />Finally, of course, there are the sex and superhuman claims of the title.  If you can have a super body, sleep 2 hours per day, be healthy, rich and successful - probably you are superhuman and sex won't be much of an issue.  For the rest of the world, it's good marketing, there are some mildly interesting elements here, but certainly nothing that will really make you a superhuman love machine (unless you can hit the prefecta noted at the beginning of the paragraph).<br /><br />The 500+ pages also goes into medical baselining and supplimentation.  Both are somewhat expensive and may or may not be right for every reader.  Having said that, the book covers the information in some detail and the author's writing style makes it interesting to read.<br /><br />What gets measured gets managed, and this book and program will get you measuring and managing your body. That alone, as well as the pretty entertaining writing style, makes the book worth a read.easured gets managed, and this book and program will get you measuring and managing your body.

B00J2VSS0C|3|This have is OK. Just anther hidden object game.
B00BD99JMW|3|The ending made absolutely no sense. The first book was the best. After that, the series lost its focus and the plots became more muddled. The protagonist was just beginning to develop her character when everything came to a screeching halt.
B00B7NPRY8|3|Perhaps in 1953 this concept was original.  That is an ordinary human who trains intensly to become masterful and then changes the course of history once joining forces with the down trodden.  Maybe because of Frank Herbert it has come around many many times.

0446530891|4|In 1996 Secret Service Agent Sean King guards presidential candidate Clyde Ritter during a rally when his attention is diverted for the longest second of his life.  In that moment a killer assassinates Ritter.  Though King kills the murderer his career died on that day.  He since accepts leg work for a legal firm that pays well, but is quite boring.<br />In 2004 Secret Service Agent Michelle Maxwell protects presidential candidate John Bruno until he heatedly demands she and her entourage give him a moment to pay his respects to the widow of a close friend.  Michelle does but John vanishes.  Michelle's fast track to the White House is now a one way ticket to the out house.  Former agent turned security guru Joan Dillinger is retained to locate the abducted candidate.<br />The cases are similar in many respects.  King and Maxwell reluctantly join forces to find who distracted Sean and who set up Bruno (even as a Buick tracks their progress) as both wants to regain their shattered reputations.  As they follow clues across the country, neither can picture what is going on and if they do they will become victims too.<br />Though quite exciting as expected by a David Baldacci thriller, SPLIT SECOND lacks an acceptable full blooded villain.  Instead the culprit seems more of a caricature than a real challenge to the terrific trio working the case.  The tale is powerful when the good guys interact as sleuths or in a romantic triangle.  Though not quite LAST MAN STANDING, readers will enjoy this fast-paced, action-packed tale.<br />Harriet Klausner
B005Z271Y6|5|Ok, saw this Blu-Ray and had to take the chance and see how it was. It was amazing!!! She is so talented and funny to watch also. It is almost like she connects with you through the show. So glad I added this to my concert collection on Blu-rays! You will NOT be disappointed buying this one. Buy one for yourself and as a gift to give to someone else. The video is high quality and the sound is amazing! Very good quality Blu-Ray. I will be watching this one many times. Thanks Adele!

B000RPTQ1C|5|Coldplay's fourth studio album, \\"Vida la Vida or Death and All His Friends\\", was released on June 11th, 2008 and was an immediate success both with the critics as well as with the public.  The album went to #1 in numerous countries, and eventually won the Grammy award for the Best Rock Album.  Though a relatively short album for these days, only 47 minutes, it is nonetheless large in message and scope.  Some have criticized it because it lacks an edge, which often great albums have, but in spite of that, or perhaps because of it, it is noteworthy.  In any case, it is true to what the group has always been.    It opens with \\"Life in Technicolor\\" a very pleasant instrumental introduction to the album which sets the tone for the whole album.  There is a longer version of the song that has lyrics titled \\"Life in Technicolor II\\" which appears on the 2008 EP \\"Prospekt's March\\".  \\"Cemeteries of London\\" is a beautiful song, with intriguing lyrics.  \\"Lost!\\" follows along the same lines as a slow melodic piece.  \\"42\\" starts off along the same lines, but then transitions into a higher-energy piece.  \\"Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love\\" continues to play to the strength of the band, with a strong melody and interesting lyrics, the first half having a good driving rhythm, and then transitioning into a very slow a melodic second half.    \\"Yes\\" opens up the second half of the album and is another example of how the band can produce similar pieces, and yet make them sound completely different.  There is a hidden piece at the end of \\"Yes\\" called \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\".  The title track \\"Viva la Vida\\" is next, and is a piece destined to be around for a long time as a classic.  \\"Violet Hill\\" is next, the first anti-war piece from the group.  \\"Strawberry Swing\\" is next, a nicely crafted piece which leads well into the closing piece.  \\"Death and All His Friends\\" is a nice simple closing to the album, though it doesn't actually close the album as there is a hidden instrumental piece called \\"The Escapist\\" which forms a nice bookend with the opening \\"Life in Technicolor\\".    Coldplay is Chris Martin (lead vocals, keyboards, guitar), Johnny Buckland (lead guitar), Guy Berryman (bass guitar), and Will Champion (drums, backing vocals, other instruments).  \\"Viva La Vida\\" is a very melodic and thoughtful album, which is well-crafted musically and lyrically.  From their start, Coldplay was a highly thought of musical group and this is their best album to date, and that wasn't an easy goal to achieve.

B000FC2KL0|5|Scar Tissue is the story from beginning to end of Anthony Kiedis' experiences growing up, entering the music scene, relapsing and meeting his many loves. The reader gets the feeling that you may actually be getting to know the really front man, Kiedis. Kiedis' diction allows you to really hear how he speaks and tells stories. He's a great storyteller and has an amazing memory despite the drug use. I highly recommend this book for it's style, adventures and rock history.
B00000AF98|2|\\"Crazy Nights\\" is a strange album...chocked right in the center of the burgeoning pop/glam metal of the late 80's, it straddles the line between being completely in style, but also being horribly out of place.<br /><br />The first problem with \\"Crazy Nights\\" is the material...it's loaded with weak, unfocused songs which harken back to the first pop phase of Kiss circa 1980; the second problem is the somewhat lackluster performances, particularly from Gene Simmons, whose attention again was drawn away from Kiss to his movie career at the time.<br /><br />Just prior to \\"Crazy Nights\\", Simmons had completed the stupid horror film \\"Trick Or Treat\\", and was filming the equally dumb \\"Never Too Young To Die\\" while the album was being recorded. His presence is diminished, appearing only on \\"No No No\\" and \\"Thief In The Night\\", both of which sound very uninspired and derivative.<br /><br />The third problem is with the production...Stanley (& allegedly Simmons) had produced the last two albums, but this time they opted for an outside producer; they chose veteran producer Ron Nevison after both expressed a mutual desire to work with the other. Nevison had produced albums for Thin Lizzy, UFO, The Who, Ozzy Osbourne, and most successfully, Heart; but choosing him to produce the album had a nearly disastrous effect for Kiss.<br /><br />Nevison's production on \\"Crazy Nights\\" is both slick and smooth, but also flat and dull; the heavy rock edge is melted away again as keyboards and synthesizers make a sudden reappearance and dominate much of the proceedings, especially on the lame tracks \\"My Way\\", \\"Turn On The Night\\", and the Heart ripoff \\"Reason To Live\\", which was released as a single and a video, both of which went nowhere. Once more, Kiss fans were scratching their heads in disbelief.<br /><br />This would mark the second time in the band's career that they began facing a sharp decline in their fan base, as well as record sales and concert attendance; Kiss would again need a miracle, but it would still be some time in coming.racle, but it would still be some time in coming.

B00JDB4BS4|5|\\"Dear Friend,<br />As you know, I have always been a great admirer of Mr. v. Karajan, and his magnificent recording of my works has given me the keenest satisfaction.... his great artistic line and the inner beauty of the interpretation have deeply impressed me. I beg you to present my grateful greetings to him.<br />With all best wishes, Very sincerely yours,<br />Jean Sibelius\\"<br />(letter to EMI producer Walter Legge, 15 September 1954)<br /><br />The World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Jean Sibelius, who lived until 1957, was rather promiscuous in his endorsements.<br />In addition to Karajan, he also recommended Barbirolli, Beecham, Kajanus, Koussevitzky, Ormandy, Schneevoigt, Stokowski, and Toscanini.<br />- Eight conductors who recorded at least one Sibelius symphony prior to World War II.<br /><br />Herbert von Karajan joined their ranks in the 1950's.<br />The 90 year-old Legend had kind words for the young conductor's first Sibelius recordings.<br />(although by then his recommendations were a bit suspect).<br />I don't believe Karajan and Sibelius ever met, so the composer's judgement was based solely on Karajan's Philharmonia recordings of Symphonies 4 and 5.<br /><br />Karajan championed Sibelius' Symphonies over a thirty year period:<br /><br />Symphony 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------- Berlin EMI 1981<br />Symphony 2 --- Philharmonia 1960 ------------------------------------- Berlin EMI 1980<br />Symphony 4 --- Philharmonia 1953 ---------- Berlin DG 1965 ----- Berlin EMI 1976<br />Symphony 5 --- Philharmonia 1952,1960 --- Berlin DG 1965 ----- Berlin EMI 1976<br />Symphony 6 --- Philharmonia 1955 ---------- Berlin DG 1967 ----- Berlin EMI 1980<br />Symphony 7 --- Philharmonia 1955 ---------- Berlin DG 1967 ------------------<br /><br />[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]<br /><br />PHILHARMONIA ORCHESTRA in the EMI/Warner box: [[ASIN:B00JDB4ASA Orchestral Spectaculars: Handel To Bartok -  Philharmonia & Bpo 1949-1960]]<br />Between 1952 and 1955, Karajan recorded Symphonies 4 through 7 in mono, in London with the Philharmonia Orchestra.<br />These are the recordings that Sibelius enthused about.<br />In 1960, he remade Symphony 5 in stereo, plus his first recording of Symphony 2.<br /><br />BERLIN PHILHARMONIC: If you want Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic performing all the Sibelius Symphonies,<br />You are out of luck.<br />Karajan never conducted the Third Symphony,<br />but he made nine recordings of the other six symphonies in Berlin.<br /><br />This box has the late recordings on EMI: Symphonies 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, recorded 1976-1981<br />(1, 2 and 6 are DDD).<br /><br />For Symphony 7 you need Karajan's middle period recordings on DG - an inexpensive 2 CD set: [[ASIN:B00000J9HE Sibelius: Symphonies Nos. 4-7]], recorded 1965-1967.<br /><br />Now you will have one Berlin Philharmonic recording of Symphonies 1, 2 and 7, and duplicates of 4, 5 and 6.<br />The duplicate symphonies are quite different between DG and EMI, so its a justifiable expenditure:<br />Symphonies 4 and 5 on EMI are slower and darker.<br />Symphony 6 is surprisingly quicker.<br /><br />You will still be missing Symphony 3, but that can't be helped.<br />(for Symphony 3 in stereo, the World's Foremost Authority recommends John Barbirolli.* )<br /><br />Karajan was unpredictable. Between his earliest Philharmonia and final Berlin recordings:<br />Symphonies 2 and 4 became slower<br />Symphonies 6 and 7 became faster<br />Symphony 5 was unchanged (after some  wide swings)<br /><br />The four recordings of Symphony 5:<br />32:29 in 1952, quickening to 30:47 in 1960,<br />slowing to 31:34 in 1965, and finally, in 1976, back to where he started (32:33).<br />Perhaps he decided that Sibelius was right about that 1952 recording.<br /><br />My personal preference is for either of the Philharmonia recordings of the 5th Symphony over the two Berlin versions.<br />Mostly because of the superior horn section of the Philharmonia Orchestra, led by Dennis Brain in 1952 and Alan Civil in 1960.<br />Heroic horn playing matters in the 5th above all Sibelius symphonies.<br /><br />Symphony 2:<br />Timings for the first two movements are virtually identical in 1960 and 1980.<br />Once again the superiority of the 1960 Philharmonia brass is telling.<br />In 1980 Berlin, the scherzo and finale are two minutes slower and more openly emotional - what a younger Karajan might have criticised as too \\"Tchaikovskian\\".<br />A criticism that could also be leveled at Karajan's only recording of Symphony 1 in 1981.<br /><br />But I kind of like \\"Tchaikovskian\\" Sibelius (see also Barbirolli and Bernstein).<br />Guilty pleasure.<br />Overall I prefer the Philharmonia 2nd Symphony, but would not be without the Berlin recording for it's more heart-on-sleeve emotionalism.<br /><br />This EMI/Warner box includes additional Karajan/Berlin Philharmonic recordings:<br />- En Saga: only recording (1976)<br />- Karelia Suite: only recording (1981 digital)<br />- Swan of Tuolema: recording 2 of 3 (1976)<br />- Tapiola: recording 3 of 4 (1976)<br />- Valse triste: recording 3 of 4 (1980 digital)<br />- Finlandia: recording 4 of 5 (1976)<br /><br />Additional Sibelius recorded by Karajan on DG:<br />- Violin Concerto (w/ Christian Ferras) - only recording: [[ASIN:B00000E3HR Sibelius: Violin Concerto, Finlandia, Tapiola]]<br />- Pelleas et Melisande Suite - only recording: [[ASIN:B00008CLNS Grieg / Sibelius: Peer Gynt, Holberg Suite / Finlandia, Tapiola, Valse Triste]]<br /><br />Even if you are not a Karajan devotee, you should probably investigate his Sibelius recordings.<br /><br />* Among the favored pre-war conductors, only Barbirolli went on to record the complete set in stereo: [[ASIN:B00D56ACOK Sibelius: Complete Symphonies]]<br />Recommended.<br />It doesn't cost a lot, and you can form your own judgement about Symphony 3.<br /><br />- after Barbirolli and Karajan, the favored conductor who recorded the most Sibelius in the stereo era was Eugene Ormandy, who recorded Symphonies 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 with the Philadelphia Orchestra.<br />Sony could give us a nice box.<br /><br />Ormandy does not get the critical respect routinely accorded many of his contemporaries, but<br />the World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Sibelius, and<br />the World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Rachmaninov, and<br />the World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Shostakovich<br />would beg to differ.ymphony 2:  Timings for the first two movements are virtually identical in 1960 and 1980.  Once again the superiority of the 1960 Philharmonia brass is telling.  In 1980 Berlin, the scherzo and finale are two minutes slower and more openly emotional - what a younger Karajan might have criticised as too \\"Tchaikovskian\\".  A criticism that could also be leveled at Karajan's only recording of Symphony 1 in 1981.    But I kind of like \\"Tchaikovskian\\" Sibelius (see also Barbirolli and Bernstein).  Guilty pleasure.  Overall I prefer the Philharmonia 2nd Symphony, but would not be without the Berlin recording for it's more heart-on-sleeve emotionalism.    This EMI/Warner box includes additional Karajan/Berlin Philharmonic recordings:  - En Saga: only recording (1976)  - Karelia Suite: only recording (1981 digital)  - Swan of Tuolema: recording 2 of 3 (1976)  - Tapiola: recording 3 of 4 (1976)  - Valse triste: recording 3 of 4 (1980 digital)  - Finlandia: recording 4 of 5 (1976)    Additional Sibelius recorded by Karajan on DG:  - Violin Concerto (w/ Christian Ferras) - only recording: [[ASIN:B00000E3HR Sibelius: Violin Concerto, Finlandia, Tapiola]]  - Pelleas et Melisande Suite - only recording: [[ASIN:B00008CLNS Grieg / Sibelius: Peer Gynt, Holberg Suite / Finlandia, Tapiola, Valse Triste]]    Even if you are not a Karajan devotee, you should probably investigate his Sibelius recordings.    * Among the favored pre-war conductors, only Barbirolli went on to record the complete set in stereo: [[ASIN:B00D56ACOK Sibelius: Complete Symphonies]]  Recommended.  It doesn't cost a lot, and you can form your own judgement about Symphony 3.    - after Barbirolli and Karajan, the favored conductor who recorded the most Sibelius in the stereo era was Eugene Ormandy, who recorded Symphonies 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 with the Philadelphia Orchestra.  Sony could give us a nice box.    Ormandy does not get the critical respect routinely accorded many of his contemporaries, but  the World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Sibelius, and  the World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Rachmaninov, and  the World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Shostakovich  would beg to differ.
B00Q7WBFTA|1|I was disappointed with the whole thing.  I was expecting something more from the talent that was assembled for this.  I guess I am just not a musical fan.
B002QE3CTY|5|Its the perfect combination of sci-fi and mystery, with a dash of romance. Can't wait until I get the scorch trails to continue this dystopian novel
B00FPOSDGY|3|I honestly don't know how to describe this book.  I let it marinate for awhile after I finished, but I'm still not sure as to what my feelings are.<br /><br />Cadence (Cady) is the character we follow.  She is part of the Sinclair family which is well off.  The Grandparents are the head, they have three daughters, Penny, Carrie, and Bess who each have their own kids. four of whom are known as the Liars.  The four Liars are three cousins, Johnny, Mirren, and Cadence, and then there's Gat who is Johnny's sort of cousin (not by blood, but his mom's boyfriend's nephew).  Every summer, the entire family goes to this private island Grandad owns.  But Cadence hasn't been there in two years, not after she got in a swimming accident in which she hit her head on a rock and got amnesia.  She doesn't remember summer fifteen (this is basically how she measures time, summer fifteen when the lot of them were fifteen, summer seventeen etc.).  No one will tell her what happened then either.<br /><br />I was expecting some awesome story full of deception and mystery where I'd be constantly scratching my noggin.  The scratching of the noggin occurred, but that was it.  It was written well, flowed, and was a quick.  I was thinking, okay, maybe Cadence didn't get amnesia in a swimming accident.  Maybe it was something like her Gramps was a sicko and raped her, or she saw something she shouldn't have.  Plus, I was and am still confused as to why she calls her group the Liars.  She didn't even remember what had happened, and she called them that beforehand, so what made them Liars?  But then, the &#34;twist&#34; that everybody always talks about in this book occurred, and I literally was just dumbfounded.  In a WTH just happened and why sort of way.<br /><br />I don't know.  I guess it just wasn't what I expected, maybe a bit over-hyped.  I was just confused and wanted to ask someone, did you read this ending or was mine a misprint.<br /><br />Happy Reading!!!
6305078181|3|I bought this DVD, because I love horror films, and it was priced right at the time; I think I found one of the only remaining copies out there at SunCoast, now that Image has lost it's liscense to produce this movie.  It was actually clearence-priced.  As far as DVDs go, this one is a poor production.  At first, I thought it had somehow become a black and white film since I first saw it on the big screen in the 80s, but then I fiddled with the color and contrast till I finally found some color and contrast.  I've never seen this on any of the hundred or so DVDs I've got, but for some reason it begins playing in black and white and you HAVE to adjust it for color.      Hmm.  Extras.  There are none.  I kept hitting the menu button, trying to find out how in hell the movie became black and white in past twenty years.  Nothing but a scene access menue.    Sound.  Good.  Though I hear this version is missing some of the original music score because of legal complications.  Too bad.    Now the movie.  It really is the stage-play version, and not Bram Stoker's novel, that is brought to the screen.  So, as always, it suffers from artsy interpretations that somehow confuse love with sex, and not very good sex if you happen to be the victim.  I think Langella's performance was good.  And I've always thought Kate Nelligan was a very beautiful actress.  Donald Pleasence, one of my all-time favorite horror character actors, was nearly wasted here, because he's always had a strong presence that just wasn't allowed to come out here.  Olivier is stout, and always gives a good performance, as he did here.  But I felt his character needed more fleshing out.  Still, I wanted to cry with him, after he had to stake his vampiric, half-decayed daughter through the heart; this scene better than all the others having to do with vampirism in the film, helps to illustrate the evil that is Dracula.    The ending.  Too bad.  I liked the kill scene, though it still doesn't top the one in Hammer's Horror of Dracula.  But then they went and blew it by having an ambivelent moment at the very end, when Lucy looks up at the fluttering remains of Dracula, now \\"kiting\\" away from his scene of destruction, and we get a mysterious, dreamy smile, as if to say, hey, he'll be back, and it's okay if he wants to suck my blood and turn me into a fiend that kills babies and damns them to hell, sure, why not.    Now, why I still like the film.  Badham did, I thought, a good job of bringing to the eighties a Hammer-style period piece.  There's plenty of atmosphere here, and a wonderfully creepy scene in the graveyard, when Van Helsing has to crawl under his daughter's coffin to gain access to her secret tunnels, an abandoned mine that runs all through the underside of the town.  I loved the castle, and I thought the scenes along the ocean front, where people milled about looking at the wreckage of the ship that brought Dracula to thier town, were beautiful.      I remember now, after watching the DVD, that I walked out of the theater back in the 80s feeling slighted, but still having enjoyed the film.  I think Badham is a good director, I just think he relied too much on the stage-play version of this story, and should've gone back to the source, the novel.  After all, the best movies are still the ones that follow our favorite books the closest.    Update:  This movie has been re-released on DVD.  It's reasonably priced, and if you are a Dracula Completest, as I sometimes feel I am, you'll want to get this newer release.  Nice anamorphic widescreen transfer.  Still the same picture, but a much nicer transfer.
B000RW3YYA|4|Arrived new and in packaging. Only negative thing is it got to me after Christmas. I buy many DVDs on here and this one took a bit longer to get to me for some reason. Not sure why it took over a week but yeah it's ok. Besides that, it works good and was a good buy.
B00IS87HYI|4|good game, great graphics.

B004QOB8SY|5|My husband enjoys this series & cant wait for more to come out.He watches this series over & over again
B00004WF68|3|This review is only based on the ten original tracks, though there are some great bonus tracks (Paper Sun; Hole in My Shoe; Smiling Phases) that would've undoubtedly boosted the rating had they been included on the original album instead of a few of the dated psychedelic songs Berkshire Poppies; A House for Everyone; Utterly Simple; Hope I Don't Find Me There; and the album-closing jam Giving to You. Psychedelia wasn't Traffic's thing, they were better off playing jazz/folk/rock songs such as Heaven is In Your Mind; No Face, No Name, No Number; Colored Rain and that unforgettable title track, arguably the best song in the Traffic canon. Plus Dealer is a good song, on the misunderstood side - the title does spell drugs, but it's really about a card dealer. A bit of an offbeat subject, but this was 1968. At its best, it's the kind of English Folke that would later inspire Jethro Tull's best work; at worst, it's psychedelic excess vaguely reminiscent of the Rolling Stones' worst work. Thankfully, they would get their sound straight on the next, self-titled album, the latter of which containing several classics (You Can All Join In; Pearly Queen; Feelin' Alright?; 40,000 Headsmen). It's the better buy, but this isn't bad at all.
1907698477|5|[[VIDEOID:mo1H74D89YUSF8]]<br /><br />HAVE A COMPLIANCE OFFICER FOR FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION (COFA)....YOU NEED THIS NEW TOOLKIT FROM THE LAW SOCIETY, WITH ACCOMPANYING CD-ROM<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Yes, the time is fast approaching.  From January 2013, not only must every law firm have an authorised compliance officer for legal practice (COLP), but additionally, a compliance officer for finance and administration (COFA).<br /><br />If you're a practitioner, particularly in a firm, you will certainly have compelling  reasons to acquire this extremely useful book, one of the Law Society's highly regarded and eminently practical `toolkits' (part of the Law Society's risk and compliance service).<br /><br />Each of these helpful `toolkits', is designed to help practitioners cope with the new regulatory environment introduced under the OFR (outcomes-focused regulation) implemented by the SRA, which insists that all law firms large or small must assign top priority to risk management in line with the demands of the Legal Services Act 2007.<br />Produced in handy paperback format with accompanying CD, each `toolkit' contains clear and practical advice that has emerged following this legislation.<br /><br />As all firms will be directly affected, (or possibly indirectly) you might decide to acquire all three toolkits, namely the `Anti-Bribery Toolkit'... `the COFAs Toolkit'... and the `COLPs Toolkit' - all in handy, paperback format. For purposes of this review, we are focusing here on `COFAs Toolkit'.<br /><br />Whether you are appointed as the firm's COFA, or perhaps the partner in charge of overseeing COFA compliance activities in line with general risk management procedures, you'll find this COFAs Toolkit' invaluable in helping you implement and supervise systems for complying with the SRA's (Solicitors Regulation Authority) Accounts Rules.<br /><br />Note that, in being charged with this responsibility, the COFA is regarded as having a more focused role than a COLP and is expected to record all compliance failures and  report them back to the SRA as soon as practicable.  This toolkit is therefore designed to provide the practical and clearly structured advice and assistance needed for the COFA role.<br /><br />As the expert authors point out, (both are from Deloittes with specialist law-based experience) the book highlights the main regulatory requirements relevant to COFAs.  It elaborates on their responsibilities, including reporting requirements, and offers the relevant guidance as well as the relevant range of practical tools, i.e. documents and forms.<br /><br />Further guidance, together with template documents, can be easily accessed from the CD-ROM and adapted to specific requirements.<br /><br />Like its companion volumes, this book - now available from The Law Society -- is distinguished for its clarity ready adaptability to the needs of busy practitioners.<br /><br />The publication date is stated as at April 2012.this responsibility, the COFA is regarded as having a more focused role than a COLP and is expected to record all compliance failures and  report them back to the SRA as soon as practicable.

B00AYR2FOI|5|What do you expect from Boz Scaggs but nice tunes very well done.  That said, I would never have expected to hear a pair of my favorite Mink DeVille numbers covered so nicely.  It's good to know there are artists you can trust.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I love this game.  It has enough variety to keep me interested and is also challenging.  The only thing I would change is that it takes so long to increase your energy needed to play in the game or you have to buy crystals.  I know that's how they make their money, but would prefer more free time play.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Didn't want to put it down.  Very good read.
B000A1SZ2Y|4|I spend the majority of my time shooting macro shots.  I had about reached the magnification limits of a 90m macro lens and series of tube extensions so I was looking for a way to increase magnification even more.  The Raynox 250 added a whole new level.  A little more difficult to use with my ring flash but still doable.  Great addition!
B005869U6G|3|From the moment the pulsing bass and drums come in on track one, you know something is different. It's not Morning View, it's not Light Grenades. It's much more subdued and stripped down. The strings are lush throughout. The production sounds are washed with reverb and 80s drums. If Not Now, When? could arguably pass as one of the greatest b-side records a band has put out.    I'm not sure how to take the record as it doesn't flow cohesively. The songs stand alone by themselves but there's nothing necessarily new here from Brandon and gang. They feel as if they're holding back. There is a lot more melody, which is what guitarist Mike Einziger hyped about before its release. Promises, Promises shows this in it's push and pull structure. That's probably the most \\"old-school\\" of tracks which reminds me of Crow or even Morning View.    Friends and Lovers is a solid track that sounds fresh and has an outstanding middle and end arrangement even though the lyrics fail in comparison.    There's a bunch of throwaway tracks on here. Isadore does nothing for me. The drums are on the verge of annoying.Thieves is not a terrible track but not a great track either causing me to skip it most of the time. Tomorrow's Food stands as a wonderfully beautiful track where every member shines except that it leaves you wanting more. It just doesn't feel finished to me.    Top tracks: The Original as it has a great groove from start to finish and harkens back to Morning View's Just A Phase. Defiance is a fresh acoustic track which has Brandon and Mike shine stripped down. I've always loved the Incubus punk-rock aesthetic, and Switchblade satisfies that with some of Einziger's signature hooks.    Adolescents sums up this record perfectly. A rock record mostly subdued with some fantastic moments though mostly leaves you wondering...what was it all about ??    Despite their effort...there's no denying they still ROCK!    Incubus  If Not Now When?  Rating: 6.5/10    Check more reviews at: [....]
0441003257|5|In the manner of laid-back british sarcasm, which so often makes for pleasant reading, it's easy for an author to overdo it and force the language into Douglas-Adamsesque epithets. (eg Starship Titanic) Luckily,  Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchet have not let anyone down here. Good Omens  for me, does for religion what Douglas Adams did for sci-fi with &quot;The  Hitchhiker's Guide...&quot;. Not only is it clever, zany and just witty  enough, but the author's paint a pleasant story with wonderful characters  as well. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED if you're a fan of Douglas Adams. (or any  other British humour for that matter -- Red Dwarf works just as well)

B001IYCMNA|5|Im sure that the product worked well. i only returned it because the office needed another piece of equipment along with this one. So, in lieu of having both, the office manager opted to get one device that could do everything she wanted it to do.<br /><br />Not sure how helpful this review is going to be. But, it doesn't knock the product at least. It did actually work!
B002750TFM|3|Overall good second part to a great first sci fi horror movie. But still keeps too many questions open ended even after two movies. Everything should have been finished especially with all the crazy hybrid bulls***.
B00GJ7CSHG|2|As one of the great rock vocalists of our time, I feel Paul Rodger's foray into mostly Memphis-based R&B soul standards was a grossly mis-guided adventure.  Virtually everyone of these &#34;modernized&#34; R&B covers proves inferior in comparison to their soulful, heartfelt, bluesy predecessors.<br /><br />Thankfully, there is a single savior on this album.  In my opinion,  the very Van Morrisonesque cover of The Temptation's &#34;It's Growing&#34; provides a unique presentation of this classic composition.
B00G7QPTR0|4|I thought the documentary was very insightful and allowed you to see a lot of what the public doesn't see when she is on stage in her zone.  It was beautifully filmed, executed, and edited.  It was pure and honest.  If you're not a believer of this woman's dedication and soul, then I pity you if this didn't change your mind!<br /><br />I think the concert was an added bonus, but I was a little disappointed with the editing being as I saw this live and it was amazing (and quite frankly better than it's parred down reincarnation, The Mrs. Carter Show).  For one, it's a very scaled down version of the show, which clocked in at nearly if not slightly over two hours.  Several songs from the second half of the show are omitted like \\"I Miss You,\\" \\"Resentment,\\" the Goo Goo Dolls \\"Iris\\" cover, \\"If I Was a Boy,\\" the Lauryn Hill \\"Ex-Factor\\" cover, \\"Countdown,\\" \\"Irreplaceable,\\" \\"Jumpin' Jumpin',\\" and \\"Why Don't You Love Me.\\"  Two, I preferred the show without the editing.  \\"Love On Top,\\" came after \\"End of Time\\" but is played at the end during the credits.  \\"Countdown\\" was a stand-out performance from the show and only the intro was shown here.  \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" was also edited with the solo dancer intro shown first though it was performed at the end.<br /><br />Besides that, a great 2-for-1 bundle for any fan of Beyonce!
B005K0HDGE|4|...if a nightmare is confirmation that King still has it, then King still has it. I've already had one, which amounted to me yelling out &#34;Help!&#34; so loudly my dog jumped off the bed and wouldn't come near me for most of the morning. Seriously, I'm loving this book so far. No, I don't love nightmares, but these characters have me reeled in tightly.  I think I know what's going to happen on 11/22/63, but it's King... so, I'm just kidding myself.
B00E8KLWB4|5|This is an addictive and entertaining game. The graphics are nice and the levels are challenging. The only problem is waiting for energy to recharge.
6300183211|5|Set in the sun-washed shores of Miami SCARFACE tells the tale of Antonio Montana,a smalltime cuban refugee hoodlum who makes his way to miami during Castro's jail evacuation in the spring of 1980.The film shows the rise Tony makes to the top of the Miami drug underworld and his subsequent fall because of bad decision making on his part due to his drug addiction. AL pacino delivers one of his greatest performances in this 1983 classic. The score for this film (done by Giorgio Moroder) is one of the greatest film scores I have ever heard.In the film Giorgio assigns music to each of the main characters(Tony,Gina,Elvira,and Alahandro Sosa)and playsit during critical moments in the film having to do with the character.This and other aspects of the film make it definately one of directer Brian DePalma's greatest masterpieces.
B00005JKBC|4|Took a little longer than expected, but not by much, it was in good condition.
B006LSZECO|4|The plot twists will keel the pages turning. This should be quite the on the edge of your seat movie.
0670022705|5|I highly recommend A History of the World in 100 Objects. It is great book to read as a family. Within as little as 10 to 15 minutes families can read and discuss one object per day. What an inspiring way to teach history to your children, and yourself.
B0055B7IPE|4|SO VERY SAD my 6 yr old  and 10 yr old sobbed through most all parts.  I remembered previews that is about the only funny or light parts there are in the entire movie.  It is a good story but even I cried.  If you have sensitive ones do NOT watch this one.
B000W799NU|5|Wanted to watch all the movies before the premiere of the final one, so I ordered it as soon as I found out I didn't have it. Got it on the second day- just in time! Love it!
B00ESB6GBY|5|I've watched every episode of this show multiple times and consider it to be one of the funniest sitcoms on tv!
B00H71PHS0|5|I thought their handling of Matthew's death was brilliant.  The season could have bogged down badly with a long drawn out funeral, etc.  The new story lines are very intriguing, and the new characters are very acceptable.  It's nice that Moseley finally has a girl!  But what about Daisy?  Is she ever going to find Mr. Right?  Edith's decision to have her baby was a great relief.  Mary's quandry of someone to take Matthew's place has everyone guessing.  I'm not sure that any of the current suitors fit the bill.  And did he, or didn't he?  Mr. Bate's suspicious trip to London certainly makes it appear that he did it!  But, if ever a guy deserved a visit from a vigilante avenger, Anna's rapist sure did!  Way to go, Mr. Bates!  The only thing I didn't like about Season 4?  It's too short, and the wait for Season 5 is going to be tough!
B0058SNI5S|3|I feel like the 3 bears... the first pair I ordered were too small & the size 10 were to large. But they are cute!

B008RJ6TTC|4|CAN'T GIVE 5 STARS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T VIEWED IT....PURCHASED FOR A GIFT BUT I AM SURE IT WILL BE ENJOYED
B009KS4XRO|1|like others wasted too much money on a game with sooo many problems.  Lost a lot of credits and money to have it keep fn up all the time. problems on your side not mine so keep your solutions to yourself. So since I can not play this game no matter what they t.ell me to do, it still crashes and frezees. too bad it was a good when IT WORKED. this game sucks and i'm deleting it  even if i'm losing over 20,000 in coins 300 in credits 100 power up. can't use them on a game that don't work.
0380977788|5|Coraline is the story of a young girl named Coraline (frequently called Caroline by the neighbors) who is unhappy with her life, her parents, and the world that surrounds her. One day she stumbles into an alternate existence which is eerily like her own, only her parents have buttons for eyes, hundreds of rats make up a man in a trench coat, and many other surprises lay in store. <br /> <br />Coraline is an excellent book for children (may be a little scary for young children) and equally as good for adults. This book is haunting and charming at the same time as Neil's books always are. Dave McKean's illustrations are beautiful as usual and add plenty to the atmosphere of the story. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and pick up this book. You won't be disappointed. FYI...this book is about to be made into a movie which I'm sure will be equally as good.
B00IX9UTLU|5|I am very stingy when it comes to handing out stars. There was no way I count give this one five stars. I was enthralled from beginning to end. The characters are masterfully created, and the story is masterfully woven. I fell in love with the story, the angst, the mystery, and the heartache. This is one of the best stories I have read in a while. It was just the page Turner I had been looking for. A Must Read!!!!
B001AQO3QA|5|Still scary... Great addition for collectors of this series and the blu-ray tech is just amazing. The special effects are flawless and the performances are top-notch!
1614270198|5|As always, a remarkable book. This is my second copy as a gift.
B00ANVX6DY|5|I would highly recommend Sofia the First to little girls! We just love watching these shows and are really looking forward for the movie!
B009ZQC7MY|5|Great great great!
B00B8WXG9G|2|Paul Anka is a singer from last century.  I do not dislike his music but I think that he is too advanced in years to add hip hop like beats and hyped up bass licks to his music.  I liked the lyrics and his choice of singing partners, however Leon Russell and Willie Nelson virtually have no voices left.  I disliked the monotonous drum beat which is prominent in rap music.  He should have had Russ Kunkel on drums to provide some terrific drum licks.  The pumped up bass almost obscures the vocals where I couldn't hear all of the lyrics, even after adjusting my iPod's equalizer.  The most enjoyable musical part of this album is Chris Botti's trumpet.  Props to him.  If Paul Anka ever does another album he needs to get a more eclectic drummer and turn down the bass.

B004WKOCP8|5|give it a chance, there are many excelent tracks that will sureley grow on you if you are willing to not judge it so harshly after just 2 release days. yes its not the same as earlier material and yes there is less hard charging by the seat of their pants incubus we all love but brandons voice is so exceptional coupled with an outstanding group of musicians.. this is the creative value of the band that we all love so much, this cd will grow on you. there are several tracts that remind me of the earlier incubus Its a sort of evolution far away from morning view. im very pleased to know that they are back together and i will get to see them live again. Im sure they will play all the songs we love plus a few from this cd. I am a hard rock junkie and this cd is really growing on me in a very short time, i just love brandons voice.  so give it a chance.     TO INCUBUS: Im very glad you guys are back together, im proud of you guys, the cd is excellent! you boys keep up the great work..
B00028HBKM|1|This movie is false advertising. Read the Bible, and you'll know the difference. Secondly, it's unrealistically sanguine.  <br /> <br />This, by the way, was written earlier in someone else's review, as a side note, and after having researched it, I found it to be true:  <br /> <br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" presents a distorted view of the gospels. {The movie} supplemented the Biblical gospel accounts with source material from the diaries of a Catholic mystic (Anne Catherine Emmerich's \\"The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ\\")
B000000OQF|5|I remember being in the halls of junior high school when everywhere I turned there was the back of a black t-shirt with the words \\"Guns N' Roses, Appetite for Destruction\\" typed in yellow and red. Never has a hard rock act captured the imagination of millions like Guns N' Roses did in 1989. From top to bottom this mega metal debut burned white hot, from the opening screech of Axl's devastating howl in the opus \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" through the closing syrupy-sweet sentiment in \\"Rocket Queen.\\" Side 1 (\\"Jungle\\" through \\"Paradise City\\") is the strongest hard rock material ever released at once. \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" is a scorching set that kicked everybody's ... 12 years ago and will do the same for new listeners. This record contains an amplitude of profanity, however, and thus is not suitable for all listeners. For those who don't mind the regular use of the \\"f\\" word will be blown away by high octane numbers like \\"Nightrain,\\" \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" \\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\\" and \\"It's So Easy.\\" I will never get over \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\" It was and still is the best that will ever be released.
B00HMD8WUS|5|This is one of my all-time favorites. I watch it every single day, even if it's just for a few minutes. &#60;3 I wish Danny and Evelyn hadn't gotten pregnant together, but not all love stories are perfect. I also love the soundtrack. Beautiful.
B0084I9QI2|5|I'm so happy I bought this.  Nothing about it was disappointing.  The video was very good quality, and so much better than any BAD concert videos I've seen in the past.
B002SHD9E2|5|Good Grief....can Andrew Lloyd Weber write music or what!  The play has always given me goose pimples and has always been my favorite play.  This movie most definitely did not disappoint!  By the way....what happens when geese get cold?  They get people-bumps!  hehe!
B009IU6BIS|5|This has become a Christmas tradition at my house. Every time we watch it we see something new and funny.

B004LWZW42|5|Probably not the last of the X-MEN series, but this was a great pre-quil. It's great to see the first aliance amoung the muntants, even if they didn't last.
B007L3BMGA|1|Horrid. I had no idea what I was wasting my money on until it was too late.
B00A8ECU24|2|The new update would not work and my sister who is littler than me  is rubbing it in my face!!!
B00AO686L0|5|two of my favorite actors..Al Pacino and Russell Crowe in fine form....an adult type movie in more about substance and story than explosions,car chases and special effects
B0054JZC6E|5|this game is so.much fun you can never be bored because it has so many hales in in big game I love it so much.
B00KGL7Y6Q|5|Excellent!
B00AGOGOLE|1|It was too complicated - and, the pictures were awful - will discontinue/uninstall my Camera HD.  Will shop for another,which I hope will be more satisfactory
B0052RDHTM|5|Excellent! A great read.  Follett creates characters that come alive and intertwines them with real historic people in real historic events. Great!
B00C1S945G|5|Not sure why people dislike this season, we love it! The characters develop and plot lines form that last through the remainder of the series.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|I enjoyed the book and hope he continues to writting stories involving King amd Maxwell. It is an interesting series.
B00FEMJF6O|4|... as the title says, and I have one of the old ones.<br /><br />Another Zynga game, another massive time sink unless you plan to pour out money. That said... it is very well drawn, and not so complex that young children (say, about 10) can quickly get the hang of it.
B004ZG5F0K|5|Crystal clear, great sound for the price. I like this movie and no missing parts. A must for your collection.
B00GY0HJ4K|1|The game sucks.
B0021L8US0|3|We had not done our research on this movie and merely bought a ticket and went in. We expected a SCIFI (which I like but my wife does not) and from this perspective she was positively surprised and I a bit less. It is really a movie with a story disguised behind SCIFI and action... and as there is quite a bit of this disguise the movie at times seems a bit chaotic and losing its audience.<br /><br />The underlying story behind clearly is our (mankinds) inability to deal with extreme poverty, refugee's and opposing cultures and values and for highlighting this the team behind the movie should be applauded but it seems at times they got a bit carried away in their 'cover theme' being SCIFI Action scenes. So it ends up being a quite decent action movie (for those who like this) while still being a movie with a message..... It would probably come up a notch if it somehow attempted to raise suggestions for a solution.<br /><br />Rating somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 stars!
B00G5G7K7O|5|Kids of all ages will love this movie and the two disc set is great.
055338466X|2|I found this to be a very irritating book - both in its content and its style of writing. Certainly hard to believe it came from the same mind as the genius who gave us A Brief History. The book is extremely short (I finished it in 3 sittings) and very uneven in its goals - swinging from some mind-bending science to a detailed explanation of what an ellipse is! Seriously?! It's also sneeringly patronizing, the \\"jokes\\" are rubbish, and it is far, far too sure of its conclusions. It's actually quite ironic that the books goes to great pains to show how science has evolved over the centuries, yet finishes in a manner that smacks of \\"that's it, we know everything, no more silly questions please\\". This could have been a great book. Instead it feels like the SUMMARY of a great book....narrated by a really annoying person.
0679737456|4|This book is interesting, and the author actually spoke at my school (Temple University) which was awesome. She goes into detail within the book and leaves you guessing.
B005BRS8Z6|5|I keep coming back to this book to remind me why I never want to go back to that dark place where I was.  :-)
B0002KVUKM|5|Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman - [[ASIN:B000HEVZ9E X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2 - X-Men United/ X-Men - The Last Stand)]]) turned up on the steps of the Vatican half dead and unable to remember his past, aside from the odd dream and nightmare.  Since then he has become a hunter of abnormal and supernatural beings.  He does this on behalf of the \\"Knights of the Holy Order\\", a secret organisation run by the Vatican.<br /><br />After \\"dealing\\" with Mr Hyde he returns to Rome and is told that his next mission will be to go to Transylvania to assist the Valerious family in conquering Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh - [[ASIN:B00005JM5B The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Widescreen Edition)]]).  If they fail to destroy Dracula they will be cursed to never enter the gates of heaven.<br /><br />Van Helsing takes with him a Friar called Carl (David Wenham - Faramir in [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]]) who is the Order's version of Q, coming up with all of Van Helsing's gadgets, and the films comic relief.<br /><br />Arriving in Transylvania they meet and team up with Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale - [[ASIN:B0000VAFO0 Underworld (Widescreen Special Edition)]]) and go in search of the way to beat Dracula.<br /><br />The start of the film recreates the old black and white Frankenstein movies.  Simon West's \\"It's alive\\" line was sublime for me (I am a fan of the old black and white horror films that I watched as a child).  The Frankenstein monster is played by Shuler Hensley and Igor (Kevin J O'Connor - [[ASIN:B00000JQB5 The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]]).<br /><br />This is the usual fun film from Stephen Sommers, in the same vein as the Mummy, etc.  It does not take itself too seriously.  And there is Kate Beckinsale is there in tight pants for those who like her, and Hugh Jackman and David Wenham for the rest of us.<br /><br />All in all it's a great family film - fun with scary bits.
B00HAKT126|5|Great suspense movie
B004LWZW7Y|4|A clever spin-off from the Shrek films with everyone's favourite cat and some new adventures.<br />Quite suitable for everyone including adults.

B003B02PEU|5|This was a great book. Kept me interested from beginning to end. I'm beginning to be a fan of John Grisham.
B004BLJQOK|4|Really enjoyed this movie, although I liked the original better. Worth watching!
0446547573|5|I saw the movie before I read the book, usually its the other way around but I was not disappointed.  Truly believable and magical.
B00000JGHS|4|Demi Moore is an out of work FBI agent who's trying to regain custody of her child. She resorts to become a stripper &amp; winds up exposing a sleezy congressman of his dirty deeds. DEMI IS HOT HOT HOT!
B00EB6F1TY|5|After reading some other reviews I didn't expect a whole lot from this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by it. This movie was all about Tony getting back to his roots, doing what only he can do. I seriously hope RDJ will continue as Tony Stark/IronMan. This franchise would be nothing without him.
B0019N8P2W|5|Great show.
B0070NSPCU|5|For quite some time now, I find it increasingly difficult<br />to find a good book among the growing mass of badly written<br />fantasy stuff. I almost gave up on the genre.<br /><br />But this book I really liked very much. Good writing, great characters,<br />gripping and intelligent story and thankfully, despite that the main characters<br />are members of an order, not to heavy on the religious angle.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one.
B00J2VSS0C|4|Tough game but fun.

0547884591|4|Want recipes AND outdoor survival tips?  Need a kitchen guide on using liquid nitrogen but includes basic knife skills too?  Have a hankering for a cook book with a few f-bombs thrown in?  If you answered \\"no\\" or was just bewildered by this description, you probably need this book more than you know.<br /><br />The 4 Hour Chef is about learning new skills with cooking just being an example (a big, multi-hundred page example). So the author doesn't lay this out in the traditional 'baking' or 'main courses' sections.  Instead he takes you through a progression designed to teach you cooking from the ground up but landing you in the Michelin Star quality at the end.  Impossible?  Perhaps but the tools, shortcuts and recipes are all there, along with delightful jaunts along the way on how Tim learned many of his skills (these are actually lessons on how to obtain skills yourself, cooking or otherwise).<br /><br />Is this book perfect?  No sometimes (even given the size of the book) he seems to skip a bit between lessons (perhaps by design, maybe you are supposed to fill in from actual experience) and not everyone may appreciate his 'talking with a drinking buddy' style of prose (cursing and all).  However if you are a kitchen-phobic or want to learn Swahili but don't know where to start, then this book will be equally adept at helping you.<br /><br />My only other knock is some mis-steps by Amazon Publishing in the print run.  Although the color pictures, printing quality and paper is generally good, of the 3 copies I purchased (one for me and the other for friends) all had some pages slightly stuck together and one had a tear in the pages from being glued improperly.  No fault of the author, but shame on you Amazon.<br /><br />However, do yourself a favor and get this book - it will expand your mind and (maybe) make you into a great cook. How many books can claim that?
B00N35P5MW|4|You are required to fill a space with puzzle pieces made from Pentagon's. It is quite fun figuring out where all the pieces must go and can become quite challenging. It is well worth some time.
0062255657|5|One of the best books I have even had the treat to read!
B00J2VSS0C|4|This was a fun, well detailed way to intrigue young minds.
B004MC8CA2|5|It is a wonderful. I am able to look at.the sermon notes for many churches accross the country! I love it!
B000SEIDR0|3|I started this book on the advice of my sister.  Didn't care to finish it.
B0015KGWZG|5|Very good book, help me a lot with my personal life.  I feel blessed to have the opportunity to read it.
B007L3BMGA|1|Very badly written novel. I felt as though I was reading a mills and boons novel on steroids. Would never recommend !
B00ILHW6AG|4|The novel was enjoyable and certainly worth the read. King's signature character development was only noticeable in two of the main characters, the narrator and Mr. Jacobs. However, I missed the nail biting tension, which only showed up for the finality of this novel, I generally get throughout King's other novels. Still, I am a huge fan and I enjoyed this book. First time readers of King may not.
B009CCBCU4|5|Want to read more!
B0081KTHEQ|4|I enjoyed this, for the most part. Jumped a lot. Liked that it was a different time period. Good quality. Loved that there was nothing Harry about Arthur. They tried to write an original story line (which is much needed these days) and it was creepy but made no logical sense.  At one point I said to myself &#34;if he goes back to that house, I'm turning this off.&#34; also, *kind of a spoiler* the &#34;climax&#34; ended up not helping; which i found to be dissatisfying and ironically anticlimactic. Maybe if it had been longer (or more scares) with less explaining and more left for the audience to figure out--It would have been the horror film it was intended to be and less on the thriller side. IMHO
B00G0OHMUG|3|Decent 3d to an otherwise classic movie. 3d looks better than the 2d version actually. Lots of fun to be had.
B000BCE918|5|Thank you !!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|1|Sucked
B007IXWKUK|4|Interesting
B004K4IZ3G|4|3 nitpicks that make this movie a 4 instead of a 5.<br /><br />1) The reveal of young CGI Jeff Bridges at the beginning just doesn't sell and looks bad (also on the TV shot where he's giving a speech at Encom). You buy the CGI more once you're on the Grid because it blends better with the environments. They should have kept the reveal of him being de-aged for CLU after the disc wars when Sam is brought before him.<br /><br />2)Tron should have played a bigger part and his face should have been revealed at some point: either when he captures Quorra or when he crashes his light-jet into CLU.<br /><br />3) The very end was a little too \\"Blade Runner\\"-esque, I wish they'd have taken those shots, added in CGI effects and particles of the grid re-appearing around the bike in the real world and then used that as a cool transition into the grid-looking end credits sequence. Could have been a cool bridge instead of a hokey fade to black.<br /><br />In terms of the product, the blu-ray is beautiful, it retains the IMAX aspect ration for a number of scenes and the film itself is a lot of fun!
B002RI9M2U|5|The author has dealt with a sensitive issue in a unique way. The plot line was engaging from start to finish.
B003XE1CU2|4|my shoe size is 7-1/2 but I had heard they ran small so I ordered size 8 and they fit just right.<br />they are really comfy and hold the feet in place so they don't slide off to the side.<br /> they are styled like kiddie's shoes; not very classy for women who want to look good<br />but they are okay to wear at home.
0679882820|5|wonderful book for the little one! Thank you!
B00GT35G9C|5|I just love that sassy, sophisticated, sarcastic, smart Veronica! The dialog is witty and the plots are engaging. The cast is very good (and the cast gets better as the show goes on throughout the season).  I am re-watching the series in 2014 and still find it current. Can't wait to see the recently released movie!
B000031WBV|5|Fast shipment. I love Chopin's nocturnes, and to have this CD available was a dream come true. Thank you so much for offering this for sale.

B000005JA8|5|Don Van Vliet was asked in an interview how he comes up with these strange sounds. \\"I paint them first\\". The guy was also a painter, and later he was (is?) solely a painter. He went as far to state that the music he's done does not represent him any more. But there's so much more to it.<br />Imagine that you wake up one day and you find yourself disgusted with popular music. All music on the radio sounds similar, doesn't it? Catchy tunes, pleasant but narrow-minded chords, the same old melody transforming into thousands of songs every single day. But, come on, there's got to be another way of playing interesting music without sounding like Mozart, who I respect but don't enjoy. Cpt Beefheart found the way. He 's showing it to us. Here. It's Blues and it's Rock, but it's also very innovative. Trout Mask Replica was well ahead of its time, and it's well ahead of our time, too.<br />But, please, let's get one thing straight. The music in this album is not composed of randomly played sounds. It was well thought-out before played. There are many webpages available to discover that these songs sounded exactly like this in live concerts too: every chord and every knock on the drums in its place.<br />My personal favorites in this album are Hair Pie Bake 1 (instrumental- a truly frightening piece of music), Dachau Blues, Moonlight on Vermont, China Pig (a normal Blues song), Veterans Day Poppy (great finale- it's just you and the chords), and of course, all good hardcore bands ever since have tried to copy/paste the overwhelming power of \\"My Human Gets Me Blues\\", but not many succeeded.<br />Sadly, the samples above don't reveal the reasons why this album is so great. But noone can promise you that you're gonna like it when you buy it. It's different. In the early 80s \\"The Shaggs\\" tried to repeat the experiment. They failed badly. \\"God Is My Co-Pilot\\" also took a shot, but they overlooked a simple fact: First you learn the rules, and only then you can break them. The earlySonic Youth, The Jesus Lizard (their guitarist AND their vocalist), Therapy?, and possibly Drive Like Jehu and The Stranglers are, among others, some of the bands that have also been influenced by Cpt Beefheart.<br />This album will always be there to remind us that maybe, just maybe, music is going to be very different in the times ahead.
B00J3AW23G|5|This game is a lot of fun, really enjoy the challenge.

B00GFD6X2A|2|I was quite disappointed with this latest book, where has his quirky sense of humour gone? for me the story didn,t roll  along. I couldn't put his first book down (The one hundred year old man who stepped out of the window and disappeared), but I with this book, the characters were not easy to like or understand and I couldn't picture the story in my mind.
B00J8CGU64|1|Terrible. Glorifies everything wrong with society.

0783226063|4|This Movei Really Grabbed me, especially after I had read the book, I was impressed at how close to the book the movie stayed, not perfect, but it wasn't mutilated as so many books are.  I have been told that there is a 4  hour long version that fills in the hole where &quot;Paul and Chani's love  grew&quot;. Is this true?  If you know anything about it, please E-mail me.

B000X1Z0BU|5|\\"Once\\" is a terrific first film from John Carney, which stars his old bandmate Glen Hansard as well as the talented Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;.  It is filmed in and around Dublin, including the lovely beach at Howth; and it is enjoyable throughout.<br /><br />Glen and Mark&eacute;ta won an Academy Award for their song \\"Falling Slowly,\\" and almost half of the film consists of songs written by Glen.  The two are fine actors too; and John is to be commended for putting together a first-rate film on a budget of $100,000, if that is to be believed.  If so, Hollywood could learn a lesson or two from him.<br /><br />It is definitely worth watching or buying, and it's delightful.
B00HGJ18C2|5|Keeps my mind busy and alert.  I love this solitaire.
1475143389|5|This book gives great practical advice for adding lean mass. As a sports and exercise science major I am familiar with most of the priciples behind muscle growth, strength gains, and nutrition, as well as how all of these variables affect one another. Personally I have achieved pretty good results from my workout programs in the past, but I never quite achieved the look I was going for. This book pointed out some key omissions I had made in my training, such as not keeping a workout log for each workout. How many guys do you see in the gym on a daily basis who never record their workouts? Are these men blessed with a rain man like ability to recall the exact number of weight, reps, and sets of their last workout? Probably not. As a result they come in every day and do the same workout with the same weight, and guess what else stays the same, their physique. If you want a practical approach to packing on lean mass then this book is for you. Its not pitching some new miracle program, its giving you a tried and true outline for success that others have followed to achieve results. It takes hard work to achieve the body you want, this book acknowledges this, but it also points out the importance of having a scientific method to track your progress. It also covers the importance of your mental attitude towards your training. I wish I had this book when I was beginning my training journey because it lays out facts that many experience lifters have learned through trial and error. I would recommend this book to new lifters because it will save them from getting sucked into the hype of the supplement industry, whos suspect claims, and endorsements from juiced up body builders, trick young men all around the world into waisting their money. I also think lifters who have been in the game a while, and who are looking to break through to the next level will get something out of the practical advice in this book.I've noticed a change in body composition over the past three weekswhile applying the principles taught in this book. I'm getting more out of my workouts, I'm lifting heavier weights, and my muscles are noticeably denser.This book gives you the gameplan for success but its up to you to follow it.<br /><br />Oh also, Mike is great about answering questions. He personally emailed me out of the blue and asked how things were going, and has continued to answer all of my questions. Well worth the 10 dollars or so.
B0000039QP|4|After you're Ready To Die you want to see Life After Death as did The Notorious B.I.G. for the sophomore album title.  They put together 14 tracks of its original version and made an edited release of it.  This one starts off with the funky guitar licks of \\"Hypnotize\\".  Notorious has a fierce rapid fire flow to compete with the featured artist Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on \\"Notorious Thugs\\".  The mainstream, R&B feel of \\"I Love The Dough\\" featuring Jay-Z & Angela Winbush, made it apparent how to get it and what to do once you have it.  An excerpt of Schooly D.'s \\"P.S.K.\\" was done in a short rhyme interlude on \\"B.I.G. Interlude\\".  Biggie then reminisces over the death of friends on \\"Miss U\\".  Coming out with fellow Bad Boy mates on \\"Mo Money Mo Problems\\" featuring Puff Daddy & Mase they flow with their status and what comes along with success.  \\"Playa Hater\\" is a song where he 'sings' the entire song with the phrase \\"...you've been robbed...\\"  He gives step by step instructions on hustling with \\"Ten Commandments\\".  Bragging on his sexual prowess and endeavors, \\"Nasty Boy\\" is an up-tempo tune.  Giving hope and dreams a reality sense he shows that \\"Sky's The Limit\\".  The Brooklyn emcee gives it up to the West Coast state of California as he flows over a West Coast swing track on \\"Going Back To Cali\\".  It seems as he saw death approaching and his destiny as he claims \\"You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)\\".  R. Kelly helps on the R&B tune of no longer being laid back but insisting on the evening.  A shorter version of the original release, but is missing the unedited lyrics.  R.I.P.

B006QSL9XC|5|Excellent historical movie

B00000IAU3|5|I found out about this album from the Roswell website and discovered that it wasn't available in the UK, so had to order it especially from Canada. I purchased the album specifically for the Roswell theme tune &quot;Here with  me&quot;,but having listened to the album repeatedly since receiving it I  have come to the conclusion that all of the songs are just as good. Another  favourite track on this album is the song &quot;Hunter&quot;. I recommend  this album to anyone that loves the series Roswell.
B001DDBCUU|5|My daughter and I were always huge fans. We faithfully watched the series every Sunday night and saw the film in the theatre. This set includes extra footage. We both liked this film version as it tied up all the storylines well. It was enjoyable and a nice ending to the lives of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. The studio should have stopped after this film.

B000SEGTI0|5|\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" presents a dystopian future in which humans must struggle with the value of life in a world where nature's restorative powers have been utterly destroyed, replaced by technology that can superficially replicate both animals and  people. Dick creates a future in which there is no natural world to speak of-- radioactive dust blocks the sky, wilderness has been reduced to boulder-strewn wasteland, and nearly all wild animals are extinct. Against this post-apocalyptic backdrop, the humans that have not emigrated to other \\"colonies\\" in the solar system struggle to define and cherish life. Artificial animals and people, the robotic sheep and androids from Dick's title, raise questions about the intrinsic value of life and the limits of empathy. Confronted with a barren world, the characters in this novel care for animals as a way of displaying their essential human quality-- empathy. Those who cannot afford a real animal take care of elaborate robotic look-alikes. Although robotic animals are seen as harmless, androids are forbidden from earth for fear that their lack of empathy will further imperil what life remains. The novel's main character, Rick Deckard, is a bounty hunter, a police officer who makes his living hunting androids illegally on earth. Deckard is forced to confront the implications of his job, which demands that he deny androids the same empathy he showed his electric sheep-- the same empathy that distinguishes him from the androids he \\"retires.\\"    \\"Androids\\" supplements Deckard's perspective with a parallel story line that reveals the complex motivations driving androids to illegally emigrate to earth. Dick's androids are near-perfect humans, except that they coldly disregard the intrinsic value of living things, even after longing to leave Mars because it is a lifeless planet. Dick's construction of complex android personalities that demonstrate their lack of empathy is fascinating. Conscious and sentient, the androids in this novel pose existential questions about their own lives. Dick ultimately appeals to the reader's own empathy by presenting scenarios in which one recoils at the cruelty androids exhibit towards animals that, in the context of the novel, are scarce and precious.    \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" illustrates the fundamental difference between the way people react to nature, on the one hand, and the machines we make, on the other. Ultimately, humanity's ability to respect the intrinsic value of life sets us apart from the machines we create. For a quick and easy read, this book contains a deep and powerful message.
B000VWYJ86|3|Incomprehensibly filmed and edited, The Bourne Ultimatum is basically a variation of The Bourne Supremacy, which itself was a remake of The Bourne Identity.  Ultimatum follows the exact same formula as those films, with Bourne being hunted by his superiors and then bringing them to justice.    As expected, there's a claustrophoic fist fight, a car chase, a foot chase, and many scenes with Bourne outmanuevering his pursuers.  There's also a Tangiers rooftop escape that was stolen straight out of the James Bond film The Living Daylights.    What makes Ultimatum better than Supremacy?  Simply put, it's more exciting and the action sequences are better-staged.  Ultimatum is not a bad film, but it still pales in comparison to Doug Liman's first Bourne film.
B003B02OQ4|5|Good story.  Well written.
B001FEO6PK|5|Viewed a documentary on Pivot TV and was amazed by this young man, that is how we will always think of him.  His music is fantastic.
B00138H4FW|5|Tyler's Vocals and lyrics are the essence of rock and roll. All members contribute to this great album. My favorite song off the record is Movin' Out. Joe Perry's guitar riff and the vocals by Tyler are just pure sex. Of course every track on this record is golden. Do yourself a favor, buy the record and listen to it from start to finish. It takes you on a journey.

B00021R7CG|5|This movie is one of my absolute favorites in the nuclear war genre.<br /><br />First, the movie does a good job in blending items from the highest level of the national command authorities to the smaller struggles faced by one B-52 bomber crew<br /><br />Second, it shows you how even the greatest planning for a certain type of disaster can always have flaws that no one counted on.  The elected President (played by Martin Landau) is removed from a position of influence when his helicopter crashes after a first wave of nuclear weapons hits the US.  The next civilian available to succeed him is the Secretary of the Interior who clearly does not have the leadership skills to lead the US out of a potentially deadly situation.  The faltering leadership of the new \\"President\\" is further re-inforced by his military aide, an Air Defense Artillery Colonel (Colonel Fargo) played by Ripp Torn who wants to pursue \\"victory\\" where none may be had.<br /><br />Third, we get to see the remarkable intelligence and good judgement of our military as the Air Force and Navy personnel outside Air Force One attempt to diffuse a bad situation.  Especially notable is James Earl Jones who plays General Allis.  James Earl Jones advocates standing down rather than continued escalation.  The integrity in his performance is true to how I believe real military personnel would react when faced with a similar set of impossible choices whose decision only yields \\"bad\\" or \\"worse\\" outcomes. You get the feeling that the crew that James Earl Jones commands from the Looking Glass plane is behind their general in their decision to follow what they believe is the right course of action.<br /><br />Fourth, the central message of the story is well told. Sometimes, all the plans, all the systems, and all the data in the world are not a substitute for human judgement. As our own military has learned the hard way, spy satellites and high tech means of information gathering are no substitute for a man on the ground with the right language skills and skills in relating to others.<br /><br />I can do without some of the sexual references made in the beginning of the movie but this is a relatively minor point when you consider all of the film's other good qualities.round with the right language skills and skills in relating to others.   <br /> <br />I can do without some of the sexual references made in the beginning of the movie but this is a relatively minor point when you consider all of the film's other good qualities.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />

B000W1V44I|2|i am a long time fan, but i must admit this album is mediocre at best. it has 2 or 3 songs that you would expect from good sounds from the past. quite a disappointment.
B00007KQA3|3|A great movie, but this version (MGM 2003) is not correctly colored. The beautiful bleach bypass processing (seen in the streaming Amazon Prime version) is not used on this transfer. Instead, this DVD, taken from a film inter-positive, is garish and looks like video with cardboard sets. See the example I posted under photos. On his website, Roger Deakins, cinematographer of the film stated--<br /><br />&#34;We used a bleach bypass process for all the prints of '1984'. It was the first time that this particular process was used on a feature film, as far as I know, and was created by Kay's lab in the UK. The process adds contrast as well as desaturates the image due to the retention of the developed silver in the emulsion. It gives the projected image a kind of luminous quality. Sadly, some of the latest DVDs do not reflect our original intentions as the distributer has not matched to a print but just taken a transfer from an IP, which, of course, is in full colour. That's more than annoying as some of the costumes and sets were actually over saturated in order to compensate for the kind of processing we were using.&#34;
B0089EHWQE|4|Very thought provoking. It is about respecting other peoples choices, even though it causes you pain. It is difficult to realize that many things in our lives are none of our business, and therefore not about us. I will look for more books by this author.

B001P9EQH8|2|i purchased this to use with my 55 ohm headphones and was disappointed to learn that the battery on mine was completely dead and refused to except a charge. The amp functioned normally when plugged into a power source but this amp is suppose to be portable so its useless without battery power. Going to return and get a fiio E11 instead. This amp sounds great with very low interference for the price but FiiO's quality control is poor at best.
B00BLCHZC2|5|My husband and daughter really enjoy this highly entertaining look at life among the often violent, very earthy lives of the Norsemen during the time of Charlemagne in Europe.if you like rough and ready in a colder environment, this might be just the show for you!
020530902X|4|A copy of this book should be in every writer's library.<br /><br />Experienced writers will find much of what is in this small book to be redundant. Even so, this book is a very useful resource. I keep a copy nearby all the time and skim for reminders and tidbits of information that I either did not know, or had forgotten.
1416594795|5|Just kidding!  Unlike Tricky Nicky I think it would be dumb to write a review for a book I haven't read and have no intention of reading. Ever.  I think Dawkins is a putz, regardless if he is right or wrong.<br />Just saying.  Since Tricky Nicky does this all the time I figured why shouldn't I?<br />Amazon doesn't stop him.<br /><br />I give it five stars because I know Mr. Dawkins ego is very very fragile.
B004XANKVO|5|I have had this bag for almost 4 years now, and I mean everyday, when its not going to from work its carrying weekend stuff for the family. I received it from an Ebay purchase as part of a package.  I would and have recommended this bag to many people. The bag with the hard sunglasses case and the 'stuff pocket' seems to be something unique to the US market, havent seen it anywhere in Europe.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is that the chest strap thing broke off (after about 1.5 - 2 years), the &#34;guides&#34; the strap slide on tore out on one side so I just cut the other one off. I'm 6'3&#34; have a 53&#34; chest so the thing was really maxed out keeping the strap in the correct place, it was partly a bad design and partly just plain leverage at the weakest point.<br /><br />The point where the strap connects to the bag on the top had started to tear out on one side, but I use this bag HARD and Heavy, and that is really the spot that receives the bulk of the stress if I dont have it ON with both straps. Sometimes I just grab it and sling it over one shoulder to go from bus to train or from the car to the office/house. I repaired it myself after it had been torn for almost a year (it never really got worse after the first tear, I just depend on the bag so much I didnt want to take the chance).<br /><br />The picture is from a bag dump I did one day last winter. Other than the laptop, tablet and my lunch box which arent in the picture, every one of those items was just something that was in my bag that day (Including the text book and the spiral notebook).<br /><br />I regularly carry a 17&#34; Elitebook 8670p (I do have to take the booster battery off to fit in the pocket, but ...duh... thats not a complaint, just an observation). Its a monster laptop, not anywhere near what most people consider portable, I'd estimate its probably about 2.5 or 3 macbooks stacked up.<br />I carry snacks, lunch, a 1.5 liter bottle of water, batteries, tablet, and all kinds of other stuff people just decide to carry for what ever reason all day every day. I would say that my pack averages 20-25lbs every day and 35+ if Im using it to travel and carry tools and extra hard disks and books etc...<br /><br />In the hardcase I carry a pair of sunglasses, USB sticks, pens, pencils and some tablet adapters. Never had an issue but I buy sunglasses 4-5 pairs at a time when they are cheap so take this with a grain of salt if you spent $300 on your favorite pair of Raybans :) I have never had a pair of my cheapies wrecked inside the case with all the other stuff behind em.<br /><br />I carry a collapsible umbrella and a little first aid kit in the zipper pocket underneath, half the time I forget its there.<br /><br />The zipper pocket on the front does create some difficulties in the 'stuff pocket' if you put a bunch of heavy items like packs of batteries or tools in it. It causes the shape of the 'stuff pocket' to become difficult to get items to go to the bottom unless you tip it forward or open it up completely. It would be nice if they put a semi rigid plate behind the stuffing to keep the items from pushing down into the bottom of the 'stuff pocket', but it only factors if you load the pocket the way I do. Again I use this bag in ways it probably wasnt considered for so I don't deduct points for this issue.<br /><br />The last thing I like about this bag is that it isnt 'Mil-Spec' and doesnt look 'tactical', I travel in Europe a lot and you can ALWAYS pick out &#34;that guy&#34; (and he's usually an American tourist or a member of a local group you dont want to be associated with) on the train/bus/walking around. This bag is every bit as solid as any Mystery Ranch or Eberlestock that I have for hiking, camping, trapping, hunting and other activities but it blends right in when you are walking around in the tech district.
B00005JNZJ|3|First off, I have only seen segments of the Liquid Television \\"Aeon Flux\\" animated episodes back in the 90's, so I'm not qualified to give an in-depth comparison to this movie. And two, I think politics should be left out of it...therefore I won't comment on Hollywood's left/right influence on this movie or anything like that. I'm reviewing it based on its merits alone and nothing else. <br /> <br />That out of the way, I found \\"Aeon Flux\\" to be a dumbed-down, watered-down, yet entertaining version of the animated series. Although I have mentioned above that I didn't see that much of the original in the 90's, I saw enough of it to say that as usual, Hollywood has toned down the sex & violence so that it gets a safe, for-the-masses PG-13 rating. Fanboys of the original series are going to throw popcorn at the screen, and are advised to skip it. But for the rest of us, I suppose it's an adequate sci-fi/action brainless flick that doesn't challenge anyone and merely asks that one put their brain on neutral. <br /> <br />Although Charlize Theron is WAY too attractive for the role of Aeon and basically phones in her performance, she does a commendable job with what she is given to work with. A large part of this movie relies on her sex appeal and it never apologizes for it. And in all fairness it does have some other good qualities, mainly the special effects and futuristic set designs that are at least original even if implausible. Some work could have been done on the fight sequences, which were amateur and even boring at times.  <br /> <br />All in all, I recommend \\"Aeon Flux,\\" but only if you have some extra cash leftover and/or are a big fan of Charlize Theron (she is after all quite easy on the eyes in this movie). But if you're trying to save some money and want to limit your movie watching, give this one a pass and wait for \\"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\\" or \\"King Kong,\\" which will surely be light years better.

B00005JNJV|4|The origins of Batman are explored in this fine fifth installment of the Batman series.  Young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) tumbles down an abandoned well on his family's property.  While in the well, he is set upon by a group of angry bats. After some time, Bruce is finally rescued by his father, but he now has a terrible fear of bats.  Later, Bruce witnesses the horrible murder of his mother and father. Years later and still shaken from the death of his parents, Bruce ventures abroad to learn the means to fight injustice and turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. <br /> <br />Bruce meets Henri Ducard (Lian Neeson)a member of a secret society known as the League of Shadows.  Henri trains Bruce in fighting injustice , but some of their methods seem very extreme. These methods will show up later in the film. <br /> <br />Bruce returns to Gotham city to find it a cesspool for crime bosses and wrong-doers.  Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has managed to buy off most of the cops and judges in Gotham so his mob basically controls the town.  One of Falcone's thugs is doctor Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy).  Known as the \\"scarecrow\\", he has developed a gas that can poison people as well as Gotham's water supply.  Inhalig the gas can cause people to go insane. Crane is getting ready to unleash this gas on the citizens of Gotham. <br /> <br />Bruce decides that he must do something to help the people of Gotham.  He enlists the help of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a techie who works at Wayne Enterprises.  He developed all kinds of cool gear, such as a kevlar suit and a high-performance ATV.  With Lucius' help, Bruce uses these items to give birth to Batman.  Even with all of this high-tech gear, will Batman be able to stop Carmine Falcone and the scarecrow before they destroy Gotham? <br /> <br />I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  The special effects are very good, and I enjoyed seeing how Bruce became Batman.  The acting, especially by Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman, is superb.  I recommend this movie very highly.  Watch and see how a troubled child matures into a great crime-fighting superhero.
B00H7KJTCG|5|Absolutely a great movie. Terrific story and very well acted. I think this is Ben Stiller's best movie. Highly recommended.

B00005IBGQ|5|&quot;Poses&quot; continues Rufus Wainwright's brilliant and insightful journey of self discovery that he began in his compelling debut CD. While, on the first CD, he saw the world through an aching, burning romantic haze with an almost unbearable intensity, &quot;Poses&quot; mutes that intensity just like adulthood tones down youthful passions and replaces them with realistic insight as to how the world truly functions. <br />&quot;Cigarettes and Choclate Milk&quot; is the perfect song with which to frame this journey. It is precisely the &quot;cravings&quot; mentioned in the song that lead him to the heartbreak and emptiness that he so poignantly expresses in the remainder of the tunes on the CD. &quot;I suggest reading of a 'lesson in tightropes' or 'Adios Kansas', he cries, as the world he has seen on his journey is not what he expected or wanted. <br />The song &quot;Poses&quot; beautifully articulates the emptiness he feels in the world in which he has found himself. &quot;I did go from wanting to be someone...now I'm drunk and wearing flip flops on Fifth Avenue...&quot;  In &quot;Shadows&quot; he laments, &quot;I could be a great star..I'm far from happy.&quot;<br />Although his romantic spirit has been dampened by the harshness of the world, he has not lost it entirely. Deep down inside he knows that love is the &quot;copious prize&quot;. &quot;The sights of Paris pale inside your iris..I saw it in your eyes what I'm looking for..,&quot; he croons in &quot;The Tower of Learning&quot;- sentiments as unabashedly romantic as any lyrics on his debut CD. <br />&quot;One man Guy&quot; serves a double purpose. This beautiful folkish melody written by his father illustrates the self reliance he was forced to learn all through his journey, but it also reinforces the romantic ideal that he truly has not lost.<br />Rufus Wainwright is undoubtedly one of the most gifted musical artists of his generation, and this extraordinary CD, with its lush musical arrangements andpenetrating, reflective lyrics just serves to confirm this. I think he has only just begun to mine his enormous talent.
B004EPZ0BG|4|This is another typical rom-com that focuses on friends with benefits who try to have sex without emotion and along the way become friends and then fall in love. It's pretty typical but if you're looking for the same thing then this is pretty good.<br /><br />Building on that factor the best strenght here is the line deliveries and overall chemistry between the two lovers, played by Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Timberlake's dancing skills are properly used enough and Kunis plays on her bubbly personality to make it work well enough. Both are good at their humor deliveries as well and let me also add that the music track is very nice to suit the mood.<br /><br />For those who saw the Portman and Kusher film \\"No Strings Attached\\" I would say this one is a notch or two up.<br /><br />Supporting roles by Jenna Elfman (as Timberlake's sister), Woody Harrelson (as the gay sports editor) and Richard Jenkins( as the mentally deteriorating father). Emma Stone is Timberlake's ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />The budget was $35M and it made over $149M at the Box Office.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus (using the typical rom-com formula); CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; HUMOR: B; ROMANCE FOCUSES: B plus to A minus (again, following the typical rom-com formula); WHEN WATCHED: mid September 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B000QXDED6|5|I never seen a movie that actually made me \\"SIT AT THE EDGE OF MY SEAT\\" like 300 did. Being a fan of Roman style gladiator films, I've seen quite a few and this one I put at the top of my list. Three hundred also holds true to history, for all you historical nuts, which I can attest to because of A- in Western Civ. given to me by my professor. None the less if you like action, sword play, blood and guts, and understandable plots BUY THIS DVD!!!! You won't regret it.

B000006OAM|5|Upon first listening to this CD- it was the first one I listened to by MS. Merchant- I was struck by the depth it had. When you turn on stations like MTV and see what they have to offer (which, to be precise, consists mainly of shallow, superficial &quot;artists&quot;), and then listen to this CD, it becomes apparent that while some critics have dismissed her efforts, she remains so much more affecting then most any other artist out there.<br />&quot;My Skin&quot; is a song I feel compelled to discuss in this review. It's the most haunting song I've ever heard, and yes, while it is sad, it also contains hope.<br />Of course, there are other excellent tracks as well, but other reviewers have already mentioned those. While it is a serious disk- for the most part- it is far from the word &quot;gloomy&quot; as a critic neglected to say. It is sensuous, at times moving.<br />This is powerful music, and I'm glad Merchant chose this new, more mature sound- it suits her nicely, and shows her growth.<br />4.6 stars for musicianship.
B00KW27K4K|5|Great movie
B0000027DJ|5|Received this one ...after listening to a downloaded version of the title track.  I have to say, though I liked Hey Stoopid, It ranks about 5th on the list for favorites on this album.  Wind Up Toy definitly reminds me of the album \\"Goes to Hell\\", while Hurricane Years is along the Trash/Constrictor lines.  I truely like every Alice Album I have ever heard or owned, including \\"flush the fashion\\", but this one is among the top three now.  ....<br />Great Album, would be bargin at twice the price!...

007174889X|5|Good
B00005N9CV|3|An anxiously awaited release following her hugely successful Grammys winning album WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES, this fully titled and themed romantic collection (albeit boasted with the support of a rich London orchestra team) lacks the former's vibrant variations of tunes and it appears more like a complimentary package for both industry and the fans thereafter.<br />Though 'S WONDERFUL will remain the most sultry fore track after all listenings, with CRY ME A RIVER and I GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU VERY WELL both serve up well deep emotional vocal approach, which is something unique of the sonorous Canadian jazz pianist/songstress.<br />However songs like BESAME MUCHO and the title track THE LOOK OF LOVE are apparently letting down, completely not creative but rather sort of a clich&eacute; sampling in popular jazz business. Worst, the latter made me skip past the torturing MAYBE YOU'LL BE THERE at the end in most of my listenings. In delight the lusciously moody DANCING IN THE DARK does earn some credits, the extended beats arrangement would actually replay in my remote mind afterwards.<br />I'm quickly looking forward to better years in Diana Krall.

1781162646|5|I finished reading Stephen King's _JOYLAND_ several weeks ago and cannot stop thinking about this novel,  thinking about  how much I enjoyed _JOYLAND_ and how much I hunger for more stories like this one, where strong relationships between the characters are the driving force of the story.  As a reader, I believe the best and most successful stories are those that reveal the strengths of our humanity, as well as the destructiveness of inhumanity, through relationship dynamics, their conflicts and resolutions: in _JOYLAND_ we have these enticing relationship components wrapped inside the conceit of a murder mystery. The year is 1973, the place is Heaven's Bay in North Carolina, and Devlin Jones is our young protagonist who hires on as a Happy Helper at a seaside carnival called Joyland during his summer break from college. WORK CLOSE TO HEAVEN! the classified ad in the regional rag _Carolina Living_  had barked.  Devlin, who is trying to recover from being dumped by his first love, answers the ad, hoping the job might distract him from his broken heart.  What Dev learns instead is that a broken heart can never be distracted nor forgotten, but stitched back together again with the sturdy sinew of dedicated friendships and noble endeavors.<br /><br />This the second time in a year that a novel has made me cry at the end. The other novel was King's _11/22/63_.
B000QRIGLC|5|The author really makes the reader understand the importance of leadership and the role of the leaders above his team. Yet, the team carried their mission to the best of their ability understanding the reality that each one of them could lose his life. At the same time, the reader learn the not all Afgan's are bad people. This I see as a plus for Afganistan. The author also added a sense of humor which made the reading more enjoyable. The sadest part was the &#34;fairwell&#34; to his fellow BROTHERS.<br /><br />A must read book even for high school students.<br /><br />Mr. V
B005TTEFRG|5|Like new, with digital copy code, just perfect! I Like that, when you buy something and received everything.<br />Thank you!<br />Vt.
0307341577|3|Dark subject matter,  gone Girl is much better!
B00KWGRKFU|5|Love their music.
B00A757EFW|5|Old electronic games are really fun
B00OTLFGDW|2|I'm really conflicted about what rating to give to this. I absolutely love the score to this movie, however there are a lot of tracks that are totally missing from this collection! What gives? I want the whole soundtrack, not just part of it! I don't think I would pay much for such an abridged copy of the score...I'll stick to listening to it for free on spotify. I would gladly pay much more for the whole score though, so if it ever gets released you can bet I'll be buying it.
B001A3AA0G|5|It doesn't happen all the time, but it happened here.  I don't even know what you might call this kind of music, but I like it, the folks that make it like it, so who cares.  I was following links from Bon Iver, (which I discovered following links), and discovered Fleet Foxes. I listen to everything, noisy punk, dinosaur rock, mississippi blues, piano trio jazz, and now this.<br /><br />What a treat and joy to find completely new, fantastic, stuff!
0740748475|5|All Calvin and Hobbes in one BIG, HEAVY package...... Beautifully done, excelent print to match the best comic strip ever.... And the size and weight just makes it virtually impossible for a friend to steal it from you... So just buy it!!!!!
B00008S2VG|4|I don't know why so many people dislike this album so much when it has beautiful songs; I know that some of them are kind of boring, such as &quot;X-STATIC PROCESS&quot; or &quot;EASY RIDE&quot; (I'm sorry Madonna, I love your music but these songs make me feel sleepy, no matter how beautiful the lyrics are, the music here sounds like: &quot;ok kids, it's time to go to bed!&quot; ); however, &quot;HOLLYWOOD&quot; , &quot;LOVE PROFUSION&quot;, &quot;NOTHING FAILS&quot;; &quot;I'M SO STUPID&quot;,and, two steps below, &quot;MOTHER AND FATHER&quot; and &quot;INTERVENTION&quot;; make this album worth it!!! I know it's not her best work, but you can easily enjoy it! Another thing: Why didn't they include a remix of &quot;DIE ANOTHER DAY&quot;? The album version is longer and, consequently, more boring! A new remix would've worked pretty well. My opinion about &quot;AMERICAN LIFE&quot;? Well, this song is not that bad, it has interesting things and maybe it could be improved remixing it. There's a song I haven't written about, it's called &quot;NOBODY KNOWS ME&quot;, I don't know what to write about it, it's not a great song, not my favourite, but still, not that bad! <br />My advice: BUY THIS ALBUM! When I listen to NOTHING FAILS and I see my mother trying to sing along even though she doesn't speak English, or when I see my elder brother-who doesn't like Madonna-enjoying HOLLYWOOD, I understand that Madonna still has that thing that makes her THE REAL,UNIQUE AND ETERNAL QUEEN OF POP; I'm sure that the failures of this album are not her fault, maybe we should blame someone else (Warner, maybe?).
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is very entertaining. Great for different age groups. The game will adjust the difficulty based on the player's age. Highly recommended
B008Y7N7JW|3|Hunger games video<br /><br />I enjoyed it but was disappointed that I could not get closed captions.  I still don't know if it is because Amazon doesn't provide them or because I haven't found the correct way to get them.<br />Some searching indicates that Amazon does not provide them as indicated by many other disappointed fans like me.
B00000FC5H|5|love love love earth wind & fire
B00EHMFC78|5|Nice read
B0069G5Z9K|5|Highly addictive. I play everyday.  I try to get other people to play too. I just love how simple and complex it is.
B004XVN1T4|3|didn't like it as much as others of his i have read.
B004G5ZY7E|4|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Had some difficulty keeping track of who was who with many different characters.  Loved Harry Hole.  All the twists and turns resulted in a real page turner.  Definitely will read more from this author!
B000002C1X|5|I'm not claiming this is Floyd's best album, but when it first came out, I kicked back, put on the earphones, and was absolutely stunned by Water's lyrics and Gilmore's &quot;crying&quot; guitar. It was de ja vue all over  again when the CD came out. I can understand someone who is not a Floyd fan  not likeing this album, but if your into Floyd, it's a must.
B005GFPZYK|5|This was a great story about a two true American heroes; one a SEAL and the other his wife. The stresses of both sides are shown, illustrating that when a soldier goes to war, it really is a family affair. Of course, most of the book has to do with his job and the camaraderie of warriors in general and, in particular, SEALs. A very good read.
B00TEAVEY8|1|It won't let me do the puzzles...takes my energy (3 times now) and when I touch the first found item it closes. I re open and tried again..again took my energy and closed.....love this game on pc but the new app for tablet definitely has some bugs to work out..glad it was free. Will be uninstalling until fixed.
B00T40UK20|5|As good as advertised - Works perfectly.
B004PYDBVM|4|Aquariums of Pyongyang was an excellent and engaging account of life in one of North Korea's concentration camps. I found myself fascinated by the depictions of the god like way in which children are taught to revere Kim Il-sung and his descendants. These innocent children grow up to become conflicted adults who are forced to watch every word they say and every thing they do or risk being swept off to concentration camps.  The book does an excellent job of depicting this internal conflict as it details the terrible plight of an average family who managed to survive the camps.<br /><br />The only shortcoming with the book must be a result of it's translation from Korean to French and then finally to English.  There are a few places where you'll have to read a sentence a second time to really grasp the meaning, but these errors are few and they do not detract from the compelling nature of the story overall.
B00005OAA6|5|I'll admit it, I initially bought this album because Victoria (a.k.a. Posh Spice) is David Beckham's wife.  I had heard &quot;Not Such An Innocent Girl&quot; before and really liked the song.  When I got the album, I mostly listened to the first track (and first single off of it).  Little did I know, what a spectacular, honest, and fun album it really was.  It took me awhile to get used to some of the songs.  Now I have listened to all the tracks multiple times and I can truly say, Victoria Beckham is extremely talented and her first solo album reflects it.  I love, love, LOVE all of the songs.  They are just phenomenal, with great beats, great lyrics, and GREAT singing.  I think Victoria put a ton of effort into this album and it shows.  Many of the artists that we know here in the U.S., are extremely unoriginal in what they sing and what they sing about.  On VB, not only are the songs spectacular, but they actually have meaning.  As I said before, I completely adore all of the songs but perhaps my favorite is &quot;Like That&quot;. It's just such a catchy song, with a good beat and clever lyrics.  I also love \\"Midnight Fantasy\\"... God I love all of them!  I think the record label made a mistake not releasing it in America.  I think that this album is more U.S.-oriented than Forever by the Spice Girls.  Songs such as &quot;Like That&quot;, &quot;A Mind of It's Own&quot;, and &quot;I Wish&quot;  would have made great singles here.  I tried &quot;A Mind of It's Own&quot; out on a couple of my friends and for the rest of the evening, they were humming it.  From the sweet ballad &quot;Every Part Of Me&quot; dedicated to her son, Brooklyn, to danceable tracks such as &quot;Whatcha Talkin' About&quot; and &quot;Like That&quot;, this album just explodes with energy and creativity.  Victoria's true potential just jumps out on this record.  I continue to enjoy this album beyond belief months after purchasing it and I am looking forward to Victoria's sophomore album!
B000MQC9H4|5|I found this movie to be light-hearted, entertaining and genuinely funny.  Kate Winslet is fabulous and her character resonates with anyone who has ever loved someone who did not love them back - just used them!  Cameron Diaz pulls off the comedy beautifully.  Jack Black and Jude Law were awesome.  I actually bought two copies so I will always have it in my library.  One of my favorites!
B007ZGO7EM|5|Easy to use, easy to see, simple calculator app. This app does everything it should and seems to have no glitches. Recommended.
B00H58VGIA|4|it was  a good book enjoyed reading it
B0013ND30M|5|Sleeping Beauty is my favorite Disney movie ever! Everything about it, from the princess, the villain, characters, art animation, music... its all total perfection. A true Walt Disney MASTERPIECE.<br /><br />  Aurora our princess is beautiful on the inside as well as on the outside.If she was really overly lovesick, she would have just ran off the moment she met Phillip. But she didn't. Instead she goes back home and tells her Godmothers about him. She get's upset when she finds out her true identity, she doesn't want to marry some prince she's never met. YET she puts her trust in her family, the Fairy Godmothers. If anything shes self sacrificing. She puts her dream to the side to please others. :D Being the girly girl that I am, I think Prince Phillip is the best prince. He does the most. Slays a dragon and wakes Aurora up from her cursed sleep. So dreamy!!! Flora, Fauna and Merryweather (The Three Good Fairies) take over the movie.Some say that the movie should be named after them instead of Sleeping Beauty lol. They stop Maleficents curse of death and turn it into a mere deep sleep that could be broken by true loves first kiss, Raise Aurora as their own, Save prince Phillip and assist him in slaying Maleficent. These fairies are heros! And of course we can't forget Maleficent. The BEST Disney villain ever. So elegant and deliciously evil. When I was little, Maleficent was the only Disney villain who actually scared me. The scene were Maleficent hypnotizes and lures Aurora into the fireplace and up the tower... creepy.<br /><br />  I love how traditional the whole plot of this movie is. Every woman has had that one dream with a love interest in it. Let's not lie here. That one dream you have when you meet that totally perfect handsome stranger you can't keep your hands off. We can all relate with Aurora on that. '' Well, hes tall and handsome and.. soo romantic. We walk together and talk together, and just before we say goodbye.. he takes me in his arms.. and then.... I wake up''. We've all been there.n.... I wake up''. We've all been there.' mantra. I think we can all just give that up and agree that it does more harm then good for us. It's to vague. Where does it start and where does it end? I need a man in my life someday. I can't live with my mom forever and I have no intentions on ever living by myself or with room mates.<br /><br /> Now with those few points to the side. Being the girly girl that I am, I think Prince Phillip is the best prince. He does the most. Slays a dragon and wakes Aurora up from her cursed sleep. So dreamy!!! I love how traditional the whole plot of this movie is. These love at first sight princess movies make me think about the song '' Today I met the boy I'm going to marry'' by Darlene Love. And many of those other oldschool love songs. Every woman has had that one dream with a love interest in it. Let's not lie here. That one dream you have when you meet that total perfect handsome stranger you can't keep your hands off. We can all relate with Aurora on that. '' Well, hes tall and handsome and.. soo romantic. We walk together and talk together, and just before we say goodbye.. he takes me in his arms.. and then.... I wake up''. We've all been there.<br /><br />There.. I have spoken!
630460288X|4|Oh this was such a great movie.  The sci-fi world is looked at from the comedics point of view and man does it work.  This movie has the same of action comedy element like die hard 3.<br /><br />The director does a good job of making everbody look bad ass and you really don't know what snipes is capable of.  Throw is some really cool stuff, and a lot of things breaking and you will have a fun ride with this.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Idk on how I feel
B00138KDO6|5|I love Rage Against The Machine, but I had never heard this entire album before, just specific tracks off of it. Once AmazonMP3 had the album for 5 bucks, I bought it. Wish I would've bought it sooner.
0517122707|5|A Confederacy of Dunces, with the exemption of the Hitchikers guide to the Galaxy, is simply the funniest book i have ever read. Toole details his characters right down to the last neurosis. The characters that revolve around the life of Ignatius J. Reily will be embeded in my mind for ever.  this is a must read!!!!!!
B000UZNRS2|5|A Good book. I read it several years ago but did not remember the plot. I enjoyed it once again.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Excellent story and great acting!  I loved every second of it.  If you like action and adventure and period pieces you will love Vikings
B000ASATWQ|5|Love his father's music, but Damian has a style all of his own.  Destined to make a name for himself just like his father too.
B004SD5GZ4|5|I like it. It works when I need it to and I don't have to open it every time it's good
B003ZJ70W4|5|Streamed very well and was easy to watch.
B00JCW0BCY|5|A must for each of us to read. This thoughtful book capture the need we all have to die as we wish. Bravo!
0790729725|5|Really great movie. Considered one of the greatest in Cinema history. Some rate this over The godfather's as the greatest mob movie. Fast moving and gripping. This really shows De Niro as one of the greatest actors in our generation. Oddly enough, after the first viewing I didn't realize his character was actually him.  Some pretty good life lessons in the movie also. Must own for guys!
B000ETRCMQ|3|This movie is full of clichés.  There is the sexually-confused man who fathered a child, but had no contact with him.  The boy who grows up not knowing his parents and becomes a street-bum.  The flower-child who is a degenerate in disguise.  The protagonist who is a complete woman in outlook, although a complete man physically.  The therapist who has a sixth sense of premonition.  Felicity Huffman, however, gives a stellar performance.  She is very convincing, very credible as either sex. <br />
B006LSZECO|4|disappointed in the ending, I hope the movie ending is better than the book.
B004J1DBJI|5|Being a longtime user of the full version of Mathematica on PC platforms, I can attest to the utility of this app as a simplified version of one of the most powerful computing environments. Although the spectrum of functions available in this app are limited, it also does not require the user to enter queries in Mathematica &#34;language&#34;, which has some similarities to C language. I cannot emphasize enough that the minuscule cost of this app will seem trivial after using it for a while.
B000XUBFE2|5|I really enjoyed reading this story. The story is told from the view point of Death who is fascinated with a tenacious survivor during World War II Germany. In the process of Liesel's brushes with Death, she also becomes a stealer of words. Books and words intrigue the girl who is left in the grips of poverty during the war. Death narrates her story and that of her friends and foster family.<br /><br />I enjoyed the poignant details of the heroine and of the secondary characters set in world of hopelessness and fear. It reminded me that even in terrible strife, there can be beauty and love; tenderness and compassion. I would highly recommend this book. I did not see the movie, because I would prefer the written word than that portrayed on the big screen. Like Liesel, books hold my heart.
B00L9B7IKE|3|I felt this book was a little difficult to read and keep up with the plot.  The book seemed like it went a little overboard about her drinking problem.
B0014I4KIK|4|Duffy has a very unique and amazing voice. She sounds like she has been imported from the 60's/70's era. You'll love this cd!! If you get a chance, check out her videos online, too!!
B000050HTO|5|Bob Dylan is most certainly amongst the best singers of all time with more than 20 platinum albums and superb songs like BLOWIN IN THE WIND,LIKE A ROLLING STONE and SLOW TRAIN COMING.Pay no attention to the one star fool below me and get this classic.This collection is good so get it.
B00KG2NGPS|5|I love history based movies. Especially movies in the World War Two era as I feel like so much is still being learned about this tragic time in Human History. It's amazing how much art, treasures were stolen and acquired by the Third Reich. It's worth the watch and can't beat an all-star cast Matt Damon, George Clooney, Bill Murray and others.<br /><br />&#34;2+ Hours of Finding Lost World War Two Treasures & Doesn't Even Have Nicholas Cage So You Know It's Good!&#34; - Brian Schoedel
B005ZUR724|5|I think its really great but I'm still level one and don't know how to get back to where I train...
B008XKSW7M|4|It would really make more sense to me if Jennifer Lopez was expecting as well at some point but that wasn't the case. It was an awesome movie though.
B009UX2YAC|5|I can't ever stop playing this game. It's a lot of fun. My children also enjoy playing and it helps with their fine motor skills and hand/eye coordination.
B00IUBM8PQ|5|This follow up to Hungar Games keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You don't know what is going to happen until the end.  Great movie and RIP Phillip Seymore Hoffman!
B005USZYDU|5|I want my teenage grandson to read these books.  Good  educational reading.
B004GHNIRK|3|I thought I liked this book when I was younger..... Why? Most boring book that I gave up on 1/4 of the way through.
B0084HJE0S|5|great book, I have learned a lot of new things from it.
B00AW57L96|5|Excellent.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Quick read that kept me interested from beginning to end.
B00AQMQBKK|5|Very entertaining once you get the hang of it. Scenarios range from easy to extremely hard. It plays very quickly.
B000OZ0NXA|3|My second reading of this book, still enjoyed it.
B000066I6N|5|Another top 5 star CD to add to my Robert Plant collection.
0446573019|5|I really liked this book. I think that readers, like me, who enjoy the characters and action in the Jack Reacher books by Lee Child will enjoy Zero Day by David Baldacci, and vice versa, because the two men and the two plots are very similar. Both John Puller in Zero Day and Jack Reacher in the Reacher series come from a military family, are military cops who are very tall and strong, very knowledgeable about both military and practical matters, very tenacious, very ethically minded, independent, highly respected by high-level military personnel, have one brother who was in the military, and generally work alone on complicated cases. Even their names are similar: Jack and John, Reacher and Puller; one reaches and the other pulls, and both know what they want and get it, quickly and completely. And both prefer that people call them by their surname. Reacher, of course, has now left the military because he handled a case in an ethical manner. Puller faces the same problem in this book.<br /><br /> Puller's superior officer gives him an assignment that he says is very sensitive and that very high government officials are watching. But, strangely, he tells Puller that he must handle it all by himself. A Lieutenant Colonel, his wife and two kids are killed in a small West Virginia coal town. He tells Puller to find out who did it and why. But Puller is unable to understand why, if this case is so sensitive and the highest levels are following it, he must handle it alone. And why is he, a highly decorated and competent soldier, assigned a run of the mill murder case? And aren't the local cops able to handle it? Is he being set up? Unlike Reacher who travels with only a tooth brush, Puller packs his car with everything, from a machine gun and other weapons to bio-hazard suits. He soon discovers four more deaths, then others. The novel begins strong and continues strong throughout. The characters are finely drawn. It is unusually suspenseful and good.
B007J4T2G8|2|Not worth reading.  Very sad characters with very low self esteem. I will not read the trilogy for sure.  This is not writting, it's a joke!
B005CRQ4XI|4|I found the story inspirational and well written. It was an honest recollection of one women's struggle to find herself and sort out where she was going in life.
6300216039|5|This movie is very good,  I give it a 5 stars +++.  More movies should be made like this one.  Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey are the best.  Perfect couple for this role. A very sad love story.
B0063IH60K|5|I love this version of solitaire.  I have this version across all my devices.  I do not even bother with other ones.  Easy to figure out and play.  Love different colors.
B00A6PD8RQ|5|Have you ever considered how rare a mother is in a Disney animated film? Usually there is no mother or she is killed off quickly. This story might explain why because the teen's wish is that her mother would change so she could be free to become the woman she desires. She gets her wish by placing her mother in danger. This movie gets so much about teens right, including the normal self-absorption, lack of responsibility and wild pendulum swings between child and woman. The story encourages parents to nurture their daughter's strengths, not just their traditions. The girl's hair is practically a character in its own right so much time is spent on its rendering, just as it is in most teen girl's lives.<br /><br />If you're of Celtic background this will be a particular delight. There are stereotypes of Celtic behavior, but how do you ground a cultural story without them?<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00E8KLWB4|3|3 stars is really one too many. Hidden object game for teens or young adults. Very little objects though.. and the whole twenty word thing is messed up.
B006885LZM|5|I haven't finished watching all of it yet. I saw a couple of episodes on tv and missed to many and now I'm trying to catch up.
B00AZMFK3K|5|I love the movie and Amazon had my copy to me when they said it would be. I was a little  leary  about them revamping the series but it has been great so far.
0062024329|5|Nicely done! It's good to take time and reflect with this one.
0670827592|5|Love his books, an interesting twist on the pigs.
B00004SAJG|5|I suppose this Japanese version of Strangers Expanded is a collectors Item because it is imported. It seems to be identical to the 1999 Capitol reissue of the 1979 midwest concert tour live album, Strangers in the night. Elsewhere on this website you will find the 1999 release, however the track list is way wrong. Use this track list as the correct one. Well worth the price of the CD. It is definitely the prize of my UFO collection.
0446615625|1|Pages were missing.  It doesn't even deserve a one star., but it was the only way to post a comment
B004J4WKUQ|5|Everyone has been telling me to read this book. They were right. Excellent storytelling and wonderful characterization make this one of my favorite books this year.
B008XG1X18|5|I love pinterest...it's full of great ideas!
B0099Y2YL6|5|Loved the show. we missed it in the beginning and so we bought the series. Can't wait for seaso 4.
B00AREIAI8|4|Fun for anyone who loves horses!  Realistic and a little challenging.
B007MB5OCE|5|Hilarious, farce of a tale!
0140001115|4|Sherlock Holmes made his debut in \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", a novella first published in 1887. He and his sidekick, Doctor John H Watson, appeared in over fifty mysteries together. \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is probably the pair's most famous case, and was inspired by a legend about a ghostly hound that haunted Dartmoor. The story was first serialised in the Strand Magazine, with the final instalment appearing in 1902 - and the complete book first appearing that same year.<br /><br />Although Holmes will be seen as the book's hero, it's Watson who tells the story. The pair's involvement with case begins with a visit from Dr James Mortimer - although, initially, he has stopped by only for a little advice. Mortimer has travelled up to London from his home on the edge of Dartmoor. Sir Charles Baskerville, an elderly neighbour of Mortimer's, has recently died and the doctor is in town to meet his successor. However, thanks to a family legend, the details of the death have the whole community panicking. Back in the 1700s, the man who ruled Baskerville Hall - Sir Hugo - was anything but a virtuous man. Having kidnapped the daughter of a neighbouring yeoman - she wouldn't come willingly - he wasn't at all pleased when she later escaped and fled across the moors. In true Monty Burns style, he pledges himself to all that was unholy, unleashes the hounds and sets out after her. Unfortunately, things don't quite go according to plan. While a huge ghostly hound joins the hunt and the girl dies of fear and exhaustion, Sir Hugo also dies and the hound feasts on his throat. Holmes, of course, views this as little more than a fairy tale. However, those who live close to Baskerville Hall are worried that the curse of the Baskervilles has returned. Several have seen a huge black hound on the moors, \\"luminous, ghastly and spectral\\", while Mortimer himself discovered massive paw-prints close to where Sir Charles' body was found. Unlike Hugo, Sir Charles was very highly thought of by all those who knew him. Dr Mortimer is naturally very concerned for Sir Charles' nephew and heir. Sir Henry, the last surviving Baskerville, will very shortly be arriving in London from Canada.<br /><br />Naturally, the bad news keeps coming for Sir Henry. He has barely arrived in London when he receives a mysterious letter warning him to keep away from Baskerville Hall, there's a mysterious bearded man is following his every move, an escaped killer is living rough on the moors and (strangely) someone keeps stealing his boots. Not to be put off, Sir Henry decides to return to the ancestral home - though not without Watson. Holmes, initially, is unable to join them - there are a few cases in London needing his immediate attention. However, he does issue Watson with some very clear instructions on how to proceed.<br /><br />A short and easy read...though not quite as scary or as dramatic as I'd imagined. I'd put this partly down to the `old fashioned' writing - while it was probably pacey stuff at the time it was written, it's a little stiff and formal by today's standards. I was also a little disappointed with Holmes : while Watson was a likeable character, I couldn't really warm to the great Sherlock. He struck me as an egotistical showman, a little too keen to hog the spotlight. (He practically threw a huff when Mortimer compared him unfavourably to Bertillion). He appeared desperate to deduce everything - whether he needed to or not - so that people could marvel at his incredible intellect. ( I also wondered if he was - at least partly - trying to keep Watson in his place). Still, there isn't too much damage done : Holmes goes missing for a stretch, and that gives Watson - who is much more likeable - the limelight.e who knew him. Dr Mortimer is naturally very concerned for Sir Charles' nephew and heir. Sir Henry, the last surviving Baskerville, will very shortly be arriving in London from Canada.     Naturally, the bad news keeps coming for Sir Henry. He has barely arrived in London when he receives a mysterious letter warning him to keep away from Baskerville Hall, there's a mysterious bearded man is following his every move, an escaped killer is living rough on the moors and (strangely) someone keeps stealing his boots. Not to be put off, Sir Henry decides to return to the ancestral home - though not without Watson. Holmes, initially, is unable to join them - there are a few cases in London needing his immediate attention. However, he does issue Watson with some very clear instructions on how to proceed.      A short and easy read...though not quite as scary or as dramatic as I'd imagined. I'd put this partly down to the `old fashioned' writing - while it was probably pacey stuff at the time it was written, it's a little stiff and formal by today's standards. I was also a little disappointed with Holmes : while Watson was a likeable character, I couldn't really warm to the great Sherlock. He struck me as an egotistical showman, a little too keen to hog the spotlight. (He practically threw a huff when Mortimer compared him unfavourably to Bertillion). He appeared desperate to deduce everything - whether he needed to or not - so that people could marvel at his incredible intellect. ( I also wondered if he was - at least partly - trying to keep Watson in his place). Still, there isn't too much damage done : Holmes goes missing for a stretch, and that gives Watson - who is much more likeable - the limelight.
B00P7PJ9P0|4|An imaginative retelling of Sleeping Beauty from the viewpoint of the &#34;evil&#34; fairy who cursed Aurora.  She was not an evil fairy, but a betrayed one.  The story is beautifully captured with excellent special effects and a magical feel.  The acting was very good.  Angelina Jolie was a stand out as Maleficent and the rest of the cast turned in very good performances.  The dragon was magnificent. Because it was somewhat violent, I wouldn't recommend this for very young children and suggest parents preview before allowing them to view it.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is great. I love this game. Every time I have my kindle fire I play it. My favorite thing about the game is that it goes to different parts of the world.
B001UFQNF0|4|Fast Shipping, my son loves it as do I. I would recommend this to anyone who is a BTTF fan.
B000N4SHOE|5|This is such a sweet movie...and the scenery is gorgeous!  I have already watched it several times.  This was a great buy!
B006PHD0RW|5|fresh and great idea! bag it really shows that there's way more to touch gaming than angry birds! I got it on the free app of the day and I would pay for it several times already!
0066214122|2|I have been onboard with Crichton since Sphere came out many moons ago, but, sadly I am jumping off his bandwagon. I trudged through Airframe, Disclosure and Rising Sun to see if he would return to his own created genre. However, what original ideas he used to have are now becoming formulaic non-sense. Here is Crichton's formula - Research Obscure Technology + Find Worst Case Scenario + Have Technology Act Out Worst Case Scenario + Isolated Location (underwater, desert, medieval Europe, whatever)+ Ignorant Character and Children = brilliant novel, plus a script Spielburg will look at (crosses fingers). Can't wait to see him tackle the time-travel issue, oh he already did.  It was enjoyable in a mindless way, plus you get to feel smarter about yourself afterward. Anyway, I'm not expecting much from him next time and I'll wait for the paperback.
B00D8HNR2K|1|I must be an old timer. I borrowed this CD from the library.  I thought the first song was acceptable but then they got worse and worse and I gave up on it after a few songs.  One man whispering angrily with his drum machine.
0894803123|5|Really fun, tasty recipes, though most are a bit rich for a healthy diet, but then, it is a dessert book, right? Great jumping off place to create your own, too, which they encourage. Just a really fun book to read for recipe affectionados.
B003Y5H5BA|5|Remakes always have the chance of being really terrible.<br />I mean, you are working with a classic and making it within today's terms.<br />But they did a really good job with this one....<br />Like really good!
B00IK1NTCW|5|simplistic yet with adequate functionality.
B000XTLUW0|2|When I purchased this cd/dvd it was written that the dvd was zone 2. ( for europeans dvd readers like mine)  and when it arrived the dvd is only zone 1 so I cannot see it. I expect amazon to do something about this.

B003UBTX7C|5|What am I going to read after this?!  I thoroughly enjoyed this series...I think we need them to resurface and come to the rescue again.
B00N1HONIO|4|One of the best games on the kindle fire. Way better than I thought it would be, but when Foxy runs at your door the game lags badly.
B00B0LPWU6|4|Started out a little slow, and built to the end. Very good movie
6305728437|5|Got it, good to go. :)
B00F8F3J2S|5|I highly recommend this book.  It lacks so much of the partisan back and forth of the day and focuses on the young men and women going into harm's way on behalf of their country,<br /><br />It is as fair to both Bush and Obama as it is contrite for mistakes made and proud of our nation.  Mr Gates is truly a patriot  with an astounding record of public service.
B000HSKUBE|1|I thought I was getting the new version.  This bored me to DEATH.  Well, not death.  I am still here.  But damn near it.  NEAR death.
B0009P5YXO|3|But I'll tell you what it does do--it's very good at making noises and lighting up!<br /><br />It's a great replica to have on your desk and occasionally wave around and buzz people with, but it does have a few major issues. The screw that holds the emitter in has a tendency to shake loose and fall out, which means you have to tighten it again ant again. The bit at the end with the interchangeable pens is prone to falling off if you're not careful with it.<br /><br />That being said, it makes Doctor Who fans freak out when you pull it out of your jacket and buzz the doors with it while casually leaning on the automatic door opener button. Which makes it quite fun, though it must be used sparingly, due to its embarrassing tendency to fall apart.<br /><br />I gave it three stars for educational value due to the UV light and invisible ink marker. In the hands of a science teacher, the toy could be used as a demonstration of why certain things glow under certain wavelengths of light.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I have waited for this CRAZY game to come to my kindle. It finally came and my family has been paying ever since. Just as addictive as on my computer
B003719G40|5|Excellent book. I would recommend everyone read this book. This book could save many relationships. I look forward to reading other books by Gary D Chapman
B00D48BSBA|3|Fredrick Forsyth has been my favorite writer since the age 18. This particular novel doesn't have that class which he has been showing till early years of 2000. He is no doubt a fantastic story teller and he still holds his class after so many years in this book as well.<br />His books always has been informative and this one also is not an exception. You get to understand a lot on how MI5 And MI6 works. But the plot of some muslim terrorist and hunting him down has become so common post 9/11 days, that I felt i am reading some bits a pieces from various other novels.<br />It's a good read and will be a nice buy if you haven't read anything from Fredrick since a long time!
B0007TKNL0|5|I watched this wonderful movie the other night with my mother, whom has seen the stage production two times.  Not being a big opera buff I was anticipating watching a so-so movie.<br /><br />Was I wrong!!!  From the first scene to the last rose, this movie held me captivated.  I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, the singing, the set, the costumes.  I only wish that I had seen the stage production. (Who knows, maybe I can win the trip to New York).  If you are hesitating about buying or watching this movie, DON'T!  Whether you watch it with someone you love or watch it alone, you will be mesmerized and have a loving and more sensitive heart afterwards.  BRAVO to the producers, actors and anyone else involved in this movie.

Now I am The Master.\\"<br /><br />\\"You can't win Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.\\"<br /><br />\\"Remember, \\"The Force\\" will be with you..., always.\\"<br /><br />- Luke Skywalker yearns to learn the family business, Darth Vader tells Obi-Wan Kenobi he's no square, but, Obi-Wan tells his former apprentice he, once again, has the high ground & spiritually tells Luke to keep the faith in \\"Star Wars\\"<br /><br />Released 28 years ago today in less than 32 theaters nationwide (compared to \\"Revenge Of The Sith\\"'s 3600+ theaters), \\"Star Wars\\" still remains one of the great all time science fiction films, that is a tribute to the Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, &  Western serials of the past. \\"Star Wars\\" gave the dying sci-fi genre a much needed jolt in the arm, in the late 70's & has generated millions of fans the world over. The film, after all these years, still remains one of the highest grossing films in history (currently at 450+ million dollars).<br /><br />Taking place roughly twenty years after \\"Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith\\", \\"Star Wars\\" (renamed \\"Epiosde IV: A New Hope\\" in 1999, after the release of the first prequel film) has the galaxy under the grip of the tyrannical Galactic Empire (the former Republic from the prequel films).<br /><br />The Empire's ultimate weapon, The Death Star (shown in a skelatal structure at the end of \\"Sith\\") has come to fruition & spells certain doom for the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom to the galaxy.<br /><br />Princess Leia, senator of the planet Alderaan, races home aboard her starship after stealing schematic plans to the battle station. Imperial forces, led by Darth Vader, intercept the ship, take Leia hostage, & destroy the ship, but, not before the Princess records a short message to Genaral Obi-Wan Kenobi & downloads the message with the valuable, stolen Death Star plans into a nearby astromech droid. As fate would have it, Artoo-Detoo is the recipient & with his companion See-Threepio use an escape pod to get off the ship blasting to the planet of Tatooine below.<br /><br />Once on the surface, & through some unusual circumstances, the droids fall into the hands of Owen Lars, & his step-nephew, Luke Skywalker. While cleaning up the two droids, Luke accidently stumbles across the ending of the message Artoo was trying to  keep hidden (\\"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Your my only hope\\").<br /><br />Luke tells his Uncle about the message & in response wants both droids memory's erased (it must have dawned on Owen that both droids have been here before & he knows the history surrounding them). Luke also asks if he can join the Academy (most of his friends have already gone), but, his Uncle also nixes that idea (as Luke leaves the dinner table, in a huff, Owens wife, Beru, tells him that Luke has to much of his father's spirit in him. Owen's reply, \\"That's what I'm afraid of.\\").<br /><br />But, Artoo has other plans. Insistent on delivering the message to Obi-Wan, Artoo ditches Threepio, while Luke & his family are at dinner, & goes searching for the Jedi Knight himself. Upon this discovery, Luke sets out early the following morning, with Threepio, & unknowingly sets his destiny to become a Jedi Knight into motion.<br /><br />\\"Star Wars\\" is the first film to be released, but, is Episode IV, chronilogically in the overall saga. Thanks to the monsterous success of this film, the rest of the saga was a go. \\"Star Wars\\" was first created as a stand alone film (in case it flopped at the box-office). With its first re-release, the film then had the \\"Episode IV, A New Hope\\" moniker attached to the opening prologue. Nominated for 11 Oscars (winner of 8).<br /><br />Over the past 28 years:<br />\\"Star Wars\\" has been re-released 7 times (including the Special Edition release) in theaters,& released on video 7 times (including the 2004 DVD release, a repricing in the late 80's, & a repackage (very badly) in the early 90's ). I've seen a very early rental copy of \\"Star Wars\\", with a plastic clamshell box that says \\"for rental only\\" at the bottom of the box from 1983, go for sale on e-bay, a few years back, for roughly 250 to 300 bucks. Thats a rarity.<br /><br />Differences over the years:<br /><br />The film had different audio tracks according to the film's format in theatre's (two types of formats were used in the original release, 35 mm & 70 mm. The 35 mm tracks were recorded first for national distribution while the 70 mm tracks were recorded for special releases. Rumor has it that these tracks weren't finished until the morning of the film's release).<br /><br />In 1997, the original trilogy was released in theatres as Special Edition's. the negative for \\"Star Wars\\" was cleaned up with a few new scenes added among them:<br /><br />The Stormtrooper squad that finds the droids escape pod is a lot bigger than in the original release. Overall, nice effect that either way doesn't kill the film.<br /><br />Mos Eisley spaceport gets a big redo. Instead of the hole in the ground from the original release, here its a big spaceport complete with ships taking off & all sorts of new scum & villainy walking the streets. Overall, this was always Lucas' vision, but, again, due to time & budget back in the day he had to make due with what he had. Still, he didn't need to take out the werewolf creature from the cantina.<br /><br />During the confrontation between Greedo & Han Solo, Greedo shoots first while the original shot of Solo firing is now a retaliation shot. The most absolute damning thing George Lucas has done to the moviegoing public (that includes \\"Howard The Duck\\"). This basiclaly destroys some of Han Solo's character. This guy doesn't take s*it from anybody. But, with the tinkering of this shot, its now just in self-defense. It sucks anyway you look at it.<br /><br />Jabba The Hutt makes an appearance (he was originally supposed to be in the film, but, due to budget & money constraints in 1976, he could never be fully realized). A fully grown Boba Fett is also present in the background setting up his bigger role in \\"Empire\\". Overall, cool effect & the scene was always meant to be there. But, Jabba looks a bit odd & doesn't look like the Jabba from \\"Return Of The Jedi\\".<br /><br />Han Solo is chased by battalions of Stormtrooopers instead of five. Overall, funny effect, but, so was the original.<br /><br />Certain dogfight scenes were replaced with CGI substitues to make the battle's more tight & fast. Overall, needed in spots & the battle is now more of a grand scale assault.<br /><br />A new scene between Luke & his friend Biggs Darklighter has been added before the space battle at the climax of the film. Note: a line about Luke's father is cut. As Red Leader is about to speak to Luke & Biggs a crewman walks in front of the camera with Red Leader, saying \\"You'll do all right.\\" The correct line is \\"If your as good a pilot as your father was, You'll do all right.\\" Overall, nice scene that lets the viewer in on a little bit of the friendship between Luke & Biggs before his death.<br /><br />For the 2004 DVD release:<br /><br />A new Jabba The Hutt takes the place of the old. Overall, needed. The new Jabba looks more like the \\"Jedi\\" Jabba, and is better for it.<br /><br />A 27 year old film gaffe is finally fixed. If you have an old VHS copy of the film, fast forward to the scene where just after Darth Vader cuts down Obi-Wan Kenobi, notice when the big metal doors close, take a careful notice to the color of Vader's lightsabre. Its rotoscope white, not the trademark red. That has finally been fixed. The other gaffe's haven't.<br /><br />The audio seems a bit off. Whenever Vader speaks, his breathing takes a backseat while his voice is less synthsizory & has more tamber to it.

0385504209|4|This book is a page turner no matter what your beliefs are.  The murder mystery, codes, etc, will keep you interested even if you disagree with the theology.<br />However, Brown is careful to note through the character's dialogue that there are two sides to every story.  For every person who tries to say the theories in this book are false and cannot be proven - please keep in mind that you cannot prove the Bible, either.  Neither this particular belief nor the Bible can be proven or disproven.  It is a matter of what you believe - that is why it's called &quot;faith&quot;.  You must have an open mind and accept the fact that there are two sides to every story instead of immediately decrying the theology as bunk.  It is not saying that Jesus did not exist, it is not saying he was not wise and enlightened, it is not saying that he was not crucified.  All the fundamental aspects of what we were taught are there.  It is simply the other side of the story.  Which one you choose to believe is up to you.  But I advise gathering all the information first.<br />The one flaw in the book is how the two main characters get out of certain situations / jams, etc.  That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.  Some of their &quot;escapes&quot;, so to speak, might be able to occur but one in particular really stretches the limits of plausibility, in my humble opinion.
B000FC12Z0|4|4.5 stars<br />This is one of those books that you think you know what's going to happen, mostly because you've heard about the book over the years. I went into this book thinking there was no way it could live up to all the praise I have heard lavished upon it. I was wrong, on so many levels. I'm thankful that I decided to read this classic mystery, and I'm also happy that I didn't watch the film version first.
B00005N6KG|5|These is the most comfortable headphones I've used, and I've bought and used some very nice ones. I wear glasses and regular headphones become painful after 30-60 minutes. Ear plugs trap moisture in the ear canal and that's uncomfortable after a few hours. While it may seem nothing will make me happy, these headphones do. I've used them for several weeks now, and I'm still happy.<br /><br />Edited March 2015:<br />I bought these March 2015 and love them as much as the MDR-W08L:<br />SONXTRONIC Xdr-8000 Vertical in Ear Ultralight Sport Running Headband Headphones<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QHOCTG6/<br />$25 is fair, quality seems good, them wear the same.

B002IFT1ZA|5|Game of thrones season one.<br />At first viewing I saw some of the actors as too old for their parts. People described as black haired being reddish brown. This bothered me for exactly one episode. I was carried away and living with each of them as I had in the books . I feel as if I know them even more intimately than I did before these are splendid renditions of George Martins books. I can not wait for the next seasons and his next book.
B002C6K7N0|1|I am a huge metal fan, since early 80's with a wide range of tastes. I like everything from old school Exodus to Dying Fetus. Deicide, Slayer, Morbid Angel, Suffocation, etc. are some of my current favorites.  Anyways, as far as Megadeth goes, Peace Sells is my all-time favorite album. It, as well as Killing is my Business, are un-duplicatable masterpieces.  That's the Megadeth I have loved since I was a in jr. high.  Those albums gives me goosebumps to this day when I listen to them.  Endgame, however, is NOT anything like that.  In fact, I think it sucks a$$!  Where is the angry heavy a$$ heavy music that everyone is craving about in this album?  I haven't found it yet. I've heard the whole album 3 times now; hoping that like Rust in Piece, it would just take hearing it a few times through to love it.  Anyway, I'm VERY dissapointed.  If you are hoping to hear what everyone is raving about, hoping to hear a mere hint of Megadeth past, allow me to crush those hopes now.  I sometimes see Mustaine in a Japanese steak house where I live. If I see him again, I would be very tempted to provide him this feedback... but out of respect for his privacy, and to avoid getting a black eye, I'll just have to bite my tongue.    Now, on the flipside, I'm not saying this isn't a good album for someone that likes metal with more of a \\"rock\\" sound to it; but to put Megadeth's name on it is simply wrong.

0525425772|5|JOhn Grisham does it again. He has written another young adult book that presents the essnce of a boy at early adolescent age. In addition, his story line gives the reader a vivid picture of life and conflicts facing Theodore. Grisham descriptive writing keeps the reader interested throughout the book. I think this series will become the &#34;Hardy Boys&#34; of the 2000's. I look forward to the next book in the series
B00DPM7TIG|1|This was a difficult read. Too wordy, too much descriptive detail which really did not relate to the story. The story also went back and forth in time without a clear delineation of the time frame you are in.
B00000K2SC|4|I like sci-fi, big-budget, far-fetched, over-the-top films. Thankfully, &quot;The Matrix&quot; came out last April. I went to go see it for my 13th birthday on the 20th. You guessed it, I saw one of the reasons for the  Columbine shootings ON the day of the Columbine shootings. Weird,  huh?<br />Visuals: Amazing special effects, art direction, cinematography,  everything! If this doesn't get a visual effects nomination at the Oscars,  then there is no justice.<br />Overall Visuals Grade: A+<br />Acting:<br />They'll  probably get nominated at the MTV Movie Awards, but they were all still  very believable and good.<br />Overall Acting Grade: A-<br />Screenplay/Story:  Though far-fetched, it is still a great story with no plot holes or weird  sayings. Just smooth as a baby's a** writing.<br />Overall Screenplay/Story  Grade: A-<br />Sound/Editing: Computer sounds and machine gun fire are just a  few sound effects. Too bad I don't have a DVD player or I could watch this  at full blast. Editing was flawless.<br />Overall Sound/Editing Grade:  A<br />Comments: This is one reason to leave your kids home when you go to the  movies. If they have a good sense of real and make-believe (also, if you  permit your kids to see brutal violence) then they'll have no problem with  this.<br />MPAA Rating: R for sci-fi violence and brief language. The violence  is fairly strong and too intense for younger children. There are no  &quot;F&quot; words in this. Though, there are ample &quot;S&quot; words.
B002MQYOFW|5|This book was great. I watched the movie first, and was sure the book would be better, as they always are. I was not disappointed! I can't wait to read the next two before they are movies.
B00008H2LB|2|This CD is a perefct example of why alot of folks hate new metal. First there's the drums. Like most new metal bands they are processed and myre the depth of the music and overal quality of the alledged metal feel. The lyrics are just what every drama queen teenage punk wants to hear. Wich is pure uncontrolled emeotional despair and rage. Not only is it annoying and cliche, but it takes very little skill to write. The giutars are an improvment from Hybrid Theory, hats off to them for elvoving in that department at least. But they are still simplistic to the point of limiting the replay value significantly. <br /> <br /> All in all....It's a notch above other new metal bands at best, and a slap in the face to music in general at worst. You decide.
B009FZHYKU|5|This is one of the best shows today. The psychology behind the characters is mind blowing. The zombies are cool too
B003Y74KCK|2|It was not as white as it looks in the picture and is not sturdy enough. I would not recommend it.
B00GO95BUU|3|As with previous celebratory episodes of the series, the 50th anniversary episode of Doctor Who pitted different iterations of the same character on the screen together, including one which we had not seen before (outside of a brief moment of foreshadowing for this very episode) and well… a spoiler would fit in quite nicely here.<br /><br />So, obviously, the world was excited.  My friends (most of them) were excited.  My wife was excited (a selection of treats including jammy dodgers, jelly babies, and fish fingers and custard was created for our viewing event).  And yes…I was a bit excited.  There were so many rumors going around about this thing, which of the previous 10 doctors were going to appear, which villains were coming about, what previous companions were going to join in, and a whole host of other murmurs regarding this single 75 minute episode.<br /><br />So, perhaps I came into the episode with my hopes too high.  As someone who’s been recently making his way through the original episodes, trying to fill out my geek card as well as possible, I was hoping for something that would work well as an homage to the entirety of the previous 50 years of story telling.<br /><br />I was disappointed.<br /><br />Although there were questions that were answered (in minimal fashion) that were initially asked back when the series restarted in 2005, it seemed that most of the series prior to that date was forgotten about.  Sure, there were little head nods toward costume choices, character names, and pictures of companions; there were overt attempts to remind people that this show has been around for awhile, including a moment that would be too much of a spoiler as well as the final shot of the episode, which actually reminded me a bit of the old episode titled The Five Doctors.<br /><br />But, heck, even this episode didn’t resolve it’s own storylines.  All three of the doctor’s leave a tense moment with aliens who are in the midst of invading earth (aren’t they always?) to deal with their own personal issues.  We never see how things resolve… the story line was really only there to show a monster that only appeared one time prior in the entirety of the show.<br /><br />Overall, the episode had its moments.  There were definitely some exciting bits in which little fanboy jumps of the heart occurred.  But as a story…it was lacking, it was confusing, and more than that, it really didn’t do the series as a whole any form of justice.  Instead of acting as an homage, it really only served as a launch pad for the new face of the doctor, so we have an idea of where his stories will be going.<br /><br />I’m not saying that we needed Tom Baker back on the ground, sonic screwdriver in hand as he goes on a hunt for the ghost of Patrick Troughton.  But I do think that a lot more could have been done to make this an actual anniversary episode for something that has spanned a half a century, as opposed to the precursor for next season that it really ended up being.<br /><br />It’s totally worth the watch…but I’m not certain it was worth the attention the BBC gave it.’t they always?) to deal with their own personal issues.  We never see how things resolve… the story line was really only there to show a monster that only appeared one time prior in the entirety of the show.<br /><br />Overall, the episode had its moments.  There were definitely some exciting bits in which little fanboy jumps of the heart occurred.  But as a story…it was lacking, it was confusing, and more than that, it really didn’t do the series as a whole any form of justice.  Instead of acting as an homage, it really only served as a launch pad for the new face of the doctor, so we have an idea of where his stories will be going.<br /><br />I’m not saying that we needed Tom Baker back on the ground, sonic screwdriver in hand as he goes on a hunt for the ghost of Patrick Troughton.  But I do think that a lot more could have been done to make this an actual anniversary episode for something that has spanned a half a century, as opposed to the precursor for next season that it really ended up being.<br /><br />It’s totally worth the watch…but I’m not certain it was worth the attention the BBC gave it.
B0086700CM|3|It was okay at first but then it was boring. I still like it but it gets boring! I like it for likeva day!
0061998494|5|Well, basically I love Craig Ferguson. I think he's an amazing tv host and a comedic genius. Genuine writing here. I'm only about halfway through this book actually but if you like the Late Late Show I recommend giving it a read. You will enjoy it.
B00ECAXMLI|4|I love a novel that takes me away and absorbs me in another world.  Treasure Island did that. A classic that will last forever.
B0017SWPXY|5|I loved this book! I will never forget this book. Enzo really inspired me. We may think we are the smartest species but this dog has a lot to teach us...
B009VIZDLI|4|finished to abruptly
B00JJXTP64|3|Let me start by saying I love all of Nalini Singh's books, but I kind of felt that this one was a little anticlimactic. After Archangel's Legion I just expected something with a little more drama and to me this book was all but done in the first few chapters. I was super excited for Ash's and Janvier's story and it just wasn't what I was expecting. But overall it was a good book and I would recommend it...solid 3.5 stars!!
B000XUBFE2|4|The story as sad as it was was one of hope and survival through human kindness and compassion. Characters whose fragility was tested on a daily basis during the Hitler reign. How something as simple as the reading of a book by an adolescent brought some peace to a small town subjected to the atrocities of that time.
B00957T6X6|5|Tough to put this down!  Great series but some disappointing character deaths... maybe they will return in the future.  Who knows.
B00NH13W2W|5|Much better than the Apple cables that fall apart and are overpriced.
B003LSTK8G|5|everyone should read this book and then demand the passage of strong laws that restrict the activities of the financial community

B00H43WOAK|1|UPDATE - Finally gave up on this.  That was $130 wasted.  Yet again, tried to take a 3 pressure reading and it gets an error on the 3rd reading causing you to start over.  30 minutes to get your blood pressure?  That's some amazing technology.  Get anything other than this.  Their other products (I have their scale and pedometer) aren't too hot either.  Poor engineering and poor software integration makes for a bad product.  This product will sync and work for about the first month, but after that it becomes very unreliable.  Readings vary way more than regular blood pressure deviation can account for, and the device itself stops taking measurements.  Will constantly give a &#34;Measurement Failed&#34; error when trying to take a reading.  I used to use the average of 3 readings (which is a nice feature) but the cuff is so unreliable I'm lucky to get one.  Even then, it usually takes about 30 minutes of re-positioning the cuff to just get one reading.  Avoid this product.  I think most reviews are based on the first month of use, don't be fooled by the high rating on Amazon.
B00R7FZ074|4|The Imitation Game<br />  If you are looking for an espionage thriller similar to “The Code Breakers” or “The Ultra Secret” don't look here.  “The Imitation Game” tells the tragic, heart bending story of Alan Turing, the unsung and virtually unknown mathematical genius who did as much or more as any general to bring World War II to a successful conclusion.  The Nazis developed a code making device called Enigma by the Allies which resisted all attempts to penetrate its secrets.  A small band of British mathematicians eventually made a counter machine powerful enough to break the secret of Enigma.  This struggle has been covered before both in print and on film.<br /> The personal story of Alan Turing has until now been known to very few.  Many people with genius level intellects have a difficult time inter acting with ordinary mortals.  We find no exception in Alan Turing.  He carries the additional burden of homosexuality in a time when society in Britain not only frowned upon such but actually legally prohibited its practice.  Turing, already cut off from nearly everyone by his towering intelligence was further and unhappily separated from general society by his sexual preferences and social bigotry.<br /> The film covers three discrete tales.  It tells the story of the battle to break the Nazi code.  It also tells the tragic life story of a brilliant man who deserves our acknowledgment for his service to humanity in defeating Nazism.  And finally it displays the injustice of by-gone social conventions and the toll they take on the unconventional.  That packs a lot of story into one hour and 54 minutes.<br /> Director Morten Tyldum has only two other and very minor films to his credit.  Blasting right into the stratosphere of an Oscar nomination seems like a hard act to follow.  Screen Writer Graham Moore has no other writing credits.  This makes an amazingly successful debut for him.<br /> The compelling story is matched by terrific performances by anoutstanding cast, headed by Bennedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing.  He manages to portray the distracted genius as an emotionally and social isolated man who never the less has the same kinds of emotional needs as the rest of us.  He is matched by Keira Knightly an another mathematician.  The two fall into one of the oddest and most intellectual kinds of love.  The relationship between the two makes the film for me.<br /> Made on a slender $14 million budget the film grabbed 8 Oscar nominations and an invigorating box office gross of $126 million.  The PG-13 film rates a somber four saw blades for a tragic story told and acted at the highest levels.

B00005OAA6|4|No Victoria Beckham did NOT have the worst voice of the Spice Girls.  That dubious honour goes to one Ms Halliwell.  VB's voice however is more style than substance...but as we all know...this girl has STYLE!  This album was cruelly overlooked and underappreciated by the UK.  A good pop/r&amp;b-light album to shake your ass too. One criticism is that there are too many ballads and the r&amp;b bit is rather tired.  If Victoria sticks to POP/dance she'll do fine.  Check out her new single LET YOUR HEAD GO.  Wicked!
B005LAIHPY|5|We seem to always watch this when we come across it on cable, thought we would bite the bullet & purchase it in Blu-ray!
B0027MJU00|4|Very good, quick read.
B0095ZQ36G|5|Gives you the insight of how the war was on both sides. Very well written. Once you start you don't want to put it down.
B000051VWW|5|The new album is great, as good as Promise or Love Deluxe.  Fans should buy it IMMEDIATELY.  It's similar in style to Love Deluxe, low-key, smooth and unforgettable.  If you've never heard any of the great music Sade makes, try this out--it's amazing.
B005BY3XHC|5|This is a great book, I would recommend it to anyone.  It really helps you cope with daily living.  It has an effect of getting to your spiritual side.
B00AHGSVKS|4|Interesting Sci Fi story by a classic author. A little dated but still enjoyable.

B000EHSVSC|5|Excellent film. History lesson.
B005XQLBU4|4|Just installed this on the kindle fire.  the game works flawlessly and it is really really polished.  The only reason that I deducted a star is because it lacks additional modes and it felt like there was no end to the game.  Not too fond of games that you can't finish... only try to keep beating the high score.    After getting all the upgrades and hitting night 25 it gets way too hard for me.  lots of fun playing it though.
B00AEFXZ1C|5|Loved it!

B0006399FS|5|I bought the CD yesterday when it released and LOVE it. This album represents what has made U2 a great band! Pure rock and roll. The band's staying power is again exhibited in this offering. If you like \\"Joshua Tree\\", \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" you will like this CD. \\"Pop\\" it is not, for which I am glad. Buy it and enjoy!
B00SI7OCWO|5|I received the CD this week and all all  the songs are beautiful, their voices blend so amazingly wonderful. I have been a fan since the first time I heard them sing. A MUST HAVE !
0446585041|1|I agree with the others that gave a negative rating, this book is a waste.  On her show she is endearing but in print it just comes off as annoying.  She goes in circles to the point I had to put it down at times and walk away and it is a fairly short book.  I think I only actually laughed one time on the whole reading.  Also I feel really bad because I had bought this for my best friend as a birthday present to take on a long flight, feel like I owe her a new gift now.<br /><br />I haven't read her other two books so I dont know how they compare but at this point I doubt I would bother to find out.  I definitely do not recommend this book.
B005ZB91KY|5|My son has gotten me into watching these Marvel movies.  Great!  Looking forward to the next one.
B0047T86G0|5|This is a valuable resource for those who care about language. To make it searchable all you have to do is make it the Kindle default dictionary -- a quick and easy setting that can be changed to any other compatible dictionary at any time.<br /><br />The reviewer who claims this dictionary is not searchable on a Kindle apparently doesn't understand the difference between the \\"Search this book\\" option and the \\"Search dictionary\\" option. It is all clearly spelled out in the Kindle User Guide.
B004H6G0TI|4|The game is not complicated and easy to learn. There are a lot of options for airplanes to unlock. Many of these are sort of &#34;tongue in cheek&#34; and cute. My kids love it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5|I am a sucker for a good mystery and love to &quot;figure things out&quot;.  The graphics and sounds are fantastic.  I agree with another post that I wish it lasted longer.  Loved The Room 2 as well!  Can't wait for three!
B002ZG98FU|3|\\"Morning Glory\\" is predictable but watchable.  The story is about a young female TV producer, Becky Fuller, (Rachel Adams), who loses her job.  She moves in with her parents and frantically searches for another job to get out of a \\"told you so\\" situation.  She finally lands a Morning Show job as Executive Producer, but the show's ratings are in the dumps.  Working with feuding co-hosts (Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton) keeps her hopping and hoping that something will \\"click.\\"  Nothing seems to be working, and the show seems dull and lifeless.  Soon her boss (played by Jeff Goldblum) calls her in to say the show is cancelled.  Becky begs for one more chance... and the rest is history.<br /><br />Overall the movie is entertaining, and you hope Becky, the young TV producer, will succeed.  She has many obstructions to overcome, but, like the Ever Ready Bunny, she keeps trying and trying.  The movie gets funny toward the end and, of course, Becky saves the day.

1586210912|4|For a three disc set you only need discs 2 &amp; 3 to learn anything. Disc 1 is an autobiographical account about Mr. Kiyosaki and a childhood friend &quot;creating their own money.&quot; I found this quite boring.  I think it's more of a lead to introduce you to Rich Dad and Poor Dad.  Discs 2 &amp; 3 were fantastic and I learned quite a bit.  No need to buy into his infomercial items as I think he hits 90% of that stuff right here in this audio book.  If you need inspiration to be an entrepreneur, this is the tool for you!
B004J4WKUQ|5|This was a very enjoyable read. I loved the dialogue and descriptions of the games.  The ending was a bit anticlimactic.  However, overall, a great read.
B000002KLP|3|I only gave this album 3 stars because I know he has better work out there. Although he has hits like &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; and &quot;Uptown&quot; no song really stands out to grab me. Then there is &quot;When You Were Mine&quot;, but even that song hasn't grabbed me yet. Overall, this is one of the few albums that works well being played as a whole, but other than that, nothing here excites me.
B00FB13Y74|3|I am in love with this me and my sister lately together all the time I think u will like it to
0385504209|1|Where to start?<br />Well first of all, for all those \\"intellectuals\\" that think that Dan Brown has DICOVERED something, think again.  This book has been written in various different forms by other people preceeding Dan Brown (Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln; The Goddess in the Gospels: Reclaiming the Sacred Feminine and The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail, both by Margaret Starbird, and The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets by Barbara G. Walker).  This in not to say that his crap is true, on the other hand, his references will show that his points are invalid.  The references used for this book do not cite source documents from Jesus' time.  Instead, the only real mention of the Mary Magdalene scenario is a kiss in the gnostic gospel of Philip, and a mention in the gnostic gospel of Mary.  Both of which were rejected by the early Church fathers very early after the death of Christ (200 a.d.).  Any research on the Church fathers will show that the canon of the bible surfased long before Constantine, and never contained anything about Jesus being married!  Was it a \\"cover up?\\"  Well, considering that the actual bible has been historically documented only decades after Jesus' death, while the gnostic gospels sprouted up hundreds of years after that, proves that they are likely false.  If you have the desire to read this book, just remember that you cant believe everything you read.  You owe it to yourself to research Dan Brown's claims before falsely accepting them.<br />\\"It is just fiction.\\"  This has been heard before, and is quite ridiculous in that Dan Brown himself tells his reader that it is not all fiction.  Although, I do agree that even the \\"facts\\" in this book are fiction, it is important not to blow this off as a meaningless fictional plot that has no intention of criticizing Christianity.<br />To my surprise, Dan Brown has \\"discovered\\" that the Catholic Church killed five million women as witches.  This is ridiculous, the actual number is historically estimated between 30,000 to 50,000 victims.  Not all were executed by the Church, not all were women, and not all were burned.<br />Perhaps the paintings of Leonardo are more appealing, in that Dan Brown has surely uncovered something there?  Refer to the following from Crisis Magazine (Sandra Miesel. \\"Dismantling The Da Vinci Code.\\" Crisis (September 2003):<br />\\"Brown's revisionist interpretations of da Vinci are as distorted as the rest of his information. He claims to have first run across these views \\"while I was studying art history in Seville,\\" but they correspond point for point to material in The Templar Revelation. A writer who sees a pointed finger as a throat-cutting gesture, who says the Madonna of the Rocks was painted for nuns instead of a lay confraternity of men, who claims that da Vinci received \\"hundreds of lucrative Vatican commissions\\" (actually, it was just one...and it was never executed) is simply unreliable.<br />He presents the Mona Lisa as an androgynous self-portrait when it's widely known to portray a real woman, Madonna Lisa, wife of Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo. The name is certainly not - as Brown claims - a mocking anagram of two Egyptian fertility deities Amon and L'Isa (Italian for Isis). How did he miss the theory, propounded by the authors of The Templar Revelation, that the Shroud of Turin is a photographed self-portrait of da Vinci?<br />Much of Brown's argument centers around da Vinci's Last Supper, a painting the author considers a coded message that reveals the truth about Jesus and the Grail. Brown points to the lack of a central chalice on the table as proof that the Grail isn't a material vessel. But da Vinci's painting specifically dramatizes the moment when Jesus warns, \\"One of you will betray me\\" (John 13:21). There is no Institution Narrative in St. John's Gospel. The Eucharist is not shown there. And the person sitting next to Jesus is not Mary Magdalene (as Brown claims) but St. John, portrayed as the usual effeminate da Vinci youth, comparable to his St. John the Baptist. Jesus is in the exact center of the painting, with two pyramidal groups of three apostles on each side. Although da Vinci was a spiritually troubled homosexual, Brown's contention that he coded his paintings with anti-Christian messages simply can't be sustained.\\"<br />It is impossible for me to point out every amount of falseness in this book, however I urge anyone to research it and find out for yourself.  Remember, ignorance is the opposite of intellegence.  One reason so many \\"intellectuals\\" are buying into this crap, is that it makes them feel more intelligent than the \\"sheep\\" that buy into religious doctrine!  It would be surprising if anyone could obtain the amount of knowledge in one life time that a religion has gained over the course of 2000 or more years!Jesus is not Mary Magdalene (as Brown claims) but St. John, portrayed as the usual effeminate da Vinci youth, comparable to his St. John the Baptist.

0452281881|4|I work in a company that lives and dies by the instant commication known as email and didn't think I would find this funny.  I was intrigued enough by the unique approach to give it a shot, and it seemed like a pretty easy read.<br />It does take some time for the plot to get going and character development can be difficult while attempting to sound like genuine email.  Mr. Beaumont manages to pull it off.  You will recognize all the types of people to be found at any large firm, doing all the things we know they're doing, but no one talks about.  When you realize that every company runs like this you think it's a wonder that anything at all ever gets done.<br />It's saucy, it's crude, and it's loads of fun.  Get this book in one hand, a beer in the other, light the cigarette, and sit back and enjoy.
1891252089|5|I have other books on the practice of Ashtanga yoga. This is the best. The other reviewers have covered the book's excellence. I'll reiterate that it's clear, it's detailed, and it includes abbreviated sessions for those whose time is limited. I have also had the pleasure of being at a workshop led by K. Pattabhi Jois, the founder of the system, and David Swenson, the author, was a few mats down from me. I have seen him in person, I have his DVDs and I can vouch for his mastery. He is also a great teacher who underscores the importance of working at your capacity to avoid injury. Ashtanga is a very athletic and beautiful practice to watch, but the importance is the inside of it, and Swenson helps you work with that. You probably cannot learn Ashtanga from any book or DVD but, if you have a good teacher, this book will be a great tool. I also recommend his DVDs.
6300274268|5|This is My Favoret Disney Movie Ever !!!!!!!!!
B0011HOEY4|4|Excellent acting from Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe and others.  Strange though to see Denzel Washington acts the bad guy, the drug dealer.  That makes the whole movie less convincing, albeit it's based on a true story.  Overall, an okay movie, although I believe director Ridley Scott had a bigger ambition.
B000075BFK|4|2pac... dead or alive, we will forever enjoy his music. This is a great cd. The only problem is their is too many Outlaw appearences. The Outlawz are hot, but this is a 2pac cd. And to prove he is alive go to hidden track 14 on the 2nd disk. Or just look in the cd booklet at track 1. (an intro that has a newsreporter asking where these new 2pac songs are coming from)If you look who it was written by it says T. Shakur. Anyways this is a great cd. The best tracks are Thugz Mansion (both versions), Better Dayz, When we ride on our enemys, and They Don't give a f*ck about us. The cd has excellent beats although they would not be the kind 2pac would write a song to. This is no all eyes on me, but this cd is worth your money. 2pac is coming out with  2003 album, a clothing line and more, so what do you think... dead or alive??
B004LROUNG|5|[[ASIN:B004LROUNG The Litigators]] by John Grisham is near the top of the list of legal tort books. At first, I thought, \\"Oh, no, is Grisham in a rut?\\" But it wasn't long before I was thoroughly immersed in Grisham's spellbinder. A mix of quirky characters, legal plotting, and courtroom circus makes this one of the most entertaining books I've read this year.    Thanks, Mr. Grisham.    Addendum 9/9/14- \\"The Litigators\\" was just as enjoyable the second time around. Crazy but credible. Highly recommended.
0060574216|4|I am halfway through this book. It's very helpful to understand how differently men think from the way women think.
B0013TXA5Y|5|This book was amazing. Many myths all coming true for one person.  I can't wait to see the movie version!
B001414XLQ|5|I LOVE THIS FRICKIN' ALBUM! System Of A Down is my second favorite band (second only to Three Days Grace) and this album is my favorite by SOAD. They've really outdone themselves for their sophomore album. When I first bought the CD, I was getting it for the song \\"Aerials\\", but when I listened to the rest of the CD, I was blown away. I had fallen in love with two other songs \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Science\\". I was also amazed at how short some of these tracks were. \\"Shimmy\\" was only a minute and fifty seconds long! In summary, I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves System Of A Down, or if you're just a fan of rock itself.
B006BDHAX0|4|I LOVE puzzle games. This is so fun and challenging that even my 15 year old son loves to play it.
B000QCS8TW|5|One of the great books of any genre that a I have ever read and I read a lot! The world that Mr. Martin has created is filled with great characters, animals and monsters. And the three surprise endings, including one that is telegraphed almost from the beginning of the book, have you sitting there screaming &#34;OMG&#34; and where is the next book, right now! George R. R. MARTIN has become my favorite author with this series.
B000JMKTLO|4|This was a good read.  The author's style of writing was clear and smooth.  I found it hard to put down.  However, I was a bit disappointed in the ending.  I wanted to know more.  I hope the main character reappears in another book.

B00E9A656K|5|It's the best game I have ever play I can't stop playing it .I can't wait to get more gas so I can keep playing it. It the most realistic game I played. I love the cars.I love how realistic the car look
1400032717|5|What a terrific book. The unique narrator gives us a look into the mind of an autistic person and a new way to look at our own reality.<br />Well worth the short time it takes to read.
0783231202|3|This movie was a part of my college history class. I did find it interesting to learn about this historical event; I hadn't heard about it before. Most of the movie consists of the trials of these enslaved Africans. It seems to be a good portrayal of the event, but it's not incredibly interesting.
B001LF3YQK|2|I thought this case was a great idea but in reality it's a pain. The wipes dry out too fast and the opening is not so easy to use while changing a squiggly baby.

B0000E1WKE|5|Her holiday album is here. Whitney comes back to her choir girl roots, and the result is pleasing. Not unbelievably good, but very good. She may have been through a lot personally, but her voice sounds rich and strong. <br />The song featuring her daughter is a special gift and mothers will find it touching.<br />It is a traditional album which would be good for playing during tree-decorating, cookie-baking days. Also nice for the car ride at night to look at lights. A little less of a party background CD, because people would listen to the CD instead of talk. Overall, enjoyable Christmas music from a Whitney we have missed. She can still sing. Welcome back.
B0001DI0FI|5|This is not your typical action film.<br /><br />People better qualified than I to judge the ship to ship battles have reviewed this film so I will only say that I felt as though I more truly understood life on board a British war ship during the Napoleonic era. Because I love history, this film is one I have seen many times and will no doubt view many times again.<br /><br />The acting is superb, the characters more finely drawn than even in the book series where novels allow for more exposition. The relationships between officers and officers and crew and crew members between themselves makes clear the class distinctions of the time. The strategies that had to be employed in ocean warfare using wooden ships with sails I found fascinating. Having worked in theatre, where the members of the cast are virtually the ONLY people you see regularly every day for months or even years, I can understand the tensions and squabbles that can develop even among close-knit supportive team mates. Without the captain's discipline and order, how much more dangerous could such an environment be, especially during wartime? There are layers upon layers in this film, and all of them handled well.
B002R2B6NE|4|Great, old, classic thriller.
B009NFHF0Q|3|Like all Neil Gaiman works, this book is well written and has great characters.  Unfortunately, this whole book would have been just one of several threads in Gaiman's better, more complex novels.  If you get it, you'll have a good read but, if you're like me, you'll be disappointed when it ends.  As the song goes, you'll be thinking &#34;is that all there is?&#34;

B009FZHYKU|5|I have watched all three seasons and I can't wait until the next season starts!!!! I love Darryl. He is my favorite part of this show! So sexy
B0042FZWC0|4|I really liked this book.  I bought the audiobook based on a referral from someone that I respect.  The reason that I found this book helpful is that is really enlightened me and helped me see that there is an entire world out there that I had been missing.  All that I have ever known is the 8-5 cubicleville lifestyle.  Thanks to Chris for sharing his story and helping me see that there is another possible lifestyle and way of thinking about work and creating the life that I want.  He doesn't say that it's easy, but that it's possible.  He gives us hope and permission that living a life that is authentic to ourselves is possible.  This book is along similar lines to &#34;A Million Miles in a Thousand Years&#34; that also helped me think new ideas.<br />This book isn't for everyone.  this book will challenge your status-quo thinking.  I recommend looking up and reading Chris's Manifesto and seeing if it resonates with you first.  If it doesn't, this book isn't for you.  Google AONC Manifesto.

B007PT1PEY|4|This is the way ebooks should be designed!  Not only is the a complete collection of Holmes fiction, it is presented with generous illustrations throughout.  And best and most important of all, you can locate anything you wish to read or review quickly and simply.  Most other similar Holmes ebook compendium collections are terribly designed with little or no illustrative material, and worst of all they load with terrible delays, and often inaccurately.  This book, unlike many other classic ebbooks, was put together with care and grace.  My favorite edition of Sherlock Holmes in ebook format.

B004J4WLB4|5|As a gardener, I found this novel relatable. As a mother , I found it heart wrenching. It is hard to believe that it is the author's first novel. I am sorry I have finished it. I enjoyed the characters and would like to continue to know them.
B004MC8CA2|5|I have looked at other apps for the Bible but for me this one is the best one.  I really enjoy getting the daily verses and starting my day out on a positive note.
B0015AARJI|5|Everything was good
B00192IV0O|5|I've loved everything Black Eyed Peas have done so far and haven't been disappointed with this CD.  So many times I will buy a CD and only found 1 or 2 tracks I like but there is not one song I don't like on this CD.  All the songs are fun, energetic and simply great to listen to. Buying this CD will be a great addition to your playlists.
0061733199|5|well worth the knolledge, to a beginner camper -pricless info. Has sort of a brittish slang to it in some parts. For those asking: beta lights listed in the book are tritium crystal lights. Includes many good pictures and plants in color.
B002KEZ96Y|5|Loved the dude, the dude abides!
B004HYHANK|2|Repetitive, trying too hard; and she goes to great lengths to describe the descent of one of the characters into quite horrible behavior, then goes nowhere with it.  I woon't bother with any more by this author.
1416550550|5|Enjoyed tremendously!!  Extreme long, but excellent!! Good read...
B009UWYFFK|5|This was a great cartoon movie.  The animation is great with a story line that makes since and is even good to adults.  Has a little adult humor that went right over my kids head but they are little.  I recommend this movie for kids and adults alike
B008Y2FRFO|1|hate it, it's no fun and the coins don't accumulate fast enough to keep my interest, slow slow slow slow
B00EMXBDMA|5|I'm one of those snobs whose skin itches if the science doesn't work or at least be damn well plausible. Alas, lots of SF books don't pass that test.<br /><br />Although I didn't check the orbital calculations or other parameters, this book had me believing!<br /><br />Furthermore, it has a great story line that I is very well told, excellent characters and a hilarious sense of humor.<br /><br />I would give this book 10 stars if I could.  If this author has other books, consider them bought by me!
B0034G4P7Q|5|Great film and honestly, the case is awesome.
0857520652|4|This is a neat story, very quiet and quaint, at turns touching and funny and frustrating. Harold meets all sorts of people along his journey, and we get to hear their stories of heartache, triumph, unfulfilled wishes, and total mundanity. Harold revisits many of his own percieved failures and missed opportunities, and tries to recapture his love of life and his love with Maureen.<br /><br />It's the sort of story they make into a hanky movie, which isn't usually my scene, but I actually quite enjoyed the book. It was a slow read, but satisfying. My only real complaint is that everything seems to be exaggerated. It seems to take FAR too long for him to cover ground, even with all his stops and problems. And does a pair of shoes really need new soles after only 60 miles? Would a man on a walk really capture so much attention? I don't know. For a nitpicky reader like me, it was distracting. Ultimately, though, it doesn't matter how realistic it is, it's still a great story. :)
B00AREIAI8|4|I was extremely impressed with this game. And it has a lot of features that you wouldn't expect with a free game. I also like the social aspect. To a lot of social games are aggravating because you can't move forward without friends. But in this game you can move forward with or without friends. Overall lots of fun!
B00005JKDR|5|This movie rocked!!  Pixar did a wonderful job of taking one of a typical child's fears and turning it into a great idea for a movie.  All the actors lending their voices to the characters were perfect choices, and the animation was just amazing.  Great movie for audiences of all ages.
B0098XY5VK|4|This is less about George and more about a challenging game for both young and old. I always enjoyed playing it on Addicting Games.com, but they don't offer it anymore. This app works pretty well, but it's a tough one to get use to on my Kindle Fire. Going in, you'll think this is easy, but with every passing turn, it gets a bit more challenging to keep up. Go for it. It's fun.
B005K0HDGE|5|I found 11/22/63 a book that was &#34;hard to put down.&#34;  Although there were parts that seemed to slow the story down with too many details, all in all it was a great story.  It had a lot of action plus a good romance and most of the time I was caught up in the book anxious to find the next devopment.
B004MC8CA2|5|this is like having your personal collection of Bibles. I can do so many things with this you will be surprise. thanks for this wonderful tool.
B0072OFOM6|5|I've learned that all the seasons in bluray from Spartacus are great. The manufacture, the materials the box is made of, because it's not your typical plastic box, it's a carton box with great printing quality. And of course, the series is one of the best I've ever seen. MUST HAVE!!
B00288KNL8|5|I really enjoyed this movie!! It was very original and very creative with bright and very detailed animation. The voices suited all the characters well, and the plot wasn't predictable. You always wanted to know what was going to happen next. I definitely recommend this movie to people who enjoy movies that are very original and/ or use this type of animation like some of Tim Burton's movies. I do not recommend it for young children as some of the characters and scenes can be quite scary. It is definitely one of those films you will definite want to see again and again if you enjoy great movies!
B00SXK8R6S|5|Storyline runs very close to the books. Characters are excellent!! Love it!
B00DPM7TIG|3|Good character build up.  Seemed long at times, but very good finish. Couldn't put the book down for the last quarter of the book.
B00296A4F4|5|I could watch Glee everyday.  I have watched the series 3 times now.  I have already ordered season 4. I love it
B00992CF6W|5|This game is totally worth the $7  I usually get bored with a game but I've had this game for 4 months and I haven't gotten sick of it.
B00280LYIC|5|I believe that this book is great.  Awsome details, full of story and frear.  I recomend this book all people who love an adventure, because this book has that too.
B00992CF6W|5|this game is so amazing there is a huge update coming in a few days and there are gowing to be armor,signs,baby animals,and lots more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0029LCJJS|5|Excellent
B0091REZMW|4|I just got this game a few days ago and it seems pretty awesome. I reached level 10 in one day. seems like there's a lot more to discover in the game.
B00BAXFACO|4|Well-paced story. I like how the strategy of his defense was outlined.<br />I wish Connelly wrote more books with Mickey Haller because I really like this character.
B00STPQ8PO|1|Horrible movie. If you are going to make a movie and claim it is biblical, make it biblical. For example, the water turning to blood was caused by a crocodile attack in this movie.  Completely inpractical and illogical. It would have bee. More logical for one theory I've seen where the water turned red from volcanic activity. And God is a psycotic little boy? Sheesh. Absolutely hated this movie. Don't waste your money. Once again. A biblical figure made to look insane. Good job hollywood. Doesn't even compare to the 10 commandments.
B009YP9L7U|4|I like the beginning.  In my youth this could have been me.  I have been that drunk and done stuff that crazy.  I could see the separation coming and was intrigued to see how it would be worked out.  Good end.
B007ZGO7EM|5|perfect in every way.  large, easy to use and read.<br /><br />to the reviewer who said 0/1 resulted in an error instead of the correct answer of 1, that apparently has been fixed.<br /><br />excellent calculator!
0439882826|5|I bought this book for my nephew and it's absouletly amazing.  The pop-ups are great quality and very detailed.  There is also a lot of text in the book and lots of hidden pictures and text.  Couldn't fault it.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Simply one the best I have read recently. Two great  stories wonderfully stitched together.
B0083VP2KQ|4|Good but not as good as the Walking series
B00KVK3WNQ|5|Cool very amazing the best book ever so cool I would buy it for real if possible so very amazing
B00MO21WAY|5|Excellent, as always!
B00BMKH5NW|4|This was a really good book! It was all about family, coming of age and learning to let others in. I was pulled in the whole time. I just loved Levi and Cath. She grew so much since she met Levi and I loved the interactions between Cath and her twin sister Wren. I loved their relationship and was so glad they found their way back to each other. The only thing that didn't make this 5 stars for me was the abrupt ending. I think there could have been more. I wanted more Levi and Cath relationship development. It's like once they started making out, that was the end of their growth as a couple. But maybe that's just me and my need for a little more steam in my books lol and I wanted to know what happened more between Simon and Baz in her Carry On fanfic. It also would've been nice to read her Fiction-Writing essay and get the professors reaction, but I can see how that wasn't necessary. Also I wanted more about Wren. Basically I just wanted more at the end. But overall it was a great read and kept me interested the entire time. A must read!
B00D2K40WY|3|Regular
B00785P2QC|3|Fun but not addictive. Asks you to do a lot of stuff like write a review. It's fun but not addictive. Doesn't shut down or slow or anything.
014242417X|5|You might get tired of buying Kleenex, but this book is worth every tear.  This story is smart and real.  Not a word or tissue wasted.  The characters stayed with me, and so many memorable lines, one line in particular, &#34;You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence.&#34;  This is a must read if you've ever questioned the meaning of life, or the legitimacy of love.
B00I3BRLPK|4|Interesting story that was well written and acted. I would recommend to anyone interested in a fast paced story line
B003YL4LYI|3|I finally finished it, but boy, it was a bitch of a read. Not sure if I caught all the threads, therewere many, but the damned thing kept bringing me back, just to find out what would happen next. I think this series has been going on way too long, and is way too convoluted, but I will probably get six, I've come this far.<br /><br />For those who have not yet started, or are on the first book in the series, I recommend watching the HBO series instead.
B00EGJE4G2|5|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It was very well written and researched and presented a nice balance of hard science blended with the author's own personal experiences. Highly recommended.
B006FS22Y8|5|If you love her music, this is a must have. Half Time is one of her best.
B0002F6AH0|5|I used to watch this series as a kid. When I heard the opening music (which is awesome), I would run to the television so I could watch it. I was thrilled when I saw this was available on DVD. If you are a fan of this series, you will not be disappointed! Order it and enjoy!
B00KT2Z9WS|1|The game was good at first but I was in a tournament and I was in second place and I left and came back in 30 minutes and I was all the way back at eighty in rank because the game took away ally points.
B009ZZDNT6|3|My first time to use this app. I am hoping it will wake me up for work in the morning.
B00005JHAD|5|Short and sweet, this is an amazing piece of work. A total roller-coaster with enough ups and downs, twists and turns to keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The pace and camera work borders on frenetic, but never does the story lose it's focus and rhythm. Scared the pants off me and I may not be able to eat pork ever again because of it.
B00023B1AS|5|very creative music video.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This product does a great job, especially if you purchase the coarse or extra course rollers for it.  I'm glad I bought the plug in version instead of battery because I can see how quickly the batteries could wear down while using it. I highly recommend this product.
B00IINPXLW|1|When you get to about level six you have to buy the full version. :( Don't waste your money!!!!!!!
B00H48ES7C|5|this game is fun you can  play it for hours  but some times when you have really long chains it lags with the explosion but if you reading this because your not sure trust me it is LOTS of fun
B009UX2YAC|5|Awss
B001FBSMW6|4|I hadn't heard anything from Keane since I left England for the US four years ago, armed with the much loved \\"Hopes and fears. I badly needed to hear more from this band so I duly purchased \\"Perfect Symmetry\\", not realising how very different it would be. So different, in fact, that it had me checking the band members on the \\"Hopes and Fears\\" album to make sure it was the same guys and not some other group with the same name!  Very unlikely I know but I was just so perplexed!      Well, of course, it was one and the same band. So I listened to the rest of the album, marveling at the total departure from the piano playing lyricism of their first work. LOTS more music in the compositions and Tom's voice in competition with it. It was interesting but just so different from what I identified with them before.    The following day I listened to it again. This time I was prepared for it and ended up intrigued.  Next day on I played it again and now I can say I love it.  Tom's beautiful voice still effortlessly soars.    Please do as I did and don't write it off on the first listen. It grows on you in an amazingly quick way.
1250006341|5|Since I have to wait for the series to start again, I'll be happily reading about all the characters and some of the behind the scenes information.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Thank you Suzanne Collins for this amazing series. There are no words to describe my enjoyment in reading these three books.
B00004T8RK|5|Although I didn't much care for this album the first time I heard it, upon  multiple listens this CD grew on me and has become my favorite Pearl Jam  album ever.  This is the first studio album with former Soundgarden drummer  Matt Cameron.  As a drummer myself, I love what Matt has added to the band  to fill the void of Jack Irons.  He wrote Evacuation, a fast-paced  time-changing punkish song.  His fills are chosen with great precision and  it sounds great.  Every song on this album is great in its own way, and  placed in the perfect order on the CD.  The opening track, Breakerfall, is  exactly what it should be: A loud, short introduction to the album.  After  that, the perfect combination of fast and slow songs.  Some of my personal  favorites are the power-chord heavy Insignificance, a straight-up rock song  that gets stuck in your head, and the slower Thin Air.  Eddie Vedder's  unique sound and incredible lyrics sound better than ever.  Although at  first listen this album might sound more simple than previous efforts, if  you listen carefully you can hear a time-changing, complex, balanced album  which takes the band to a level they hadn't reached previously.
B008EL25LE|3|Started out interesting, but the whole bugs and flames stuff quickly got old.  I preferred the previous version, although even that wasn't that great.  Like with Azkend 1, this was the Free App of the Day, otherwise I never would have grabbed it, and I probably wouldn't pay for it.  As it is, I didn't even finish it.
B003O86FMW|4|This was still a fun read and I was glad I read it to finish out the story, but I was about ready to be done with this series by the time this one ended.
B00FATEJYE|5|Nice game<br />I will highly recommend this game to my friends
B00BMVTS1S|2|As this is half a movie I say rent it or get the online version (I did). Wait till you can get the whole thing for your collection.Yes it looks great for what there is of it. If this was the whole movie I would have given them fours stars.
B00B97SNJI|3|I was really anticipating the release of this album. The first 2 albums showed growth and promise. This 3rd release finds the band a little stagnant in my opinion. Soundwise, it could be part 2 of their last release. I was hoping to hear a wider range of instruments and sounds here. The songs are for the most part enjoyable, but are not too dissimilar from their previous output. Dawes impressed me in a live setting, however this is a little too studio sterile for my tastes. I have not replayed the disc as much as i usually do for these reasons, but i do intend to give it a few more spins. This will not prevent me from checking out the next release from this up and coming band.  Mark B.Smith
B004SOR4H6|4|Not a fan of twitter, but useful when a friend is showing me something
B008XG1X18|1|The new update wiped out everything. Years of saved pins... I would give it 0 stars of I could!
B00005AQGH|5|Intro 1.bomb first (my second reply) (9/10) This has the outlawz on it, before the song starts you hear a news reporter. Talking about the album.   2.hail mary (10/10) a very well done beat, 2pac out does himself on here. And then the outlawz come in last. The were cold too.   3.toss it up (10/10) I think KC & Jojo were the ones singing. at the end he diss Dre about being gay and not going to Compton.   4.to live & die in l.a. (10/10) This is \\"California part 2 with out [...] a$$ Dre\\" That is what he called it. But this song is 2pac telling much he loves Cali.  5.blasphemy (10/10) which is the greatest sin, to speak against the holly ghost. 2pac really uses energy in this song.   6.life of an outlaw (8/10) This song tells you what it is like to live like an outlaw. The outlawz are on this one.   7.just like daddy (8/10) more for women just like toss it up.   8.krazy (10/10) I like the hook, it is a deep song.   9.white man'z world (9/10) Telling you this is a white man's world and you can get through it if you are smart. A very good song.   10.me and my girlfriend (10/10) the classic bonnie and clyde song, 2pac and his honnie. Jay-Z redid this song with Beyonce.   11.hold your head (9/10) he is saying along with tyrone wrice through everything that is going on. hold your head up.   12.against all odds (10/10) best song on here next to hail mary, he goes all out on here dissing Dr.Dre, Mobb Deep, Jay-Z, Nas, P.Diddy, and some people I don't even know about.     I know I reviewed this before but this album deserves a second review. You can't like rap and don't listen to 2pac. That's like saying I like going in planes but your not flying he was just to good and had to many sides. RIP 2pac.
B0016492BW|5|Love this movie!!
B0070Y46UY|4|Hard to begin, but once I started I didn't want to stop. Very interesting material, combined with fantastic storytelling and a unique writing style created a fantastic novel, a true modern classic.
B006885LZM|5|A great telling of the hardships faced by the Marines as the secured the critical islands in the Pacific war.
B004EI924E|5|I have seen this movie in the theatres snd watched it several times on television. I gave this as a Christmas gift to my sister. I recommend anyone who likes Bruce Willis to see this movie. The vendor sent the item in good condition and it arrived it plenty if time for Christmas day.
B007SGM084|5|These books are not for the faint of heart and some parts are difficult to read.  A interesting read. I am not disappointed. Sheds light on a part of society you do not often hear a lot about.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Cleverly written and full of insightful character development.  I actually called in sick at work after lunch just so I could finish it!  Excellent read, and the ending did not let me down - so many novels seem to end suddenly as if the publisher's deadline caused the author to throw in the towel.  This novel was just right!
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love all the great levels I think it is cool that you spin to see what you get but when ever I do spin I keep getting the same thing
B0090P98Z4|5|This right here this right here this right here is a beast mode game it's really nice and has awesome graphics
B00005JKED|5|This movie shows the acting strengths of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat, has a great plot, and a scene that was worth the 5 stars I gave it alone. (with Ethan Hawke's character \\"JAKE\\" left to fend for himself) Whoever says this movie is unrealistic, has never lived in Los Angeles.
1878424505|4|As much as I enjoyed the book and took away principles I will definitely cogitate and act on, I have to skeptically ask how can we actually know this is \\"Toltec wisdom\\" since it has been \\"hidden for ages\\" and only now coming out? (And I haven't even read The Fifth Agreement yet encouraging skepticism of any belief.) Someone help me out here.
B00005JNVS|5|Shanghai, China, the 1930s.  The Axe Gang is taking over the town but is not interested in the poor slums. This leaves the residents of Pig Sty Alley to deal with their overbearing Landlady. One day, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick,  walk into the Alley and attempt to blackmail people there. When the residents of the tenement stand up to fight him, he reveals that he is part of the Axe Gang and signals for help. Gang members show up and the landlady and the tenement residents fight them off. The Axe Gang realizes that they have been called to help someone who is not a part of the gang, but Sing is desperate to become a member. Now that the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley have met, they can't back down from each other, fighting until one group is victorious. The leader of the Axe Gang realizes that he will not be able to fight them alone and brings in The Beast.<br /><br />\\"Kung Fu Hustle\\", written and directed by the star, Stephen Chow, is a fun, exhilarating, fast-paced film, borrowing elements from and paying homage to many other genres. Chow is clearly a filmmaker who loves films; he seems like a kid in a candy store. Now that he can make a film, how many different types of things can he get into the story? \\"Hustle\\" combines all of these elements in a way that is fresh and exciting.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a homage to police interrogation films and westerns. When the opposing sides face off on a dusty road, we are transported from Shanghai to the Wild West. The sky turns magenta and everybody faces off, preparing for a classic gun fight. This scene is very theatrical, comical and sets the tone for the remainder of the film. Of course, we aren't in the Old West and the leader of the Axe Gang uses an axe to prove his point and keep us firmly rooted in the world of kung-fu.<br /><br />The story is a framework for Chow to throw each and every trick in the book at the audience. After he introduces the Axe Gang, we then meet the residents of Pig Sty Alley. Landlord walks through the shops, receiving tributes and terrorizing everyone in a jovial way. Until he meets up with his wife, Landlady, who terrorizes her husband. Everyone in the Alley appears perfectly normal until Sing shows up.<br /><br />When the two groups meet, we learn that people have special skills that they hesitate to use, unless absolutely necessary. They will do anything to protect their lives and friends. This leads to a series of amusing, entertaining fights, in which their skills are comically enhanced by special effects. Chow deftly blends all of these elements together making them appear somehow natural. Amazing considering all of the special effects, cartoon style action and over the top acting. Once we have accepted that these things can happen in this universe, we can accept the behavior as it becomes more cartoonish and more outlandish.<br /><br />The story, while slight, is effective at creating a character that we can root for. Chow's Sing is just a guy looking to join the Axe Gang, but as he witnesses their brutality, he seems more drawn to the people of Pig Sty Alley. He realizes that their efforts to use their powers, only when absolutely necessary, to defend themselves, is the more responsible course of action. Throughout the film, we see glimpses of a pivotal moment in his childhood; he saves a deaf mute girl from a bunch of bullies and buys a book about kung-fu from a street beggar. Later, we learn that Sing may be the Chosen One. To live up to this prophecy, he has to make some changes in his life.<br /><br />All of these over-the-top, disparate elements combined together would normally create a mess of a film. In \\"Hustle\\", they come together to create a fun, enjoyable film that will hopefully spur filmmakers to come up with more creative ways to tell a story.of Pig Sty Alley.

1423136802|5|I've always liked Greek mythology and these put a great spin on it. Its a great way to learn and enjoy it there aren't any real slow parts of the books they cover the emotional spectrum very well. Comedy abounds all in all great books for all ages
B00GINENG0|5|You will love it
B00LU0P9L4|4|I liked the story and the puzzles were challenging. The HO portions could have been a little tight but on the whole, I enjoyed it. With all of the movement between scenes, it would have been helpful to have a map to use for jumping between scenes.
0788812408|5|This movie amazes me every time that I see it. Some of the Disney cartoon movies that are being churned out today are okay but not as good as movies like The Little Mermaid. It is such a beautiful movie and so tastefully done. I truly believe it's a movie for the young and the young at heart. It's all about falling in love and doing anything for the person that you love even risking your own life. The songs really touch my heart, the characters are so funny, sweet and lovable from Flounder the dumb and sweet fish to Sebastian the funny and witty crab to Scuttle the absentminded and crazy seagull.  Ariel the mermaid kind of reminds me of what almost every young teenage girl is like, headstrong and just wanting to go out and follow her own dreams and having to grow up with a loving, but very overprotective and strict father and going against the schemes and plots of the evil Ursula but in the end after overcoming all the obstacles finally being with her true love forever. It is just a beautiful story and ever since I saw it when it first came out in the theatres with my mother it has grown on me and I have loved and cherished this movie ever since. The songs are everything from upbeat to romantic and the actors/actresses picked to do the voices for the characters are so talented and are just made for the parts. I fell in love with this movie and the characters in it in 1989 and am still in love with it today. The Little Mermaid: being transported from real life into the beautiful underworld of the ocean filled with mermaids/mermen, fish, and many more made me want to be &quot;part of that world&quot;
B00097A5I6|5|This album is not a comeback as it's been hyped, and especially not a return to the heavy guitar sound of Oasis' first three albums. \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is essentially a continuation of \\"Heathen Chemistry\\"'s laid-back, slightly psychedelic classic rock sound, just with much better songs. The only real new element is Noel's dead-on Kinks tribute \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" (imagine a precise musical and lyrical fusion of \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" and \\"Dead End Street\\" and you have this song). The fact that the other band members wrote a significant amount of the material has gotten a lot of press, but nothing here is a radical departure. In the end, this is an Oasis album, and just like most every Oasis album it's full of jangly guitars, gritty singing, peace-and-love lyrics, long instrumental codas, and songs that sound like outtakes from \\"Let It Be\\" or perhaps \\"Tommy.\\" In short, nothing here is going to \\"convert\\" people who just don't get Oasis. <br /> <br />All that said, however, if you do enjoy the Oasis formula this is an excellent listen, and certainly the band's best effort since 1997's classic, unjustly maligned \\"Be Here Now.\\" The whole album exhibits an energy, creativity, and coherence that was often missing from \\"Heathen Chemistry.\\" Liam's songwriting has evolved at light speed from the career-nadir \\"Little James\\" two albums ago to the flat-out awesome acoustic mod stomper \\"The Meaning of Soul\\" and best-song-Paul-McCartney-forgot-to-write \\"Love Like a Bomb.\\" Those songs are the strongest among universally solid material. Andy Bell has also come into his own-- his \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\" is another highlight. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is a significant improvement over \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" and suggests that Oasis could go on fruitfully mining this vein of Beatles-worshipping classic rock for a long time. They may not have another \\"Supersonic\\" or \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" in them, but their talents are far from spent. Highly recommended!
B0077ATSSQ|5|I saw the movie in the theaters and knew that I was going to want this for myself. A beautilul movie. Got the movie very quickly.
B00338QENI|5|well written, page turner, alternates nicely between the scientific/medical history of Henrietta's cells and the history/emotions of her and her family.  Well researched, flows well, great read
B000VBJEFK|5|Great movie that my daughter loves. I watched it over 50 times with my kids. It motivated me to cook all weekend.
B005V5WBFG|5|It was easy to install.
B00005JOFQ|5|There is absolutely nothing left to say about this film that hasn't already been said.  Yet I feel compelled to add my five cents, if only because of the slight it received at the Academy Awards.  Simply put, this is the most important American film of the past twenty-five years.  It is provocative, it is breathtakingly beautiful, and it is flawlessly acted, but it is also a movie with a heart, and I defy anyone with the sensitivity of a snail not to be moved by Jack and Ennis' tragic love story.  The movie has received its share of criticism, but bear in mind that most of that has come from people who refuse to see the film.  I'm including Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine, among other Academy voters, who allowed their bigotry to stand in the way of their seeing the film.  They cast their votes in ignorance.  Go figure.  But none of that has stopped \\"Brokeback\\" from becoming possibly the most honored film in the history of cinema.  It has won fourteen Best Picture awards that I know of, beginning with the Vienna Film Festival Award and including the recent GLAAD Award for best picture.  It is a film that will continue to be viewed and studied, both for pleasure and for pure love of cinema for decades to come.  I place \\"Brokeback\\" in the same category as \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" or \\"La Traviata\\"--one of the great love stories of all time.  As Emmy Lou Harris sings on the sound track, \\"A Love that Will Never Grow Old.\\"  Hats off to Ang Lee, to Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossawa, and to Heath and Jake, but a special bow to Annie Proulx, whose short story started it all, when it originally appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 1997.  The short story and the film are indisputable masterpieces.
B008Y5OWMK|4|Thank goodness for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray restoration of the full 216 minute film that originally premiered in NYC. Technically it brings the video and audio quality up to where it should be for home Blu-ray release.  In general, it allows one to fully appreciate the outstanding cinematography, sweeping vista scenes (reminiscent of some of Davd Lean's work) and sound work.<br /><br />The film was skewered by critics when originally released in 1980, at least some of which was a dog pile precipitated by the industry press coverage about the film's massive overruns in shooting schedule and budget. Even today, too many critics slam films that have production problems because of them and not the final result (The Lone Ranger is an example). United Artists didn't help by pulling it immediately after the NYC premier and having the 216 minute run-time hacked down to 149 minutes for wider release. That left the film with holes; it didn't tell enough of the story. The full 216 minute version isn't perfect, but it's much more cohesive. There are sections that could be a few seconds shorter to pick up the pace slightly. This is mostly near the beginning that sets an environment for the story, but not by much -- a few minutes total cut -- certainly nowhere near an hour. Perhaps among the biggest problems critics had with Heaven's Gate is that it's not a high concept film. They either wanted it to be one or were expecting it to be one, and when it wasn't they dished out their punishment.<br /><br />Approach the film without preconceptions from reviews you might have read or what a western genre film should or should not be. Keep your mind open and look beyond its genre into the narrative and its underlying themes. There is where I believe you'll find the power of the film and the story it tells about wealth, power, privilege and class warfare in the late 19th Century west.
B00CH3DBNQ|2|I really wanted to like this book, but it failed to hold my interest. The Diary of Anne Frank it is not. Truth be told, I got more out of the news stories about Malala than out of this book. Sorry. However, all isn't lost. I would say that in a few more years after she's in her 20s or maybe even her 30s and she's accomplished much more in her life (and I have no reason to believe she won't, she's got a fire in her belly), Malala should do a re-write and I think that it will be a better book at that point once it has the seasoning of maturity added to it. The book will also hold more credibility and it won't look so much like her story is being manipulated by adults with an agenda in order to sell books.
B00BATG18K|1|I have loved Amy Tan for years....However, I feel like this book was not authentic and not actually written by her....or else she has lost some of her skill due to her past illnesses. (Sorry Amy.....I hope you are feeling better...I really do!)
B00F91RYL8|2|Brad Pitt + zombies should have been a recipe for success. I still had hopes for this film, even after mixed reviews and all of the talk about the many problems that occurred during filming. The decision to go with a PG-13 rating was probably the first mistake, as much of the bite was removed (pun intended.) There was nothing frightening in this film, and Pitt seemed almost robotic. Perhaps he should have played a zombie.<br /><br />The one scene we all saw in the trailer that showed the zombies frantically climbing on top of each other to reach the top of a massive wall was pretty cool. But while watching it, I thought, \\"This is a nice little piece of CGI,\\" and not, \\"This is a terrifying scene.\\"<br /><br />There are much better zombie films out there, and I'd recommend skipping this, or wait until it shows up on Netflix. In the meantime, I'll happily recommend the BEST zombie film I've ever seen (actually, a British miniseries): Dead Set.
B001GUXJQA|5|Great Book.
B00079FUI6|5|As an avid Desperate Housewives viewer every Sunday night, I ordered the DVD set as soon as it became available on Amazon. I find that as much as I love the episodes on TV, I enjoy them even more on DVD. The episodes flow well, are ten times more enrapturing without the commercials, and are of a high quality. The extras are fun, especially Bree's multicultural dinner party where you hear the characters talking in a variety of languages, and I love the extended episodes. It's interesting to see what you've missed with cut scenes, and the extra scenes add a whole new dimension and further your understanding of the sordid goings-on of Wisteria Lane. They've also done an excellent job of packaging the DVDs, and while there may be six of them they're easy to keep track of. I'd recommend this DVD set to any Desperate Housewives aficionado, or anyone who's seen an episode here and there and wants to get started on the series. Once you start watching, you won't want to stop!
B00H7MW3HC|5|good all around
0307346617|5|This is a very smart, well thought-out novel. It brings the fantastic idea of a zombie attack into the real world with meticulous attention to detail. Highly recommended.
B00TYBD6VQ|4|Wow.
B006R8GK2Q|5|Very fun, engaging game. I love hidden picture games and this one is very good. I definitely recommend this game to any hidden picture enthusiasts.
B000002J09|5|Love it.
B0051QIGP4|5|and for the price it was such a steal. shes gone form pop to electro to rock and i love it. these songs have meanings compared to the fame monster. a must to get the whole album!
0618918248|4|I'll try and make this short and sweet. \\"The God Delusion\\" should be a required read for theists and atheists alike as it does answer many questions, but it should not be one's only source when trying to determine whether there is a higher being. I doubt it will convert many believers to non-believers, but it surely will enlighten them. This wouldn't be a bad place to start if one wants to learn about the arguments for and against the existence of God/gods, but one should really base their decision on more than a single book. I suggest balancing \\"The God Delusion\\" with a more scientific approach along with an historical examination of one's holy text. For the latter, I found \\"Is Christianity True?\\" to be a good concise assessment of the Gospels.    Final word: Read it! Worth the money and time.
B001N18HOQ|5|The Brendan O'Brien mix is brilliant, the bonus tracks rock, and experiencing a DVD of the best MTV Unplugged episode ever of one of the greatest bands ever in surround sound is a joy, \\"State of Love and Trust\\" is a highlight. I was most definitely a Nirvana fan over Pearl Jam back in the nineties yet must say the musicianship here is exceptional, imho this is easily an improvement over the original release. Fantastic, highly recommended.
0553573411|5|Many people criticize this book, but I can't quite understand why. To me it's like Assassin's Apprentice, but better (and longer). I found the first 10-15 pages to be a bit rocky, but it improves as we follow Fitz's life at Buckkeep, dealing with the numerous problems resulting from the Red Ship raids, Regal's ambition, and his own struggles to grow up and develop relationships. I liked this one better because Fitz is older; he's no longer in training, he's a teenager as opposed to a young boy, and he's able to take more independent action.<br /><br />And stuff happens. Fitz goes into battle. He gets a girlfriend. He becomes a player in the intrigues of Buckkeep, as opposed to the pawn he was before. No, this isn't nonstop action-based fantasy by any means, with its focus on character development and Fitz's daily life, but if you read and enjoyed Assassin's Apprentice, you probably like that. And much like the previous book, this one will draw you in, get you emotionally involved, and not let you go. The only downside is that the end is so depressing that you virtually have to move on to the third book to see how things turn out (and I thought the third book was awful).<br /><br />At any rate, I found this to be a highly engrossing book, and I hope people won't be discouraged after reading Assassin's Apprentice by the criticism of this one.
B0063M22QO|4|This game is addictive as well as enjoyable.  Easy to work with once you get to recognizing the designs on the tiles.  Highly recommend it.
B00HX6DK5Q|5|Great book for writers and students.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is extremely AWESOME and fun it is worth buying even though it is seven dollars.I have been waiting a really long time for the roller coaster  update to come out.
B008BWFOVE|4|It seems like Ms. Binoche is  receiving fewer roles that are of an interesting subject matter. But she still peaks my interest, because I keep hoping she is actually challenged by her movie career field. She's beautiful women that has depth. This role did not fully challenge her, and allow for more exposure of skin. I'm a fan as you can tell, I hope to see her in future films. Foreign movie stars are becoming more, popular once again.
B006PZBR8S|5|A typical American plot, but executed brilliantly.  Absent father, broken hearts, hoping for victory, etc., but the graphics are superb, and very believable.  A story of hope, love, and determination. I really like Hugh Jackman, and all around, this was a great stand up and shout 'we did it' kind of movie.
B005PK56TA|5|This is a great series...
B00DUGCLY4|5|I really liked this app it fun.I really had a great time guessing stuff I actually heard about this game in a Facebook offer
B004QK5N5W|4|This adapter allows me to hook up my iPad 2 to my 42&#34; inch HDMI TV, and it works flawlessly. I like the extra tab that allows me to charge the iPad while it is playing, so I don't ever have to worry about having the iPad battery charged when I want to watch something on short notice.<br /><br />My advice to iPad users who like me don't have cable TV - get this adapter and the PBS app. You won't ever have to worry about missing a current episode of Downtown Abbey or Call The Midwife on the night they are showing. You can simply watch them with the iPad on your big TV whenever you want, thanks to this adapter!
B009VB998I|5|My kids and I love to sit and watch movies together. We loved the movie, and had a great time.
B009UX2YAC|2|I don't really like this game. It is SO glitchy and very, very, very unrealistic. I can stand like the running away from a cop, but really, dodging trains and running on a train? I don't think so. I really DON'T recommend this.
B000JMKTLO|3|Interesting plot, enjoyed book, but felt it never reached a level that her other books did. Overall I would recommend this book and author.
B0038M2AZA|5|thank you
B0086700CM|5|Can't get enough of this game. Remains challenging even after unlocking all the powers. Highly recommend this enjoyable game for anyone who likes to keep pushing to beat high scores.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|It is a great game. I would recommend it. It can be hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's awesome. 😁
1607747308|5|This system works for me!  The author's suggestions on letting go of things are so helpful.
B0000AUHPG|5|Great classic western
B00BD99JMW|5|Parts in the middle were boring and could have used more action, the middle being mainly romance troubles, but the ending was incredibly powerful and meaningful.
0385523394|4|&#34;Orange is the New Black&#34; is a riveting narrative of a woman's incarceration. Piper Kerman, as a prisoner, realistically portrays life in prison. The shock of moving from the &#34;high life&#34; to the &#34;low life&#34; so abruptly is evident in what she writes. It is fascinating to read how she gradually accommodated herself to such a wildly diverse population. Having been a volunteer, with my wife, in a woman's prison in Texas, I can speak with some degree of authority on this issue. The book would be profitably read by anyone facing the ugly specter of incarceration and it is true to how it is as an employee of the prison systerm as well as is for those who have daily custody responsibilities. However, Kerman's story makes good reading no matter from what perspective it is absorbed.<br /><br />Wesley Stevens
B00DPM90C4|5|Fantastic book.  I absolutely loved it.  It was impossible to put down the last night I read it.  I think I stayed up until 3am and decided it was worth it the next day.  Very, very good.
B00HHJPUFM|4|Is a really nice movie so funny we enjoy the hold movie with the entire family that it no more comment
