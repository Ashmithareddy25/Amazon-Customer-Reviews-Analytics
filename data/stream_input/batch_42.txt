B001FAM3DQ|5|ALways great product! whats nice is you can have a new bumper look every year
B002E5HMSC|5|Fit great on my 2007 Ford Edge.
B00JU7Z9QY|2|my fault for not really looking at the dimensions,  but I would not call this a bumper sticker...  its more like a TINY window decal
B00N9NRLKW|5|Great
B00MOR4D5U|1|One headlight was burnt within 2 months,,, waiting on customer service to answer my email
B003PJEDXI|5|Perfect fit. Kit provided the tool that puts the bolts right were they are to go. It was everything I needed. I have used it and it is perfect.
B0053P69IO|5|Great product. Perfect fit!
B000C9C2AK|5|What a savings. $300 savings for a name brand. Don't go to a dealer for this one. Buy it here.
B003RA8HAA|3|Couldn't get it to work
B004GC7VPA|4|Excellent
B00LCL7AS6|4|I like how it looks on my asphalt frs, makes the car more aggressive, first day of installation i notice a condensation inside the unit but after a couple days its gone and never came back, quality is good, the led light which is the day light looks cool, i prefer you change the h7 bulb though with some good brand bulb, the passenger side on mine died after 4 months. Overall this is a good aftermarket mod, gt86 oem replica, you can upgrade it to h7 hid if you want, plug and play!
B00HHNSTPG|5|great plate/ good quality/nice addition to my ss camaro
B00NXBSE3I|5|Perfect fit for rear bumper retainers on Lexus LS430
B000Y82X4E|5|I bought this solenoid as a replacement for one that gave out in our RV.  It was a perfect fit replacement and it works as expected.  Not sure what caused the old one to go bad but it sure puts a twist on things when you are hundreds of miles away from home and your coach batteries are depleted.
B00GBVHPNW|3|Alright for the money
B006KDJUGG|4|The only reason to not give a 5 is there were no instructions. Hubcaps look great, fit great.
B002MWCDYA|1|Worthless.  Stayled plugged all nite &#34;recharging&#34;.  Wouldn't even run a small fan.  Lite indicator was green but that didn't mean a thing.  DON'T BUY THIS THING !!!!!
B002XM59F4|5|This is identical to the manufacturer's curtain bracket for my Keystone Premier Bullet RV at a fraction of the cost of the ones I could buy at the dealership.  Works perfect.
B008NQL00W|5|Worked flawlessly to install my Pioneer SPH-DA120. Grounding the parking brake wire on the SPH-DA120 simply does not work, you need the double pulse bypass which is what does product does. This is the case in the US, overseas you don't need this. Install is as follows. 1. Connect Green Wire to green handbrake wire. Black goes to ground. Blue goes to Blue/White System Control/Amp wire. I used posi-locks to connect all the wires.
B0068EUP5M|5|Great pipes! Love the sound. Easy install
B0006IX7UQ|5|Product was as advertised, works great fast shipping AAAA  ++++
B00L3LU33E|5|Great price adding all colors to my automotive wire rack
B006N7CU7U|5|Just As Described
B00RCEJUYO|1|cheap and flimsy, garbage ,and took 1 month to arrive
B000HLOEMM|5|Great product!
B009DJWRS2|3|WORKED AS IT SHOULD
B00AO3AGCK|5|Great
B009T3AF7W|5|Used to control turn signal flash on 2002 CBR600F4i - works as described. I imagine it will fail eventually but when the stock flasher relay is $80 and this one is less than $20, it's a no brainer.<br /><br />Using Proton Flushmounts on the front, Bikemaster Corner Cateye leds on the back.
B00MEVO5U4|1|Really nice when you first put them on but they're really cheap. Within a week, two of the crowns broke and then one of the crowns cap came off and was stuck onto my tire! I couldn't get it off so I had to use pliers to get it off, it almost messed up my tires air spout thing. Don't recommend this item whatsoever.
B0016LE80K|1|beware of this product.  it blew the fuse in my cigarette lighter outlet and burned out my car charger.  terrible product.
B002YKIJ8O|5|VERY EASY TO USE, IN UNION WITH PPPP01 TO PUT BANANA PLG IN ONE TERMINAL
B000VLHC72|2|Update:<br />Jan 2016.<br />I have no idea what happened but both my side windows fail to clip on the bottom. It seems like it stretched out some how. Anyway when i drive the wind pops the bottom that clips on the vehicle. I had to remove these and put on my old clear windows to be safe. I didnt want it flying off
B00429NKWK|5|Unbelievable results! Very user friendly, my headlights went from very clouded over to clear as glass!  Very happy with results! Excellent product. Wish I would have taken before and after pics.
B007ND4P0S|3|Not noticeable during daylight.  They are only bright at night time.  Flickering on engine start up.
B00SUTHIVM|5|This is a very good quality organizer.  I could feel the quality just in the weight of the package when the mail lady handed it to me.  Could tell right away this wasn't made of cheap material.  It doesn't slide around in my trunk.  Overall i would give this product 10 stars if amazon would let me!!!!!
B001R6321U|5|Always  great product.
B005ZLS2M2|5|Cool sticker. I've been told it looks like a hug by non-grapplers.
B0009EUA0M|4|If you have a bad back you'll probably need a stool with a little back support and a larger seat. I've got some issues and ..while it's well made ..this thing kills my back. I need more support. That said, other family members are fine using this. It rolls well and has a nice cushion.
B007PK17BO|5|obviously perfect fit.
B005NC6YK0|5|Beautiful looking. No cheap look to it. Love it!
B00FQPY5PA|3|Cheaply made but it works
B00VAVSDWA|5|Was as described.
B00FW1JTB8|5|excellent
B00RCBOKGU|3|The mirror is more magnified than the one that didn't break... You know how mirrors say object is closer than it appears.. Well this one the object is right where it looks like it is. So I look in my right mirror the new one and it's super close and I look at the left one and it's far away and I can see more of the surrounding area.. But it clicked right in . A perfect fit and it works
B00RPGWE9C|5|nice
B0009IQZFM|5|The towel holds a stunning amount of water before any wringing is required.  Nearly dried all of my 2015 Honda Accord.  I decided to buy two more.  Toss it in the clothes washer when finished.  Comes out of the dryer good as new.
B000FT2WBG|5|Served the purpose real well.  Needed this to secure sunshade to fence!!!!
B00HMRMJZS|5|gained speed off the line and do not loose as much speed on the hills.  well worth the $
B0009VIPYI|2|The end of the brush, which is actually all you'll ever be using when cleaning around the lug nuts, wears down very quickly and exposes the wire underneath.  Only good for a few cleanings and then it's into the trash.  Not worth it.
B000NJU6OI|4|These boots will probably need some breaking in time.  I don't think they will be useful for anything other than riding boots.  Still very stiff and not comfortable to walk around in.
B00VMUA82W|5|Great quality harness as advertised! Quick and easy install!!
B00192JGDU|4|easy to use (just opens up!)... I wish the side trays were more waterproof (don't leave it out in the rain!).... but clever design for use with portable grills
B00K2G5I40|5|I like how this has a fastener in the middle to close it. It is easy to open and easy to close.
B002LWJR8G|5|Fits my K20A2 engine throttle body great.
B00A93TCW0|1|Beware, when I opened the box(which had no visible damage) the black plate with the logo on it had come separated from the keychain. It is just glued on, but only with a small dab. I had some superglue on hand, so I just cleaned and reglued. Other than that product looks nice.
B00ZWBNZMM|2|Hi I need fire this car and I'm not sure dos it fit plaz Emil me leat me now befor I buy
B007HIEKYK|5|Great turn around time and very happy with product. Highly recommend to anyone
B00061SKHI|3|Great quality but super short as in hard to get a bite on a bolt head. Will be buying the deep barrel cause I like the quality.
B000CO9186|2|A cople  of inches  short.  But still  better  than falling  all the way  hitting the  bumper .
B00NB8SZQY|2|Middling quality. Random spare bulbs in the kit.  The LEDs for the map lights were oddly designed and dangled against the actual button.  The other lights were very dim.
B001P280KO|4|Works well
B000C0107K|3|They do the job.
B00C3N9YU4|5|As a Corvette intheusius the coffee mug fit right in
B001UC72UI|3|The TPMS transmits the pressure to the WCM and shows the pressure in the dash correctly in my 2008 Pacifica. However, I'm still getting a &#34;Service Tire System Soon&#34; warning in the dash that won't go away.<br /><br />The Chrysler dealership says since the TPMS is not OEM it's causing the error. They recommend installing OEM parts from them which costs over $100 each. Not sure how to address this problem.
B00MS96N7U|5|Great find for 6 volt bulbs!
B00030BFQA|5|works great, very happy with it!
B007I9OIFY|5|Great product!
B001MP2U9G|5|It fit fine.
B00C5LW2LC|5|High quality. Very bright focused light that works well with a dimmer. Mounted for dualsport motorcycle use. This style of light throws light further dowm the road than any other light or comperable size. More that most lights larger too.
B00JBIDKT0|1|Wasted money look good for a month or so now there full of water
B00KUYEPPM|5|Exactly what I needed. Great quality and fast shipping. Pleasant transaction.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Bright and easy
B001U8MPMM|5|My seats look like they came in leather! Best car seat covers I have ever purchased!
B00HFSQ6TE|5|great
B006KZAJ8C|5|Works great! The moment I attached it and put the door back on, this has directed my side mirrors like a champ. Perfect price for what is needed.
B0009JB7GI|1|quick working.... had to replace
B009NLMWT4|5|Wire it in easily, I used it for the controller for my compressor in my AE101 seeing as the compressor switch in the main a/c switch blew.
B00XZ9NSRU|4|Works. Bad battery and it wouldn't accept initial programming. $25 to get it cut $50 to get it programmed as I only had 1 key when I bought new ford focus. $75 is much cheaper than dealer $282 quote.
B00KTIVHLY|5|programed easily but you have to wait to unlock all locks longer than original
B0068M0SNI|5|served it's purpose as a replacement for my rear window.  Works great, no complaints.  Easy to remove the old one and install this one.
B0033DQ91U|5|Kit contained everything you need to do timing belt and water pump service properly.
B007I0ON3U|4|This fit perfect and the screw holes were in the right place.  I give it four stars because the ring that holds the cap in place does not hold on.  First time I opened it to put fluid in, it fell off and had to dig around to find it.
B0088BX0IM|5|This thing is great. Couldn't be easier to install, literally just connect to the battery and run the wire under the tank to the bars.  I use this to keep my cell phone charged when I'm using it for GPS or music out on the bike.  In hindsight, I might have looked for a version that did not offer the 12V connection, but I guess it's nice to have if I ever need it, it also would allow the use of battery jump packs without removing the seat to get to the battery.  It also surprisingly looks pretty good.  The chrome is solid on it and it doesn't look too out of place, looking quickly depending on where you mount it, it would just look like a master cylinder.
B011Q18D14|4|I was hoping this would do more than literally JUST read check engine codes. I have a service airbag light that I was hoping I could get a code from. This worked with my 2006 GMC Sierra, but since I have no check engine lights nothing showed up for me. It would be nice if you added an extra button so you didn't have to scroll only in one direction.
B00BITKWOQ|5|Perfect match.  Great price.
B000WGBRFO|3|expensive and long wait
B00I3KLZTE|1|The ads imply it will repair paint....it is a clear substance like superglue and ran down the side of my car leaving a drip mark 2 feet long.  Not what i expected.  Thought it would cover the thin 2 inch scratch and i would be able to buff it in for a repair, unfortunately more mess than anything. Don't waste your money[[ASIN:B00I3KLZTE Quixx 10050 Paint Repair Pen]]
B00LXEQ7EK|3|You get what you pay for.
B003RXVXKS|1|after 2 trips and over 4 hours at the locksmiths, there's a fatal flaw in this key fob!  Long story short, the transponder inside the key fob is about 1.5mm too far from the Lexus GX470 sensor to allow the engine be started when it is inserted in the ignition switch.  Thus this key is USELESS!
B00FAICU64|1|Looks very cheap...........
B0006SU3QW|5|Great stuff in this here can.  Did up all four of my rims 3 coats each with one and a half cans of this stuff.
B002CNK62K|1|It didnt fit my toyota corolla 2007 even though the size mentioned was the same . it was too loose for it .
B00GB8600O|5|These lights.are awesome. Way better than expected.  WOW
B00HWPYU6Q|5|Very nice, authentic and easy to put on. I would recommend putting these on with grommets or some other way than glue, as thieves like to pull these emblems off an put them on their vehicles. HUH? But it is true.
B001A0P8C4|1|Returned.
B00RVE9VMQ|5|Living in Florida i thought by now this stick would be full of bubbles and ready to be pulled off its still in perfect condition. It was easy to apply!
B002XL2HVO|4|Smaller than traditional one but fits easily in small/narrow drawer
B000BRMYN8|1|Terrible
B00ONH7SFG|5|I was a little concerned about the quality not having any previous experience with this brand, but after installing the components, particularly the tensioner bearing ( I have gotten some so flimsy that I threw them away ) I have to say that these are equal to OEM in fit and quality.
B005VNM1EO|5|Don't buy the cheap ones,the color is off and they brake after about 6 months. I could immediately tell this was waaaay more durable.
B00ACDP6YU|4|works well
B00BZAGNQY|4|Good replacement battery.
B002809YHA|5|Product as described.
B0028MN46U|5|Just as described.  Brand new and worked great in my car.  Passed emissions easily.
B00HY06RCY|5|Great lights for the price easy to install
B00F47Z2J8|5|The Kensun HID fog lights are amazing at the price of only $39.95. I installed them on a 2004 Ford Ranger and it was quite easy, with the components of the system being inline between the existing fog light bulb connector and the new HID bulbs, so no exernal cables running to the battery. It took about 1/2 an hour to install both. I tie wrapped the hid power supply module to the frame of the truck and used another tie wrap to secure the cables. The lights are super bright and I have the 6000K bulbs which appears pure white. The lights are so bright that I only want to use them at night when I'm somewhere that doesn't have oncoming traffic as to not blind the other driver. I was going to install the headlight version but I'm glad I just did the fog lights. As for EMI, I'm getting hash on the AM radio as I expected, however I'll eventually try to use some clamp on ferrite filters to see if I can reduce the interference. The nice thing about them being fog lights is that if I'm using the AM radio and the interference bothers me, I can turn off these lights and still drive with the regular incandescent headlights.
B00QWT54UO|1|I wish I can give this Product  0 stars.  The product did not fit my eg civic at all . The the plate of the fog light did not even line up with the fog light . Do not ever get this product
B001F79API|5|Fast delivery, saved some money.
B006GFLI0O|1|If I could rate this with no stars, I would.  The material is very good and the product was well constructed.  I wear this product at night and after about four nights, the band around the cap completely lost its elasticity rendering the cap useless.
B0013T5V6K|5|Just the size for my boat
B005QZMWEQ|5|Works Great.  Fit my 2008 GMC yukon XL.  The dealership wanted to charge 800 to replace these plus parts.
B000C7UQJQ|5|Worked Perfectly!
B0031HC8S6|5|Awesome part. Great OEM replacement. No complaints!
B00XZ9PJUO|5|was very easy to program. It did cost $48.00 to have cut. I am very satisfied.
B008XB9BJY|5|I like it. Not as bright as the standard #1156 but close, color is also close. Just what I wanted for the interior of my boat.
B00FOD2E8Y|4|I bought this as a pilot/escort vehicle driver. It works fantastic and looks even better with my silver car. The lights are very bright and i like all the modes. I did have an issue with one of the sets of lights within 2 weeks though. After taking the light apart i saw there was a bad connection.  Since fixing the connection there have been no problems the last 20,000 miles. The magnets are good,  the cord is long enough for me. It feels very solid. This is a bargain.
B00MHFOTZ8|1|Makes a lot of sound....not so powerful as described.....pressure gauge not working
B00BJ5YIGC|1|I will like buy this product but I want to know if all part is include in this product
B00YJ8Y3TI|5|The patch was exactly as they described. Fast shipping.
B000BQSIWK|5|Used first time yesterday and worked exactly as described. Will keep further reviews as item is used, but so far so good. Love it and all the information it gives.
B011RZ1IA2|5|AA++
B005NKMDCU|5|I love it.
B004K8V6XS|5|So easy to install and worked like a charm
B0025QIAP4|5|Great product!
B001N8C7CW|1|The product is fine but the Velcro fasteners were not in the package.
B009GIXPGI|1|I was not satisfied at all with this product.  I purchased this together with the Speed-Way shelter, which I rated 5 stars.  Unfortunately the flooring is not strong enough for a touring bike.  I own a 2015 Harley Road glide, and just leaning the bike on the kick-stand punctured a hole in the flooring multiple times.  The floor was laid on a concrete patio.  I have returned the product for a refund.
B006EGAIII|1|Over-priced plastic junk. These ramps are a safety hazard! Purchased brand new and first time with a Ford Fiesta they worked good. Second time using, drove my Ford Ranger on them and they Both structurally failed with supporting plastic underneath cracking and allowing the truck to collapse to the Ground. I've used another brand of plastic ramps for 7 straight years to change oil in my Ranger and they have never cracked to this day. Buyer Beware!
B006JXFADY|3|Mine didn't fit in perfectly. Used duct tape to hold the two pieces together and now it works perfect. There starts because it works but the adaption doesn't fit well.
B00020CB2S|4|Extremely sharp when handling.  You definitely want to put on some gloves before even touching these sheets.  Overall they work very well and are easy enough to apply.
B003YP1R0A|5|Works great on my 2003 Kia Sedona EX. Perfect fit according to automotive a/c repair shop. Cold air again in hot and sunny Florida.
B004K9KETY|5|This is soap is by far the best I've ever used! I have been detailing vehicles for 5 years and I wish I would've know about this product when I first started. It's super concentrated so you don't have to pour a lot into the bucket and it's shine looks like a high quality wax job. I'd highly recommend this quality soap to anyone! Detailer or just the average Joe, spend the extra dough for this. Won't regret it.
B00X6DE0I6|3|Too short on both sides but it states for a truck windshield
B000C7WQNA|5|Works perfectly in my 2000 Civic EX. Completely fixed my idle problem.
B000BYD3RC|5|Worked great on my truck.
B0049D7VVA|5|Great quality tool
B0002L6U60|5|Does an excellent job, even in South Carolina.....
B0045FO3IG|5|Easy to install. Looks good
B000BZGDTQ|1|Does not fit my Nissan Altima '06 even though Amazon (and other sites) claims it will. Make sure you buy the correct pump since this is not returnable. It is easy to check before purchasing. You need to see if you have 2 fuel lines (one for return) or 1 fuel line only before purchasing the pump. My car only has 1 line and this pump has 2, so incompatible.
B001AIZ5HY|4|Used this to restore the headlights on my wife's '06 Jetta.  Very straightforward and easy to follow instructions.  Took a little over 1.5 hours to do both lights.  Overall very pleased with the end results and would definitely recommend.
B009MFADGU|5|Cool for the man cave.
B00J3ZT9B4|4|Happy with purchase
B008O9COKI|5|Installed easily in my camper.  I did need to shim the tray up to clear the access door of my camper.<br />I first screwed 2x4s to the camper and then the Cargo Tray to the 2x4s.  Very easy
B00IWMKCOM|5|This product slid right in. HOWEVER, it does not come with the interior door handle &#34;CAP&#34; that holds it in place. Besides that, I was able to reuse the old one. No big deal. I've put it on and taken it off a few times since I bought it. I wish I'd order the entire set for the interior of the car's door handles. But, this was the best first option.
B00H1I639Q|5|5 star- got what I ordered when they said they would delivery it.
B0035YGLZG|4|you had better read the directions
B00KGV2FMY|5|Great product! Have used it to scan many cars to get some basic codes.
B00KTLZPS2|5|My 11 Year old was thrilled to get this for his birthday!  This is a good, sturdy bike that is easy to maneuver for a kid.  Gets up to about 15 MPH, which is perfect for riding around the yard.
B004W979TK|1|Definitely does NOT fit on my 2006 Sierra. These have four sockets, my truck has three lights... Also, the notches on the light sockets do not line up with the tabs on the bulb fixtures. I suppose I should have realized that before purchasing, but hey... the truck's outside and I'm not. Live and learn.... Never trust Amazon to tell you what parts to get...<br /><br />They look great and fit fine, but they are NOT for the 1999-2006 model Sierra!
B003EHV64U|5|WOW, shifting is night and day. The shift ball looks really tiny, but wait it out and you will get accustomed to it. It was a great buy, got the Hurst 3326030 installed same day. Save the trouble to replace later.
B00H1I639Q|5|package arrived quick. I would buy from them again. As far as the lug nuts. They were just what I wanted.
B000CITK8S|5|Very good
B000X3DEC0|5|Brilliant. No more black dust all over my wheels. Postage was reasonably priced  and very fast.
B00JZ0H694|5|great
B00AECXWU4|5|My FJ Cruiser looks so 'muscular' and drive handling is so manageable for a 35 inch tire.
B001NZQIDE|5|Worked perfectly on my Winnebago Motorhome.
B0016J5ZL8|5|Actual ACDelco part, perfect fit with no problems. Factory electrical connections fit with no modification.
B00EUVNGPG|5|Great seller. Prompt and merchandise as advertised.
B0051NYUMA|5|works great needed it for an oven.
B0041UGF2C|5|FIT PERFECT...EASY TO INSTALL!!
B00AGROIH8|1|Did you work had to Return it
B00EC102WE|5|Exact fit great product
B0011D56IQ|1|I tried to rate this with no stars but I couldn't. Product did not work it was more expensive to me to ship it back and get a new one. once I plugged in my vehicle smoke came out of it and something inside popped. I had my red and blue undercover police lights hooked on it luckily they did not get damaged.
B00YJL925A|5|all good
B008TTNXEO|3|Okay, but doesn't fit the gauges perfectly.  I had to super glue the ends.
B003VLBPJA|3|I've had to retie some of the hooks back on.
B000SL0R9K|3|good
B000CHGIA2|5|Exact fit in '02 Chevy Venture.
B000C9MWSC|4|It fit in perfect n works exactly how it's supposed to but was packaged loosely in the box enough to hear it shake around
B00BRL73Z6|2|didn't fit the rear
B00PWYMCZA|5|Easy to install and very good quality.
B004GZL0Q8|5|not bad for the money, I went ahead and repainted  it with a good quality of paint then waxed it before installing it.
B003K5S4NW|2|Works no better than a paper towel.  Will leave streaks if you don't go behind the wipes with a paper towel or dry cloth thus defeating the purpose.  Only needed to clean the inside of a windshield.
B00OO9DI7A|5|Love it!
B00DPWMYYU|3|If you have one of those 4 cylinder Ford engines this is what you need.
B000SXCLIS|5|Fits my Victory Low with shield just fine with plenty to go past the bags and front wheel.
B009SUJU1I|4|Worked great for my Motorcycle Safety Course, but the rubber covers on the fingers aren't put on sturdy. I noticed this after two days of riding on the course.
B00CJ9O9BG|5|Misread the length , but worked out well for locking 2 bikes
B004JAXC20|3|Bought it for the hardware, the Velcro has a tendency to slip so replaced them with a Rampage product.
B008K6I1RU|5|What a beautiful unit.  Excellent quality.  Put it in my 1996 Sportsman travel trailer , replacing the older unit that was there.  So easy to install.  Comes with wax ring so no need to purchase extra one.  Replaced in 15 mins and I love it.  .  Highly recommend this unit for your RV replacement.
B001GN1GLM|3|No reason to pay more for this name brand, because it's made in Taiwan like everything else.  This company claims that their parts are made in the USA, but that is not true.  Neither this item nor the hitch I purchased from the same company were US made - both made in Taiwan.  Very disappointing.
B00R1FEUKI|2|the part does not work  , than I had to sent it back to the seller and cost me more money .
B000GZLR9M|5|Works as described. I bought it to use on my 1980 H.D. FLH-80 Classic's 4 speed transmission. Makes installing the main drive seal a simple task, installs the seal evenly to the perfect depth. Great quality tool.
B000K1JYYM|5|Accurate and Easy to use. Not a cheap plastic cage like you find at the gas station, this one will last a long time.
B00I82C0D2|5|Fits ok, however the sized smaller than original will not fit the supplied tool from GMC
B00C8YXGCK|4|The orbital buffer works great except the polish soaks into the base foam pad and before removing wax with the terry cloth pad one needs to clean the foam before putting on the other cover.
B001P29X4G|4|Perfect go to harness. You could get better quality, but for the price it works well right out the box with no complaints.
B003NU0EM8|2|This product does seal correctly on a flat surface but getting dents out of my vehicle did not work at all. After multiple attempts even on the smallest dent I could not pop it out.
B000E2CVT2|5|My necessary missing part.
B007BL4WPA|5|It's a good piece
B00877SL2M|5|bright lights! Speedy delivery and everything was perfect love them!
B004AQZDZM|5|Perfect Size. No Issues.
B003AN1UA8|5|It is about a 1.5 hour job to install. Not for the faint of heart, inexperienced, or to be done in summer. But the peace of mind I have knowing my RV is protected is well worth the money and my husband's time. Plus it's kinda cool to know how much juice your appliances are pulling.
B004AZSN3C|5|Beautifu.
B0013FSR7E|5|Good buisness
B000NWTPEC|4|Good product
B003TODXQW|5|good product.
B0027XYKZO|5|Easy install and held in place while installing the intake manifold.
B00HCPI0YE|5|very good like the picture
B00VH1UE1G|1|Doesn't really fit 100%. With a little craftsmanship it will fit.
B002D3KR4Q|5|Is a good protection, good to have one for you nice car.
B006X6P40G|5|Perfect fit, and easy to install with basic tools and knowledge
B000VSY4HG|3|I liked the kit but, unfortunately the shank of the trailer hitch receiver lock was 1/8&#34; too short to function- necessitating a return.
B00KTI9XIS|5|Great product. Easy progamming for my 2004 Chevy silverado. Check sellers website before purchase to make sure compatible. I didnt and got scared when I opened up and read paper that said it was disclosed that it wont work with all models. Easy to avoid problem though. They have a list of makes and models that work. Got to me within a reasonable time frame too.
B000E65OI8|5|Fixed the problem with starting
B004XTKDQA|5|Fuel pump was exact replacement.  I spoke with their customer service on the phone and they were very helpful in making sure I ordered the correct one.  I would recommend purchasing the pump removal tool from somewhere if you want to make it a little easier on yourself, but I was able to get the old one out and the new one in with only about 30 minutes of my time invested.  Pump fit exactly and runs perfect.
B000BZJ7I0|5|Worked great on my 2001 Honda Civic
B000CRO4IK|3|It's just ok I guess, nothing special...
B00KJ7U1A8|5|the best i like it
B00XOXBCTS|5|Perfect
B0010GG7YG|5|works and fits perfectly!!
B005H7DRQA|5|Good product for care your leather
B0066IU9B0|5|Nice build for functionality. I bought this for my father. He accidentally reversed the polarity,  he thought he broke it. I opened it up and replaced 8 30Amp fuses and it's back in action. My opinion is that it is good. Little heads up though. It's not a pure sine wave. Meaning it may not work to power some electronic devices. And may even cause damage Such as switching power supplies(laptop chargers, some projectors,etc.) That being said, we ignored the warning and tried it on a projector, a laptop and an audio system and it worked perfectly.
B0066RYUVG|3|It did what i needed it to do.  Granted, there is a hole in the bottom of this expansion tank where a thermometer is attached, and that was not included (i feel its a necessary part, and the unit will not even hold liquid without it).<br /><br />So, I fell they should have just included it.  As it worked out, i was able to disassemble my old expansion tank (that had a crack in it) and repurpose the old thermometer, but if I had not be able to do that this would be a very incomplete unit.<br /><br />It also did not come with a cap (that was less of a big deal, as its easy to unscrew the old cap and just put it on the replacement.<br /><br />Still, that they sold this unit without necessary parts was why i give it 3 stars (and not 5)<br /><br />As for the expansion tank itself, it seems to be well made, and only gently used, so it works fine.<br /><br />Just be aware that the price is good, but if you buy this particular expansion tank you'll need to ALSO buy the thermometer and the cap too (which could wind up making the whole process a lot more pricey than you had planned).<br /><br />Other than that, it did arrive in a timely manner, and as I said, it works a-ok.
B00JF9IJ7I|5|Bought this for my dad and he loves it, he has no excuse to be late for work now that he has warp drive
B000NW8EU8|5|It worked wonderfully.I'm going to purchase one for my own vehicle.
B00FXWLD88|5|great construction and easy to use.  can some otther uses i had not thought of.
B00DQJ8T00|4|Let's be honest, this product is for looks and not function. I'm slightly unsatisfied because after about 2-3weeks the tip of the antenna lost its color from the sun and is now a goldish color...
B0075K5X1Y|5|Decal is awesome. I didn't realize that it was a two layer sticker so you have to pull the top on off. I feel like an idiot but it was a great suprised when I decided to remove it and the white sabers stayed on......
B00A740VQM|5|Love it.+++++ Handy.
B00TZ8HT5M|4|Very cool sticker!
B000765MHI|1|Fan does blow real hard, but on/off switch fell off after several uses. Would have returned it, but was past the 30 day return period.
B0001L0DFA|5|I really like the settings nice and light weight told my mom she should get one and along with the DAP XHOSE PRO.
B00AETUVM4|5|Great cables. Ive used them once so far and did what they supposed to do. They are a heavy feeling cable with real 4 gauge wire in them. They are amazingly long and the clips are really nice.
B00EDFM6R8|5|Ordered these for my little camping trailer. Almost got a different one that had &#34;ok&#34; reviews. Looked like the others had more, smaller leds. These have fewer, larger leds and seem to be brighter. These were a much better choice. Brightness and color are basically identical to the incandescents that i replaced. Going camping in a few weeks and I'm looking forward to the increased battery life!
B00UEHHI3G|5|It's a perfect match for an old scanner I have, it works and functions as the original one.
B008R95GA0|5|A+++
B003VARN1U|5|great STUFF
B000C5O1VW|5|yep, its a spark plug.
B00SSMOS5U|5|Fits like a glove. Long-term investment. Light-years better than the $10 crap in stores. That said, it's a bit stiff to roll up, but the benefit is it doesn't sag. No free lunch.
B00JY03Y8M|5|The steps arrived quickly and very well packaged. They bolted up perfectly with no modifications or drilling necessary. They look great and seem to be very well made! I had read other reviews of instruction difficulties, but I just looked at the pictures and it was pretty simple.
B001KSCF0Y|5|Price excellent
B004TVM2ZW|4|I am 5'8 165 pounds. I got the large and it fits just right, but might not be much room for a lot of layering.  It was 55 out this morning and I wore it with just a short sleeve shirt on underneath and I was just fine.
B00LC82GZQ|4|This remote access fob works great. The horn button doesn't work, but previous fob didn't even have a horn button. And the programming was easy, once I was able to borrow a small alligator clip on a cord for grounding. Definitely a much better way to go than paying the dealership price for the fob ($78) plus programming ($45)!
B004QOW07W|5|Just what I needed and the service was fantastic!
B00108CKIG|5|Direct fit. Perfect
B003FO2O1G|5|Purchased as a Sensar (without Wingman) replacement. I won't get in a fight over which is better because I didn't have the Wingman attachment. This antenna allowed an upgrade without dealing with the Wingman clearance problem. A Wingman would have stuck out over the side of my RV or I would have had to reconfigure a mount to reverse it. 100% happy with this product. Scanned channels at home with a noticeable increase in stations. When I got to my favorite spot at the lake, I raised the antenna and without searching, I had a great picture on ALL the stations.  I never turned the antenna direction the whole weekend. This unit seems much more directionally forgiving than the old batwing. For you guys complaining about the thumping on the roof, rob a rubber foot from your batwing, space it with a couple of washers and screw it directly into the aluminum Sensar lift support. It gives a nice snug fit to the roof when lowered.  (pictures)  Hey, King Jack people, put a mounting foot in with your product!  UPDATE: Owned over a year now and still working GREAT!
B00XVZYTLM|3|Used these in my camper to replace the old light bulbs. they are definitely more efficient however the light is very harsh blue white
B004YD5MF2|5|I actually love these things. I live in Minnesota and have a boat at my cabin. I installed some cleats at the end of my dock and use these to tie up when I'm loading and unloading people into the boat. They are so easy to connect and get to the proper length. These say medium duty, but they have held up very well to waves hitting my 19' runabout. I also use a set to tie up our pontoon, which is always floating. I doubled them up on themselves for the pontoon to ensure they held up. They are doing a great job against some pretty serious Minnesota thunderstorms. I highly recommend these for tying up boats. I can see where they would have many other uses, but so far I love them for my boats.
B007USCMJM|5|great price
B000GZCUAC|5|All the spark my engine needs. Great price.
B00EA0ZB7I|3|Ok lights, not as bright as I hoped they would be.  For the lumens and wattage stated I expected the light to be brighter  (when compared to other LED lights I have installed over the years). The mounting brackets seemed a little awkward.  The light unit itself seems sturdy and should last.
B002MESUK4|5|Headlamp assembly was installed in August 2015. Within two years of being on vehicle the coating peeled off and they started yellowing. The company refused to do anything as there was only a 1 year warranty. Buyer beware.
B000C5WD08|5|2003 Camry 4cyl. Was Perfect, took less then 10 mintues to replace it.
B00BOUURMG|5|Nice little bag, used it on a custom bobber I built. pretty ridged little bag, keeps dry, and has pretty much room for a little bag.
B007MVKBFY|5|Product arrived quick and was just as I expected.
B003COQAKA|5|Mounted up and works great!
B005ZGLGF2|5|Really liked them! They are holding up well.. And comfortable on the skin
B013AUSNOG|1|Blades didn't make good contact with windshield.
B00DLMGAKS|5|PERFECT! What I expected!
B00NOAPW7E|5|Last time my truck didn't start I couldn't find any cables nearby and realized I needed these in case it happened again. This is inexpensive solution. I like the packaging and included gloves too!
B00ZZO01Z0|3|These bulbs are not as bright as the 1141 incandescent's they replaced.  I like the blue/white color they have but they are only 60 - 70% as bright as the 1141's.
B00VSQAQC2|4|Worked great on my Toyota Tacoma Prerunner . Plugged it right in, it uses the car battery to power itself on. It's simple to use, it only takes about a minute to read your vehicle and it tells you how many codes/issues you got. Simple to read the code with a description so is not necessary to google the code. Would recommend to other as it is simple and easy to use and saves you lot's of time not to mention $$$
B001GFW5Q0|5|Great stuff. Added it above the muffler on my RZR and it reduces the heat above significantly. Highly recommend it.
B000GZOKZ0|4|Works as advertised
B000BRJQ9S|5|Work great. Quality material.
B002IVEPLY|5|No problems
B008OZSNA2|5|Damn good
B005J43I56|4|I really like RAM's mounts, and this ball is a good, quick, easy, non-ugly way for me to move the GoPro/GPS/phone mounts between my motorcycle and my wife's.  Be advised, however, that the  included bolts are for imports, not domestic bikes.  Both my bike and my wife's are Harleys, so I ended up ordering some bolts with the correct threads and I was in business.  This was the reason I took a star away - I can't imagine why HARLEY DAVIDSON wouldn't be the FIRST manufacturer you would want your motorcycle-oriented product to be compatible with.  Meh...all it took to fix was an inexpensive bolt, so I'm a happy camper.<br /><br />If you want to put one of these on a Harley (and I assume most other domestic bikes, as well), look for a bolt that matches the following description:<br />5/16-18 x 2 1/4 Socket Cap Screw<br /><br />FMW Fasteners has a perfect fit bolt with the part number: 2162086
B000C0YR1G|3|IT DID WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO
B005O531FW|5|Fit like it was supposed to! Great look! Strong build! Would buy another if I needed one!
B00IFPVPQ0|5|Worked well and fixed 2006 Odyssey glove box.
B00MUCPJ4I|5|It looks good, and fit on like a glove. Definitely worth every penny.
B001C97UW4|5|Worked great on my 2001 honda civic
B002MEHFVO|1|Quality isn't that great
B00510GHGK|5|Looks great
B008MQ4XFW|5|Perfect Fit & Look!<br />Exactly what I expected!
B00IS5T1JK|5|Great product.
B001AZXEQG|5|It fits and looks fine.
B0002MB80C|5|nicely made!
B003ZJUDD2|4|After investigating this issue  accept my apologies for my past review cause the problem doesn't came from unbeatablesale inc.  But from the manufacturer. I think the product is good.
B002BHRXJ6|5|Great  tool for repairing ac coils  -  half price at Harbor freight tool  - same item.
B009PJJEO0|5|just what i needed
B000HQ1WAO|5|Love it
B00XWHGTBM|5|Fit my truck perfectly and really adds a touch of class to the old truck!
B006WPQNB2|3|I loved it until the pump stopped working, which was about after a year and a half of owning it. And, I guess looking at reviews about other toilets, I thought the smell was normal but I guess not. Starts to smell after about 3 days. I have to close the valve to keep the smell away and then I go to use it and forget the valve is closed and pee leaks all over the floor. Anyway, I called the company to purchase a new pump and it costs 140.00, which is more than to get another one. I am currently looking for a different brand.
B00BCRMC3I|1|Does not fit at all!!!
B00I3RBDDK|4|Installed the kit today, along with a new throttle body gasket and a dipstick o-ring. Every hose and the air oil separator itself maintained a factory like fit and finish, except for the hose that connected to the valve cover. It had a noticeable bend in the connector going to the separator that wouldn't let it connect to both components without flexing excessively. Ended up having to reuse the OE hose temporarily until I can find the time to rip it all it out again. Other than that, great product at a great price!
B003M9WVSK|5|The carpet mat fit the trunk well.
B00ETR19DW|5|Nice and new plate.
B00LNLJR3G|4|These are high quality and work for the CBR 1000RR as recommended however there are a few caveats. This acts more as a complementary set but not the only bolts required for a complete teardown/rebuild. They are also not an OEM replica. I cannot fault the seller as the description is accurate and it does fit working with the metric tools.
B006R9W68W|5|loved it  colors matched out camper  easy to clean and put away
B0009PI13E|5|Just as described
B0087NB088|4|Works as advertised; connects with my iPhone quickly and works with most Siri commands. Phone calls are clear with sufficient volume to hear incoming calls. The microphone works very well with wind noise not being a factor; speaking normally works well, no yelling into mic is necessary. I was impressed with the ease of making and receiving phone calls! Music sound quality is not as good as what you would get with a good pair of ear buds but that is because I'm having a difficult time getting the speakers close enough to my ears comfortably in my EXO GT3000 modular helmet, but that is not high priority to me.<br />I did a lot of research before buying this unit and feel it was the best option for me, it did not disappoint.
B002L7H6Q6|3|I put this on for the first time and when I came back from a 180 mile trip there were several pieces of the black that had been nicked off due to bugs.
B00Y1968FC|5|Fits well and attaches easily.
B001AVOM70|4|Came as advertised. Fast shipping, easy install.
B00B8YA66A|5|Very easy to install.
B000KKLLFS|5|Bought these to go on my bike. Excellent inexpensive solution to my missing valve stem caps. Only needed 2, so the other 2 will be great for backups. Can't go wring with these.
B00JHK81X2|5|Purchased for my 16 year old, new driver to keep in his car for emergencies.  I did add a few things like bandaids, hand sanitizer, etc, but the bag had plenty of room to hold the extras.  Great value and peace of mind.
B00BPSUCPE|5|Good buy fast shipping
B00ODGHVMW|1|This did not fit a ford ranger. There where no hols for seat selts
B003BG4CMW|5|Fits like a glove. Luv it!  It definitely is a heat shield and not just a sunshade. It keeps the car a lot cooler than my old ill-fitting generic sunshade.
B00279AMT6|4|Works fine in my ZRX1200R!
B00J2CI3L0|2|Not bright at all, the flashlight on your phone is probably better than these lights but they look cool, match my headlights, and they are cheap, so that's why I got them. I also barely use my fog lights in the first place and I have tons of other lights to make up for the loss of light. So I'll give them two stars only for how they look.
B00E5TR6Y0|4|Bag's look great, I like the design. I do have concerns about the stitching it should have been reinforced. I only used them once and no problem so far.
B00GMA9UUS|5|Looks awesome!  Fits good over helmet and fits good over glasses!!
B004AG8T44|5|Excellent choice
B004OVG0N2|3|It didnt fit my car but it was nice material used.
B0012TRJBQ|5|I purchased the 3/8in set and I liked it so much that I ordered the 1/4in. Great set of tools for the money. Highly recommended
B00SC6ZRP2|5|This works perfect for my daughters booster seat so she can buckle herself.
B00O83FROE|3|The passenger side one gets a lot of water in it am going to check it.
B00PBCMUB4|2|They  were too small for my wheels.
B00029JKIM|5|excellent
B00AEY0V60|5|A+
B00KHUQ9NK|5|Too small for my 2006 Nissan but donated to a friend and it fits their vehicle
B00IKKS4W8|5|I think I am going to buy two more of these and mount the two that I previously bought permanently on the back of the camper. I would like to have two that are not permanently attached to the camper for other uses.
B00GMQVUNW|5|the gift was judt what i was looking for and it cam nicely wraped
B000QUXYXE|5|fit real snug in the socket but still fit with a light tap.
B0015CKXWC|5|Fit perfectly on my 2003 Lexus RX 300. Thank you!
B000C55T7W|5|Just what I needed. Easy to install and better than what came when it was a new car.
B006YTQR4E|5|Honda owners should only use dw1... don't use anything else..... it's easy did the filter and  flush 3×... my tranny shifts like new at 150k...04 accord lx... at Benson honda in san antonio it's $7.59 per quart.... can't beat that....
B00GZHXA4A|5|Very bright! Easy to install.
B00B4EW5D6|4|They are exactly what they say they are, i got a defective one because of it must of got weathered but they sent me a new one without question i recommend this product
B00AESZRBU|5|Already on rear window, Submarine Veteran, US Navy 1970 to 1990
B00HVHOJHU|4|Its good but pricy.
B0014NJWEW|5|always hard to decide which size can to get. the 8 oz. offers just the right amount if my guy leaves the can open we don't loose too much product to error.
B0119RV3KI|5|Absolutely-fast shipping, product exactly as described-would buy it again! Quality material.
B008BE04C6|5|Fantastic bulbs, bright white without the annoying blue tint. I do recommend being careful when installing though, never touch the bulb (this is why you see so many reviews of short lifespan...this is user error not the bulb) If you do touch it take a soft paper towel and a little isopropyl alcohol to clean it, in fact I always clean them this way even if i dont touch the. Also put a dab of bulb grease on the socket side (not the bulb side) If you follow these steps the bulbs will last a long time
B000CAINEI|5|does the trick during a hot southern summer
B00HG76A9A|5|good oil
B001J83FKE|3|A little lose on the install, hopefully it won't fly off.
B009FU7ELE|5|Great product. I could definitely tell the difference once I installed it. Took 10 minutes to install with air tools. 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 5.9L QDCB SLT 4x4
B00CPZOGZ8|5|I'm very grateful to Amazon for having the Jerry Garcia stickers, they're very cool & different!
B00YWGSIXE|5|They look good
B006BC35GM|1|did not program
B00T9URV40|5|Got this after removing the old valve cover to change the gasket and then realizing the spark plug holes were integrated with the cover. Poor design from Nissan. This cover had the gasket and the built in spark plug hole gaskets. Great price and it fit like the old one. It doesn't say Nissan on it like the old one did but I could care less as long is it isn't leaking oil anymore. Good buy.
B000C9CC1E|5|Great
B00DOSWVCA|5|Good quality, looks great combined with the mineral gray crank case. unexpensive upgrade for your bike
B005BN46TM|5|Looks nice in the Vette
B001NIGH4G|2|Only got one of these instead of 2
B00V3RWTGM|5|Item as described - NIB. Would buy from again. Thx!
B0033DNELI|2|Need to use gasket sealer to help this gasket stop the water leak.
B00SJOILKA|5|This product is so amazing way better than spending 1000s of dollars for led lights from the dealer for my Volvo way brighter lights up the highway perfect rain and fog and dark highways thank deep space for a great product and I feel safer.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Looks good works grate
B002R0LPSC|4|Good quality
B00MW8G78C|2|only unlocks my door, only after repeated attempts. Doesnt lock doors. Tried programming it several times with no luck getting it to lock the doors. I have an 05 honda element.
B0046I14RA|5|These devices work great on my boat trailer and fit my wheels fine.
B00OO2005A|5|I ended up returning it as I did not need it but it did fit perfectly if needed.
B005C59NRO|5|Item works as expected.
B00NAUL218|3|Do not try to flush mount.  The sealant on the wires in the back also came off while installing.  The wires come out of two different places on the back.  Not sure how you would ever install them without drilling a huge hole.
B007EZ0EZK|5|simple, fast shipping, love your car.
B009PDBWL4|5|Useful!
B00407RRFA|4|Perfect match.  Wish they came in larger cans.
B00VGL8LZS|5|The hitch ball was exactly as described. I needed a 2&#34; ball with a 5/8&#34; shank for my riding mower. I bolted it in place the day it arrived.
B00W6J0SI2|5|fast delivery, very good fit, now I can leave my windows down for ventilation.
B009DK4XK6|3|after just a few weeks, it failed.  I will be contacting the seller for a warranty return.  If you are wondering how to install it, here is what you need to know: 1) Red wire - constant hot (required so antenna goes down after the vehicle is turned off. 2) Black - ground.  3) White wire - hooks to the power antenna lead on your radio.  If it is an after market radio, the wire is normally solid blue.  The kit comes with screws, a black tube and a piece of metal with several holes in it.  The black tube is to protect wires that run through metal or something else that may damage them nad it may be heat shrinkable, but I didn't use mine, so I don't know.  The metal strip with holes in it is to secure the bottom of the antenna motor housing.  One screw installs through a hole in the metal strip and into one of the holes in the black plastic housing.  The screw and nut are to secure the metal strip to something solid.  This is the support for the bottom of the antenna assembly, the top being supported by the mast but that sits on top and is visible.<br /><br />If you are using this antenna with the factory radio, you MAY need an adapter, as the newer radios have some funked up and different connector.  Check out crutchfield.com, maybe they'll tell you about your car/truck so you can order in advance.<br /><br />The reception was on par with the factory antenna, so no complaints there.  The too-soon-failure however, is a bugger.  However, after looking for a power antenna for my truck (1999 GMC Suburban), this same exact antenna sells for up to $199.00, so the $30.00 plus is reasonable.<br /><br />When I installed mine, knowing that it would likely need replacement, I used snap connectors to make it easier and faster to install a replacement.  I will soon find out how well the warranty is.  I will share that, as all people make errors, but how the error is dealt with separates the good folks from the bad folks.  Still not unhappy with the purchase, so maybe I'll just order a couple and keep replacing them.  :)
B004ME4NDA|4|Sturdy and nice.  I am 5&#34;8&#34; so it is perfect for me . A much shorter person i don't know. It also depends on how high u wonna be though
B00SMH58RI|4|I purchased this product for novelty purposes. I took it out of the packaging, the it in the dash, and plugged the cord into the cigarette lighter port. While this isn't as bright as some of the units you see on police cars, it is still very bright at a fraction of the price! I am very happy with the product, but I would recommend checking local and state laws on restrictions of use.<br /><br />https://youtu.be/ApLy2XZMC3w<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample and/or discount on this product in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are 100% my own and have not been influenced in any way.
B00LY6FX1A|5|Love it, thank you looks really beautiful!
B0010GCAWY|5|Taking the old one out was a pain, because it was stuck, I had to drill holes through the inside door to get to the retaining bolts. This new one went in so easy, like in minutes, very nice product.
B00QKLFFWG|5|Awesome fit like a glove, very easy to install it took 30mins.
B000E4THCE|5|Fast shipping, fitted perfect.
B00WT222FS|5|I am so glad this sticker exists!!!
B00VBXOAC4|1|It's not a 3 way toggle so it always has power going one way or the other
B00HM4LH40|5|Shipped very well secured in bubble wrap, no scratches the quality is second to none. They look fantastic.
B003POJ1DU|5|These are great!  Have been using them on my car for a couple of years and they hold up very well.  Plus they are not harsh on your paint surface.  Really recommend Griot's products.  I have been happy with these, and their other cleaning / detailing products.
B008EEYTQA|5|OEM qualtity parts. Get OEM or this kit. Don't do the job with anything else.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Awesome product and delivery. Thank you

B00GZHX928|5|Great Looking Product “We will do business again”  “Thank You”
B001892TQK|5|The seat feels very durable and holds up great to the elements. All the hardware to mount the seat is included and none of the stock stuff is used.
B00NPC4OSY|4|Fits my Nissan Altima '06. Was easy to install.
B00B7HBIOW|5|same as the original.
B002JAU25C|5|Great
B000CMJ2KU|5|Item looks good and solid.  Received wrench on time.<br />Packaged very well.<br />Thanks.
B0026MCTL8|4|This kit along with the Dorman washer nozzle kit made the installation very easy! I did have to drill a couple of holes in the underside of the hood to keep it from dangling, but it fit very well!
B0042KMX18|5|I use it all the time
B000V1SNPW|2|good key but to expensive for an old lincoln key
B00429NKWK|5|Really works, I was skeptical at first, but my 2003 Honda Civic looks like it has brand new headlights. Takes a little elbow grease to use but well worth it.
B0031BL1D0|5|Put this through a 5000 mile road trip and loved it! Plenty of room and a family easy on and off. I have a 13&#34; passenger backrest so it took a little wrestling to get it on and off but it never moved. The rain cover also worked like a champ! Highly recommend
B001Y91MFI|4|fit well and looks good
B00395L908|5|This thing... works.... no more wind tunnel noise, water doesn't get in, and keeps the cab cool.
B00AR5Y7WK|5|This item is exactly as described - fits perfectly!  I love it!

B00SYFACHE|5|THIS TOOL WONT GET USED MUCH IN MY GARAGE BUT IF YOUR DOING A SMALL BLOCK CHEVY ENGINE BUILD  THIS TOOL IS A MUST
B004UVM03A|5|SNELL 2005 rated. Comfortable for my big noggin. Used for drag racing per sanctioning body rules. Entire helmet is coated in rubber like coating, so be aware of that. For my application, couldn't ask for a better value. Would buy again, but make sure you know the minimum SNELL rating per the rule book of your race's sanctioning body.
B00EAJLUAQ|5|Just as I expected
B00OBR1R1O|5|Shipping was fast as expected!  Starter came well packaged, and fit like a glove.  My four wheeler didn't start this well, when it was brand new!  I'm very happy!
B007RRYW4E|4|Was exactly what I ordered. I'm very happy.
B00K69YXS0|3|Flimsy product, but kinda works. Really needs to be built stronger.
B00JJBWMDO|4|I'm sure they work great, but I hope I never have to use them.
B004R33MLA|5|Great product. Perfect fit!
B000B8JULG|5|Product as described.
B00OH0S5Y2|5|Works Great
B004SL8568|5|Better than having to go to the dealership to buy it.
B001DCH3TK|5|Fit perfectly. Less than half the price of the local auto parts stores
B0009IBJE4|5|Purchased as a gift for my husband.  Does the job quickly and seems to be sturdy & dependable.
B005PZMKZI|5|Fast Delivery and a very good product.<br />Thanks
B001O074JU|5|Our truck was running like crap, having worked in automotive stores I learned that for a Ford Engine in the opinion of many customers and research we did. These are the best for our truck and Amazon has them at the best price. Our truck drives like it's brand new.
B0002UHVAA|5|Ad was exactly what I needed and it fits! No more poop spilling out ! I am soooo happy
B00ZCFTG8K|1|Way too dark
B00XZ4R33A|4|Had to pin the clamps to the engine guard with a small bolt to keep them from turning on the guard. Look good and very satisfied with them. I feel the reason I had to pin them was due to the area attached was in a bend area.
B000B8UPCY|5|Always been a fan of the blue goo for doing my assembly.  It is generally up to personal preference but you should always use a quality goo and Dr. Tranny has you covered on the quality side.  I used this for just about anything that I have issues with when working on the car, just the other day I used it to help guide some bushings that didn't want to fit.
B00KWEXHTU|5|Works. No need to program it.
B00E975MPI|4|It takes a bit to get the hang of spraying it on.  Start with an area that is out of view, or practice with something else.  Once I got the hang of it though it went on like a dream.  I used it on an older outdoor aluminum table and chairs that somebody was going to throw away because it had gotten run down.  A day and a case of Plasti-Dip later, the old set looked like new and at a recent party at my home I got way more compliments than I thought I would.
B00211UR18|5|great product
B0082365AQ|5|The assembly was extremely easy. You just slide the wheels on and set the pins. I keep it assembled, but it would be a breeze to break down for storage.
B00DBEQC3G|1|Came with only one working.<br />I have emailed and requested return.<br />They never sent return or replacements to me.<br /><br />These are junk
B00NX8EYFI|5|We loved it
B00DWVN08I|5|Exactly what I ordered and perfect fit.
B006H34BUY|4|Pros:<br />Perfect size.<br />I dust even exterior part of car and did not want to buy other bigger/bulkier ones.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Micro fibers should have been more tightly packed.
B00873J0YY|5|Works great with my kayaks.
B009II5CMQ|5|Works fine.
B0051WS8K6|5|Worked great on my Tundra.  Most locks are too short. This one had room to spare.
B000GU7G56|5|The Item is awesome! and my order arrived ahead of schedule!
B001O0VNTW|5|Like it
B00B36CPVM|4|Dries to a great glossy finish.  Will purchase again for painting outdoor metal objects
B00KTHU6DK|4|I bought these because it is a more economical way to replace a ruined key fob. It does look a little more plasticky than I expected and the range seems even shorter than it already was but it works overall and I like the color.
B005VNWIOW|5|I was getting a check engine light on my '04 XC90 that indicated the engine was taking too long to get to operating temperature. I suspect the problem was with the thermostat but wanted to change this while I was replacing the thermostat just in case.<br /><br />I'm glad I did as I had everything out and apart making installing this a breeze.<br /><br />Everything fit perfectly and the sensor seems to be working as it should.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Nice product which serves the purpose exactly, and the size fits well to the windshield!
B00AQKGBIY|5|Son really liked the sticker for his car.
B008QDXPFK|5|Really effective. fed a little less than 25% of the bottle's content to during freon refill and let it circulate a couple of days maybe 3days then use a UV light to identify leak, if it glows under the UV light then thats your leak. pretty straight forward. I found my leak around the compressor.
B00S7PWBR0|5|They worked so good I'm thinking about buying 2 more for the back of my boat
B00BCRMC1U|1|Didn't fit my car as discribed. And even if it did, installation is horrid!!!!
B00WYCO4FO|1|Tiny stickers, not worth the money. I kinda felt ripped off. But delivered timely so deserving of the one star.
B00CMMOAOQ|5|Right fit for my car
B008FCD85Y|5|Fast and excellent service and product. THANKS!
B001GS0DBG|1|They are horrible scratches all over.  I am going to return them.
B004RSC5TU|3|The 3M tabs given are a joke. I love the dash pod and it looks great for an OEM look. I ended up just using 1 self-tapper screw to install this because the 3M tape was not strong enough or meant to wrok in the type of dash Ford uses. Anyways I love the pod and I will post a picture later today.
B0031794W4|4|Got the product on time as stated.looks good on the bike
B00PQWN5DQ|3|I got a couple of these to replace a similar one I had and couldn't find any more. The reason I liked my old one is that it provided a solid grip on the device when pushing the chuck hard against the valve (and sometimes wearing gloves, as in cold weather or motorcycling).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the 'rubber' pieces aren't molded into the body like with my old one. What shows as a rubber grip (black) is actually a thin piece of rubber that slips over the device body and just as easily slips off.<br /><br />I wouldn't get these again. I would pay more for a product that provided a good, solid grip as I was expecting.
B00QVO5A90|5|Perfect
B00AHTD0LK|5|Good price for 1 pc rotors for my cts-v. Don't need anything else (slotted or drilled).
B000BKJDKM|5|excellant
B00KTITHNO|5|These work great.  I can't believe the prices, they are great.  They are very simple to program.
B00QL1TP8U|5|Just what I needed.  I am short, if the seat does not adjust high enough, you will need something like this.
B0027UPPK6|5|replaced on a polaris 330 and works famously
B00BJ7YZRM|2|Lighter in weight than the Ford product.  Do not stay on very well.  Lost one first day it was put on.
B00GB1TMBA|5|Good value and quality
B00OPVYHZ4|4|The LED light was bent and I had to straighten it.  Hopefully it will not break off.  Otherwise it seems to be built well.
B008B5X5GC|5|Should have ordered 4 since the price went up.  I ordered 2 to replace the front originals on a 2007 Cadillac Escalade.  I took it to a 'hood place that charges $5 to fix flats and they replaced them for $25 per tire.  The guy replaced them in under 20 minutes but was initially overly concerned about destroying the originals since he didn't see anyway to prevent that.  I, through a translator, had to assure him that the part is replace only, not repair.  I did the reprogramming myself and working fine, so far.
B00LAIYOX0|2|30 days after buying this rack the bolts and main frame started rusting. After contacting Proline for a return due to rust. They stated that they have a 30 day return policy. They refused to take care of the poor quality. I picked this rack because it is supposed to be powder coated. It does require you to drill holes on my 2008 Dodge 1500. Unless you are planning to completely re-paint this rack before installation buy a different rack.
B00AOGDNE0|5|Worked perfectl...just took it and my armrest to an upholstery repair place.<br />Good as new!
B000EDST1K|4|A great way to turn our stove top into extra counter space in our travel trailer. It mostly stays in place during travel (keep in mind how much a travel trailer bounces around). However after a season of use, the non slip underside is starting to come loose on the edges, nothing that some duct tape can't fix, but still.
B00XVQFO42|5|These look amazing on my 2015 Kawasaki Vulcan Classic 900. They really flow with my Zombie theme. Very easy to install, but you will need to ride around a bit to get the proper placement. Once they are in the right spot they even function very well. The only issue I have with these. They rotate up and down at the wrist. If you ride fast like myself. The pressure from the wind and jolts from bumps move them out of place. To fix that problem I put in a couple drops of super glue. &#34;WARNING&#34; DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU ARE 100% CERTAIN THEY ARE WHERE YOU WANT THEM TO BE. make sure to wipe away and excess glue before it dries to not compremise the integrity of the looks. You do not want to glue them with the wrong tilt. They function perfectly after a little tampering and they look great too.
B002M2MMXM|5|Great price. Half of what local shops want for same plug.
B00KUSZQ92|2|There were no instructions to install and 2 different kinds of screws were given not matching,it looks horrible.
B0073LDXG2|5|Perfect fitting!
B001OMLAFC|1|Missing parts...just looked sloppy
B0046I3I8I|1|These are very small not happy
B003YI421I|5|Works grate
B0002KL6TM|5|Good stuff!  I used this during the extraction of the dreaded two piece spark plugs from a 2005 Mustang v8. Made the job a lot easier!<br />Also use it on my 2008 Ford Expedition retractable running boards to keep them lubricated and operating smoothly.
B00G3L1GQC|5|Perfect fit!!!
B005KOZ25Y|5|This item saved me $250 the first time I used it. Great value, easy to use!
B004PLCKEO|5|Don't know how I would have completed the rebuild of my LS2 engine without this. A need to have for this process. Highly recommend
B001JT19GK|5|Perfect is so hard to find in stores. Exactly what I wanted.
B00LOZ9AQA|3|You get what you pay for here with these lug nuts. A CHEAP SET. I put these on a car I was selling, needed shorter lug nut to clear a new set of hubcaps. Some of them seemed very loose and sloppy, although they all did still tighten down to the proper torque. I've been working on cars for 25+ years, and can just tell that after these nuts are removed and re-installed a few times that they'll need to be replaced. I would have only given them 2 stars, but their shipping was good and they did supply a spare nut in the package.
B001LL9UQ2|2|Doesn't fit normal utility trailer hitch. The shaft (to lock) and the distance from the shaft to key housing is very short. Also note this is not a push in to lock. You must turn the key multiple times to fully engage.
B003VAWYRS|5|I bought this for camping but, use it in my kitchen as it is small and does not occupy much space! love it. Very handy.
B00MLF5W28|5|Awesome, high-quality fob holder for my Cadillac keys. Fobs are extremely expensive to replace so it's nice to have the extra coverage!
B0016IGVQM|5|I got a brand name at a $300 savings.
B0047ZZOQ4|5|Great product!
B00WMK6Z46|5|I purchased these mats to keep in our car for the harsh and salt/sand filled winter months in MI. We have a toyota Camry and I am very impressed with the fit! It is really easy to cut them down to size as well if needed. There is no strong smell from the rubber and the design is sleek and not too chunky. We have grey interior in our car, and the grey mats match perfectly! The real test will be in the winter when the elements will start to effect the mats, but as of right now I think they will do the job!
B00852684M|1|Missing one package of (2) blue LEDs.  Only came with one package of (2) pink LEDs and one package of (2) green LEDs.  Returned item.
B00332GO8O|5|Nice bed rails...I was pleased with them.
B00029JKG4|5|Awesome product. Fast shipping
B00CP6JZQC|5|Handle fit perfectly and an easy youtube video search helped me put it right in.  This GM design is overall very poor and cheaply made.  Almost all of the vehicles that require this handle are $40,000 and above vehicles.  One would expect a better door handle design.  GM is wasting money and design research on dumb things such as electronic internal tire preasure gauges that no one cares about, but cant make a funtioning door handle that gets used multiple times a day.  Anyway, this LatchWell handle fit in and funtioned as advertised.
B000NDL8P0|3|Fine
B001539B7O|5|Works great, and compact for camping
B00DIVGJT4|5|Only need one set of mirror  covers
B0018C85VK|5|Works better than I thought!! Strong
B000VKODI4|4|It works amazingly, but this is a very tight fit. I have to use some sort of grease in order to slide it into the proper track. However this is the 4th one I've purchased over 3 years, so it can't be that bad.
B002UCYRZU|5|This stuff is amazing. I used it to polish the instrument console plastic cover in my car. It has a cloudy finish on it that nothing else could remove. Three minutes polishing with #2 and another two minute wipe with #1 and the cover is so clear I can't even tell its there anymore!
B00ABZSC7M|4|Covers hair nicely, but have to use another band to keep it on. Would be great if it was water proof and not open at one end.
B002CZ7D60|5|I use it all the time. It allows me to carry a much lighter weight 30 AMP cable which is all I need because I don't think I'll be installing an additional air conditioner.
B002M2OBTU|3|This is NOT a 'kit'. It is a single bushing. Anyone working on a car with two of the exact same bushings for the exact same purpose -one on each side- would assume that a 'kit' meant it was both bushings. This isn't. As such it is way overpriced- I could have bought a single bushing on Rock Auto for $5.60 and thrown it into an order with other parts to absorb the shipping.
B008TS6F6S|5|Excellent
B0077FJWLY|5|I gave it 5 stars but I don't know yet. This is going into a 65 mustang project that has been in the shop for close to 2 years and as it comes closer to completion I will re-review this item. I am sure it will do just fine.
B00I50553E|5|Outstanding Product.
B001QIPSK2|5|Great item, seemed brand new. Fit is great (glad I went with a larger than publicized size recommendation).
B005ETYRI8|4|Was expecting a re-man caliper but this one is all new with a very nice silver finish.
B00UAHC4LG|3|It is OK. Didn't notice much performance improvement. I feel the braking distance might be a bit even longer. The package I received only includes one brake sensors(need 2) and 4 bushings. The hi-temp grease was not included either.
B003V57NUQ|5|This works great with our 18ft tandem sea kayak. Its very stable. I do use additional straps to be more secure.
B0015RC3CU|5|As advertised.
B00LM55XHM|1|Sent me the wrong scent, covered the sticker up and sent a less popular scent to get rid of them.
B005XVBIL6|5|good
B00OCEGTZA|5|Great cheap little tool to have to test brake fluid especially if you're a tech, now you can quickly show a customer why there fluid needs to be changed and how important brake fluid is to a vehicle. one of the most important and most overlooked fluids of a vehicle. One thing to be careful when using this tool is to not submerge it completely or else you'll get false reading, just barely touch the tips in the fluid for a more accurate result.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Great product! Easy to use and you can't beat the price!
B00449PVIE|5|it fits perfectly on my 2002 mini cooper... my old muffler was 12 years old and after so much salt accumulating on the top of it here no one can reach, the metal started to deteriorate and eventually it made a hole which made the muffler produce a lot of noise. when i replaced it with the new one, it was so quite, quite than ever.
B00PU5I4JO|1|Cheap abs plastic and not even wearable for a bicycle
B000C5G0ES|5|Just like the OEM unit.  Works as you would expect.
B007IVQYRC|5|Product was as expected...quality..!!!
B00N2ZFTOW|5|Worked perfect for my 2003 Polaris Magnum 330
B002R0BEWY|4|Good quality.  Fits well.
B000C9J6JK|5|Fits perfect easy to install works great
B00RYSTM9G|5|Look good
B0070Y341G|4|SatLink WS-6903 Digital LED Satellite Signal Meter Finder
B009B1COD0|5|They provide goos coverage. I have the tan seats and they blend in pretty well. They fit snuggly and I haven't experienced any issues with catching the sides or anything. They are pricey but I think the quality is worth it.
B0087NB2OU|5|Outstanding product that has made riding in the open sports car a pleasure.  Easily set up and operated,  comfortable to wear and clear audio even in quite winy conditions.  Very pleased with the product.
B00YWKY87A|3|Rubber grommets between hood and bracket like to compress, leaving the hood looser than I'd like.
B00WAGYVDO|5|This is a perfect replacement for the broken cable on my 2010 Sienna. It comes with well-written instructions on how to get the door apart and how to replace the cable. Considering that the dealership wanted $750 for this part and another $50 to install it, this was a great deal at less than 1/4 the cost!
B0008G1N98|5|great product.
B000BZJ7X0|5|Good
B00IVA50K6|5|Exactly what I expected thank you
B000EQRU80|5|I debated on whether to get the original brake shoes or something cheaper; I'm glad I bought these.  They fit perfectly and after several months now, they perform well with no noise or any other issues.... very happy
B008KPYXLO|5|it wasn't for me but it does work good and the price was good
B00D4DK05U|5|Great quality, but not fit my 2009 e82 120d.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great, keeps car much cooler in our Texas heat
B006VR6LBS|5|The fit is tight, but I am happy with the helmet. I love the sun visor, which can be raised rather than changing the shield.
B00HAPHQXW|1|its made in Chaina and i received broken
B010FXXFYO|5|Vote Bernie, he CAN win!
B0023W5HKG|5|looks better than factory
B001AVS61S|5|I ride a 98  Honda Ace Shadow 750, with Cobra Drag Pipes and didn't like how high the bike rev'd during my commute, most forums suggest a 38tooth, but the local shop suggested I'd be happier with the 39T and I have to say I am very pleased with the 39T, I run about 70mph on the speedo and before the switch with the factory 41T you could tell the engine was running hard buzzing hard. As for performance yes you will lose a little bottom end, but since you now will shift later, you may actually see an improved 0-60 since there is one less shift in there ;) (just a guess) So now when I cruise at 70mph in 5th the engine is quieter, even my mechanic on the test ride was impressed he's mostly a Harley/chopper guy but he said it's so smooth now at speed, not to mention if I wanted to I have a much higher top speed(but its not a race bike so not really a factor)<br /><br />MPG will go up as well, nothing calculated yet, but you don't need a calculator to know that lower RPMS at the same speed = more MPG<br /><br />There is a reason this is considered one of the top mods for Shadows and other bikes, it basically gives you that 6th gear for highway cruising without feeling like you are going to blow the engine up...
B0069T8DGY|5|The very best! Have used them for years!
B00GYTEDRW|5|Fit. Worked. Made my car much quieter. No leaves rustling around anymore!
B009IF1U5M|5|10 second installation perfect fit!!
B000BRQ0TW|5|I've used this stuff before and it is amazing.
B00AUI2DJ8|5|Great Product...
B00EDGQLQO|5|It's change the whole look it looks great
B000C2GGF4|5|Great seller. Prompt and merchandise as advertised.
B000CSRA3K|5|thanks
B0093JXF06|5|Awesome thanks
B0016OIF3I|5|great product, perfect fit
B005R66BQ4|5|Very good fit and finish for FZJ80 Landcruiser.  Used the baseball stitch and bought a small crochet hook to cinch it all down tight.
B003ZS5B2Q|5|Fast delivery. Easy to install on my vehicle, Toyota Highlander
B00CWSK4UY|5|worked fine!
B00JKU683E|3|does it fit to be in the back of my car and still not too big?
B0031W3FV0|1|This product does NOT fit a 2004 4Runner correctly despite its claim. After tearing apart my dash and installing the last piece I noticed that the cutout for the gear selector which is illuminated on the dash itself is incorrect in its shift pattern layout. It also does not easily install over the needles as stated and if not done very carefully can mess up the inner edge of the sticker causing a needle to potentially hang up. Also you can &#34;mess up&#34; the needles and their position even with the &#34;cutout&#34; holes in this kit. If it would've been the correct pattern I would've given a 3 to 4 star rating as it did look good installed. Since I not only had to install, but uninstall the product I would not recommend it. Also, it says over and over in the packaging to &#34;email them if not completely satisfied&#34; and they will fix any issues. I emailed them a couple days ago... No response. Imagine that?
B004GCSAO6|5|Awesome thanks Amazon :-) :-)
B004KK553I|2|Shipment was fast, and item was packaged great! They are not actual crystals, just clear balls. Therefore they do not catch the light as I hoped. Disappointing
B00KTIYXLU|4|Work good.
B00QLDDC50|4|Looks great on my car! Just be careful when applying and make absolutely sure you've positioned it where you want it--you can't really unstick it when some of the finer details along the cat's base and tail adhere because they then get tangled, creased, or stretched.
B00B3BKM1M|5|Nice decal that pretty much say's it all-it's like giving those other two car company's a big ole middle finger. FORD FOREVER !!!!!
B005HF3BWW|5|Perfect fit for our EZ Pass. We have one of the older model pssses. It makes it easy to transfer from one car to the other.
B006OOH5UY|5|I have always hated the original wrangler exhaust and I found this. I painted in black and I just cant stop staring at it.
B000WKATG8|1|I wish I would have read the other review!  This kit does not come with the airline!  It is useless to someone needing the whole kit that is required to install Progressive shocks!  The item ad photo clearly shows the airline as part of the kit and never mentions that it is not part of the kit.
B00UILP2PE|4|A bit pricey but looks ok!
B004AKM3HE|5|These dock lines are very well made from high quality rope.
B004MWTWQ0|5|great product at a great price.
B00EUVLGXA|5|worked perfect good quality
B00132CG4M|5|I beefed up my trailer ramp after I purchased my side by side. The added weight made raising and lowering the ramp a back breaking experience. After installing these assists, raising and lowering is a one handed operation. I recommend taking the time to plan your install before drilling any holes. I followed the directions and started on one side. I used clamps to temporarily hold the spring housings in place so I didn't have to drill anything. I fastened the cable to the ramp with the S-hooks that are provided so there was minimal spring force when I lowered my ramp. After verifying that I had clearance between my cable and the trailer, I marked and drilled the first side. After fastening the second side in the same manner, I used the S-hooks to get the right cable tension like the directions say for easy raising and lowering. After drilling the ramp for the cable fastening, my assists were installed with no extra drilling and they worked great. If you do not have perforated metal to fasten the S-hooks to to adjust your spring tension before drilling, use clamps to temporarily hold your cables until you get he correct tension. These are a great product I highly recommend.
B002SAUY74|5|perfect fit-easy to install
B0000AY1W7|5|Works great
B00CODED18|1|Ordered the size that said should fit and it did not :( was too small, so I gave it to my sister. It's a beautiful vest but disappointed in the sizing...
B0075XHDHI|5|Works just it is supposed to.
B00FE7BWJ2|4|Quick shipping. Perfect fit.
B00EU1B20M|5|This part was a perfect fit and works great.  It was very easy to install, taking only 40 minutes.  This was the first time I had replaced this type of component so I was worried how well it would work or whether it would be difficult but it was not.  If you can do an oil change you can replace this starter.
B00BITPZ8E|5|muy buen producto
B00B1AKEFY|5|Worked great on my 2014 CR-V
B0009OMYAQ|1|I have an Audi A4 2007 , I could not change my filter oil . It is smaller than the oil socket
B00MJ3ZQNC|3|Although overall pleased with this product  ..... I wasn't happy that the rain visers on the rear didn't cover the whole window.
B000BOLEFA|5|Fits perfectly on my 2003 pontiac vibes ,looks nice
B00YTXKKDQ|3|The instructions did not indicate if the lead wire could be shortened or not. I left the excess bundled on the pressure washer and it appears to work just fine.
B00MQ1G6ZE|5|The fit is perfect and the mirror is clear. The price was good if you need a replacement mirror this is the place to get it I am sure you will be happy with this site and what you get.
B00M4MIN92|5|Easy to install , brought 20 years back to my 300ZX twin turbo ..
B006EH9WUC|4|Exactly what i wanted. Does what it suppose to do
B00Y85UME2|5|Added magnets and they work great for camping!
B00GWFKUE8|5|Installed these mats in my 2014 Toyota Tundra Double Cab.  Not only do these mats look excellent, they are shaped perfectly to the contours of the floor.  These mats also cover the driver's side foot rest near the emergency brake, which my previous All-Weather mats did not.  As with other reviews, I am not a fan of the screw-type plug used on the passenger side to dig into the carpet to hold it in place.  But, that is a flaw with Toyota and not the mats.  Great product!
B00KLKZF68|5|It was a real five star experience.. The parts were on my door step day's before the deadline..
B004G4AYLG|5|Perfect!
B00681BE2S|5|Worked as advertised.  Perfect solution so far.
B00PJX549A|1|Smaller than advertised.  Very disappointed.
B000C9F4VY|5|Works great & shipped fast
B00884UFQY|5|Good service, quality product and quick delivery. I would use them again.
B00IXZQEFY|4|A prime example of saving a little and getting a little lower quality product.  Mats like Weathertech's and Husky's are so expensive that this makes for a nice alternative but the price savings can be seen in the build quality.  Seems like it is made from thinner rubber and some of the lines just don't line up right with the angles in the floor.  We put this in our brand new JKU and it is a fairly fine product but that flaws kind of left me wanting more.  My wife loves them and at the end of the day that is what really matters but if I were driving the Jeep every day I would probably not be satisfied with these mats and would look for something more substantial.
B00GUJ9CUO|5|Fit my 03 envoy perfectly.  Not easy to replace though.
B00139FQLU|2|They dont fit tightly in my new fuse block. I'm afraid they'll pop out when the going gets rough
B0115QEVGQ|4|This is a nice looking frame made out of actual metal. It looks pretty great, and hopefully it holds up. The warning about salt and needing to spray it down concerns  me a little during the winter months as we have snow and salt on the roads where I live.<br /><br />So the frame does what it is supposed to, and looks good. There are a couple of down sides I think could be addressed. The main one is that there are no real instructions or diagrams with how to use it included in the packaging. I wasn't exactly sure how the screw covers worked.<br /><br />That was the other thing that I don't know if I like. I put the screws through the ones with a hole in them (I couldn't see how else they would even work), and then the caps seem to fit nicely inside. The issue I have is that I have no idea how you remove them once they are in like that. Maybe you can put a screwdriver in and pry it off. It doesn't seem convenient.<br />The other thing about the screws is that even though it comes with a set of 4 covers it only includes 2 screws. So if you need to mount all 4 you have to provide at least 2 of your own. That seems like a strange oversight. Why include 4 screw caps and 2 screws?
B00IRD7RT4|5|Great fit and finish. Love the look. Compliments the SRT8 bumper conversion nicely. Fits to existing holes perfectly.<br />The only thing is the hardware provided the bolts had Philips heads, but quick trip to home depot fixed that. As other reviewers mentioned it's M6-1.0 x 16mm bolts I couldn't find 16mm and ended up using M6-1.0 x 20mm bolts and 1/4&#34; washers.<br />The factory spoiler uses studs but I couldn't find studs at home depot. With the studs you wouldn't need a helper to install it.<br />Overall I am very happy with this SRT8 spoiler.
B003YLMPPA|5|I thought I had to replace the entire fan switch on my Jeep, but luckily I found this was the answer. Installation was quick, about 5 minutes. It's nice to be able to put the fan speed on low again.
B00KTI8UBE|5|Works as advertised
B005NLQAHS|5|Works as it should,  Use with a free Android app Torque
B0007VYMUQ|4|Arrived damaged.
B00DQU9W4G|4|looks good, good protection for dust and sun but is not  rain proof
B004O7DC0K|5|Good!!!
B00276LC2A|4|fits fine but is not a carbon filter
B003554TB8|5|Roofbag is the BEST. This cartop carrier got my stuff from Minnesota to Seattle with absolutely everything completely in tact. It's sturdy, the zippers are strong, completely waterproof. This thing fits a ton of stuff in it and literally doubled my car's capacity. We used two extra ratchet ties to secure it to the roof to ease our minds, but I do not believe that would have been necessary. Completely recommend this product!
B0006IX87S|5|RV filter water works well on my last three trips. Wouldn't hook-up without it.
B00Y1HTI0Q|5|Great deal !!!!
B00MATVMC4|5|Very nice durable construction nicely priced as well compared to local source at 50 bucks a pop.
B000CN7D3M|5|Good quality
B0018QJ7IQ|1|Horrible. My cover has rotted in 3 months. Without being exposed to any extreme weather, the inner layer has rotted and begun leaving gray dust and pieces of the material all over my Jeep. The gray dust started to stick to my paint and has been a pain to remove. It also leaves your interior covered in this layer of dust and pieces that have rotted off the cover.
B001H494DC|5|Trucks are stolen continuously in our city and this is the best theft protection me and my neighbor have found. Another neighbor without it lost his truck to theft. Well worth the price. Very easy to use as well.
B0031OXGXU|5|works fine
B00ZD1T6QK|5|As advertised. Fits good.
B0060YRD9G|5|Very good.
B0014477MU|1|This meter quit after a year, stopped @ 22.6 hours...
B00540BMZS|5|This was just what I needed. I'm now wishing I had bought one sooner.
B00Q4AS1G0|5|It was the piece that I need so it worked out well to have to go through the passenger's door thank you for the item
B001JT58OY|5|good
B001FONOSK|4|Product works well, but it was delivered with the plastic top damaged.
B00T6IWFQE|4|Thought they were going to be black. Turns out they are a grayish color. Other then that they look great!
B000QSZFZ6|4|works great, looks better
B00L1S0JU6|3|Nothing amazing. I still have to use my Absorber first to suck up 90% of the water. I tried drying my car with this, and it soaked the water up pretty well (nothing very special though), but then it wouldn't ring out at all, so after that it was just streak city. Also, a little bit of the stitching came off the very first time I used it, and it has a tag which is a no-no for any detailing enthusiast. For now I am keeping this for touch-ups. Certainly isn't worth the price.
B00R7THISE|5|Great product all across, very easy to install!
B005CPA2UG|5|Just what i was look for, really make the back and side of the truck look good.
B00KVO4RZY|5|Does exactly as advertised!
B00KRL38HY|4|Quality decal, just a bit bigger than I expected otherwise 5 stars.
B000I1US62|5|Used to rebuild top end on LS2. Works perfect. Highly recommend. A quality product!
B00AYZB6Z4|5|They are exactly what I was looking for Thank You.
B004MTK39S|1|Hole for ratchet is too close for hole for axle nut. Cant get in behind pipes.
B00D3QYPP4|5|They look awesome. Easy install.
B004LFABG8|4|It was just what I needed, the only thing was there were no holes on the bottom of the leg for the landing pad, had to drill my own
B0000AY2Z6|5|Wonderful
B007ED84XG|5|I love this shade!
B000WK732G|5|i bought this for Sturgis as a back-up in case i lost my sunglasses.  Turns out i used it for the whole trip  Good fit,,,ventalation was good.  It was also dark enough for the cloudless sky.
B00PH1F6HY|5|It looks and feel like the OEM. A must purchase. It not hard to install at all. I used YouTube to learn how to remove the steering wheel and the install was easy.
B000CB35F4|5|Bought 3 from advanced auto and all broke this stay working so much longer
B000KID2ZC|4|Good item
B000E7YP7I|5|Very good fit for my 2011 BMW 750.  Holds plenty of stuff including air compressor / battery booster.  Heavy and doesn't move around at all.  Very pleased.
B008G3CK7Y|5|Works great!
B006VU5WX8|5|Cheep product but good will rebuy when needed.
B000KZ23LY|5|worked perfect.  instructions to activate remote very good. Thank you!!
B000R8F47Y|2|I gave the item 2 stars because it appears to be top quality. The reason I don't like it is due to the horrible smell of the item. It has almost a toxic plastic smell. I am not sure if something went wrong during shipping but either way I am stuck with it. I have tried drenching the net in a bucket of water with soap and it still smells. After airing it out, still bad. Looks like I will have to buy a new one.<br /><br />In fairness to Master Lock, it could of been a shipping issue, so do not let my experience deter you.
B003A4QT8A|4|It met my expectations.  Luckily I had my own rivet gun and was able to estimate the rivet sizes and pick some up at Ace Hardware.  Ideally it would come with the rivets.
B0068ODC66|5|Great remotes  simple to program
B00RMNNAKA|4|Brightest set of fog lights I've seen
B00H51P7KA|5|Perfect fit on wrx sti 2006.
B004A6I3Q8|5|It is a Very good service and quality
B0010B00IA|1|This is a bad buy won't keep anything cold even when put in cold bought for a 18 hour road trip and didn't do wat it claimed
B000CMHVJO|5|Purchased the easylift for my father and he says its great. Easy to install.
B00TQ6W2JQ|1|i bought this item and within 1 week  the rubber turned to rock and my technician is going to have to do the work twice. u know what that means for my wallet and now we found out too late and according to amazon.
B00BHH1QT4|4|Works great; kind of cheap build, but not flimsy.  The thing is plastic, so I wouldn't have expected it to be much more solid anyways.
B0051IEDT0|5|made such a difference driving at night! The company stands behind its product and customer service was spot on. Installation was simple and easy,
B00G5C3ZZ4|3|Schematic was incorrect. Took me double to time to try to figure out what wire went were.
B00PKQGTM2|1|Looks nothing like the picture, unrould it and the vinyl is already coming apart full of air bubbles. I will not buy this product again.
B00IAZXN2Y|1|I gave it away because it looked cheat and I just didn't like it.
B00KQY8T1W|4|worked well and pleased with quality. these are my second set purchased and can recommend..
B000EAIERW|5|had them almost 7 months now. Kids swing from them and use them everyday. Still holding up
B008XIQ5KA|5|bought this when it was on sale and you get your money's worth. Great tools love the mini leatherman and it comes in a metal tin which you could make into a handy survival case as well.
B00KIERDDU|5|Outstanding Product. Very Bright.
B00OU6QDP6|4|On the driver side bracket it cracked in the middle.I had to replace.
B00538TU8C|5|Item fit perfectly. Didn't feel much cheaper than stock. Except- my problem was deeper than just the broken handle. My issue was a retaining clip that kept a rod in place that unlatched the bottom catch. Rigged up a zip tie to keep the rod in place and all is well again.
B001I9JKJ4|5|great price
B00U64XP6G|5|fast shipping, was a good fit, satisfied
B00TGPQQTE|5|They all work great and as intended. No need for a lengthy review.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Awesome. Works as described.
B00NGFP5S8|1|I did not receive the bolts necessary to attach it to my lift gate.  Had to send it back.  Total waste of time.
B001FHAODA|1|I've learned to always double-check Amazon as the wiper they sent me does not actually fit on my far.  The passenger one was correct, but this drivers side one is not.
B000JZHLYE|5|excellent price !!
B001DKN9CC|5|This is a very good tool to have. You can use 1/2 inch sockets on a 3/8 drive. Its guaranteed a life time too and thanks for the fast shipping from Hires Automotive!
B00355KWYQ|5|perfect
B00QMI3CZ4|2|doesn't fit the spring very well. afraid if it slipped off could cause injury. went to auto parts store and used theirs and it fit well with locking pins
B00HSRNVRW|5|Perfect fit
B00U6Y0PWS|4|These are quality glasses and a good value.
B00J8DPFKA|1|Too small. Will not come close to fitting my truck. Not as advertised. No wonder this thing was a blow out price of 19.95. It might fit a kids wagon or a Tonka truck. I have an expensive rag now.
B009B1007C|5|Does its job, and looks nice while doing it... though still dunno why it came with a ziptie.....
B00AQWF4HQ|5|Looks awesome on our rzr xp900
B00C3AIOTY|5|Great quality much more stiff then I thought I expected they would be rubberised and soft but really good for the price if you go rally racing or just live on a gravel road it's great helps lessen rocks being kicked up no scratching your family or friends cars
B000WJ75FC|5|Works great! Not a problem yet
B001CHWLES|2|only one remote and no way to know if a &#34;universal&#34; will work so if you loose it or it fails you end up with a useless alarm
B005HJ5SG0|5|Priced well, looked good and worked well with the water pump pulley I purchased at the same time.  Was happy with both pulleys.
B00KTIUG5C|5|These work perfect. No problems instructions that they came with were clear.
B005HMOSSG|5|Love the lighting. I was able to fit all 11 in 2007 Honda Odyssey. They missed the installation tool but refunded me for that. So the customer service is awesome.
B002P3KJLU|5|Product as described and works great......
B00KTHVE72|5|Works real good and the rubber push bottoms came with it.
B000CEE62W|5|This works great. You can definitely feel it when you drive over it. I think it works well.
B000BYB5A4|4|These guys were lickety split on their delivery. A definite must for car part purchases.
B000C9LQSO|5|I have know overheating problems, and it was an exact fit.
B00JH2GMMC|5|Good
B001P0ZA86|5|Confused about whether your vehicle is wired for trailer brakes?  It doesn't matter anymore.  This controller works wirelessly and flawlessly.  Worth every cent.
B00BL0PESG|5|Excellent quality, good fit, great price. Living in a &#34;helmet&#34; state, this is perfect. Small frame helmet equates to little mushroom... lol. I am quite happy with this purchse. Only thing I wish is for a quick release snap as opposed to buckle on the chin strap.
B00771YX1C|5|A perfect match, as the original!
B000WJAH5M|1|I noticed a small tear on one end of the 1st grip I tried to install.<br />As careful as I was the product still ripped in half during installation.<br />$$$$$ right out the window.<br />If you have to stretch this over ANYTHING on the end of your handlebar you should consider an alternative product.
B00L3O9OQS|5|Easy to use, great pruduct. Makes for a very nice end product.
B000A8JNF0|5|Works Great.
B00JIEX722|5|JDM doesn't disappoint!!!! Im telling you these LEDs are worth every single penny. If you really want to get them, what are you waiting for!!!
B00L6XCK44|5|Great key! Worked perfectly for my 2009 Pontiac Vibe.
B00VXG4ZI8|5|Nice
B00ACX8WNW|5|great travel coffee mug
B00NF1RQQ2|5|Arrived timely and looks excellent
B0002JN2EU|5|Works great it does the job honda generator is running great saved me a repair bill
B00GJMQESU|3|The jacket has small red strap loops inside the jacket sleeves to retain the liner, one of the loops was not attached to the jacket, so the liner would not stay with the jacket when you take the jacket off. I did not have the time to wait to send it back so I sewed it back on and it should be ok.<br /> It just kind of made me made I had to do it.<br />It seems like a nice heavy duty jacket & the Large size is ok I am 6ft - 1 , about 185 lbs, little small but ok.
B000WJBLDE|5|Received quickly, it is well built and works GREAT! Should last my Grandson's and I for many years to come.
B000C8ZGPE|5|Great product as, works as stated no regrets will recommend.
B00JG8IMM0|5|This is a GREAT Tire Cover, just be sure to buy from the right seller. ANY cover shipped from China or ANY other country is not made in the US and is a fake. I had to return a few Chinese covers before spending the money for THIS cover, save the time and effort and buy American the first time. This is a lifetime cover. The piping on the edge makes such a difference and from what I am told protects the stitching from UV deterioration. I have seen a few factory Honda covers with exposed stitching fall apart at the top where the sun beats down on it.. Protect the US economy BUY AMERICAN !
B007WMH0ZC|5|Arrived on time. Good price. Works great in my car. Works 100% as described.
B005J94L0C|5|Fits perfectly, I just wish it folded instead of rolling up.
B00EL37R8U|5|After reading reviews of these lights being hard to install I wasn't sure if I made the right decision in buying these. My husband found that by using a needle nose players made installing a snap. Love the brightness in our motor home with these lights. Can't wait to get the rest in to install in the rest of the RV.
B00CASDZKC|5|works great
B007ZGBLNW|2|yellow look to them fill with water
B001PYG8FQ|5|it was just what i need  ,,and  fast shipping
B002MAMBDU|3|This was my first time ever using a clay bar, so I didn't really know what to expect.<br /><br />I have a 2013 Kia Forte5 with 20,000 miles - it's been hand washed every 6 weeks ish, never professionally detailed and only gets driven a few times a week. I've never waxed it, this clay bar was in preparation to do so.<br /><br />I picked Chemical Guys clay based partly on reviews, partly on their passion for detailing and partly because they have so many informative videos; I wanted to be a supporter. I also wanted to do a lot of prep work so I watched a handful of videos, read a handful of blogs, forums, reviews and then went to work washing the car prior to using this clay.<br /><br />I like this product, but I'm very disappointed that it's labeled incorrectly. It does NOT remove tree sap, which was in part why I purchased it. There are a total of 4 tree sap spots on the Kia and I tried it first on the oldest spot of tree sap; 4 weeks ish and I used the clay lube liberally and rubbed for 5 minutes and didn't see any difference. I then moved to the most fresh spot and did the same thing; rubbed for 5 minutes and nothing happened.<br /><br />I also tried it on a couple bigger bug splatter spots and that also did nothing. Perhaps made the bug spot smoother, but it did not remove it.<br /><br />It did however remove the smaller pin head size bumps on the hood; road debris, small bugs and tar - I'm just guessing. It wasn't a complete waste of money and I MAY consider trying the medium size clay bar in the future. What else is disappointing is I used their helpful guide to decide which clay bar would be the best and medium wasn't the case because my car has zero oxidation and is so new.
B007UTORTE|4|Product as described it was just took longer than stated to receive.
B000C9LR1A|5|Perfect fit 2007 Mazdaspeed3.
B00QW3KIHO|5|So far it's been a great part
B006KZALGC|4|Looks amazing exactly what was pictured. Super easy to change.
B002EP2SGS|5|Excellent product.Exact fit.Good price.
B005ESU2DS|5|It fets perfect no complains great product
B00KL4ZCY4|3|Very attractive on the car but they are not chrome, imported and cheaply made. Once on the car I was pleased but questioned the false advertisement and excessive pricing. Amazon did a good job in handling my issues with this product
B002ECKZ7U|1|Came shattered. Was just in an envelope. So not suprised.
B0028OV6WW|5|This is the best product online for your automobile engine. I have been using this product for 20 years plus on all my vehicles.  It really extends the performance on my car.
B00029WR8C|5|Well pleased,Fast service.
B000NOUQRA|5|Handy, sturdy, compact, nice white color. Great item, easy to use, smooth folding action.
B0093A9ST2|2|Very noisey at high speed, one already came loose after 5,000 miles. U
B005H8YCQI|4|Very good for the price
B00UY6WFLM|5|Well made and fits perfectly in 2014 RAV4 XLE. This should have been included with the car, but I'm glad it was at least available aftermarket.
B00CG354AK|5|bought several and they all work perfectly for autos that are rarely driven.  Works on 6volt batteries as well as 12 volt
B0039K0L8E|5|Some of these ford trucks need them because they wern't installed in them. makes it easier to align.
B002HXQDCC|5|Very easy to install & enjoy the American flag w/Made in USA logo.
B00M5YC7Q4|5|Fantastic quality!
B000J19XSA|5|:)
B001LHVOVK|4|Very easy to use.  Definitely worth the money to have one of these on hand.  Saved the time it would take to go to a garage or parts store to get the same results.  Diagnosed my problem correctly.
B000BQSIWK|5|There is a short in my car that no one can find.  It's killed my battery several times.  This charger is very easy to use.  It's charged my battery and has switched into trickle (maintainer) mode.  So I have a fully charged battery when I need it.
B004J9FAYE|5|Wiring shown does NOT come with canister. I installed part quickly on gas tank. Didn't need to purchase additional wiring. Reset computer and dash light is out. Dealer wants lots of $. DIY.
B00080QHMM|5|finally, an accurate tire gauge.
B00KY0B4FQ|5|Superior priced item!!! perfect timing to find this kind of deal!!!
B00NLMH37W|2|Haven't put this covert on my car yet,  but the case is not add described. It's a cheaper made case with strings not a handle. Probably not a good cover for this price.
B008VB1A5E|5|Good buy
B002H9CMCQ|5|very pleased
B000B8J6PG|5|Great price for the 2 items.
B00P2OVEVI|2|Within minutes of installation the power light in the on/off switch stopped working. If I had purchased it at a local store I would have returned the item, but I did not want the hassle of shipping back & forth, etc., so I decided to settle for the defective, though somewhat functional item.
B001DKM4PU|1|didn't have the one that I need
B004R32TG4|5|install was easy
B001C20T9C|5|Works Great. Good price.
B0022ZJTKS|5|Super handy for motorcycle riding and works great.

B005HJL94A|5|A+
B00NHBYOA6|2|does not work well
B006VGI47I|4|nice racks. A bit loud sometimes when there is no weight on them.
B0026PGN3A|5|I have a 98 Rav 4, and this is a good fit. Product was delivered right on time. Great value!
B00P73KWIU|1|Would not fit a Honda 250 Recon. Had to purchase additional hardware to mount it. I would have come out cheaper and better buying one from the dealership and let then install it. Would not recommend this product.
B00V6ETXDE|2|I bought the on of these it it was delivered upside down. I put it on my car anyway and now I am proudly proclaiming that Jesus died on the cross for my sins. His sacrifice is the only acceptable atonement for my iniquities. Jesus saves.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Great product!  I bought to clean a white leather purse that had gotten generally grungy.  It also had blue stains from my dark wash jeans.  It cleaned both off beautifully.  I've also used on the car seats and cleaned very nicely.
B001AD6T24|5|Nice bag! Fits stuff nicely. It's a great everyday rider bag.
B001OD2OCY|5|IF YOUR CHANGING FROM A POINT DISTRIBUTOR TO HEI THIS PRODUCT IS A MUST A SIMPLE HOOK UP FROM YOUR TACH AND IGNITION POWER WIRES AND YOUR IN BUSINESS
B004UR33C6|5|Adds much needed stability when you ride with a heavy payload.
B001N0E16A|5|Exactly as described!!
B006B6WXJ8|1|Did not fit my 2014 Chevrolet Equinox. It cost almost as much as I paid for it to return it.
B00FBPWO0S|4|My wife and I really like our outdoor camper mat. It looks fantastic and it really brings together the outdoor space under the awning of our travel trailer. The mat is relatively easy to clean--we just rinse it with a hose and let it sun-dry for a short while before packing it away. It's also very lightweight and easy to move around.<br /><br />The cons are two-fold, though neither is so significant that it would prevent me from recommending it to a friend:<br />1) the material is not exactly super-strong; I definitely don't expect it to hold together well near the stakes<br />2) the carrying bag is really not well-made and began to tear a little after the first use--you NEED the carrying bag to move and store the mat, so I will probably just make my own using the same dimensions but stronger fabric<br /><br />Overall, very good purchase and very reasonably priced. Would recommend this item to frequent RV campers.
B00BI3JK9K|5|Every part was in the package and it works great and the price was better than all the places i called around at.
B000C16XL2|5|Great price and great quality
B000EQW1AC|5|Works exactly as hoped for - hopefully it lasts a long time!
B000B5QFE4|4|These work very well I have a 2013 Ford F 150 and they fit well
B000FGI6E6|5|My 3rd one and the only filter I use for the HD due to K&N reputation and availability on Amazon for half the dealer price.  The only issue with these is the hex on the filter never works to remove it after 5K miles.  I use a strap filter wrench and works great.
B0066QVM3Q|5|Excellent choice
B005493JQE|5|The product works as advertised.  Bought it again.
B00RORVU5Q|5|They work great
B0091PAFMI|5|thanks
B000TYTZXU|5|Exactly as decribed. Could not find locally
B0002SA22Q|5|Shipped in a very timely fashion and even had a couple extra pieces of hardware just incase. They made it easy to choose the right header for what I needed.
B00N3446NC|2|I received the cross bars promptly; installation was easy. The crossbars also look good on the car.<br /><br /> I noted, however, I had to check the fittings periodically and noted the screws for the clamps had to be tightened every time. Last week I received 4 lower replacement clamps with instructions to replace the existing clamps with the &#34;improved, safer&#34; ones. The original installation instructions I received documented the tightening screws from the lower clamps should not be removed when installing the crossbars. How the manufacturer expected anyone to install the lower clamps, therefore, without unscrewing them completely remains a mystery to me.<br /><br />In addition, when  I removed the cross bars from my vehicle and attempted to re-install them with the &#34;improved&#34; lower clamps I  discovered the tightening screws did not properly fit into the new lower clamps. Result: the crossbars are now sitting in my garage because I can't re-install them with the new, improved, supposedly safer lower clamps!
B00PT18QAQ|5|Bought this tire pressure gauge to replace a $5 Harbor Freight gauge that I just didn't trust.  This gauge works well - I've tested it against a few professional level shop gauges and it reads the same PSI.  It also seems like it should be durable, much more so than the plastic digital gauges that are currently in vogue.  The button on the side controls a one-way valve, keeping pressure in the gauge until you press the button.  This allows for reading the value on the gauge after removal from the tire, a bonus for my motorcycle where space is very cramped.<br /><br />To top it off, I emailed back some quick feedback (more about marketing than the product at hand) in response to the typical automated &#34;How was our service&#34; aka &#34;please rate us 5 stars&#34; emails, and was surprised to get back a well written response from the founder of the company.  Refreshing to see that my purchase is helping a small business, and *very* refreshing to have the company actually care about your feedback instead of trying to game the Amazon ranking system like a lot of the shadier companies do.  I hope the company does well and expands so I can buy more of their products.
B005ESEU8G|4|Looks great on my 2012 dodge ram hemi
B0126YHPQY|5|[[VIDEOID:7bac8f7b875e32d2b2cb24ed823bd7b5]] All of the instructions for this item are in Chinese, but it is $10 less expensive than similar replacement lights.<br /><br />Please note: I received this product for free for my honest and unbiased feedback.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Great lights for the price!!!
B00L45Z5CS|5|Great!  Keeps thinks cold (and probably hot) all day!
B00IPS4APU|3|I did everything by the book. It made a difference but not as much as I expected. If it doesn't spread I'll be satisfied
B009VYWIMO|1|THIS BACK UP CAMERA WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME.  THE PICTURE BLINKS OFF AND ON AND SOME TIMES GOES COMPLETELY OFF.  THE VIEW IS MISS LEADING AS TO WHAT IS BEHIND YOU AND HOW CLOSE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO MY WORST ENEMY.
B001UROUJO|3|Little small for men's gloves.
B005F9IZTO|5|Fantastic FP Sensor for a V70R. Direct fit.
B00QMPYA26|5|Use it a lot
B00756NNN8|4|Ok
B00WJI7DFQ|5|Love this! Looks great on my JK!
B004D5SUIC|5|I can't say whether this is a superior oil filter or not but i can say Amazon shipped it quickly and I of course paired it with the extended performance oil when i did my oil change on my G37, best price I have found also. Will order again.
B00BTLEIIY|1|So far, I am extremely unhappy.  I received an email saying my payment declined. Without question, I put another payment through as I have never had a problem with an Amazon account. The next day I was checking my account and noticed I got hit twice for the seats.  One set arrived Monday.I picked them up.  The front seats fit great. Back seat is completely the wrong seat cover.  The second set said has arrived. I will check tomorrow to see if perhaps the back seat fits, then we will begin to try to get one or both of these returned if neither back seat fits.  I hope this isn't as painful as it feels it's going to be.  I'm a little angry that I was told my payment declined only to get hit twice,  I want an explanation. I'm not used to being taken like this on Amazon.
B00MFRT92Q|3|Horrible Customer service , Good product
B00NVL4E70|5|What an awesome sticker !<br />It looks very durable , and seems to be made from some type of metallic material similar to the smaller dye cut metal sticker / badges , only bigger .  going to put in the car some day [ if I ever get around to washing it first 1 ] . I really like this one .
B00UW4DNEO|5|This product is one of the best buy I have done not only help me to jump my car it have diferent functions for<br />The now days of tecnology thanks for this wonderfull product.
B00HQZELAW|1|2014 Durango Limited; I purchased them and was excited to install them. The installation instructions were easy, but they do not fit! The front covers will require you to shim out the rims 1/4&#34; for clearance.  On rear wheels the small clips that holds the covers to the calibers was to wide to fit in the caliber grove. I placed three phone calls to MGP and never got a call back from there technical support help line.  So I sent them back.....Mike
B007UTN60K|3|Product works ok... did not get the grit in the corners of wheels or in lug nut cavities. The mini brush was too big to fit in my BMW wheel, M wheels, style 135. I will try this product on my other cars when needed.
B0012ILZAS|5|Well worth the money<br />Look and sound great<br />Very easy install
B00HCON824|5|All ok
B000GV7LPK|5|SOUNDS GREAT EASY TO INSTALL WORTH THE MONEY
B00B4YCTWI|5|Looks great. Good quality.
B0094BNRA6|5|good buy.
B005DLLVWC|5|Great fit and well made. It makes it so much easier to move my 6' x 12' utility trailer. Very pleased.
B006XG6K2M|5|These replaced my OEM driving lights on my motorcycle because of a stone hole in one of the originals. Very powerful and well focused.
B0054SLURK|5|Fits perfectly in the cup holders. High quality plastic and hinge. Amazing how the prices fluctuate between vendors and websites.  Dealer wanted $75!! Wish the item had an option for a light.
B0016I8R2S|5|Fit perfectly
B004UJ3IAQ|5|Great value wench.  Mounted perfectly to the front of my F-150.  Haven't really had to use it yet except for just testing it out to make sure it works, but everything looks and sounds good so far.
B00EUUNJRM|5|Brighter than expected for a great price
B00M7DFU8A|5|good deal
B005CXL1TO|5|It's a Yamaha part. Just like the original.
B00F9RNIPI|4|clumsy clamps, but i purchased it for the cable portion anyway. as advertised
B000E28C7M|5|Easy on, easy off!
B00E0GLKZO|5|These are wicked cool.  I have several chrome attachments to my 2005 Black PT Cruiser...this adds even more...I know that no one else where I live has them...
B009YP1PVA|5|Great shape.. Looked just like the picture!
B005QZQVR0|5|awasome
B00RBMN5CA|4|Great unit and works as advertised
B003TUQLY2|5|Works well, soon to purchase more.
B00P0UOHI6|4|Difficult to put back seat covers on. Other than that very satisfied with product.
B00KSXWDIQ|5|Awesome
B000XEGEWG|5|Great product.  Just moved and have used it a lot
B00UJET7LA|4|You can tell this product is made out of country with multiple spelling and grammar issues on the package. The product itself is the coolest thing I've ever installed on my vehicle. I spent probably 20 minutes getting the install right, since the sensor to turn off the light while the door is closed was not usually in the spot that said sensor. However, I love this product and all of my friends want these now too
B000C9GLIO|5|Perfect fit!
B002HVF7IU|5|Exactly right fit; easy installation and works great.  What more could we ask for?
B001A3CPSQ|5|Great Replacement for my VTX .
B000JFHMVQ|3|Unfortunately only worth 3 stars due to two complaints. First being that a piece of plastic shouldn't cost nearly as much. Second is a very annoying design flaw that you can't see in the pictures. The drain spout will only fit down inside wide-mouth oil containers. In other words, the spout will not fit down inside other regular automotive containers for draining; such as wiper fluid bottles, transmission fluid bottles, or coolant/antifreeze jugs. You can only store your used oil back into the containers it comes out of, which isn't very good if you have a 5qt jug and the car your changing only takes 4qts oil
B00JLJK55G|5|Fast delivery, great fit.
B006DB9EB6|3|My first one burned up within 5 hours of use, but to be fair, we may have been overworking it.  This type of generator has a built in inverter that is not really designed to work with an A/C unit (even a low voltage one) because A/C units put a heavy load on the gene with its constant cycling up and down.  We learned this after our brand new one burned up.<br /><br />We contacted the company and they sent us a replacement right away, so I give them credit for that.<br /><br />We ended up buying a different generator with an alternator instead of build in Inverter and it has no problems running the small A/C unit without bogging down the generator as this Extreme Max did.  The replacement ExtMax unit is now being used for running steady load items while camping and works just fine for that.
B000C2OFCU|5|fast service and great price
B000J2LVYI|5|Cheap!
B0009IQZJS|5|as advertised
B007SNFENK|5|we love this stuff. Since it is all natural it doesn't affect my breathing.
B002YZAYNW|5|Got what I wanted! Boricua!
B00H6ETIUQ|1|Had to use duct tape to fit<br />.
B000994BUM|3|The paint is a great dark red. The reason for three stars is the paint came out of the can in big drops. Might have just been that can because the blue paint of same brand came out better.
B00QGPKCJ2|5|Excellent coverage and durability. Had several sets of weatherbeaters in past vehicles and highly recommend.
B00412UIPA|1|Easy to do .... However the instructions should be included with the kit.<br />I had to search U tube for video how its done
B00PTQOF4W|5|It worked well and was very easy to install. Rocker switch fit well in FJ Cruiser with little modification.
B00I8IPCM2|5|Fit my 2014 Ford Fusion (1.5L ecoboost) just fine.<br /><br />Watch the youtube video for instructions on how to install. If you have 30 minutes and basic tools, you'll be fine to do this after work.
B001F0MACK|4|havent used it yet ,but will probably do the job fine.
B00R8LF6TO|1|The Napa Auto Parts were selling it at $150, so I took a gamble on this product. Bought the Radiator ($54.18) from Imperial Auto Parts, saved about $100 and was happy with the deal. Paid the mechanic $120 for a labor and Anti-freeze ($16.49 x 2 = $33.00). I spent total of $207.18 at first.<br />After couple of days, I started having trouble with my transmission. So, I went to my mechanic and found out that there was intense leakage of Transmission oil from the nut that connects to the Radiator. The mechanic tried to tighten the bolt, but it didn’t seem to solve the problem. So, I had to buy an entire new Radiator ASAP. The mechanic said, my transmission could break and result in so much more if I keep on driving my car. So, I bought a new Radiator from Napa for $150, Anti-freeze for $16.49 x 2 = $33.00, Transmission Oil for $6.50 x 4 = $26.00 and paid the mechanic $120 for labor again.<br />If I had bought the Radiator from Napa Auto Parts in a first place, I could have saved about $250. I ended up paying the twice for Anti-freeze, transmission oil, and the labor. Plus, I had to go to the body shop and the auto parts store 2 more times. Ruined my entire weekend and I would not recommend this product to any friend. Now, I am $250 poorer college student.
B00G3EAGKG|5|Great Product.
B005U30NTU|4|A little hard to put on, but they work well.  They are very low profile to the roof, so my thule rack clamps just barely touch the roof of my car.  I needed every inch to make it inside my garage with the carrier on top.
B00VAVT7LG|5|As advertised,  great deal
B000EVYGZA|5|Great for basic home projects/troubleshooting.
B0009N4F8Q|4|These are plastic. Don't be fooled. They are better looking than standard though. Over all I am satisfied.
B00MRNXDF2|5|Great product
B000E2CVI8|5|Great filter, keeps oil cleaner than I expected after a 3000 mile check in my 04 Honda VTX1300.  Will definitely be using these again.
B0009IBJAS|5|very good
B000S2SKIY|5|Awesome!  Exactly what we needed to fix our Chevy!
B00CBWLZPO|5|perfect fit.
B00QN399Y6|5|Great product met my expectations
B008I2H55U|5|Love it. Beast stuff on the market outperforms every other lubricant I have used.
B008LZ8DDM|4|Great!
B004INCV5C|4|Just As Described
B00IO32U7G|4|Product arrived in a timely manner and exactly as described and was installed on my car in mere seconds.
B00Q0CN89C|5|Works perfectly on front OEM control arms/wishbone for 2007 Mazdaspeed3. Just bang old one out and bang this one in with large socket and a small sledge hammer.
B0091OE6K6|1|Totally useless. I put it on as directed, but it doesn't hold the shoulder belt. The clip part is not engineered to grab the shoulder belt firmly, so it slips back and doesn't do the job..
B000CEE62W|5|Works really well for parking in tight spots.  Can roll over the first bump to know when to stop.
B00EDWF1BE|5|Fits and looks great. Thank you!
B00C1YI2XA|5|Good
B00MVMRS6O|4|Easy install and a lot of light<br />Currently just using 2 of them for back up lights for a pickup<br />But I'll be using the rest of them soon
B001KO15UY|5|Excellent.
B005SWEYWA|4|I wish they would have given me something to fasten to the front some time place to much weight on back of it and it pops up other then that I love it
B00070FJL8|4|i must have misunderstood, i thought there were two frames.  Still, excellent service and product.
B001MXX5D8|1|This thing left water marks all over my brand new car, worst Spray Wax I have used. As another reviewer stated this literally is scented water no wonder it dries up as water would, leaving water marks all over the car.<br />After an hour of buffing I still have some water marks left and no wax feel to the paint.<br />Mother's should be ashamed to sell such a product.
B005948U7C|5|Great.
B008YS3V88|5|OK
B00HJEGQQ2|5|Works just as advertised!!!
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Works great. I like that the head swivels to make it easier to fit on the tire steam. Compared it to a .01psi calibrated gauge and it's right on!
B002E2UK8O|3|I do not recommend these for your &#34;everyday driver&#34; at all. They might seem cool and make your car look cool, however they are not effective at all. Save yourself some time and get silverstar ultras and it will not look stupid and actually be effective
B00ONFPN3M|3|I wish it was bigger
B00U9111F8|2|Looked good but too fragile. Tore really quickly.
B000LS7JH8|3|ok
B00NMRT83S|5|Outstanding Product.
B0012GTVVA|5|Easy install. Works well.
B006GJYOL0|5|Outstanding Product... Awesome
B00666F994|5|Great product, does the job filtering some light, not to the point of harming your sight of the bumps.
B001NAUAXI|5|As advertised good value, prompt delivery
B005PZMLDY|1|don't like it
B00C8TDGX4|5|Looks awesome on my 2014 Kawaskai Teryx4!
B007V2DCI2|5|Awesome piece. Way better than the junk you buy at local stores. Fits my STI hatch perfect and has drastically reduced the interior temp. This is a must have in the Florida heat if you park your car outside regularly.
B00BBE7KAM|5|Great product
B0091OE6K6|2|Doesn't work very well, seat belt twists and is uncomfortable after attaching.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great on my 2009 VW GTI. Zero complaints
B00KO29ZF0|5|Becouse tis is our product
B002GTKAHQ|2|After five months on the motorcycle one of the mirrors has come loose by the two screws on the back of the mirror. These screws cannot be tightened. So it is only a matter of time before the mirror falls off. Buy them if you only want to use them for a limited time.
B00TQHHCTK|4|Works as expected.
B009LAUY1A|5|saves room and weight in the trunk. switching balls is fast and easy.
B00W9OQW7U|5|Great product and very bright.
B0022ZQZMS|5|Great

B003SS62PS|4|works well.
B00IIO42S6|5|Outstanding Product.
B00N42FZY2|1|Very cheaply made
B00753S8CC|5|Looks awesome! Delivery was ugh quicker than I expected!!
B0054SAL3E|5|It comes as expected
B00VBZI4YM|5|Nice slick look...not too slammed,but definitely not riding high off the ground. Get's you the look you want,while remaining functional. I did notice a lower center of gravity & more steer/break responsiveness. fits perfectly as well.
B008BT432I|4|Not exactly what i expected.<br />Thin plastic.<br />Didn't fit but I'm keeping it for project backups
B004ZF3KXA|5|Easy install on my f150 05 looks great and very bright 12k is no purple but a blue white looks like the 8k most people have just brighter love the color matches my led bar and pods. Most places charge 200 for the lights and install witch took me 30 minutes. Only problem was did not get any zip ties or so on but that no big deal so 5 star product
B000C84740|5|Great gas cap. Remedied my check engine light.
B0091YXN46|5|Great Looking Product “We will do business again”  “Thank You”
B00R131QRU|5|Fit 13 charger rt perfect.  Changes entire look if car
B00FY7M38Q|5|excellent
B005QAK9XW|5|GOOD
B008Y8MXQY|5|Just what I ordered and a great price.
B000B6BJVC|4|Good
B000I28MKU|5|Must have for auto interior panel removal
B0057B53J0|1|Mirror vibrates when driving<br />Wired wrong inside the mirror<br />Company didn't refund money as stated in there email
B000GVGPVG|5|Awesome however I did not see the smaller print that indicated the Muffler was black and not Crome like in the advertised picture .. I would have paid the extra to get the crome can .. Other then that everything was simply &#34;bolt on&#34;, very easy . One more thing, you need to buy new copper rings , they do not come with the kit.. Overall I would definitely recommend to a friend. Very happy with this exhaust!
B0002SRF4O|5|Saved me from pulling the cyl head, so far so good.
B0058VFNHQ|5|Excellent produce.  Would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade or just get rid of the cloudy factory ones after years of sun damage.  Easy install and plenty of youtube videos on how to install but it was so easy snap snap your done. Unless your adding not replacing than you will need some wiring skills but it comes with everything you need down to the switch.
B00AC5S23U|3|They are adorable and fun to have. Although one of the heads already fell off.
B003SY3D4A|5|Great fit and function
B00ZR3MPC6|5|Easy to install looks nice! Big help and a must have aide for my family when they are trying to climb onto my Jeep since it does have a lift kit.
B002L1ESZY|1|The picture is of a round port gasket was shipped a square port with the same part#  and with prime it still took five days. Photo is incorrect... Waste of time.
B001O13BLO|5|Used these for my 2008 Scion tC hatch. My wife and I replaced both sides in about 10 minutes. Super easy to install. That was about 6 months ago and they're still holding up great. Definitely recommend. *UPDATE* its been almost a year and these guys are still holding up like brand new. Awesome product.
B002G3OG6S|5|Great product
B00HJE5GI6|4|They work well and fit perfectly.  However they do still cause a code every once in awhile in my 2014 VW Sportwagen.  Also they are not nearly as bright as other LED tail lights I have purchased.  They are probably only about 1/3 as bright as the LED lights I put in my 68 Cougar, but then again those are white LEDs not red.  Overall pretty happy with them.
B00K1C1WC2|5|They do exactly what they are suppose to do.
B00JA1VEAK|5|Great
B008D5TTBU|2|As far as delivery goes, great service!!. As far as product, not good from my personal experience.  Installed them on aftermarket headlight.. dual halo with projector lenses.  Melted the lens to some degree.  Pulled them off to look at the bulb and the greyish paint on tip of bulb was all flaky and had come off.  Don't think they are supposed to do that or not but still ended up messing up my two week old lights.
B00F2QPTK8|5|Fits really well.
B0022ZAFOC|5|Works great
B00BGZ1VJC|5|This key fob cover fits perfectly over your key fob for a 2004 4Runner. It adds protection, but a bit of bulk, to your key fob.<br /><br />I would and do recommend this product.
B000IDUW5C|4|Hopefully I'll never have to use it
B0082365AQ|3|ok
B00F8LEB9W|5|Exactly as the OEM and overall easy to install.
B00IGZQGAY|5|We are a Subaru family recently bought these for a 2010 Legacy. Fits Great!
B000EVU8X4|4|Great gauge.<br /><br />All the necessary fitting were included and it worked right out of the box. I had to use the bigger size thread adapter that was included with the gauge.<br /><br />Liquid or tape thread seal should be used when installing to prevent any coolant leaks<br /><br />The capillary tube was just about long enough to get from the original water temperature port to inside the cabin.<br /><br />Takes a few minutes for the gauge to register a reading as to be expected with a mechanical gauge.<br /><br />The backlight is more to the top of the gauge, but provides sufficient illumination to the entire face. The bulb is easily interchangeable with a LED (not included) if you need more brightness.<br /><br />I recommend using a gauge pod if you want to mount this on your A-pillar or dashboard as the gauge body is white and visible behind the crude mounting bracket that is provided.
B005M186I0|5|Used for my bimini to so could move and adjust wth putting screws into the boat.  Volla, it works great.  Also use them for pole  holders.
B001BCLZGY|1|I does not fit a 2006 Pontiac g6 like it said it did on the site, when you check to see if it fits it said it did but it does not
B00XWCM4HK|1|Didn't work as advertised.  Sitting on a shelf somewhere in a warehouse.
B00FP0G5EK|1|Works good if you leave the car off turn. turn the car on then it doesn't work I guess it  not for my car or is not made for the hid kit
B002XM59F4|4|We broke one of these in our RV.  Works perfectly!
B005F5L7PW|5|Perfect fit for my 13 charger rt plus factory 19&#34; wheels.  Good Mopar quality as always
B00UCTYC12|5|These are the best I have used. They stand up to our hot days, well worth the extra $.
B00BFE5OBK|3|i am not sure yet
B00LG07MZE|1|I should have listened to the review that mentioned the fabric on the sides. Thanks to that,  there's no way for it to stay up unless I paperclip the flimsy bits to the rear view mirror. Such a disappointment.
B000C8ZJII|5|Great price, fixed the problem!
B00B0C1D62|1|I have a 2004 Cadillac CTS V and purchased the POWER STOP K288126 kit for the front and rear. I read all the reviews before purchase and they seemed too have been all good. Well - I installed the brake kits in Nov. 2014. So I have had plenty of time to test the brake system. If you are not familiar with a CTS-V they come from the factory with a performance Brembo Brake System and i have always used factory brakes from the dealer. The reason for putting the power stop system was that I was unable to get factory brake system – it was on back order and I could not wait. Rotors and pads I had hard braking from day 1 so I gave it time hoping brakes would break in.  But that never happened -here are the concerns. 1. Almost impossible to stop when it rains or brakes get wet. 2. Gives my ABS system a fit. 3. My whole car vibrates when I have to stop fast to the point that it feel like the heads are going to pop out and that’s on a dry day.<br /> I spoke with a factory rep. before I purchased and he told me they were getting great results with POWER STOP K288126 on the CTS-V . Now anytime I brake the vibration is terrible. So I replaced all of my bushings with REVSHIFT performance kit and vibration is still there. Today I will be replacing the pads with new ones - I just can’t  take it any longer. Oh I have been repairing cars for 45 years so I have the experience. I will follow up with another review to let you know how the new pads do.
B000E4NKEK|5|just as described, cheap
B00HASW274|5|Fit my 2015 Civic great.  Much better than the carpet mats.
B00HV0ZOZ8|5|Matched up great
B0009JKGJW|5|One of the best items to put in your gas or oil for cleaning your engine. It has reduced an engine tick problem I was having.
B001FI06MS|5|Very good quality a pleasant transaction
B00U6SCQ4Y|5|Love them! Thank you SOOO much! Will definitely recommend & buy from again! A+++
B000S34PBY|5|Bought these a few months ago for my new Hyundai Santa Fe.........still holding strong and working perfectly. Would recommend
B000KZ1XVK|3|Work just fine
B00MY4CR7Y|5|Excellent However the sensor's cable is too short
B007ZK55DK|5|Excellent just as described. Shipped fast!
B006P88TJ0|5|EXCELLENT QUALITY AND DETAIL
B009DK7YQQ|5|Looks awesome! Easy to install! Much more comfortable for the ol' elbow
B00J2CI5EU|5|great product
B005TTZPUM|5|Very happy with this track bar. I installed this on my Jeep ZJ with a 4 inch lift. The bar seems very heavy duty, and I like using this way more than the extended track bar bracket I used to be using.
B000O3IAC8|5|Excelente seller
B00VSQAQC2|5|Great tool! Used it to turn off codes and pass smog check first try.
B000TDOHPM|1|Lasted for 2 rides on a Polaris 500 then became loose. Nut assembly that goes inside the handlebar then stripped when I attempted to tighten it. Not built tough enough for ATV use.
B0031HEIDY|5|Fit on my Highlander better than the factory originals. Also, they're brighter than the originals. Standard  mechanics' practice it to replace both at the same time for even lighting and if one failed, the other will fail soon. Be sure to wear glove when installing because any fingerprint on the glass will cause very quick burnout.
B009F94AZ8|4|Cute little item. Fits right in my saddle bag. I'll update after I have had to, unfortunately, use it.
B00IWPUROE|5|Great!
B00HHGTCF4|4|Perfect fit..
B00HNMLQAG|5|Great!
B00FEXE0BI|5|Brilliant.  Great finish, nice packaging, came with mounting hardware. Best part of my front end rebuild.
B000C57M8Q|1|This shock started leaking after just a few months of normal street use.  And, it is specified by Monroe as fitting my vehicle. In addition, the Monroe specs and advertisement for these shocks make them sound stupendous. However, these shocks are the worse shocks I've ever used in my life! I definitely didn't notice any improvement in my ride after installation as I normally do with new shocks.  Perhaps it's got something to do with where they're being made now... Anyway, I'm going back to Gabriel shocks which always lasted for many years on the same application and worked great.
B00HVHN2CI|5|Same product you get from the dealership but at a much better price. I know where to go if I need any more remote protectors.
B00AZ18RLI|1|This item did not fit my car at all. I thought it would fit my it didnt.
B007IVRBD8|5|Experience was great
B009YJGKW0|1|This item does not fit my car at all. Sucks I was expecting it would brighten up my interior but it couldn't because it didn't fit.
B0072J7B68|5|Love'em
B00YI3IGA6|5|Really reduce the sunlight in the vehicle and they fit great.  Easy to put on and take off!
B009656KE0|4|They fit and do the job. What more can you ask for.
B007IVRU0W|5|Exact match.
B004NBDLYE|5|Works better than the original!
B00CASDZKC|5|Great buy!!!
B004QJXX00|3|Look great and easy to install.  Contacted the company regarding a loose bolt that I cannot tighten and this issue has not been addressed as of yet...otherwise a 5 star product!  PS - you do see the install bolts on the bottom of the sidebars, so I will probably paint them black once I know if I am keeping them.
B0045LXI0Y|4|works, simple install
B004GCSF4G|5|Perfect  replacement. Easy installation.
B0094A6UUQ|5|Surprisinlgy high quality.
B000BZJEWE|5|Perfect fit , good price. I will use it for next replacement job.
B000IYBEQ2|5|Awesome price on these and they are quality wires!
B000KSTFJO|4|These are great entry level guns.  I did have a problem with the full size HVLP when I tried to change the tip the first time.  Upon trying to return the 1.3mm to the gun I found the threads were stripped.  The 1.8 would still retain but not the 1.3.  Called customer service and they're shipping me a new one, no questions asked.  I was worried I had walked into a bad situation when I saw the gun had failed so quickly but the great customer service has turned me around.<br />I've also had minor issues with leaks on the cups.<br />So, as other have already stated, great entry level guns but the quality control is a little loose.  For the price I think these are a great deal.
B005QZMW00|5|Works Great.  Fit my 2008 GMC yukon XL.  The dealership wanted to charge 800 to replace these plus parts.
B000C9HOTO|2|Wrong part, vehicle match said it was correct, returned.
B001KO0QD6|3|Worked great, but it broke in half after using is only for a small amount of time.
B00N07JXXU|5|Love it fits perfect
B00865TJC6|3|I read the reviews before i bought the glasses and others stated they do not get as dark as needed, that is true. I wish they would get darker in thesunlight, but they fit my face good, except my eyelashes touch the lens even when I dont have mascara on.
B007JAFP6S|5|Perfect
B00RLUO5N0|5|They fit perfect  ! they are great.
B008F8Q8DM|5|Works great took about 10 minutes to install.
B005RJ3GBE|3|Looks much better than my old wore out original,  but shell doesn't fit exact.
B00T36QHUO|5|Excellent produce - well worth the expense, shipped right away as promised ....
B00DZ3M66U|5|AA++
B00SCY3HP6|5|Great light
B00XXD32R4|5|great idea for using when servicing on rack or using floor jack...always in place....
B000CO82A4|4|Nice product, as advertised!
B00QPQD1NQ|1|This is the worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. Wall charger does not fit the base unit maybe the connector is wrong....good luck no response to phone calls or emails. This product is a rip ..good luck
B005LYNORQ|4|Very nice jacket, initial impression is that it is very well made.  Jacket length, chest and waist fit great, but the sleeves must be made for people that never lifted more than two pounds in their life.  The sleeves are SKINNY, even adjusted out to their maximum.
B0049NMDPO|1|181572L Lh strut spring hitting each other everytime going over a bump i got it exchanged still doing same nocking sound left hand spring design is bad.
B0001WW37U|5|It does exactly what it says it will. Fits 10 CDs perfectly with room. The elastic going over the visor is a bit tight but it holds itself in place perfectly.
B00FLY938K|2|This is GIGANTIC in size, and I cannot imagine this mounted on the forks of your bike.
B002G29LLE|4|I love these!!! Have used these all summer on our cars and they hold up pretty well.
B00LGLM2K8|5|Love it.
B001OBIUV0|5|The caliper is a solid rebuild. There was a little spot on this caliper that had rubbed away and you could see where the rust had been sanded and refinished. In addition the spot where the ebrake mounts was compressed a little and I had to pry and compress to get the ebrake mounted properly. This does not at all take away from the quality as everything else seemed solid and well built. I was in between on giving this 4 or 5 stars, but I leaned towards 5 due to all the nice positives that the caliper had.<br /><br />The caliper itself is not like the picture displayed, but that is not a bad thing. The paint is silver and it is treated to prevent corrosion. If you wanted to paint your calipers a different color, the silver is better than black obviously. On it's own you can hardly notice it so that's not very important. The caliper also comes with all the bolts and mounting clips you will need. Seeing as I was putting this on a 24 year old car, it was nice to not have to reuse any of the rusted pieces.The banjo bolt inlet (the banjo bolt was not included, instead it was plugged with a plastic stopper) even comes with two new copper washers which is a very nice plus since these get very dirty from years of use.<br /><br />This caliper really helped me fix my rear brakes. My ebrake line is a lot more responsive when engaging and the car definitely locks into place much better.
B0000AY2BR|5|This receiver hitch cover fit my 2011 Subaru Outback CURT hitch perfectly and the foam spacer allows the cover and receiver hitch holes to line up  without any gap. Plugged it in and now enjoy a more secure feeling that the drivers behind me have an extra brake light coming at them.
B000JZBHLM|4|it is what it is
B0068NJ2NY|5|sticks well
B00TEABVQY|5|Perfect!!!!
B007REJTGI|5|Great product, well made, and I expect it to last a lifetime.
B00BQ9UYA0|5|I didn't even have to help my son install it.
B00OT7IZ0W|2|Entire set only fits rear blinkers, not the front mounts on my 1996 Honda Shadow 1100 :( Otherwise, they are a decent, sturdy set. Great price.
B00SAEP8SW|5|Happy. Concerned may not fit 2015 Mustang... But it does. It Does cover the sensor where it determines day time lights or nightime lights automatically. I just turn lights off or on when I need. Rather have dash protected, Especially In TEXAS.
B00P815M7C|5|Love it.
B00877SL2M|4|Good
B004DRRTLE|5|Excellent product and fast shipping
B000BRCKTG|5|Use it in our RV generator!  It fills the bill as expected.  No reason to use any other brand in my book!  Arrived promptly.  Thanks, Amazon!
B00JBJ3IL4|1|After the first car wash and a humid day they start getting moisture inside the bumper lights, the headlights beam isn't very good.
B003IHKXKY|4|Works great!  Like other reviews have mentioned; this is not weatherproof.  I store my trailer inside, which is helpful.  But of course, pulling it in the rain is a real possibility.  For trailers store outside, or boat trailers where the planned mounting place of the spare could become consistently submerged, I'd consider looking elsewhere.  Though, the price of this is extraordinarily cheap; so replacing it is far from a heartache.<br /><br />I used this to mount an 8&#34; spare tire on the drawbar of my motorcycle cargo trailer (one pulled behind a motorcycle).  It worked just fine.  I did need spacers to make the skinny, small 8&#34; wheel fit snugly, but that's no big deal.  I now have pulled this trailer, with the spare mounted like this, for a little over 1,000 miles at the time of this review; without issue!
B00M5DGZ04|5|As stated
B000C55M1K|3|The boxes were opened and no bushings were included. Shocks are ok otherwise.
B00CHDJ7HU|3|Some of the holes on the replacement part I purchased for inserting fasteners into did not match with the holes on the car's body. Because of this, I was only able to attach the replacement part to the car's body in some sections but not in all sections , leaving the possiblity that the replacement part might fall off the car's body prematurely.
B00T2GT9L4|5|I have not tried to jump start anything yet.  Seems will built
B0086I9GV2|5|Love it and it was delivered before the due date thank you
B00265M9SS|3|Vacuum system leaks and  had to use zip ties on every connection. Vacuum strength is okay container is really small.
B008BZQTJW|5|It looked like an exact replacement and fit perfectly.
B000JZN0SU|4|Great quality,wokk great
B0082LK130|2|Burns like hell makes a big mess
