6305127697|5.0|Primal Fear is my most favorite thriller of all time and we have two wonderfully talented performers, Richard Gere and Edward Norton to thank for that. They really brought these characters to life big time on the screen. Originally they wanted Leonardo DiCaprio for the role of Aaron/Roy Stampler but apparently DiCaprio turned it down and Edward Norton took over the role and I must say he was the best!!! No other actor could have played that role to powerful perfection the way Norton did. Same goes for Richard Gere as big time defense attorney Martin Vail. He was the best for that role too. You could see the chemistry right there between Gere and Norton in that movie. They certainly were \\"A Great Team\\" as Roy puts it at the end of the movie. It certainly was him, boy! It certainly was him!!! And that is the first biggest twist of the movie, when we are lead to believe that Aaron has multiple personality disorder and has the Roy side to him that comes to his rescue whenever Aaron feels threatened. The biggest twist shocker is at the end when we find out that there never was an Aaron side to this criminal and that the Roy side of him existed all along and he faked the multiple personality disorder syndrome to get away with the crime by being declared insane. This was an absolute 10 star well done shocker! I own the movie after seeing it back in 1996 and have enjoyed watching it all these years and still look forward to watching it many more years to come. I hope Edward Norton will do another surprising psycho role like his Aaron Stampler character in the future. His stuttering and acting was indeed priceless and au natural in this flick. A highly recommended numero uno thriller.

B0009R1T7M|1.0|Slightly more \\"umph\\" than the Michigan CD, but still redundant and boring.  A few clever and artistic moments, but not quite an entire album's worth.  Playing a diverse array of instruments doesn't really make the songs any more musical.  Overall, it's still a pleasant sounding and well-produced CD.  Just too many 'da,da,da's, 'oh's, and repetitive chime sounds for me.
141690977X|1.0|This book could be summarized in a sentence (the rest is repetition and fluff): be passive and let the man do everything. If he doesn't do everything and more, he's not that into you. So let it go and wait for the man who will overcome any obstacle (even sexual harassment laws) to get to you.<br /><br />The simplicity of this is the cause of its success. The second cause is that it works. Yes, yes, it works as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Let suppose a man likes a woman but:<br /><br />He is not skillful at recognizing women's cues -> he's not that into you.<br /><br />He is a shy guy -> he's not that into you.<br /><br />He is an intellectual or feminist guy who despises gender roles -> he's not that into you.<br /><br />He loves intelligent women but you haven't had time to show you your intelligent -> he's not that into you.<br /><br />So all these guys will be dismissed without a second thought. The woman is convinced that they were not into her, so it's amazed about how much this approach works. But they are the best partners.<br /><br />(To be fair, there are cases that this approach works: he is not really into you. But generalizing something that works a percentage of cases to a 100% rule is a recipe for disaster).<br /><br />The only guys that love the chase are the macho, hyper-confident guys. That is, the ladies' men. Because a man who is so confident to overcome any obstacle, can do it with you and with lots of other women.<br /><br />So you can end up marrying a ladies men or you can end up lonely because \\"nobody was into me\\". Of course, you can end up happily married with this approach but it's efficacy is very low.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Fans of Renee Olstead's self-titled debut have eagerly waited since 2004 for a follow-up disc. While the intervening years have been frustrating for fans anxious for new music, the resulting album proves worth the wait. Skylark takes all of the elements that made her first disc a success and ups the ante with a great mix of standards and more new compositions that prove to be an even better showcase for Olstead's amazing voice. The up-tempo, David Foster-penned \\"Midnight Man\\" opens the album and then segues to a beautifully rendered cover of the Billie Holiday classic, \\"Lover Man.\\" This is followed by one of my favorite songs ever, \\"Stars Fell On Alabama,\\" and I love this arrangement. For the opening bars, Olstead's voice accompanies a tinny piano and is overlaid with scratches that sound like you're listening to an old record - this nostalgic touch seamlessly gives way to the \\"modern\\" sound for the rest of the cut. There's a little Andrews Sisters's vibe to the arrangements and background vocals on \\"Thanks For the Boogie Ride\\" and \\"Ain't We Got Fun\\" (the latter was featured in the film [[ASIN:B000WGVEAC Kit Kittredge - An American Girl]]). Kudos to the producers and arrangers for crafting such an accessible collection of jazz/pop music with several neat little nods to the musical roots of the standards - it's a great balance of nostalgia with a modern pop sensibility (should definitely appeal to Michael Buble fans!). Chris Botti's incomparable trumpet playing is featured on \\"When I Fall In Love.\\" Honestly I'm a little over this song, but between Botti's always-welcome presence and Renee's pitch-perfect delivery, I can't seriously complain. Olstead co-wrote three songs for this album, proving she has an equal flair for writing as well as song delivery. \\"Midnight In Austin Texas\\" is a funky, rockabilly-tinged nod to her home state. The other two cuts - the bluesy \\"Nothing But the Blame\\" and the exquisite ballad \\"Hold Me Now\\" -blend perfectly with the standards. \\"Hold Me Now\\" is my favorite cut on the disc - Olstead wrings every last drop of emotion out of the lyrics with a maturity that belies the fact she's not yet twenty.  With Skylark Renee Olstead proves she's a triple singing-acting-writing threat whose star is on the rise. I only hope it doesn't take five more years for the next chapter of her musical journey to see the light.Me Now\\" is my favorite cut on the disc - Olstead wrings every last drop of emotion out of the lyrics with a maturity that belies the fact she's not yet twenty.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Christian Bale \\"is\\" BATMAN !!!  ---  He does a MOST EXCELLENT job reproducing the \\"dark\\" figure all red-blooded American boys know so well from comic books.<br /><br />Again [no exposed cow-teats, to sexually arouse and harass children, adolescents and immature adults] I liked NOT being distracted by sleazy hos displaying their wears & tears !!!<br /><br />Epilog:<br />Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr. EXCELLENT.<br />Batman, Christian Bale, EXCELLENT.<br />Hulk, Eric Bana, EXCELLENT [but too much CGI].
B000G759LW|4.0|First off, I know that Christina gets a lot of flack for trying to hard to be original or authentic, but in an industry where so many artists with lesser (or non-exsistant) talent put little effort into repetitive disposable hits, I think she should get credit for trying to do something innovative. Did she succeed? Not entirely, but she gets an A+ for effort from me.    What I do not like about the album:  - Some of the songs do sound like she is trying to hard to recapture the sound of old jazz or blues records (ie. the cracking of the turntable which is heard a lot throughout the 2-disc epic) and the track \\"Back in the Day\\" makes it various that this album is attempt to do so by mentioning a slew of soul artists. But like I said, at least she has a vision.  - She also over sings a lot on some songs, when it really isn't necessary. She proves on the amazing \\"Save Me From Myself\\" that less is more and that her voice can sound beautiful when she doesn't belt.  - The CD is way too long. There are about 5 songs on the first disc that are filler. If she condensed both discs onto 1 disc, this album would be incredible. Just for fun, here's what my ideal track listing would be:    1. Enter the Circus  2. Welcome  3. Makes Me Wanna Pray  4. I Got Trouble  5. Aint No Other Man  6. Save Me from Myself  7. Understand  8. I Got Trouble  9. Slow Down Baby  10. F.U.S.S.  11. Candyman  12. Hurt  13. Mercy on Me  14. Oh Mother  15. The Right Man      What I like:  - The second CD is very solid. The melodies are great and I like that it's all real instruments. My personal favorites are \\"Welcome\\", \\"Mercy On Me\\" and the aforementioned \\"Save Me From Myself\\".  - I really like the use of some of the samples on the first disc, particularly on the smash \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", and \\"Slow Down Baby\\". They're very funky and the songs sound fresh because the originals were not instantly recognizable songs to most people.  - Although she does over-use her voice at times, she sounds amazing forthe most part and she sings with a lot of emotion.  - The album doesn't sound like any other pop album of the last few years and there is a timeless quality to a lot of the tunes, so I think this album will not sound dated in 10 years.    Overall, this is a great album, and depute a few flaws, it is worth the money. Give it a chance.
B001P22HK8|5.0|This just may be the most engrossing book I've read in years, as well as the most frightening.  When placed in the context of current events (a potentially collapsing world economy) one sees a glimpse of what might be the cause.  By this I don't mean the specific plot devices but rather the fact that an economy built on technology can be very easily manipulated by a small group to the detriment of the majority.  Couple this with the privatization of key governmental functions, as portrayed in this book (a process already well under way), and you have the formula for disaster.  I thank Mr, Suarez for bringing this issue to the fore in an entertaining and well constructed novel.  As previously mentioned by other reviewers the price originally gave me pause to reconsider.  I'm very glad I made the leap.  It is well worth your money and your time.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Once upon a time, Green Day was the voice of a generation. They wrote about touchy political issues without restraint. Their music was pure punk rock. Then, with the release of \\"American Idiot\\", Green Day had officially sold out. Record sales and fame became more important than music and self-expression. All of the sudden, the group's biggest fans became preppy high school girls, and their music basically became a part of the money hungry pop genre.

B001KL3GY0|3.0|Franz Ferdinand have finally hit a bit of a speed bump with their third album, \\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand\\".  But thankfully, it's not a major one.  After two stellar albums full of dance rock gems, the guys come up just a bit short.  The latest album finds the group incorporating synthesizers into their sound and going for more of a disco feel at times.  There are also no songs in this set as great as Take Me Out or Do You Want To, the hits from their previous efforts.  Still, there's plenty to like.  Ulysees and No You Girls are both fine singles that prove the band can still write catchy pop/rock/dance songs.  The album closes with Katherine Kiss Me, an acoustic gem that leaves no doubt as to how talented these guys really are.  The only reason this album doesn't make it to a 4 star rating and rank as one of the early year's best, is the album version of Lucid Dreams.  The single that was released was patented Franz Ferdinand:  danceable beat, catchy chours, etc.  But the version included here is a complete butchering.  The song sounds completely different and is stretched out to nearly 8 minutes thanks to some unnecessary synth noise that drones on for the last few minutes.  It's nearly unbearable.  Maybe the band is just trying to experiment a bit.  If that's their goal, they should wander further into the acoustic realm of Katherine Kiss Me.  More songs like that one could really push these guys into interesting new territory.  Until then, we'll have to settle for their effortless dance rock.
B001GCUNVW|5.0|I must admit I detest watching wrestling, such abhorrent unnecessary violence seems pointless and neither do I care for Mickey Rourke... however, after watching the trailer I was intrigued and saw the movie. It had it's moments of brutality where I needed to close my eyes and hold my ears but the heart of the movie is the touching human aspect and is remarkably poignant.  There is something so captivating about the performance that I seemed to lose track of Mickey Rourke's character THE RAM and instead became mesmerized by Mickey Rourke himself. The reviewer L.Power writes: The lines between actor and character blur and disappear. The kind of pain you see on Randy's face cannot be pretended. It can only be relived from the actor's parallel experience, which is what makes Rourke's performance so compelling... (Indeed)    Marisa Tomei gave an incredible performance. The synergy between them was wonderful to watch.
B000FGGE7C|5.0|I thought it interesting how the reviews of this movie are almost evenly split.  Loved it, hated it, . . . ehhh it was okay. Interesting to me how 2 butt kicking comic book characters were brought to life in film around the same time.  Aeon Flux and Ultra Violet.  I think that you have to be a fan of comic book reading and science fiction to really appreciate this film for what it is and it doesn't hurt to enjoy girl butt kicking movies, . . .all of which I do.  So of course ask me and I have to say that I found this movie very enjoyable.  Enjoyable enough to add it to my collection.  Mila is very convincing as the comic book character Violet.  She flips, kicks, and twists, . . punches and kills, . . a whole load of people.  The story line was a little all over the place.  I think that it was compromised a little to save time for all the fighting scenes but the fighting scenes, . .boy did I REALLY enjoy the fighting scenes. I thought that they were really well choreographed. I only wish that they showed more on the special features about the fighting scenes.  This movie is apropriately visually stunning and really takes you into the future.  The costumes are AMAZING.  Everything about this movie from costume, to the cars, weapons, architechture, . . exude an almost attainable realisim that we may just very well see in the near future.  Story line wise I would have to say that I liked Aeon Flux better, but visually this movie really rocks and is well worth a look into.  You just have to put on your science fiction thinking cap on and appreciate it for what it is a beautifully put together film that is extremely entertaining.

ADTR DELIVERS AN AWESOME MELODIC ALBUM WITH THE TRADEMARK BRUTAL BREAKDOWNS THAT GETS THE MOSH PIT SHAKING. MOST OF THE SONGS ARE EXTREMELY CATCHY AND MAKE YOU WANT TO SING ALONG BEFORE YOU EVEN KNOW THE WORDS.  THIS ALBUM IS A+++ ALL THE WAY!
B00008972S|5.0|Being in my early 50's in age, and a long-time movie buff; I have always considered West Side Story to be in my top ten all-time favorite movies.  I had previously owned a VCR version of the movie.  After watching it recently, I realized that with the passage of time and usage, that I needed to purchase a DVD version.  Well, Amazon offered the special edition DVD collector's set of West Side.  After watching the movie, and extras that came in the set, all I can say is that the price that I paid for the movie was an outright steal, (and I paid under $26 for the movie, including shipping).     While watching the movie, I remember telling myself \\"Oh, so that is what the movie really looks like\\", (in comparison to my 25 year old VCR tape version that basically had become worn out).  The colors were extremely vivid throughout the movie, (from the outdoor shots, the school dance hall, to the colorful outfits worn by many of the characters).        The hour long extra feature which consisted of interviews with the actors, (conducted in 2001-2002) was filled with nostalgia and information that I, as a film buff especially of this movie, did not know.  Example:  Cast members stated that the late Natalie Wood, (Maria) and Richard Beymer (Tony, Maria's ill-fated lover in the movie) really did NOT get along well during the entire filming process.  One would never had guessed this while watching the two characters interact throughout the movie.      In addition to the movie, and second DVD, (interviews, behind the scenes material, trailers, etc.) one also receives in the set a collector's book which includes the entire movie dialogue, circa 1961 advertisements for the movie, as well as actor, producer, and director's bios.     I have always believed that the theme behind \\"West Side Story\\" will never become outdated - now almost 50 years after the film was released.  The story is about how bigotry and prejudice is ingrained in society.  People who have hatred of other races justbecause of the color of ones skin, (just as occurred in the movie between the Puerto Rican and Caucasian gang members) need to be educated on how their bias and ignorance of others can lead to unneeded tragedy.  In junior high music classes, I remember our teacher devoted class time towards teaching us about \\"West Side Story\\".  This was back in the early 70's.  And, I quite believe that these lectures, now almost 40 years ago, led me to a deeper appreciation and understanding of this all-time classic movie.      5 stars for the movie and the collector's set offered on Amazon.  It should be a requirement in any movie buff's home collection to own this edition of \\"West Side Story\\"!
B000O5AYCA|5.0|Boxer blew me away. The vocals are stronger and more haunting than earlier work. With amazing lyrics this album will have all the hipsters standing at punch tables, losing themselves in the sounds of Boxer through their off-brand MP3 players. If you liked Alligator, you'll like this slightly more polished work. It's a well-rounded album with depth to each song. Best listened to in order, as an entire work.
B001MW0IY8|5.0|Antony Hegarty came to my attention at a tribute Leonard Cohen concert and I did not know what to make of him -he just looked like this large woman with a voice of an angel. His voice can be described as smooth and brittle as porcelain. You could call him Jazz-Avante gard, channelling Marlene Dietrich- whatever, he is probably the most exciting thing out there at the moment. With three albums out there plus the disco one he did he has a body of work worth investigating- if he keeps at this rate he will one day ranked with Bessie, Billie,Ella and Nina this is how good he is.

B001EO2UJK|4.0|I bought this package mainly for the surround mixes. I must admit I was a little suprised at some stuff. A few times I heard what appeared to be a \\"dubbed in\\" vocal. But all in all the sound was GREAT! 4 stars because in a few instances Peter sounded like he had a lisp...I had to reduce the treble a tad to get rid of this.   The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway has been my favorite album since I first heard it in early 1975. Alas, I never saw the concert! The slide show from the concert was surprising and well done. Had a little nudity which I think Genesis could have done without(I reallize the album has erotic content, though.   A few highlites...  From Nursery Cryme...The Musical Box \\"A\\": Seven Stones \\"A+\\"    From Foxtrot...Time Table \\"A+\\":  Suppers Ready \\"A\\"  From Selling England By The Pound...The Cinema Show \\"A++\\" (I think it is the best the set has! The keyboard was brought out in places that reminded me of some of the times I heard it live with Phil as the front man!)   A few places on bass pedals had distortion which seemed out of place. Maybe if I had better equipment...   All in all I loved the surround mixes...

1591840562|4.0|\\"Books are good enough in their own way, but they are a mighty bloodless substitute for living\\" as Robert Louis Stevenson is quoted in this book. OK. True. So Guy Kawasaki has written a bloodless substitute (book) about business life! This was a random reading selection acquired while in an airport (and an unusual choice for me in that I'm an experienced tech company executive and I tend to avoid anything with the word \\"Guide\\" in a title). My net: This book is essentially a bunch of practical conversations with an experienced entrepreneur. It provides you several clever points of view and a couple of smiles. I would pay particular attention to his discussions around these topics.     1. His thoughts on describing and presenting your company and its plans to investors (net: tell new lies because investors already know the old ones),   2. His advice on patents (net: don't bet your business on them ... customers don't buy patents)  3. His thoughts on defining value for customers (net: it's harder when you are a solution looking for a customer problem).      Kawasaki tends to focus his advice around what gets qualitative business outcomes and less on process and form.  I consider this a virtue of the book. Read (or scan) this book if you are seeking outside-in \\"been there done that\\" perspectives. The book is an especially useful challenge to your day-to-day mindset ... especially if you're a person overly absorbed in the minutiae of operating a small business.
0030565812|5.0|Great book. The book inspires you to fight for your own causes, no matter how they compare in intensity to Nelson's monsterous battle. A great description of a man that went from a tiny village to being an inspirational leader of the world. A beautiful piece of history!
1402217722|3.0|*****Light SPOILERS, but nothing unexpected for a Heyer book******    I became a Heyer fanatic in my late teens, about thirty years ago, but I'm not sure this is one I read at the time.  (It seemed a bit familiar, but since Heyer recycles characters and plot elements, I can't be certain one way or the other.)  I am purchasing the new editions as they come out (replacing my ragged old mass markets), and I found this one an engaging but not compelling read.      Early Heyer tends to be more sexually frank than later Heyer, but that is still pretty much on the circumspect side for most turn-of-the-millennium tastes.  A book where the hero and heroine marry early on, but then must still find their way to the actual in-love-happier-ever-after ending presents unique problems:  even those not of prurient bent may find it odd that Lord Rule has never kissed Horry \\"like that\\" until the book's ending.  Has the marriage perhaps not even been consummated--maybe because Rule finds his bride just SO young and wants to woo her first?  Since the reader knows much more about what is going on than Horry does, and since Heyer is fairly straightforward about Rule's relationship with his mistress, the vagueness about the marriage unnecessarily obscures the nature of Rule's and Horry's relationship.    As to the characters, I enjoyed both Rule and Horry, without finding either notably memorable.  I liked the variety of Horry's personality:  she is clever but unworldly, and enjoys cutting a figure in the ton.  I also really liked how well Rule understood and appreciated Horry, and the depth of his trust in her.  (He trusts her because he understands her.)  My favorite parts of the book dealt with Horry's brother and his spectacularly easygoing approach to life, whether engaged in a duel or told there's been a murder.  Heyer has a special gift for comic relief characters such as this.  Where the book fails is in some of the plotting, especially later in the book, where the ending is only held off by some foolish actions on Horry's part.  (But at least someone is around to tell her she's being a fool.)  Some of these plot elements, particularly those involving playacting on Rule's part, require a suspension of disbelief similar to that in watching a Shakespeare play--only this isn't Shakespeare!  All told, the book is well worth reading, because most Heyer books are, but it is not her best.    I complained in another review about the publisher putting Regency covers on Heyer's Georgian romances, so props to them for using a Georgian cover on this one.

B000J103WK|5.0|This is one of the best concerts I have seen. It is a hugely popular DVD, so I have been wondering why it is not out on Blu-Ray. The HD-DVD format is dead. My HD player is broken, out of warranty, and I don't want to spend the money on repair or to buy a new one. I also have a Blu-Ray player. I hope the companies involved are planning on releasing this on Blu-Ray at some point soon. I don't know why they wouldn't - it seems to me it would be quite profitable.
B001ANOU7U|5.0|one of my favorite movies unable to view on my dvd player and unable to return or exchange.
031606792X|5.0|I really enjoyed the Twilight series. Twilight made me feel like i was 17 again.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***    \\"Dark\\" is right: this is a dark movie with dark people and dark buildings where there is no daylight until the very end of the story. It's a combination sci-fi/film noir and takes place back in the 1940s or '50s in some big city.    A quick note on the Blu-Ray: it's 15 minutes longer with mostly developmental scenes from the early part of the movie added.  The transfer is excellent, too, so it is definitely worth the purchase.    Story-wise, it's the usual alien nonsense but with some interesting twists you certainly haven't seen in other movies, like the city re-shapes itself every night.    Because of that, the set designs and special effect are unique. I know of no other movie, before or since (it's been 10 years), which shows a city with buildings expanding, rising, falling, etc. The visuals throughout this movie are fabulous and the sounds that go with it are good, too.    There is very little profanity in this movie but it's still a somewhat ugly, sordid story.  Yet - at least with me - it draws you back for multiple viewings. There is a magnetism to this film. This is the only video I got rid of twice and re-acquired it both times....and then bought it a third time when this expanded Blu-Ray disc came out....and I'm glad I did. This is one more fascinating films of past decade.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|The DVD was shipped well & was perfect. Played well & no scratches. Good shipper..fast & packed well. Will purchase from them again if they have what I am looking for.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|First off, this was a more complete version of the DVD which came out earlier. In this edition, about a half-hour of new material was added to the disc (and what was shown at the theaters.) Most reviews I read said it elevated this film from \\"fair at best\\" to \\"good.\\" I agree. It made the movie much, much better.    Yeah, it's more far-fetched than the other superhero movies because here, the hero is a blind guy who, because of his blindness, has extraordinary hearing powers along with the rest of the usual Batman/Spiderman-type athletic skills.    As in most of the Batman films, this is a dark film. I think it would have been better had it lightened up a bit with a few jokes and a more wholesome female lead. Jennifer Garner is another one of these latter-day skinny chicks who is made to be tough-looking, tough-talking and tough-fighting.However, I will say she comes across a little more likable on the extended version. One more negative: the fight scenes go on a tad too long and are outlandish.    On the positive side, this may be the best-sounding DVD I own, at least up to ones I had heard up until this came out in January of 2005. Since the hero (Ben Affleck) has super hearing, this is emphasized in this movie and so you, if you have a 5.1 surround system, hear sounds from all speakers at almost times. It's awesome!    Affleck, meanwhile, is likable as the superhero and I liked the message he gives at the end about shunning revenge. Wow, you don't hear that much in movies. Kudos, too, to villains' Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. They are fun to watch, especially Farrell.    So, if this superhero film interests you, make sure you get the \\"Director's Cut\\" edition. It's far better than the original, and, I believe, the same price.
0790734850|4.0|Screenwriters, Brian Helgeland along with Curtis Hanson wrote a tight and compelling story about two L.A. cops, during the 1950s, who investigate a shooting.  Based on the novel by James Elroy, the twists and turns in this movie are cleverly intertwined     Outstanding performances are given by Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito.  I particularly liked Pearce for his understated, but compelling performance.  We could see his mind working under a stone faced wooden facade.      Director Curtis Hanson clearly captured the era of the time and took us along moment by moment as the suspense unraveled.
0788805843|4.0|The only problem with the movie is the sound is messed for the first 5 minutes.  It's really quite then all of a sudden it's really loud.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Amazing footage, especially in HD.  There's over 10 hours of stunning video covering a diverse array of land, sea, and wild-life.  Absolutely incredible imagery.
031606792X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It is a real page-turner.  I am sad that I have now read all of the Twilight books.  This left me thirsty for more.(No pun intended)  I think that Stephanie Meyer is a wonderful writer and I look forward to more books by this author.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|[[ASIN:B000QXDEDG 300 (Full Screen Edition)]]    Hmmmm What can I say about this movie without having to write a whole page about it. This movie is simply put as a symphony of violence. This movie is packed with tons of actions. It also has a great story behind and it's true too. I might add this movie has some inaccuracy's , but who really cares about the inaccuracy when this movie is so awesome. Anyways you should buy it you won't regret it.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|great product - the completion of the Matrix trilogy which was an amazing piece of science fiction.  can't have the other two movies without this one too !
B001N26GFC|5.0|This is all about Poppy, played by Sally Hawkins.  Single in London.  Positive, cheerful, and generally embodies the title of the movie.  Every situation is to be faced with good spirit, a light attitude, and cheer.    At the beginning it seems that she will overrun a challenge like a tank running over a building in a WW II flick.  Smiles.  Banter.  Humor.  Irrepressible.  Even when alone.    The challenges grow.  A problem student.  A vagrant in a deserted part of town.  A doctor visit.  A dance instructor with issues.    And then the new champion for Driving Instructor From Satan, played by Eddie Marsan.  These scenes are classics.  As in many movies confrontation is important to good comedy or drama.  The theater I saw this in was laughing its collective heads off.  The driving lessons make me smile even as I type this.    How Poppy reacts to each challenge - and how others react to Poppy - is the core of this movie.  The plot is mostly a string of episodes.  Mike Leigh does an outstanding job directing, finding a second level to each situation.  Funny and happy.  But also thoughtful and a little gritty.    Sally Hawkins should be up for an Oscar in 2009, but that is a whole other discussion.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I'd seen The Dark Knight, but when I got the Blu-Ray copy of the movie, I was blown away.  This was my first Blu-Ray movie I've gotten and couldn't believe the difference.  I think for most movies, I would stick with the regular DVD versions, but for movies like Dark Knight, the Blu-Ray version is the way to go.  Gotham city came to life when panning around, the people looked much more vibrant.  I had to tell people at work about it and actually brought a couple over to see the difference.
1582701709|1.0|The real secret is that \\"The Secret\\" is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read.  It's incredibly cheesy with graphics, icons, quotes, and fancy paper, and it is largely lacking in content.  The book is written as if based on science, but it is factually inaccurate.  I think Byrne's point about the value of positive thinking (i.e. positive thinking improves health and happiness) is important, but there are dozens of books that do a better job of conveying this notion.  I believe in the power of thought (though not in the \\"Genie\\" of the universe), but if I did not, I doubt this book would have convinced me.  \\"The Secret\\" repeats itself, adding quotations from people who repeat themselves, and there is almost no specific evidence or anecdote to support its claims.  Ironically (or not), Byrne's best support for her thesis is that she believed she could become rich, and she did -- by selling way too many copies of a lousy book.
0385338732|2.0|I usually like all of her books but this one was especially boring and formulaic.  It was extremely predictable and I was not entertained by it.  It was more a waste of my time.   Too bad, because I like her other books.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Dark Knight is a great movie! I received this dvd within 2 weeks of online purchase. It was in mint condition, and I couldn't be more satisfied.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I loved these shows ever since I watched them when they were first run 43 years ago. Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine then what effects(let alone HD picture quality) would be possible 40 years later, but now I know. I was frankly shocked at the improved picture quality when my local station broadcast these remastered shows recently in HD with the new SFX scenes included. It's probably what watching the original film print projected on a screen was like when they were first shot.   But as much as I loved TOS, I realized even then that some of the SFX were simply crude looking and not what they could be. This remastered set completes Gene Roddenberry's original vision of what the show could be, and I'm sure he would be pleased with the final result. I know I am.  I sincerely hope this set is eventually offered in BluRay so my ST TOS collection can finally be complete.
0440237688|5.0|Even though this book is considered a novel for younger adults, I think that it is great for any age. Very thought-provoking and inspiring, this book reminds us of the importance of being an individual and standing up for your beliefs. It's also gives a different perspective and appreciation for the simple things in life that you don't think about. I DEFINITELY recommend it!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The movie was cast perfectly. It was if the script was tailor-made for each character's actor. The swashbuckling Robin Hood (Errol Flynn), the beautiful Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland), the evil Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone), and the tyrannical Prince John (Claude Rains). Veteran character actors are abundant and wonderful in this picture. Alan Hale (Little John), Eugene Pallette (Friar Tuck), and Una O'Connor (Bess) stand out in their performances.    The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene. The viewer is constantly entertained and never bored. The action sequences are outstanding. The climatic sword fight between Flynn and Rathbone was choreographed exceptionally. Both actors were well-skilled swordsmen which added to the realism of the fight.    No CGI here! Those wonderful scenes with large crowds are real costumed extras. The sets are story-like in appearance. This was a $2 million budgeted movie (a record for the industry at that time) and it showed in the overall quality of this picture.    The Technicolor process was vivid and visually stunning. The score written by Erich Wolfgang Korngold was classic.    This was one of the most well made and entertaining movies of all-time.

B0000AKP2J|4.0|Earthling was released in 1997 and showcases a strong influence of elctronica. Earthling contained such hits as \\"I'm Afraid of Americans\\", \\"Little Wonder\\" and \\"Telling Lies\\" . The cd booklet has Bowie in a union jack inspired coat the rest of the booklet is really od and confusing. In fact I do not know how to explain it. 4/5.
0788811355|2.0|Movie started out great, got me excited, the first 30 minutes was good. Then all of the sudden, boring and trite plot and subplot making me want to walk out of the movie all together.
031606792X|2.0|Worst book of all four.  It was so thrown together.  The bit at the end with Edward and Bella's baby and Jacob is beyond STUPID.  I couldn't even finish the book I was so disappointed in the way it was thrown together just to get the series to an end.  It was really too bad for a series that had so much potential.  What a waste.....
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|There were parts like the beginning that were quite good, but as the movie lingered on, I got the idea that something was missing, that somewhere along the way they could not afford, or did not put the time into making this a James Bond Masterpiece; far from that and lacking the old James Bond charm of the old movies, and incomprehensible and poor special effects in parts especially when matched up against some of the 007 capers in the past. Ending almost incomprehensible and appears they lacked money to give the special effects am used to, but still worth seeing as it beats most of the garbage in the theatre now-a-days. I never knew missing M, could ruin this series so badly, what a shame.
1590171993|5.0|I was so mezmerized by this book. When I began reading I couldn't understand why the introduction discussed the plot nearly from begining to end. I stopped reading it because I thought it was going to give the book away. Little did I know that I could have known every detail about the plot of the book and it would still not have given away a thing. The plot as you might tell to a friend in summary, is not that interesting. Its the way in which the story is told, the language Williams uses, and beauty and heroism of the characters that make this story so amazing. As soon as I was done I wanted to start over. I worried that I hadn't paid enough attention in the begining before I had realized how special this book was. At the end I felt inspired, affected, and forever touched by this book. It truly is a perfect novel.

0380730367|5.0|Mr. Lehane is one of my favorite writers as he can tell a story with sizzle and suspense. He paints his characters such that you feel like you know them, feel their emotions, and causes you to have a definite feeling about each one. He is one of the best storytellers out there today and this 5th book in the Patrick Kenzie/Angie Gennaro series grabs your attention and keeps it until the last page.<br /><br />Patrick, a PI, is surprised when he reads about the suicide of a young woman that hired him six months ago when she was being stalked. This young lady was the epitome of the innocent, naive, sweet girl next door and now she has jumped naked from the 24th story of the Custom House Tower in Boston. She had left him a message about a month after he quickly handled the \\"stalker\\" problem - he had forgotten to return the call when he arrived back in town. Patrick is curious and started asking questions. Everyone, even her own family says her death was a suicide - that her boyfriend's death, just weeks before, was an unfortunate accident. With no paying client, Patrick starts peeling back the layers of this twisting mystery where nothing is what it seems to be.<br /><br />Author  [[ASIN:0741449102 al-Qaeda Strikes Again]]

B001H5X7JS|4.0|I finally got around to seeing Tropic Thunder, and I'm glad I did.  Though it often borderlines on being excessive, Tropic Thunder is a very, very funny send-up of the Hollywood movie-making process, and is a sheer blast to behold.  Ben Stiller (who also co-writes and directs) stars as fading action star Tugg Speedman, who headlines the cast of big budget Vietnam-era flick.  Along for the ride are actors Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black in a role clearly based on Chris Farley) and multiple award winner Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr in an Oscar nominated role) who is such a deep character actor that he underwent an operation to turn himself black.  That's one of the pleasures of Tropic Thunder: it doesn't care who it offends, and it's all the more glorious for it.  There's so many surprises and off the wall moments that you will be constantly glued to the screen, and the trio of Stiller, Black, and Downey are hysterical.  Also featuring Steve Coogan, Nick Nolte, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, an actually funny Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise in prosthetics as the foul-mouthed producer.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I did not want to like this, but I did.  I didn't start watching the show until this year and was immediately hooked.  The cast is great. The writing is fun and the show never takes itself too seriously.  It is what a comedy is suppossed to be...funny.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Great workout. Be ready to work hard for 30 minutes. Takes a couple of weeks for normal (like me) people to get up to speed but you will lose weight. I have lost 15lbs in 4 weeks. If course, calorie counting helps.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Good music, perfect for the movie and book fans of Twilight. The songs are creative and wonderful for your ears. At first when I received the cd I thought it was mixed with the background music AND songs but it's just musical artist songs and ONE classical piece \\"Bella's Lullaby\\". If you like these bands or this type of music then I recommend this cd.      If you were looking for the background music like I was I recommend you looking for Twilight Soundtrack : the Score. Just came out, and just as good as this cd.
0887307280|5.0|This is a well written book that is a quick and easy read.  It's an eye opener to problems that can severely hurt a business.  I have read the book multiple times and have recommended it to everyone I know who owns a business.  Well worth the money!
0525948023|5.0|This book literally has changed my outlook on life since I first encountered it on a bookstore shelf, long before the Oprah hype, and I am *not* an easy sale when it comes to self-help material. Part of the reason, I think, is it helps to have suffered, odd as that may sound.  The book is easy to read in terms of flow, however, the subject matter is deep and difficult, so you need time to digest every paragraph. Allow yourself that time. I can understand the difficulty people have expressed in reading the material, but as Tolle would likely say, he's describing what best he can, that which cannot be put into words. He can only give us glimpses of what it's like. I suggest you read it once, and just take in the material. If part of it then speaks to some part of you, take a second reading -- this time with notes. You can then refer back to the notes to remind yourself of elements you considered worthy of writing. These are practices for a lifetime.
B000TT1QLE|5.0|This criticizes it is good for BACH'S work played by Angela Weitt: Perfect tempos, perfect interpretation. wonderful cantabiles in the whole work, beautiful rubatos of a nonpareil sweetness. It is noticed that you inspires and the great GOULD. The quality of the sound is good but it should be better, Hyperion should be bought an apparatus of 24bits as harmoniamundi or sony.
0930289234|4.0|I thought that this was great! It definitely follows Moore's style of not just action but being very thought provoking and intense. The art work was well done but the coloring definitely reflected the times that it was created in (too vibrant for my taste). I guess for what the writer wanted to do it maybe was a good idea but I hated the long pages of text which went into explaining some back story. It just completely killed the flow, but I guess it may have worked when it was a single issue comic. The ending is completely unexpected but understandable and I cant imagine it ending any other way.
015206396X|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It was full of twists and turns that I didn't expect. Fantasy readers everywhere should read this book!
B0000C8WYB|3.0|This is a collection of songs that Edith Piaf was famous for, redone with all the splendour of Mireille's studio team. I think her voice is better than Edith, but I find the strong French inflection she uses a little grating. She's tried too hard to sound like Piaf and not her usual self. Still, very nice.
0307265730|5.0|Thought it would be a novel, so disappointed when first story ended.  Lahiri is masterful, either way.
0316113077|1.0|I was very excited about this book before it arrived, I even purchased the other book from this author specializing in kids cakes; I have to say that once I was able to finally read it I was deeply disappointed, the recipes presented are scarce and not accurate, the instructions and step by step guides inexistent, or at least ineffective for novices in cake decoration (I have studied 4 different Chef courses and still find it difficult to follow).  Photographs of finished cakes are quite impressive, but basically there are no photographs for the whole construction and decorating process (which was what I was looking for).  From my personal opinion this book is a wonderful example of what can be accomplished with great marketing strategy, but not necessarily provides anything in terms of learning.
142720599X|5.0|Janet Evanovich has done it again!  This latest edition of her Stephanie Plum novels is witty and well-written, holding your attention from beginning to end.  This time her primary male companion is the elusive Diesel but Joe and Ranger are around, as well.  Adding comedy to the mix is Carl, the monkey, left on Stephanie's doorstep when her owner goes on a honeymoon.  Carl is more human than monkey and adds much to the literary mix.  And I can't forget Lula, everyone's favorite ex-\\"ho\\".  I loved the book and can't wait for the next installment in the Plum saga.
6302517028|5.0|I went to see this back at the moving picture-drome as cinemas were known as in those days,  we ate sweets as popcorn wasn't invented and we had to take a break half way through the film due to a Zeppelin raid.     This is the semi-autobiographical tail of 3 professors who decide to establish a business busting ghosts. Much hilarity ensues. The main thing I took from the film was a need to add Bill Murray to my list of people to model myself on. At the time, this list consisted of one. Hawkeye Pierce from MASH. Dr Venkman made 2 and David Addison (Bruce Willis) from Moonlighting completed this comic triumvirate. Secondly, the idea of adopting science \\"as some sort of dodge or \\"hussle\\" was born. Indeed enough so for me to become a scientist and enjoy some japes of my own. I believe the culmination of my early career was when my boss said \\"I reminder her of Bill Murray\\", in terms of demeanour, not looks I hasten to add. As my boss was entirely devoid of humour, although blonde and attractive, I took this as high praise indeed and a vindication of my decision to enter science for a living. Adam, one of my co-scientists took the idea to the extreme working though a succession of PhD's until I lost touch with him, and as far as I know, he still managed not to enter the real world. \\"Personally, I liked the University,. They gave us money and didn't expect results\\" was what Adam took from the film.     It was on a couple of nights ago, and although I have seen it a dozen times, I still find it a great and enjoyable film. Mind you, the bit at the start when the old lady ghosts turns into a skeleton and frightens the Ghostbusters had me covering my eyes until I was about 35. Really!     Murray is a joy, Dan Ackroyd enthusiastic, Harold Ramis serious, Sigourney Weaver sexy, Rick Moranis manic and hilarious, the bloke from the EPA, totally unrealistic and overly officious, what he really would have done was serve a prohibition notice and seek to bring the establishment into the licensing regime.
B000Z8GZYW|1.0|Sound was completely distorted, such that the background sound overpowered the voices of the main characters - impossible to listen to.
0783233477|4.0|I didn't see this movie when it first came out in the theatres, and wasn't privvy to all the trash-talk about it's initial box-office flop. Came across it while channel-surfing about a year ago, and only caught bits and pieces of it the first few times- but was intrigued enough by what I saw to eventually buy my own copy; I have now watched it through several times in the last year. This being the 454th review of this film on this site, by no means do I figure to offer any amazing new insights for someone who has never seen this under-appreciated movie. But after reading through several of both the one and five-star reviews on this site, I thought I'd add just a few personal observations. To start, it is worth nothing that about 3/4 of the numerous reviews posted here rate MJB as a 5-star movie. The 5% that relegate it to one star all have a central theme: it was too long, too slow, and pretentious.<br /><br />Now I am a contemplative sort at heart, but still also enjoy a good pure-action flick, provided the production values, acting, plot and message are sound. Perhaps because I have been a cancer specialist for the past 23 years, and am witness to Death on a frequent basis (in His more obscure, spiritual form), I think those who are critical of the perceived \\"slowness\\" of this film just aren't catching what I believe must have been the intent of the director: life generally rushes by in the blink of an eye, but when you are confronted with your own imminent mortality, and the pressing reality of the prospect of Oblivion (or at least the end of all you know as real), everything tends to slow down to a snail's-pace. The last days, hours, minutes of one's life are grasped very dearly, and only relinquished with great resignation.<br /><br />The pace, therefore, of MJB I believe to be a purposeful attempt to capture that time warp- those who found this movie slow and pretentious just didn't buy into the attempt. I think many of the 5 star reviewers for this movie obviously did. I did, and can only add that when one's life is \\"flashing before your eyes\\", it actually \\"flashes\\" at a very languid pace. The human spirit holds on as long as it can, to savor what it is about to know no more.<br /><br />I won't comment on all the other aspects of this very-finely crafted movie, except to say that like so many others, I was riveted by Claire Forlani's physical presence: she didn't have to utter a single syllable in this film for me- Beauty beyond description, so much that even Death Himself was caught in her spell. How some reviewers saw Anthony Hopkins' performance in this film disappointing is beyond me: he's the perfect actor to handle the subdued and introspective nature of his character in MJB. Likewise, Brad Pitt does a credible job with a part that must have posed quite the challenge to portray in a believable way, and yet always manage to convey a sense of other-worldliness. The first time I watched MJB I was put-off by his seemingly stilted, robotic mannerisms and monotone speech- but with repeated viewing, it just fits. This guy (Death) doesn't get out much, after all. Also a nice casting choice to make the human form of Death so physically attractive: a subtle reminder that appearances are yet mortal, fleeting, dust in the wind.<br /><br />And the musical score is excellent- purposefully grandiose and sweeping at times, and lyrically subdued, tender, and sad at others. Of course, if you thought the movie slow and pretentious, the score probably also seems melodramatic. To each his own.<br /><br />But I guess to appreciate this movie you just \\"have to be there\\" : facing your own mortality with a guaranteed finality, and even an awareness of what will be your final day, your \\"last rush of time\\".<br /><br />If you are in such a place, or perhaps have faced it with a loved one, this movie will ring absolutely true. Recommended, regardless of all the negative hype over the years, as a lasting testament to Life., and can only add that when one's life is \\"flashing before your eyes\\", it actually \\"flashes\\" at a very languid pace. The human spirit holds on as long as it can, to savor what it is about to know no more.    I won't comment on all the other aspects of this very-finely crafted movie, except to say that like so many others, I was riveted by Claire Forlani's physical presence: she didn't have to utter a single syllable in this film for me- Beauty beyond description, so much that even Death Himself was caught in her spell.

And the musical score is excellent- purposefully grandiose and sweeping at times, and lyrically subdued, tender, and sad at others. Of course, if you thought the movie slow and pretentious, the score probably also seems melodramatic. To each his own.    But I guess to appreciate this movie you just \\"have to be there\\" : facing your own mortality with a guaranteed finality, and even an awareness of what will be your final day, your \\"last rush of time\\".    If you are in such a place, or perhaps have faced it with a loved one, this movie will ring absolutely true. Recommended, regardless of all the negative hype over the years, as a lasting testament to Life.

1401216676|5.0|Its hard not to sound like a fanboy when it comes to reviewing something this Amazing. Alan Moore; who also wrote V for Vendetta, The Watcmen, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, etc., has given a darker than dark scenario for Batman. This graphic novel is definitely not intended for kids. Without giving away so much, this story shows just how brutal the joker can be. This is right up there with Frank Miller's rendition of the dark knight. A must have if you are a fan of the Batman series or Alan Moore's work.
B000PMG16U|5.0|The day a six disc boxed set comes out is the day I buy a blu-ray player.
B001LF4IA6|3.0|I am a devoted Springsteen fan and own [[ASIN:B0000025UW Born in the U.S.A.]], [[ASIN:B0000E1ALR The Essential Bruce Springsteen]], [[ASIN:B000V8I2QU Magic]], and a number of individual songs I've bought on iTunes.  Altogether, I have 82 of the Boss' songs on my iPod, so this review is not coming from somebody who has no appreciation for his music.      I was thoroughly impressed with [[ASIN:B000V8I2QU Magic]] when I bought it a year ago and I was very excited when I heard the news that Bruce would be releasing a new album.  I bought it only a few days after it was released, and I have to say that I am rather disappointed in it.  [[ASIN:B000V8I2QU Magic]] set a high standard for any future work that Bruce released and in my opinion Working on a Dream does not live up to that standard.  Too many of the songs are generic sounding and the lyrics have very little depth (\\"My Lucky Day\\", \\"Working on a Dream\\" & \\"Surprise, Surprise\\").  They don't have the same sort of poetic deep meaning I've come to expect out of Springsteen songs, and they don't even have particularly catchy tunes to make up for it.  I'll agree with a previous reviewer that \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" is one of Bruce's worst songs in years, and \\"Working on a Dream\\" is almost as repetitive.    That's not to say that this album is horrible.  There are certainly some gems mixed in.  The bonus track \\"The Wrestler\\", a song Bruce did for a Mickey Rourke movie that I haven't seen, is an excellent acoustic tune, easily the best on the album.  The opening track, \\"Outlaw Pete\\", is a wild west style ballad.  It's not Thunder Road quality, but it is a very good song.  \\"What Love Can Do\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", \\"Life Itself\\", and \\"Kingdom of Days\\" are some solid upbeat songs.  They don't really compare to songs like \\"Livin' in the Future\\", \\"Radio Nowhere\\" and \\"You'll be Coming Down\\" on [[ASIN:B000V8I2QU Magic]], but they are nothing to sneeze at by any means.    Overall, I would say that this album is average by E Street standards.  I would recommend giving the album a listen if possible before you make a decision on buying it.  If you find yourself impressed with a few songs, but not the album as a whole, you would probably be better off buying those songs on iTunes or Amazon MP3 rather than buying the entire album.
B000001FB6|4.0|having a greatest hits cd already,I checked an album guide of their cds over the years.Perfect strangers got good reviews and I Just FELT it was gonna be a good one so I took a chance-Wow every song was just top notch I think,too bad they couldnt continue to stay together for more!
0385340990|5.0|A delightful book and wonderful way to learn about a remote part of World War II that I never knew about.  All the characters quickly become your great friends.  Their letters are so revealing of their characters.  A brilliant way to communicate a subject.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|I had the original lp after seeing the movie 3 times!I thought it was great and innovative for the band-even though it got tepid reviews-this new expanded set is even more enjoyable with the 6 xtras concert songs.Makes you feel like its the complete show,right there-Its a favorite of mine over the years-No Quarter is magic dreamy-so is the RAin song--love it all!
B00004VW35|4.0|Neil finally goes all the way, putting out a full-on, hardcore country album.  Fantastic stuff, with Waylon and Willie adding to the mix, along with all the studio musicians in Nashville, seemingly.  This album didn't do much when it came out, oddly.  I can only imagine that it had to do with both the lawsuits surrounding this release (Geffen wanted something more commercial), and the fact that while most Neil fans like his countrified folk/pop stuff, they just don't like the real deal.  Pity.  I own all of Neil's albums, and this one always floats around near the top of the pile.
B000002KB8|3.0|This is a fine classic hard rock album, but I have to say, it's a little over-rated as a groundbreaker.  Aside from the title song, the rest of it sounds pretty much like the heavier stuff Cream and Zeppelin had already done.  It's good, but not groundbreaking or particularly original (in fact, some of it sounds downright derivative - not that most great bands didn't steal a riff or lick here and there in their early work).  The title song, however, is an eerie, heavy masterpiece that doesn't sound like anything else I've heard from before that time (although certainly influenced many followers!).    The next album (Paranoid) would be a little more original, but to my ears it's \\"Masters Of Reality\\" and \\"Vol. 4\\" where Sabbath really step into their own sound, and create something special.  So, worth it for the title song alone, or for fans of that jammy, heavy Zep sound but otherwise if you want to check out the roots of metal I'd suggest starting a few albums later. (You might also want to check out an album by Deep Purple called \\"In Rock\\" - also a few albums into that bands career - which certainly owes little to Zep or heavy blues).
B000006Y4E|5.0|Never talk to me about these guys I will never leave you alone about them...they're the best band in the world to me... I will just go ahead and agree with everyone else it is Def Leppard in the RAW and there is not one bad song on here...and along with their 1st record I think Steve really shines the most on this record. Of course he does on every record but I think my favorite riffs as far as these guys are concerned come from On Through The Night and this one. And Rick Allen's drumming is at its most brutal here. But for GODS SAKE THEY'RE NOT HEAVY METAL !!! They may have a foot in metal fine..but they are NOT metal ! HARD ROCK at it's finest...period..Best one ? maybe... Do I recommend it ? DEFINITLEY !!
B001PE26QQ|5.0|Even though I am an instructor of a Wu Tang Kung Fu school, I am quite familiar with Wing Chun. In my view, Donnie Yen plays Ip Man, Bruce Lee's master to perfection. Ip Man's Wing Chun style, with its \\"economy of movement\\" is beautiful and excellent. I have seen several movies by Donnie Yen but he has never played so convincingly and so competently as in this movie. This movie is certainly much superior than Donnie Yen's collections 1 and 2. The storyline is also excellent. Ip Man proves himself continuously as nobel and dignified. He even works as a common laborer when the situation becomes impossibly hard. He becomes angry only when he realises that the Japanese has been murdering his colleagues. He challenged 10 Japanese which he can easily defeat. He even defeated the Japanese champion, General San Po.  He was killed by a gun but he never flinched. Ip Man is larger than life - a true Kung Fu master. If you are a Kung Fu aficionado, watch this movie and you will be raptly entertained. Dr Jusuf Hariman.
B000001F7R|5.0|Leppards first album . . . I love this album like anything they've done there's nothing bad about this album... I wish they would play more of this stuff live...and beginning with this album they need to re-release it remastered maybe some bonous tracks but I think alot of New Age Def Leppard fans might re-discover their fanhood if this were to be re-released now given their excuse for not playing it live is no one really knows about this album...if you like anything else from these guys you definitley need to give this one a shot...cuz this truly was the beginning of the best
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I have always been a drama series kind of girl - Deadwood, Six feet Under, Lost, Desperate Housewives, etc.. I decided to try a comedy series for fun (and wanted an off the wall kind) so I picked this up based on reviews and I was hooked since episode one. I have been a fan of Alyson Hannigan since American Pie and she hasn't let me down. This show is cute and hilarious and time seems to fly when I pop in the disks. I'm glad I purchased this series.
B001DMJ9R4|4.0|I gave this as agift to a friend for his birthday. He lit up right away when the video for Scream came on (there are female dancers for that song), and the overall concert video is pretty cool. The guys in this band really have a sence of humor and their performace reflects that.
0778321606|5.0|Long a fan of Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove series, I decided to try her Blossom Street series and am so glad I did.  The outstanding but unusual relationship she forges with diverse women (done so well in her Thursdays at Eight) is present here.  There may be few surprises, but there is an abundance of warmth and happiness.  Who doesn't need a dose of both now and then?<br /><br />Lydia Hoffman is the main character and it is her opening of a knit shop on Blossom Street that propels the plot.  As a two time cancer survivor, she wants to reaffirm her commitment to living as well as make friends she so desperately needs.  Her first knitting class includes socialite and lonely wife Jacqueline, career woman Carol who struggles with trying to have a baby, and Alix, the rebel without a cause.  These women would never get to know each other in most cases, but amongst the yarn and knitting needles, friendships form and each becomes important in the other's life.<br /><br />Knitters will love the pattern for the baby blanket as well as the warm-hearted quotes about knitters and knitting that introduce each chapter.  But non-knitters like me will be equally captivated by the story and probably want to find the nearest knitting shop in town.
0765350386|5.0|After reading the first 4 epic novels of the Malazan Empire by Stephen Erikson (GREAT!), I decided before the next I would try out a new author.  And who better than the guy chosen to finish the Wheel of Time series.  My decision between Elantris and Mistborn was a hard one, but since the bookstore only had Mistborn, I got that one.  This guy can write his butt off!  The characterizations in his book are so believeable, I found myself saying, \\"NO!\\" and \\"OH HECK!\\"  It's rare to find a good book that brings out emotions in you, like watching a thrilling movie.  But this book draws you in, makes you an observer to the scene, and has you crying out as if you're there.  (Ever watch Wheel of Fortune, know what the phrase is and yell it to the TV screen???)  Yep.  That's what you'll do here.  One of the best, and just bought book 2 yesterday.  Yeah!!!!
B0001932ZA|4.0|THE RUNNING MAN was a precursor to Arnold Schwarzenngger's work in the 1990's (i.e. TOTAL RECALL and TERMINATOR 2). Looking back on the film, it looks low-budget and a little cheesey but it works based on the uncomplicated script, interesting casting, and some tounge-in-cheek dialogue. Based loosely on the novel of Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), the film is somewhat of a commentary of the society and the media(mainly television) and its intrusion and manipulation of the masses. The main plot is participants are forced to escape designated assassins on live tv while the public bets on who is going to oft who. All in the name of tv ratings. Off the bat, the movie was directed by Paul Micheal Glaser of tv's STARSKY & HUTCH fame. Listening to the audio-commentary, Glaser was brought in as a last-minute replacement to direct with only a few days of preparation, so he did a great job under the circumstances. The casting of Richard Dawson as game show host Damon Killian was a stroke of genius based on his stint as an actual game show host on tv's FAMILY FEUD. Many people forget that Dawson was an actor before he was a game show host (i.e. THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE and tv's HOGAN'S HEROES). Dawson/Killian almost steals the movie with a villian to rival Darth Vader. The cameo's are interesting as well. Mick Fleetwood of rock band Fleetwood Mac plays a leader of underground rebels with right-hand-man Dweezel Zappa (who gets to say one of the defining lines near the end of the film). Then there is NFL legend Jim Brown and wrestler Jesse Ventura to round out the casting.  Schwarzenngger plays the patented \\"Schwarzenngger\\" character with comic one liners and action tailored for his persona. The movie has humor, action, well defined characters, and it resonates somewhat of today's reality-based televsion.
630027179X|5.0|All aspects of this film are A+. The casting, the screenplay, the actors and actresses deliver in spades and the special effects are top shelf.  The subplots between Merlin and Arthur's half sister and her son add even more depth to the film. Quest for the Holy Grail? it's here as well. The actor who plays Merlin is also in the Seven Percent Solution playing Sherlock Holmes.
B0010X745K|1.0|If you have a Christian faith, this movie will offend you.  If you have any literary knowledge of the Bible, this movie will offend you.  If you have any common sense, you will find the ending of this movie to be just plain stupid.<br /><br />The writer of the screenplay takes a random hit at the Book of Revelations and the old testament, taking every biblical comment out of context and making a noticeable effort to belittle people of faith.  More and more of the liberal architechs of Gollywood are putting political and religious commentary into their films.  They are doing a grand job of alienating much of their audience -- the people who spend money on their products.<br /><br />This movie could have been really good without of the religious hysteria and the addition of a hero with common sense.<br /><br />Save your money.
B000006TRV|5.0|I've been a Pink Floyd fan for a long time.  I had the Wall album on vinal back when we used this thing called a \\"turn Table\\".  When I wanted to get the CD of the Wall, I knew the best place to start was Amazon.com.  For one thing its only half as much the cost as if it were bought in a store like Best Buy, and the second is trying to find it in a store.  Most stores only stock an older groups greatest hits cd's.  The Wall is one of my favroit Pink floyd albums. So far I've played parts of it every day since I received it.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|This was a return to the fun Stephanie Plum novel.  Recently, I'd gotten tired of the formulaic style, but for some reason Plum Spooky felt very fresh and fun.  Sure, we know that Stephanie will get into trouble and somehow be saved, but she seems a little more savvy in this book.  I loved Carl!
6305212112|4.0|If you want a good cry this one will do it for you.  Get the blankets, the tissues and popcorn and settle in for a good time the movie is well worth it.  Good storyline. You'll laugh and cry, sometimes right after one another.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I bought this dvd for my children ages 9 and 11 years old.  They loved it.  I, personally enjoyed it, too.  The story itself was really nice and the kids in the kids were very talented and did not give up.
031236198X|5.0|If you are proficient in some topic, it is easy to write 400 pages book about it. To make it short and straight to the point, you have to be more than that. But, to make it short, straight to the point and so interesting to read - you really have to be a master.    Kotter condensed his knowledge in easy to read book which you can digest in one afternoon. Absolutely perfect and must have for anybody thinking about change management. I would say - rather read this short book 10 times, than any other 300+ pages book once.    I have never before read such a masterpiece.
1582701709|5.0|I think that despite its hype, this book truly is that good!  I have recommended it to all of my friends and love to read parts over and over again.  It is easy to follow and provides you with some common sense knowledge on how to lead your life in a more positive way.  It does not solve everyone's problems nor reveal the secrets of life, but each person can finish reading this book with a sense of hope and learn at least one new thing to add to his/her life.  No matter what your life situation may be, this book will lead you in the right direction!  In today's world, we could use more optimism!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|MY SON WANTED THIS FOR THE LONGEST TIME. HE IS SO HAPPY WITH IT. GREAT MOVIE.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Yes, the movie is a little too long - and the hardest laughs come in the first 10 minutes - but apart from Robert Downey Jr. doing an awesome job - I thought Tom Cruise stole this movie.<br /><br />Now - I am no Tom Cruise fan whatsoever, perhaps the opposite - but his two 5-minute appearances together with his antics during the closing credits made me watch it over and over with my sides splitting from laughing so hard :)<br /><br />The character is rumored to be based on Ben Stiller's agent. If so, I hope I never meet the guy :))
B000W93CXQ|5.0|this book was one of the best books ive read in my entire life. i never thought that  i would enjoy this book that much. on a scale 1 to 10 i give it a 9 or 10
0375413405|4.0|This volume was purchased as a birthday treat for my daughter who read my original copy as a teenager and almost wore it out. She wishes to re-visit an old favourite and try the recipes. This book is written differently to other cook books with ingredients listed for each stage followed by instructions for each step, then the next group of ingredients. Some recipes seem a little involved, but step by step instructions are excellent  and the end result is traditional cooking at its best.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell makes the compelling observation that unusual success really is a mix of being in the right place at the right time with an element of 'there by the grace of God go I'.  I especially enjoyed his \\"10,000 hour rule.\\"  As an experiment, I calculated the number of hours I invested in the laboratory when I was a research Ph.D. trainee years ago.  From start to finish, the number was 10,400 hours give or take. Remarkable proof of concept, and redefined my definition of an outlier.
031606792X|3.0|After reading the first three books in the series, I was more than a bit tired of the elementary sentence structure, repetitiveness and holes in the story. The teenage angst - I'm not good enough for him - over and over became very boring and every book could have been at least 100 pages shorter without any loss to the story. It also seemed that the author was more worried about the moral negatives of premarital sex than the murder of people or slaughter of wild animals by vampires.   With all of these issues in the first three books, I planned to not read the 4th book. Nevertheless, I found I had to order a copy. It was a quick and fun read.

B001C08RHA|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. brings the Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man to life in this thrilling movie.    Downey stars as Tony Stark, billionaire head of Stark Enterprises.  Taking control of the company after his father's death, Tony, along with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) continue to manufacture different types of military weapons systems.  Their newest system is the Jericho missile, and Tony is on a mission to Afghanistan to show off the system to the military brass.     After the demonstration, Tony hops in a Humvee.  He's talking with the others in the Humvee when suddenly, the convoy comes under fire.  Tony is eventually captured by rebels and hidden away.  He is told that, in order to be released, he must build a Jericho system for the reigning warlord.  However, Tony has something else in mind.  He instead begins construction of an iron suit.  Once completed, Tony blasts his way out of captivity.  He's finally rescued, but he's forced to leave his damaged suit behind.    Upon returning to the U.S., Tony decides to stop all production of military weapons, much to the amazement of his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Obadiah.  Instead, Tony works on perfecting his Iron Man suit.  He even returns to the Middle East to clean up some unfinished business.  Meanwhile, Tony's company has suffered huge monetary losses due to his decision to stop military production.  As it turns out, Obadiah has had secret dealings with the Middle Easterners and is still trying to funnel arms to them.    In the end, Tony discovers that Obadiah has betrayed him and has managed to build his own suit.  There is a huge confrontation between Tony and Obadiah, and only one will survive.    This is an excellent movie.  Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges all give first-rate performances.  The special effects are great, and there's even a little comedy thrown in, too.  I've seen each of the \\"Spiderman\\" and \\"Batman\\" movies, and I'd rate \\"Iron Man\\" as the best of the superhero films.  Highly recommended.
0790729725|4.0|I love Deniro and I think he's a fantastic actor. his movies are all very very good!
B00132D808|2.0|The Good<br />\\"We're So Starving\\" opens the album in grand fashion as it is more or less welcoming you to the show that's about to begin. It's a little tongue-and-cheek in its delivery, and as you will soon hear, thematic like a classic seventies album. \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" has a steady rhythm to it, while \\"She's a Handsome Woman\\" employs a fuzzy riff that recalls rock's early days. The chorus is enhanced by multi-part harmonies. It's not hard to tell by now that Panic at the Disco is drawing a lot of influence from The Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Band. \\"Do You Know What I'm Seeing\\" has a rhythmic ebb and flow that ranges from sad to upbeat. The string section is a nice touch. Acoustic guitars and steady piano set the emotional range for Northern Downpour. Twangy guitar comes in a just the right places.<br /><br />The Bad<br />\\"I Have Friends in Holy Places\\" has a ragtime feel that is just so far out, it ruins the flow of the album. Despite the great press coverage for their debut, Panic at the Disco still has a singer that can barely carry a tune, outside of the typical emo whine.<br /><br />The Verdict<br />For their sophomore effort, Panic at the Disco break away from the up-beat standards of emo rock, for an attempt at a more mature, pop-oriented sound. It's tough to determine whether they are paying homage to Sgt. Peppers or poking fun at it. Granted, Pretty Odd has the feel and sound of a classic concept album, but vocally the group can't even hold a candle to The Beatles.
6305127697|5.0|fantastic movie and terrific performance by Edward Norton, one of the best actor aroud today................(with Philip Seymour Hoffman)! They are my favourite actors.
B000SFJWLU|4.0|The Good<br />\\"Ashes\\" comes on strong with furious riffage and thunderous drums. Ivan Moody's vocals are bloody-thirsty and sometimes melodic. It helps fuel the intensity of the lyrics. The album's title track is just as intense, with the duel guitar attack of Zoltan Bathory and Darrell Roberts leading the way. \\"The Bleeding\\" is sure to throw some off with it's tranquil and clean guitar introduction. More guitars are added to help build-up the power that's sure to come. Moody delivers that energy with a commanding yell, but falls back into a tortured and subdued delivery. His anger cannot be contained for long though. \\"The Devil's Own\\" is a great mix of ferociousness and melody. From its rapid-fire muted riffs to its driving drum beats, \\"White Knuckles\\" is pure metal. There's a little bit of the old school mixed with the new school here. \\"Death Before Dishonor\\" is full of rage, anger, and guitar mayhem.<br /><br />The Bad<br />Nothing notable<br /><br />The Verdict<br />Five Finger Death Punch come out of the gate and prove that they are no joke on their debut effort. The Way of the Fist is chock-full of intensity, power, rage, and all of the other traits you expect in a killer heavy metal album. Certainly not an album for the weak hearted.
0316168815|4.0|`The Lovely Bones' by Alice Sebold is an intriguing, moving, and heart-warming book.  The book tells the story of a young girl who is killed and now watches her family from heaven.  It takes the reader through the hardships Suzie, the main character, goes through.  In watching her younger brother and sister growing up, Suzie realizes not only how much she misses her life on earth, but also her family.  Suzie also struggles with the fact that her murderer was not caught and seeing her friends and family try to return to normal life after her death.     This book was an all around amazing book. It was the perfect combination of emotion, romance, and a bit of humor that kept the reader mesmerized through the entire novel.  Also, this book took an interesting look on the topic of death. Usually books that are about death are from the family left behind's point of view. But instead, this story was told from the one who passed. It allows the reader to take a step back and think about what `life after death' is like. Suzie wants to return to Earth to tie up loose ends. This gives the reader an in look on their own life. `If I were to die, would I have any regrets?' It allows one to truly put the quote `Live your life to the fullest.' into use.     I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a well-written, meaningful book. It not only appeals to high school students like myself, but also to a wide range of people, especially women. Because the premise of the book is not too young, yet not too advanced, it can be enjoyed by all. Not only did I enjoy this book, but my mother, my grandmother, and my older cousin loved this book.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|The Good<br />If Edguy is Sammet's day job, then Avantasia is certainly his night one. The normally energetic highflying vocalist takes on a darker more ominous tone with this project. Roy Kahn of Kamelot lends a vocal hand on the hopeless lyrical scheme of \\"Twisted Mind.\\" Despite the utter darkness it entails, both vocalists are on the game melodically. \\"The Scarecrow\\" is an epic 11+ minute affair that is not only enhanced by orchestral elements, but also power metal heavyweight Jorn Lande. Frantic rapid-fire riffage runs rampant on \\"Shelter From the Rain.\\" The double-kick drum onslaught reminds you of early Helloween. And if that doesn't, guest vocalist Michael Kiske will. Hey, didn't he swear off metal? Sammet teams up with Amanda Somerville on the stunning duet \\"What Kind of Love.\\" Their two vocal styles were truly made for each other. For \\"The Toy Master\\" Sammet employs a living scarecrow (I mean that with the utmost respect). Legendary shock-rocker Alice Cooper lends his gritty and scary vocals on this one. \\"Cry a Little\\" has a thematic element to it that will remind you of a Broadway or motion picture score. Powerful choruses, driving guitars, and over-the-top vocals elevate the energy level of \\"I Don't Believe in Your Love.\\"<br /><br />The Bad<br />Nada<br /><br />The Verdict<br />Wow! I am almost at a loss for words. The Scarecrow is incredible. Sammet has no problem making the transition from energetic party man to dark storyteller. Guest appearance by some of the prominent names is metal certainly doesn't hurt this Avantasia effort, but it doesn't take away from the talent of Tobias Sammet either. A great metal find.

B000GPIPT2|5.0|Universal had previously released two nice special editions of this film masterpiece,and mine for more gold from there beloved monster.  This edition has a beaut of a cover and case design,though I found problems with some of the pieces not being glued properly.  Not a big deal,but i've noticed some other people have confirmed the same problem.    The DVD features a great looking print of the film with clear audio and crisp picture that is probally the closest to pristine this 1931 picture will ever see.    Special Features are many,and there are the same ones from the previous release and than some.  You have the excellent documentary on the film,hosted by David J.Skal,the commentary by historian,Rudy Behlmer and the short subject,\\"Boo!\\".  New additions include ANOTHER commentary track by Christopher Frayling,which is enjoyable and enlightening,as well as a documentary on Boris Karloff,that benefits from having access to Universal Studio's film library.It's very entertaining,and a nice addition to the set.(Curiously the names of both the Karloff and Lugosi documentary(offered on the Dracula special Edition) are the same as the A and E Biographies made in the 90s.These are available on the great DVD set,Heroes of Horror from Image Entertainment.)    The film itself is one of the 100 most essential motion pictures ever made.A gothic masterpiece that was the culmination of the previous decade's fascination with expressionsim,this was the ultimate tale of shadows and the dark that Germany never made.  Whale's direction was just right,providing a good pace and peppering with a liveliness that makes Tod Browning's work on Dracula(1931) pale in comparsion.  The performances are top notch.Colin Clive is the definitive mad doctor as the young scientist,Henry Frankenstein and is supported by Dracula veterans,Edward Van Sloan as Dr.Waldman and Dwight Frye as the hunchbacked assiistant,Fritz.  Mae Clark gives a very modern bielevable performance as Henry's distraught fiance and Frederick Kerr makes a wonderful cantankerous,Baron Frankenstein.  Of course,it's Karloff who stands above all the performers in a towering portrayal that ranks among the most poignant and moving in cinema history.  Karloff gets alot of mileage out of the brilliant make up design by legendary Make Up Artist,Jack Pierce.  An absolutely mesmerizing experience worth returning to again and again,no Horror film has ever really duplicated the power brought on by this gothic masterpiece.  Still,one of the great films that belong in every film fan's collection.  This is a lovely edition for the life long fan and the newcomer that has yet to experience the magic of this timeless classic.    And a good film is worth repeating.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|I have been a fan for a long time. Back to her days on 'You Can't Do That On Television.'    I enjoy the new sounds as well as the classic undertones. Perfect voice. Thoughtful lyrics.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog is probably the best thing to come of the Writers' Strike. It is amazingly written, superbly acted, and by its very existence tells the Studios to shove off. Watching Dr. Horrible for the first time resulted in a glee I haven't felt since childhood. Unless you are a hollow shell of a person, completely dead on the inside, you will enjoy this DVD.
1595141979|5.0|I have to say that I really loved this series.  I bought this series for my daughter to read--we are huge Twilight Fans--and decided to read it on my own because I was out of 'adult' books.  But I read all three of these books in less than a week and was really impressed!!!  I am anxious for the next book!  I have to say that, like everyone else, I was really saddened by the ending and really hoped until the very last sentence that what happened was wrong, but it seems to me that Rose is going on a mission and it's going to eventually lead her to someone else.  Great book!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is the absolute epitome of what dealings with supernatural forces should be. The characters of Sam and Dean are very real, just normal guys with an extraordinary calling on their lives and they're trying to make the best of it. Storylines are interesting and in later seasons can make one think seriously about what they're willing to do not just for family, but for people in general. Just a fabulous way to spend a weekend.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|At first glance, it seems that Wanted is a 'Matrix' wannabe, especially in the first five minutes, but make no mistake about it, Wanted contains some of the best gunfights and action sequences in recent memory. It's bloody, it's profane, and it could be the best man's movie since the Die Hard series. Wesley Gibson starts out as a wimp with a pathetic life only to be swept in a strange fraternity of assassins, in which the training is incredibly brutal and painful. The reasons as to why, and what follows bring a couple of out-of-nowhere plot twists that wrap together a simple but surprising story. And unlike the Matrix, there isn't any grim future, and it's not as weird.<br /><br />But the main draw is the action, which is intense as it is brutal, and at times it's stunning, if not jaw-dropping. The cast also does a great job as relative newcomer James McAvoy makes a good action star, Angelina Jolie returns to the action genre, providing several curves for the movie's delight, and Morgan Freeman also pops up in another surprisingly good role for the legend. Overall, Wanted as least warrants a rental if not a purchase. It certainly keeps the heart beating as it were, and it looks stunning in Blu-ray, with a great assortment of bonus features. Now if we could only get a sequel, and change that generic title...
B00000APLB|4.0|Hello gang.    Has anybody heard the sound quality on the Argentina CD version of this? I saw it sealed, brand-new for $5.99 in the CD store the other day. I didn't know if the sound quality was bad, or if it's a quasi-bootleg. It appears to have the same CD cover and back art (it says it's remastered ... and from Virgin Records). Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks! :)
0385340990|5.0|I needed to get this book for my book club February selection because it is too popular at the libraries.  Well worth it.  Very expensive, but good choice.  Glad that I read it.  Too bad that the whole thing is fiction.
0679735909|5.0|I liked this book a lot. I like everything I've read by A.S. Byatt, but Possession is the closest to a \\"modern classic\\" that I've read in some time. I like that Byatt is so interested in stories, writing, language, and symbolism, and she crafts her fiction to mix these elements in a natural way. She reminds me of Jane Austin in how she fits a story together and how she treats her characters. She gives dimension to heroes and villains, allowing you to identify with their triumphs and tragedies. Possession is a rich story with several interesting dimensions woven together, examining the idea of different kinds of possession in her characters interconnected stories. It is titled as a romance, but it is also a detective story, and equally uses devices from both genres. The story remains fresh 'till the end with several twists, and doesn't take the cheap way out. All in all, great work. Worth reading and re-reading.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Music CD came quickly. Plastic case was cracked and broken, but was as described and CD played fine.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This Enya CD is so soothing w/the soft sounds of Christmas. There were a few surprises in there (one song actually has steel guitar in the background).  Good classic enya w/a few modern twists. Love it!
B0012GMYTG|5.0|Alice Ventures into new territory all the time. Whilst I knew some of these songs from Years ago,it was great to finally receive as a gift a copy of this album.I actually first saw/heard FEED MY FRANKENSTEIN on the Wayne's World film.It was a surprise to me that Ozzy Osbourne sung on HEY STOOPID, but it may have been something he wanted to do given the song's \\"message\\", but despite its message element its a good song. The playing is extremely good, and Alice has teamed with some good writers, and in the case of Satriani, some good players. Whilst I am pretty sure   that some will peg this as a not so good Alice album, its a great piece of variety in the Alice Cooper universe where he shows again that his versatility is wide enough, and his song writing skills, as Dylan says, are hugely under-rated. Alice Cooper is a Major world talent.
0060578793|5.0|Things we as  people have lost. There`s no way to remember all of what is in this book but with a little practice at doing some they will stay with you.  If in trouble this would be a great tool to have.  Toby
B001E5FYS8|5.0|\\"Man on Wire\\" is most entertaining. If you didn't already know what it's about, it starts out like a subversive terrorist thriller, and of course, the premise is well laid out shortly after. These guys act like a bunch of naughty school boys pulling a stunt for which they know they'll be caught. It's the suspense leading up to the pranks that is riveting. Director James Marsh has crafted a fine film about the improbable passion of Philippe Petit that is instructive as well as entertaining. One thing I appreciated was that there's little or no reference made to the bombing of the WTC to distract from the narrative at large. That would be a whole 'nother film. Highly recommended.
0156030209|3.0|\\"Life of Pi\\", by Yann Martel, is a riveting story about a boy named Piscine Patel. He lives in India and most people call him Pi for short. His dad owns the Pondicherry Zoo which is kind of like a family business. Pi is a very religious, intelligent, and clever kid who is very \\"confusing\\".         As a high school student, \\"Life of Pi\\" was an ok book because it was slow at times and unpredictable, not in a good way though. The summary on the book sums up part two of the book only, which upset me. When I read this, I thought it was going to be about a boy who was on a boat with a tiger and had to use his wits to survive. That's not what I got out of this book. I read about a boy who didn't have many friends, but befriended many adults.         I was confused a lot. For a reader to like this book, they have to be an avid reader. Staying into this book was a challenge, but I stuck with it the whole way. Reading about Pi, even though it's not true, was actually motivating. That's probably the biggest positive about the book. Pi was on this boat with a tiger in the middle of an ocean for over 250 days. Just being able to survive is a feat, let alone making all the contraptions that he did. He was so keen about what he did by rationing water and food, catching rain water, and fishing.         If the reader is looking for a book to read on the go, this would not be the one. This is a sit down, get into it book. This is an intriguing book, yet very puzzling. Piscine Patel meets many people that help him along the way. Mamaji taught him how to swim, Ravi, his brother, helped him just growing up, and Mr. Kumar the teacher and Mr. Kumar the baker both helped Pi learn life lessons.         Once again, \\"Life of Pi\\" is a very motivating, confusing, get into it type of book. The reader should really want to have a sit down read.
6305907145|4.0|The movie is not completely faithful to Jane Austen's Masterpiece, which usually would spell disaster but some how this movie is still delightful.  I still prefer the BBC 1983 mini-series better, however this is still worth a look.  I also, enjoy the fact that Fanny is much more feisty in this version.
B001GM28HO|5.0|This debut is one of the best debut albums i've listened to in many many years..  If you are into pop and dance music, this is definitely for you...  the album is packed with songs that are potential hits starting with 'Just Dance' which already proved to be huge and pushed GaGa under the spotlight of international 'fame'.    In my point of view though, the lead single isin't the only stand out track, 'poker face', 'lovegame' and 'starstruck' all show the power of becoming hits just like the first single.. you can tell so while listening to them. they are nothing less than 'just dance'.    But the reason i fell in love with this album is that most of the songs are great too, unlike other artists who release an album with 3 or 4 good songs (which become singles) and the rest are just fillers.. this is not the case here at all. Infact I would give it 6/5 if I could only for this point because its been so long that i bought an album and loved almost all the songs in it.    'Money honey', 'paper gangsta', 'paparazzi', 'like it rough', 'eh eh' and 'the fame' are all amazing, demonstrating how this lady can really make many good songs all on one album and not saving anything for later... simply Talented!!    It worth every cent from the $8 dollars it will cost you. You'll Love it!
B0015DYIH2|4.0|fantastic and fun final read for the twilight saga.  worth every minute from book 1 through 4.  when you finally do finish you immediately start the rereads!
B001IF5YLQ|1.0|I wont waste time, so just read the other reviews.  This is a nearly-worthless and overpriced product.

1402577923|5.0|I started listening to this audiobook on a six hour car trip. I found myself so engrossed in the story that I was actually looking forward to the return trip! When I came home, I was thinking up errands that I needed to run so I could listen to it in the car. I have never gotten so engrossed in an audiobook before.<br /><br />The story was suspenseful and exciting. It has inspired me to get more audiobooks of Michael Crichton's works. The only downside was the scientific portions of the book slowed the story down. The author would stop to inform about nanotechnology or things related to it and a lot of it was unnecessary for the story and caused it to drag a bit. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this audiobook!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was a gift for my husband.  The show is well done, excellent historical account and I would recommend it highly.  We are enjoying these  even though the actual content does not leave you in a high mood.  It's life  and you come away with a greater respect for our veterans....at least you should!
B001O2MBOQ|2.0|Miss Potter is a wonderful, sensitive, and well-acted film. I have a regular DVD copy of it which, I suppose, will have to suffice, because my Blu-ray copy will not play on my Sony Blu-ray player. I even updated the firmware as suggested, but it did not help. I wish Amazon would post a disclaimer to this fact so that others will be spared the inconvenience of having to return unplayable copies. I have purchased many Blu-ray discs over the past six months, and this is the first one that I've had a problem with. The production of the disc appears to have been done in Australia which may--or may not--have something to do with the incompatibility. So, as the previous reviewer stated, BEWARE!
B0017R5UAA|4.0|The music is great but the recording of some of the songs could be better.
1563898586|2.0|That would be the result if this was a football game.<br /><br />STORY: An interesting adventure. The idea of combining all these characters was simply excellent and the plot was solid and well written. I didn't like some violent scenes, but overall it was okay.<br /><br />ART: Did I say art? FART is more like it, as it stinks more than rotten eggs. By far the UGLIEST I've seen. Even kids draw better. This guy makes Rob Liefeld look like Da Vinci. It's hard to find words, it's that bad.<br /><br />O'Neill can't draw even a human face right. The figures look ridiculous and usually flat. The way he draws hands is quite unique. They remind me of zombies. Then in some panels the perspective is problematic. There is also the case where he hasn't drawn ANYTHING, he just waits for the colorist to do the dirty work (ex. in a panel Quatermain has no hair, in another Hyde has no arm or muscles). Speaking of muscles, Hyde is a good example of O'Neill's knowledge of anatomy. Hasn't studied you think? I would say he's never heard of it. The inks complete the mess. No wonder he's been banned by the Comics Code Authority (oh, you didn't know?).<br /><br />It's a pity to see good stories wasted with such fartwork. So 2 stars. This is a comic after all.
B000ION23K|4.0|wonderful adventure, parents should watch with their children to help them learn why bullying is not fun, or exceptable.
B000002UA9|5.0|Please Please Me by The Beatles was their first studio album. Paul, John, Ringo, and George play their british hearts out on tracks like: I Saw Her Standing There, Love Me Do, Twist and Shout, P.S. I Love You, and the title-track. These 4 lads were so talented, start your Beatles collection right here. Enjoy!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace tells the story of William Wilberforce and his community of friends who dared to take on and change the ideas of a culture to eradicate slavery in England.  It shows the persistence, faith, and dedication of those who dared to care for those caught in the degredation of slavery, and how their faith in God kept them going against unbelievable odds over more than 20 years to achieve their goals!  Inspiring is the smallest word I can apply to this wonderful movie!  Something everyone who is discouraged with society or culture should see!  A movie every teenager can enjoy and receive a blessing!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I won't lie, I was a Whedonite already, so my interest in this was a foregone conclusion.  But truly, you don't have to love Whedon to love this.  Dr. Horrible is brilliantly written, cast and acted.  Everyone is great, the songs are great, the characters are great, the story is great.  Funny, sad, poignant.  Neil Patrick Harris is seriously amazing - not that the others are lacking anywhere!      I downloaded this already on iTunes but it was worth purchasing again just to get the special features, especially the hilarious \\"musical commentary\\".  Two thumbs way, way up for Dr. Horrible!
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Just finished this most glorious DVD. Ms. Streisand delivered a gorgeous film over 25 years ago and her passion and dedication to her art does not seem to pale as one watches the wonderful direction that went into this new DVD release.   The film is a wonder and the new introductions show us a forever young and gorgeous Streisand introducing wonderful moments from her personal archives that not only enrich the experience but also show just how dedicated she is to her fans and her art.     Bravo Barbra!
B000WS4QJG|4.0|nice anniversary album, sure do miss mike's youngers days!  huge fan of his though, if you're a fan then you'll prob wanna pick this up but for most of us, we already have the original recording lol!  go pick this up if you want, it's still nice to listen to.
B00005JKES|4.0|great show, but the first season just isn't enough to be satisfied with.  you never find out who kills laura palmer in this season...
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I totally agree this is a great live album, but this Chicago show actually did not have Mother Mary,This Kids I'm a Loser and Natural Thing in the set list. Pack It Up(and go)was after Cherry and Ain't No Baby was also in the setlist.Why can't they just include those two songs also. Even if it was a double cd set it would be well worth it.
B000001DTM|2.0|u2 is kind of annoying to me, but this album is one i had when i was younger so i bought it used.  i listen to it occasionally and like the song \\"one\\"

B00005JMK0|5.0|I'd like to add my vote for this film to be released on DVD. (Note that I just learned that it's being played theatrically in L.A. for one night in Feb. 2009 as part of a Bud Cort salute!)<br /><br />When this movie was released, I saw it three times in the movie theater. A few years later, I found it used on VHS at a local video store and snatched it up, and it got a lot of wear and tear.<br /><br />It's a film I used to watch when I felt a bit blue or lonely that always picked me up. It's also the film that introduced a very lovely Virginia Madsen.<br /><br />I hadn't watched it in years, but about a year ago, I burned my VHS copy to DVD. Good thing too since it's clear the video was on its last legs, and the quality wasn't very good. Shortly after burning it, I watched it one evening and while it's definitely of it's time -- and a bit funny in retrospect since it portrays a level of online activity that I don't think was quite that sophisticated yet--I found that it still retains its old magic.<br /><br />This is a crowd pleasing forgotten gem that deserves to be brought to DVD.<br /><br />UPDATE 03/09: Knowing how Hollywood works, don't hold your breath, but a feature story about Virginia Madsen in the March 26 edition of the Los Angeles Times reported that the actress \\"is now working to remake [Electric Dreams] with updated technology and a deeper exploration of its cybersoul theme.\\" Can't imagine it will have the same innocence and magic of the original film, but perhaps it will compel the release of the movie onto DVD! Hopefully this reflects in part good memories the actress retains of the film. The story doesn't necessarily need to have a young ingenue in the lead female role, so I'd prefer to see Madsen in the remake rather than some other actress!
B000J5XS3C|2.0|i ended up buying the wrong board when i bought this one.  the description was confusing and i returned it immediately.  oh well, can't win em all.
B001B223TW|5.0|Dmitry Hvorostovsky is amazing throughout, at the start of the performance I wondered how Jose Cura with his less than perfect tenor voice had managed to continue performing on the opera stage but by the end I knew --the guy delivers when it counts!! A committed performance, dramatically perfect. I have seen this opera numerous times and have the Pavarotti version on DVD with the excellent Azucena but the end of the opera did not touch me dramatically like this one did. the soprano also gave a very good, involved performance. Combine the quality of the performance with the sound and picture quality, and I'm in opera heaven!     Highly recommended-get it on blu-ray!
0743486285|5.0|The Heroin Diaries is the most amazing book I've read in my life. It has affected me in so many ways. I devoured the entire book in one day, taking the trip along with Nikki, and came out of it [as cliche as it sounds] a changed person. I would love to share my story here.    When I first purchased my copy of The Heroin Diaries, I had just graduated from my final year of high school. All throughout the preceeding years, I fought a terrible and deepening depression. I was in the depths of despair, and only getting worse. I kept fighting, but it always won. Always.    The day after acquiring The Heroin Diaries, I spent the night at my friends house. I read the book from cover to cover that night, and as a result was up until around three or four in the morning. After completing what I would have to say is the most amazing read of my life, I went to sleep pondering on the life of Nikki Sixx, of whom I was already a fan due to my long lasting love for Motley Crue. This is where things got a little strange.    Sometime before dawn, I awoke. It was a cool night, but I was drenched in sweat. I was paranoid that people were turning into mist and coming under the doors to get me, and that the house was surrounded by police. I was hallucinating and my heart was racing. The feelings I had were indescribable, and not exactly pleasant. And, strangely, I was sitting in my friends closet.    I still don't exactly know what happened that night. I don't know how I came to be in my friend's closet. I don't know what caused all the feelings and the hallucinations and paranoia, and I swear I have never taken any kind of drug in my life. But from that night onwards, I realised there was a feeling worse than the depression I was fighting. That there were people out there who this was happening to, right as I sat there feeling it for myself. I took this experience, and I turned myself around. My depression has never won the fight since.    From then on, Nikki Sixx has been my inspirationand my power. The Heroin Diaries is the book I turn to when I feel things getting to much for me, when I feel my depression crawling back. But now, I have the power to fight, and I have the power to win. I feel like I owe Nikki Sixx a lot for that, and one day I hope to tell him my story in person, and to thank him from the bottom of my heart. He lived the life he did, and told the world all about it so we wouldn't have to go through the same thing. I guess my story seems a lot different from his, but we were both losing the battle against something. Granted what he was fighting was a million times worse than what I was fighting, but we were both battling nonetheless. And we both had the power to conquer what we were formerly slaves to.    The music created by Sixx:A.M. has given me another tool to utilise in my fight. A source of aural soothing, and another niche to slip into. I give the Heroin Diaries a hearty recommendation for people of all ages, all backgrounds and all kinds of musical interest. It's an utterly amazing snippet of Nikki Sixx's life to read.    My name is Stephanie Keys, and that's my Heroin Diaries experience.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|We had to exchange for a second set.  The problem is that the dvd's are just slid into cardboard sleeves rather than being protected with hard plastic.  So there are a lot of scratches, some bad enough to make the dvd unplayable.  Same problem with the second set.  I would recommend the series, and the Collector's Giftset idea is great, but because of poor packaging, I can only give 2 stars.  NOTE:  Amazon was terrific about replacing the defective item.  We decided not to try for a third set since the problem seems to be due to packaging.
0316168815|5.0|As a high school student, I think Lovely Bones was a perfect read.  Truthfully, I was very hesitant when I started to read this novel.  I did not know if I could handle its serious content.  As a teenager, my initial reaction was fear and uneasiness.  After reading this book, I unexpectedly came to the conclusion that The Lovely Bones is the perfect read for a high school student.    Alice Sebold, the author of this book, writes the story of 14-year-old Susie Salmon who was raped and murdered one day on her way home from school.  Throughout the novel, Susie tells her story from her own personal heaven.  She also watches over the loved ones she left behind on the Earth.  She constantly observes the lives of her father, her mother, her younger siblings, Lindsey and Buckley, her friends, Ruth and Ray, and her vile murderer, Mr. George Harvey.  Although Susie continues to live up in heaven as a teenage girl, she grows and matures into a woman through the life of her sister, Lindsey.    Alice Sebold did an exceptional job writing this brilliant novel.  The Lovely Bones contains lots of vivid language and strong emotions that are sure to keep the reader turning its pages.  It is especially unique because the story is told from heaven.  The uncertainty the reader feels as he or she reads keeps their interest.  Even though the element of crime, mystery and sorrow are intense components of this book, they do not inhibit the reader from experiencing its thoughtfulness.  This novel gives a different perspective on crime in today's world.  It touches on the heartfelt mourning and difficult coping that are intertwined in this tragic storyline.  It also shows how the heart can heal over time with plenty of love and powerful memories.  This touching novel is an excellent read for male and female readers of all ages.
0545128285|4.0|I am surprised by how well the fairy tales of this book stand on their own, not just as small bits in the massive Harry Potter universe. I was expecting a lot of inside jokes and lore pertaining to the world of the boy with the lightning scar but each story made a satisfactory fable all by itself. Since no one other than Dumbledore himself writes the analysis of each fable, all the Potter trivia is still in the book, just not in the stories. This construct works amazingly well with the only hiccup being the forward, where the author has the annoying habit of writing as if she and her charity live in the world of Harry Potter and converse with the characters. Fortunately this small error, like the typo of an unmatched parenthesis on p. 85, are easy to overlook and I only found myself hoping that the book could continue beyond the far too brief hundred pages.

B001EO748M|5.0|The Tudors is a brilliant piece of television history.  The series displays excellence in acting, stage set, design, costumes, etc.  There is accuracy in the historical record.  It moves you to feel how times have changed.  Highly recommended.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I was trilled to be able to find this classic movie, which I was unable to find in any stores.  Delivery was excellent it came in 2 days and was brand new as promised.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|This is a review for the Blu-ray version:  This film is a classic and the best of the series.Stallone did all of the stunts himself in this film and he broke a few bones doing them.The PQ and AQ are ok but better than the DVD version,the extras on the Blu-ray version are very indepth and the deleted scenes are a treat.This version has commentary by Stallone and the writer that is very informative.  The Blu-ray version uses AVC that has a DD+ and DTS-HD soundtrack.
B000RZOR2U|5.0|Like Peter Watchorn, I also reviewed this same set in its $550.00 incarnation, and bought, over a period of several years, all 10 of the six-CD volumes.  Each purchase only confirmed for me what I initially believed: that the apparent roughness of these performances actually enhanced rather than diminished the value of the music.  Bach's cantatas are not musical bonbons, but serious works of religious art. Serious, of course, doesn't mean stuffy or boring, and every cantata in this set offers at least one movement--and frequently several--of profound, exquisite beauty.  There is the full range of human experience here: joy, sorrow, terror, despair, and--perhaps most often--deep, mature, boundless love.      I'll avoid commenting on the performances again--see my review of the old box set for details--and what others say on this site pretty much matches my own view of this set.  But I will comment on the price, which is both a delight (for those contemplating getting a set of Bach's cantatas) and a frustration (for people like me who paid twice as much to own the same music).  Bach's cantatas are not nearly as well-known as they should be--now there's no reason everyone can't own their own set of first-rate recordings.    One more piece of advice: Since this set is so reasonably priced, I'd highly recommend that you take some of the cash you have saved and invest in Alfred Durr's The Cantatas of JS Bach, now in paperback from Oxford University Press.  Durr wrote many of the notes for the original Telefunken vinyl recordings, but this book offers the complete German texts and a parallel English translation that is superb (better than the often-ridiculous translations supplied with the Teldec CDs, by the way).  Plus, you get a thorough, yet accessible commentary for each cantata, a short history of the form, and other helpful essays--an excellent companion to these works.  For those, like me, who miss the loss of the scores in the LP-to-CD transfer, you can download for free electronic scans of the old Bach-Gesellschaft versions (which were reproduced with the Telefunken sets)--these are far from perfect, I know, but they will provide the listener with at least a decent score to follow.

1439110123|5.0|\\"The Prize\\" deserved its Pulitzer Prize three times over.  It gives insight into history, without which, you can not understand history since the discovery of oil.  This book gives history substance and excitement.  In between the lines you can see the many small changes in the history of oil, each typically the work of a single person, that totally changed the history of WWII and the world as we know it.  For example,Yergin shows that the history of WWII was very much determined by the availability of oil over and over again.  The destruction of the Japanese in the south Pacific because their ships could not use proper tactics or go full speed for lack of oil is one example.  The story of the \\"Henderson\\", a little destroyer, that was able to cripple the Japanese fleet by making it go into a defensive action that caused it to use more oil than it could afford and at the same time wipe out a cruiser was awe inspiring.  The story of how the Japanese air force was largely destroyed by poor quality and inadequate fuel for training and flying was shocking.  The book was long but fantastically interesting.  I could hardly put it down. This is a book to be read slowly and pondered to allow the awesome magnitude of what is being said to sink in.
B0017ANAZO|4.0|I enjoyed this remake of George Cukor's classic 1939 film.  While Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell headed an excellent cast in a sparkling film, Diane English does a good job bringing this update to the screen.  The DVD special features are informative as we hear about what a labor of love this was for English, the long fuse of financing and numerous screenplay drafts before the the project could be brought to screen.<br /><br />Meg Ryan plays Mary Haines whose husband is having an affair.  Ryan was one of the top romantic comedy starts in the 80s & 90s with great classics such as her Golden Globe nominated \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" & \\"Sleepless in Seattle.\\"  She tugs at our heartstrings as the woman forced to come out of her shell and gain a better sense of herself.<br /><br />Annette Bening who I loved in [[ASIN:B0000TANUI Open Range]] and who has been nominated for an Oscar three times for \\"The Grifters,\\" \\"American Beauty\\" & \\"Being Julia\\" does a good job as the anti-domestic career woman Sylvie Fowler.  This was Rosalind Russell's role in the original.  Bening is always interesting to watch.  Her scenes with Mary's daughter show variety and range.<br /><br />In the DVD extras, English said she questioned whether 82-year-old Cloris Leachman would be up to doing a role.  But Leachman, whose Oscar was for \\"The Last Picture Show,\\" glistens as the saucy housekeeper Maggie whose personal opinions keep her continually on the verge of quitting.<br /><br />Eva Mendes showed me what great depth she has an actress in [[ASIN:B000ZS8GWQ We Own the Night]].  She may be one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood.  As Crystal Allen, the girl most willing to have an affair with a married man, she combines the elegance & barb of Joan Crawford with street sleaze.  Her scene in the dressing room trying on lingerie makes you want to scratch her eyes out.  She's a delight!<br /><br />Candace Bergen, who was nominated for an Oscar in 1979 for \\"Starting Over,\\" reflects great presence as Mary's mother Catherine Frazier.  In her scenes, we are treated to a sizzling cameo performance.  Bette Midler who has two Oscar nominations of her own (\\"For the Boys\\" & \\"The Rose\\") plays Leah Miller, drying out with Mary.  She is intense, charming and flamboyant in her limited screen time.<br /><br />Debra Messing from TV's \\"Will & Grace\\" plays Edie Cohen, the eternally pregant friend of Mary's.  Her comic timing is great.  Jada Pinkett Smith as the gay Alex Fisher adds spice.  I enjoyed her as the maverick captain in [[ASIN:B0001BKAEY The Matrix Revolutions (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]].  Debi Mazar does a great job as the brassy manicurist Tanya who loves to gossip.  Carrie Fisher from \\"Star Wars\\" has a brief scene on an exercise bike as reporter Bailey Smith.<br /><br />Overall, the film works well.  I hope it stimulates people to want to check out the great George Cukor film as well as Clare Boothe Luce's excellent stage play.  Enjoy!therine Frazier.

Little did I know, that once I bought the book and started to read it, did my life begin to change for the better.    If your new to this world of the mind, manifestation, metaphysics, I highly recommend this book!
B001L5SXQG|5.0|If seeing the incredible performances at the Inaugural bash and the Superbowl weren't enough, Mr. Springsteen's new disc is vintage Bruce and superb.  I am so pleased that he is back!!  If you are a fan of Springsteen from the days of yore, think \\"Greetings from Asbury Park\\", you will appreciate this effort.  His voice is strong and diction is right on (contrary to some of his late 90's releases), no mumbling here.  Of course, the E-Street band is sounding better all the time.  The lyrics are meaningful and inspiring.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|This is one of Rush's best albums. I wouldn't have said that after my first or second listen, or even after attending their concert without really familiarizing myself with the album. If, like me, you're a decades' long fan and geared to expect variations on Rush's greatest hits from days of yore, you'll be confounded if not disappointed at first.    However, the songs on this album are rich musically and lyrically--and different enough from their previous materials to be fresh and interesting.  Indeed, after repeated listens, most of the songs on this album--including \\"Far Cry,\\" \\"Workin' Them Angels,\\" \\"The Larger Bowl,\\" \\"Spindrift,\\" \\"The Main Monkey Business,\\" and \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\"--have gotten onto my list of favorite Rush songs.    I can appreciate the turn Rush's lyrics have taken, as life and world events have made for a darker worldview. My young kids, on the other hand, appreciate the driving rhythms and guitars as well as some of the catchier lyrics (they love air drumming and singing along to \\"Far Cry\\"). Also, the innovative blend of acoustic and electric guitars for heavy metal rhythms sounds great.    In the end, if you give this album four or five listens, I guarantee that it will rise in your list of favorite Rush albums. It's almost up there with Moving Pictures for me. If you don't give it a chance, you'll be missing out.
159448385X|5.0|The subject matter of A Thousand Splendid Suns (embedded in the harsh realities of recent decades in Afghanistan) is terribly distressing. The narrative is drenched in sadness, and Khaled Hosseini's empathic approach to character development drew me in. Like The Kite Runner, his home city of Kabul is a primary character in the book--a rollercoaster personality through its shifting sands of successive revolutions and invasions.     Hosseini's novel is shaped by these events and imbued with their devastating impacts on his common folk characters. The continuum throughout the book is the subjugation of women. The level of seething brutality and neglect that men heap upon their wives and daughters--with such extravagant impunity--wrenches the gut and rips the heart.     We have all read about the treatment of women in Afghanistan under the Taliban. It's disheartening to read about their continued oppression through forced marriages, violence, and lack of opportunities years following the U.S.-led invasion. What Hosseini's work of fiction does for me, however, is translate a personal connection--a tunnel into the soul of our shared humanity that is otherwise lost in the reporting of events and statistics.     As I neared the final chapters of the story, I was looking for a Hollywood-like finish to the misery and suffering. But this is Afghanistan, where the road to redemption is strewn with potholes, mines and martyrs. In the end, there is more of the same, but with flourishes of transformation, courage, sacrifice, hope, forgiveness and love.

031606792X|5.0|I just finished reading the book (actually I read the whole series in about two weeks, which is very fast for me ;o)...and as there's currently no way of contacting the author directly, I'm just gonna put this here, hoping that maybe she's gonna stumble over it:    Dear Ms Meyer,    I know there has been a lot of critical voices about this 4th and last part to the series, but I would like to thank you for it; that's to say for choosing and putting love and peace, over hate, misstrust and violence.     Thank you for writing a story in which the ones held together by love and compassion are stronger than the ones who want to dominate and gain power over others by force.    Thank you for inventing caracters, who as their relationships grow and become stronger, are willing to risk their lives for this and at the same time in the end find a way to do so without having to kill!      I strongly believe, that true love is gonna be the key to change this world we live in! Because with love comes respect, tolerance and a will to understand each other. A will to focus on the things that unite us rather than the things that part us. Of course this is not always easy, sometimes it's even very hard, but in the end we might get as lucky as Bella and her family and friends and get everything we ever hoped for...    So again: thank you!

1423113497|5.0|I was fortunate to attend a conference on reading for teachers.  One of the things they talked about was how fourth grade is a crucial time in reading for students.  I decided to try to encourage my grandson to read by reading these books with him.  The series is excellent. They have kept his attention and he has accomplished his goal of reading three books.  He's now finishing the fourth and is so excited and can't wait for us to start the fifth book in the series that will be available February 10.  If you have a fourth grader who needs encouragement reading, I recommend this series for you to read with your child or grandchild.
B000VBIEXS|5.0|Arrived earlier than scheduled and was as described!  Very nice experience.  Thank you!
B000A0GYD2|4.0|From the Earth to the Moon was definitely an ambitious undertaking; i.e.  telling the entire story of the Apollo program from beginning to end, and bringing it and the people who were a part of it to life.  Overall, the producers succeeded superbly with an excellent miniseries.  I especially loved the fact that they incorporated into the story the participation of not just the astronauts, but others who played a valuable role in the program.    As a history graduate student, I did research on the early space program for my thesis.  I often find myself frustrated with the widely believed myth that it was President Kennedy that started the American effort to land a man on the moon just because he highlighted the goal and gave it greater importance with his speech before Congress.  In reality, it was a goal and program already suggested by Wernher Von Braun and Dr. James R. Killian, Science Advisor to President Eisenhower, and that it was Eisenhower who okayed the initial funding for it.  The series plays up the Kennedy speech a lot, but still highlights the lesser known fact that plans for the moonlanding pre-dated Kennedy's administration.    That being said, there were some episodes of this series that were rather disappointing and were just not handled very well for various reasons.  I'll take it episode by episode to illustrate my views on each:  1: Can We Do This?: This episode just tries to take on too much, with the entire Gemini program and some aspects of Mercury before it included.  The episode lacks any flow, and instead is just a jumble of clips of different missions and is ultimately hard to follow.  2: Apollo 1: One of the very best episodes of the series because it shows how this terrible tragedy almost derailed the entire program. This episode resurrected this somewhat forgotten incident of sacrifice to make the moon exploration possible.  3: We Have Cleared the Tower: Very good episode that explored what kind of men the astronauts were, and the role of those ground crew members who had to put every little thing together to make a launch happen.  4: 1968: As a historian, I loved this episode because it put the entire Apollo program into the context of time and place, i.e. the turbulent 1960's America.  For those who lived through the time, it was a reminder of everything that was going on while astronauts first voyaged to the moon; and for those who didn't, it is an education in the context of time and place.  5: Spider: Another excellent episode that showed the time, manpower, and creativity that went into the design of the all important lunar module that would actually land on the moon.  The egg heads in the workshop get their due.  6: Mare Tranquilitatis: Sadly, this all important episode which covers the Apollo 11 landing is one of the weakest of the series.  It totally failed to capture the moment of that first moon landing, when the entire world stopped and watched this unique event in human history.  Instead, the Apollo 11 crew seemed to be shown almost in a bubble of silence from the rest of the world.  Of course, they were in real life, but for the historical value of this moment as a worldwide event, there needed to be more of the impact aspect in it.  If I wanted to show my students the moon landing in all of its aspects, I would not show this episode.  7: That's All There Is:  This is the funnest episode of the series because the astronauts of Apollo 12 are shown as their committed, professional, but goofy and lighthearted selves.  They didn't have the weight of being first on them, so they could have fun with the experience.  I just thoroughly enjoyed this episode.  8: We Interrupt This Program: Unfortunately, the producers were faced with a great difficulty with this episode on Apollo 13--the story had just been told with the epic film released just a couple of years before this aired.  While the angle they chose to tell the story from for this (reporters' role) was interesting, I think it just lacked any gravity to it because you know the real story is the one they are talking about, but is not being shown (i.e. the lives of three astronauts hanging by a thread).  9: For Miles and Miles: I really liked this one because Alan Shepherd is  a forgotten American hero of the space race.  He was the first American to go into space, but was forgotten in the wake of John Glenn's orbit and later missions.  This episode tells the magnificent story of how he overcame his medical limitations that kept him from going up again for a decade and allowed him to set foot on the moon with Apollo 14.  10: Galileo Was Right: If I had to pick a best episode, this is it.  It clearly illustrates the scientific value of the Apollo program and the knowledge it gained us about our nearest neighbor in space.  As the astronauts learned to be geologists and field scientists, so too did the audience.  And it is never boring in doing so.  11: The Original Wives Club: Probably the weakest episode of the series, not because of the subject, but the way the wives' stories were executed as part of the series as a whole.  Instead of waiting until this episode that dealt only with their stories, the producers should have incorporated them into the overall story of the series more.  The result is that you are watching this episode the whole time wondering who each wife is, who is their husband, when is this again, because you have barely seen them, if at all, through the course of the series.  Too disconnected from the story to be an effective part of the story's telling.  12: Le Voyage Dans La Lune: I know Hollywood people think films are everything, but telling parallel stories of the first early film about a fictional moon landing with the story of the last Apollo moon landing just didn't work.  I was bored during the segments on the Melies film, and I think more could have been done on the decisions made by higher ups to end the program with Apollo 17 and the reasoning behind it, along with thefinal mission.    So, overall, good series, but some episodes were definitely a whole lot better than others.
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|There is so much here to enjoy. Some of the performances are tributes, some are reinventions; some songs are familiar to any casual Dylan fan and some may have managed to escape under the radar of even the most devoted. All of them are worth listening to. The backing provided by Calexico and the Million Dollar Bashers on many tracks is extremely supportive of the singers and songs. An additional benefit for old hipsters who may not have been keeping up with younger acoustic artists are the performances by groups like Iron & Wine, Sufjan Stevens, Stephen Malkmus and the outstanding Mason Jennings. Buy it, if for no other reason, for Jim James on \\"Going to Acapulco\\" & Bob (himself) on \\"I'm Not There\\".

1590302273|5.0|Hermann Hesse's \\"Siddartha\\" is not exactly an account of the historical Buddha, but a fictional account of a man named Siddartha who is looking for spiritual meaning at the time of Buddha's life.  Siddartha drifts through several stages of life, as a Hindu ascetic, as a worldly businessman in love with a beautiful woman, and finally as a ferryboat man.  Siddartha's voyage to enlightenment is far from direct, but illumines several fascinating aspects about human life, its meaning, love and suffering.  If Hesse has not captured the essence of the spiritual pursuits of Hinduism and Buddhism, he has at least captured key aspects of them; and of the essential meaning of life.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|When Coldplay's [[ASIN:B0006L16N8 X&Y]] came out, it aspired to a grandeur that their previous two albums had not had, but in the process lost the intimacy that made [[ASIN:0711989249 Parachutes]] and [[ASIN:0711996067 A Rush of Blood to the Head]] so powerful.<br /><br />With the release of \\"Viva La Vida,\\" X&Y begins to look like a transitional step.  The new album builds on the sonic confidence of its predecessor, and adds more complex and interesting instrumentation.  In part by reclaiming the first person for many of his lyrics, Chris Martin re-asserts the personal element that had gone missing in the third album.  In fact, lyrically, he seems to be reaching for something more challenging than ever; the album is rife with references to the spiritual (\\"I saw God come in my garden, but I don't know what He said / for my heart it wasn't open\\") and enigmatic-but-important-sounding turns of phrase (\\"I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing...\\").  And yet, despite these seemingly weighty contemplations, the album never loses its lightness; as soon as you know the words it's impossible not to sing along.<br /><br />The complex sound and lyrical richness make \\"Viva La Vida\\" highly rewarding on repeated listens.  With this album, Coldplay have taken a long stride toward a musical maturity they could easily have avoided, resting on their laurels and turning out album after album of pitch-perfect pop anthems.  The fact that this album retains an unmistakably \\"Coldplay\\" sound while advancing its execution is exciting; it suggests that in future, the band will continue to go fearlessly forward.<br /><br />~

I was expecting..something at least descent, however this book was just not good at all. I felt that it made fun of Christians and of course the language was a little mature. If I had a kid in high school I wouldn't want them reading these books at all.

B00004XQ83|5.0|It's a rare surprise when a commercial media success features honest roots music played by musicians who have artistic integrity. This fine soundtrack is every bit as good as its companion movie. There's not a bad track on the CD and in fact every track is superb.<br /><br />This CD offers not only great music, but it has helped to expose our rich traditional music styles and artists to persons whose previous listening experience was centered on bland, sound-the-same, music-mill commercial recordings. A recording like this one helps to keep good music alive.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys traditional music, and recommended also to anyone who is looking to discover music that is interesting, significant, substantial, and enduring.
0545128285|1.0|Disappointed? Yes. The only part of this little book I enjoyed was the great little illustrations done by J.K. Rowling.  The \\"fairy tales\\" were weird and not very interesting.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|I loved the book and was extremely disappointed that the movie deviated away from McCullough's story in several keys areas.  For expediency, I can understand the need to combine key historical events into one occurrence, rather than the several that really took place over a period of years.  In that regard, the actual historical events were generously altered in many instances. The movie also portrays Adam's relationship particularly with sons, John Quincy and Charles as non-loving and overly parochial.  He was a loving and supportive father even if he wasn't always with his children.  On Mr. Adams (second) trip to Paris, both boys travelled with their father (not just John Quincy as the movie portrays) and thrived there.  To Abigail he wrote about \\"delicate\\" Charles as \\"hardy as flint\\" and \\"speaks French like a hero.\\" \\"He is a delightful little fellow.  I love him too much.\\"  The movie makes it sound like Charles was left behind and forgotten, which created this under-achiever stance that would plague him to his death.  While also pitting John Quincy and the Sr. against each other in a competition where John Quincy felt he could never measure up to his father.  That was all drama for the mini-series that was not present in the book.  Giamatti does an outstanding job, but plays Mr. Adams as a bully most of the time.  He was an intellectual and trained in the classics with the presence of mind to be one of the greatest debaters and writers in American history.  The mini-series did a major disservice by not addressing Mr. Adams' significant contribution to our Government by authoring the \\"Thoughts on Government\\", which subsequently led to the Massachusetts State Constitution and Bill of Rights, and which served at the basis for the US Constitution.  He was really one of the most (if not the most) significant minds behind the way our system of government works today!  Little to none of that came across in the movie.  It was his grit and vitriol that the director preferred to emphasize, which made Mr. Adams appear more singular than he actually was and almost incapable of making friends.  I was deeply disappointed that the mini-series didn't give him the depth of character that I believe would have served his legacy better in the mini-series.  Many folks will see the DVD and choose not to read the book.  That would be unfortunate.

B000TGCR38|4.0|I wasn't sure I'd like this movie after reading a plot summary on cable TV. I'd never heard of the actors or director. What's more, I'd read very little about World War 2 in occupied Holland. I was IMMERSED immediately.<br />Ms. Van Hooten is engaging as Rachel Stein a young Dutch Jewish girl hiding from the Nazi's and seperated from a family she is briefly reunited with and then betrayed by someone she and they trusted with their lives. This movie is about survival and says a lot about \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\". It is violent at times, but the war was BRUTAL especially behind the lines and outside the history books. The cast is FIRST RATE.<br />The film was beautifully shot and done so well, I felt like I was transported back in time. There are subtitles in the version I saw, but<br />I have a film collection that contains Das Boot and Stalingrad and can't wait to add this one! BTW, I would not recommend this film to those<br />who don't watch violent movies or nudity. I didn't think either was glorified in this film. BRAVO!

1416595546|5.0|I read Montefiore's two books on Stalin, and I'm fairly knowledgeable about 20th Century Russian history. I found that, in this novel, he started out a bit tentatively--there was almost a pedantic element in his repeated use of terms such as landaulet. The early part of the book didn't grab me, but soon I was engrossed, and as it went on towards the conclusion, I was astounded by the power of this story.  As with most books, there are stronger and weaker parts, but by the time you finish, you're left with a powerful, searing novel that burns itself into your mind, so that you think about it over time.  I read quite a bit, and I rarely have that feeling from contemporary novels.  I'd love it if Montefiore writes another Russian historical novel--or, for that matter, another straight history.  As other reviewers have noted, this would make an excellent movie or multi-part BBC series.
B001L63JC8|2.0|Great album, but the mp3 version has a huge gap between the opening track and its follow up, &#34;Fly On The Windshield&#34;.  I don't know for sure how long the &#34;actual&#34; gap is b/c by the time I notice it, I go to the mp3 cloud window on my PC and there's a status of &#34;loading&#34;.  Thing is, I downloaded the songs on my PC and, using Windows Media Player, the songs still don't transition smoothly.  Looks like I'll have to re-buy the CD one of these days...
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I have a set of these from the mid-80s and love them.  I needed a second pair, and did some research.  As I asked around for recommendations and tried many other sets, I kept coming back to the AKG-K240s.<br /><br />When I got the new set, I did a comparison of the new to the old.  Frankly, except for the new ones being more comfortable, I couldn't tell much difference; the old ones still sounded like new.  These will last you a very long time.  For most use, you can't go wrong with them.<br /><br />They ARE open, though.  If you are using them on-stage and want the headphones to block out some of the sound around you, you would be better off with a set intended for that purpose.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|The Movie itself Wall*e Delivers. The Blu Ray makes this movie feel like its truly a Computer animated film. This is the first PIXAR movie to outdo my favorite PIXAR Toy Story! but (that will change when TOY STORY 3 comes out in 2010. Anyway, This is a must buy for people who love underdogs and Charlie Chaplin. Excellent buy for you Blu Ray player!
B001C3KCSY|5.0|IT is so fantastic!  I bought it for Sex on Fire and was pleasantly suprised that other songs became my favorites!
B001ILFUD2|5.0|It's been 7 years since this has been Re-issued on DVD. For me I had to get the 20th anniversary because I didn't have this film to begin with. Last summer, this had a price tag of 25.99 for the 2002 edition! I am so glad i have this now. The music itself delivers. I can't believe its been 20 years! I saw this when i was 4! anyway great buy for $19.99 at Target. I highly recommend this film to people who are intermediate with Disney Classics! a must Buy!
031606792X|5.0|I really loved this book. ALL of the Twilight series. Im 40 yrs old and far from a teen. This book isn't just for the young. I really wish more guys would read these and maybe they would get a clue more :)
B001NTZ21O|5.0|\\"Reckless\\" by Bryan Adams is an essential addition to anyone who grew up in the 80's and still loves to rock. I downloaded this album for under $2 and since buying the hit songs individually would have cost me at least double what I paid, I'm a happy girl!<br /><br />The entire album became a hit in 1985 and 24 years later, it's still a hit...at least with me.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE HAD THE BEST MUSIC IN IT THAT ANY MOVIE HAS HAD IN A LONG TIME. I GIVE THIS CD A FIVE STAR RATEING FOR ITS WONDERFUL MUSIC.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|I really liked the CD. The songs were breezy and tuneful. I went on a 300 mile round trip saturday and back sunday and listened to this CD the whole time, now that really says something. It really grows on you. I actually like it better then Magic. If you like a combination of rock and pop then you will like this CD. Working on a Dream is a fantastic song. There is not one bad song on the album. Though it doesn't have the depth of Darkness or Born to Run but it still is a wonderful CD. I highly recomend it
0340933674|4.0|I gave this to my art-director fiance for Valentine's last year.  It is such a beautiful book, however not very practical to read all the way through.  Although it is a book of poems, it is definitely more of a picture book (every page resembles the cover; or is more intricate!)  I recommend having this book if you collect art books or are a designer of some stripe for the eye-candy or inspiration.  If you are more of a poem lover, best to look elsewhere!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|this is both a must read for every american  and grade schooler but should be in every  home library.  this is the way american history should be taught.  the humanity, psychology, and political science lessons are irreplacable.
B001EO748M|5.0|Brilliantly cast, The Tudors shows Henry viii's court to be nothing more than a miserable, elaborate series of games for very high stakes. The only figure who holds onto his soul for all he is worth throughout the Game is Jeremy Northam's Sir Thomas More.  Natalie Dormer's magnificent Queen Anne Boleyn is forced to dig to the greater depths of her soul in her eleventh hour and the result is heart breaking.  The Earl of Suffolk, played by the physically exquisite Henry Cavill shows us what happens when one actually begins to go through a process of maturation.  Rhys Meyer's portrayal of Henry viii creates an image of infantile narcissism like no scholarly psychology paper is likely to be able to do.. although much has been written on the shadow side of narcissism in these last 30 years. The sense of entitlement of course goes with the territory .. but toss in a lack of empathy, grandiosity, suppressed and then uncontrollable rage, labile sense of being in the world, fear of humiliation and you are watching a brilliant study in personality disorder.  Rhys Meyers is so good at it that he comes close to being difficult to watch.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|while striving to write a meaningful book of soulsearching self discovery, this book seemed more self indulgent and light weight to me. i saw the author interviewed several times on tv and felt her &#34;pain of rejection&#34;and rejoyced with her new life but still thought she was pretty selfish in her choices and decisions.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love all of the Supernatural series, I hope Eric Kripke and the crew keep it going for alot more seasons to come.
B000URWYTS|4.0|a beautifully written book with lyrically descriptive word passagees that fairly sing off the page, sweeping the reader into a time ago age.  loved the book, knowing it was about real people gave it gavis tas.  i expect to read more literatue from horan.
0374531269|4.0|As an incoming high school student, I was required to read two books over the summer, one of which was \\"A Long Way Gone\\" by Ishmael Beah.     \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is the memoirs of Ishmael Beah as he is caught up in the Sierra Leone Civil War as a twelve year old and is eventually forced into the army as a child soldier. During his time as a child soldier, Ishmael learns that he is capable of inflicting much pain and violence than he ever thought possible.      The stories that Beah tells are remarkable. It is hard to believe that a young boy could go through so much, and still manage to stay alive and live a relatively normal life in New York City as he does today.      Although I very much enjoyed this book, it was far from the greatest book ever written. At some points it is hard to understand. Despite that, it defiantly manages to get its point across.     This book is very important and should be read by everyone. It gives the reader an idea of what went on and what is still going on today in Africa.     The most important part of the book that the reader should pay most attention to is Beah's time as a child soldier and his recovery. When Ishmael was on the run, he was a caring boy. When he was a soldier, he was turned into a killing machine. It is hard to read at sometimes.    After a group called UNICEF takes him out of the army, it is remarkable to see the transformation he makes from a killing machine back into a normal boy.     I would defiantly recommend this book to all teenagers and adults. It is a fast and easy read, which the reader will enjoy very much.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|an interesting look at different routes and  avanues to becoming successful and fulfilled.  a new and refreshing view of success which may attract alternative thinkers or educators.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|I've been a fan for years but this is Classic Bruce and The E Street Band. I love it! Just puts a smile on my face. If your a fan, this is a must have!
B000OVLBHG|4.0|Having watched this movie tens of times I am now an expert on every scene and one liners of this movie. The acting is mediocre but the script makes it all the best and enjoyable. It's an exciting movie. I've been a fan ever since it came out in late 1990s. There are also a lot of goofs in it for instance when Rico is injured and Carmen (Denise Richards) searches for his name on the screen she says I am surprised there are no wounded and then her colleague/mate says \\"Bugs don't take PRISONERS\\". She was talking about wounded while a lot of them were shown on that shot any ways. The director could be a lot more careful with those stuff. This is a sci-fi movie with the technological advantages of 1990s. I enjoy it every time I watch it.
0316017922|5.0|This latest is as interesting as Blink and Tipping Point.  I found the chapter on education (chapter 9) to be an unexpected surprise.  Also, chapter 5's discussion about the impact of demographic trough was fascinating for me, a late baby boomer.  Overall, I appreciate MG's thesis: that \\"success is not a random act [but] arises out of a predictible and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities.\\" (p. 155)  The variety of examples that MG uses to illustrate his theories in all three of his books broadens his appeal and \\"buy-in\\" for his ideas.  His writing style is plain-spoken, straight- forward. Always interesting...food for thought.
0385340567|1.0|I'll be brief.  This book is not worth your time.  Poorly written, poorly structured, and the author uses his iconic lead character to advance his political ideology.  The end of the book has a blatant slap at our heroic military by making the actions of cowardly deserters somehow noble.    I hope I saved you some money and time with this.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|Bought this movie just becasue I think Christian Bale is a highly under-rated actor. This movie did not dissapoint me at all. In fact, after watching this movie, I thought actually watching it again as soon it was over. It was a awesome movie and he did a great job being a \\"psycho\\".
0810970686|5.0|Just as much fun as expected.  My grandson couldn't wait to read it too and has passed it along to several friends.  Plot is easy to follow and too easy to relate to!!!  Having raised 4 children (3 boys) I can almost guess what will happen next!!  keep on telling Wimpy Kid stories!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|2014 update: In the wake of the folk-pop-group revival (both album and single/one-hit wonder-oriented artists), this album can be said to be very influential, and though it topped most magazine/blog end-of year lists when it came out, the Fleets still seem almost criminally underrated. They seem shy toward media, big appearances and music videos, and they don't go out of their way to produce a song with the aspects today's radio would see as a huge single. The Fleet Foxes' follow-up \\"Helplessness Blues\\" corroborated my 5-star review, live show is spot-on as well. Pecknold (Fleet's lead singer/songwriter) has said that this album wasn't as direct and coherent in its lyricism as the follow-up, and the mix was less crisp/detailed, but I think that's part of the poetry.<br /><br />Original review:<br />Saw these guys on SNL, and after the horrible musical guests SNL's had, they seemed like they were from another planet. Their harmonies are choir-like, though their melodies have a strength and ornamented contour of their own. \\"Fleet Foxes\\" has the unity of a concept album, consistent in presenting different facets of an overall experience. Within this world they create, are moments of happiness, wonder, tragedy, mystery and more.<br /><br />  The thing is, they don't let anything obvious pervade - the work excels in its ambiguity, its shading and transition. Aside from the more definate verses/lyrics, there are instrumentals, interludes (both instrumental and vocal) that begin to seem like events themselves, usually melancholy and mysterious, sometimes suspenseful, ALWAYS well timed. Speaking as a composer, their music is suprisingly patient and thought out - the drama of it is understated but archs effectively: (\\"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\\" builds to an emotional confession, then tinges it with a fading minor reprise).<br /><br />Musically, they do have alot of reverb, but it works, in fact it's essential to the ambiguity they create, and the choir-like beauty. It still seems intimate to me, and the instruments and lead vocal remain defined.<br /><br />Lyrically, rural imagery follows the music's lead (or vice versa?), and lyrics frequently hint at something that has happened or is about to happen - but the Fleets leave it at that - creating a haunted and universal effect.<br /><br />Songs:<br />1. Sun It Rises: melancholy, majestic opener<br />2. White Winter Hymnal: upbeat, melody has a charming arc (Pet Sounds anyone?)<br />3. Ragged Wood: a multifaceted, 3 part \\"experience\\", finale wins out.<br />4. Tiger Mt. Peasant Song: pensive, renaissance beauty and another climactic finale.<br />5. Quiet Houses: a sunny instrumental w/ sparse 'hooks'. I'm a sucker for Maj7th chords.<br />6. He Doesn't Know Why: several verses of a soaring melody, bursting into an unrestrained hook, soon humanized by harmonies.<br />7. Heard Them Stirring: an instrumental more pensive than \\"Quiet..\\", rollercoaster of different shadings.<br />8. Your Protector: most aggressive song, effective in its firey drama<br />9. Meadowlark: intimate catharsis after \\"..Protector\\", remarkable senstivity.<br />10. Blue Ridge Mountains: impossibly beautiful, seems to be the realization of alot of musical foreshadowing earlier in the album. Finale wins again.<br />11. Oliver James: Simple, understated and seemingly optimistic end.<br /><br />...I joined just to write this, still perplexed about how good it is. they take so many influences that are musically meaningful and create a world all their own.
0810979772|5.0|I purchased this for several children Christmas 2008.  In every case (there were 4) this was the present children returned to when they were done opening gifts and they continued to fill it in and make comments.  It opened communications with parents, grandparents, siblings, and friends who were in the room with them.  One grandson especially enjoyed completing cartoons and drawing his own.  These were 8-12 year old boys and girls who were more interested in video games than literature and they chose to read and write on Christmas Day.  Hats off to Jeff Kinney!!!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This Wall-E 3 disc set is amazing.  Not only do you get a bunch of extras, but you get a disc that allows you  to put it on your Ipod.  The case is a little weird.  You pull out either side to get what you want and I foresee sometime in the future I'll have to get a generic case, but as for content I can speak highly enough of how great this DVD set is.
0670020478|5.0|Dr. Robinson is one of the best minds of our time.  I have read his previous book \\"Out of Our Minds\\" and decided to read his second book after hearing him talking at TED meetings.  This book should be moved to the Business and Management section.  It complements the work of:  Marcus Buckingham on Strengths Movement and Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Outliers.\\"   The core idea of \\"The Element\\" is how to find your way and excel through empowering your strengths, talents and endowments, by not surrounding to how others see you, and how you had been educated.

B000EWBKKI|2.0|I understand now why the blu ray version is so cheap, it is not the uncut version, and after watching that version ten times before getting the blu ray, those extra parts are sorely missed and I feel cheated out of what is missing, and it's much more than the dream sequence. I suppose, as is the norm with hollywood marketing, they release the regular version first on blu ray, then I bet anything down the road we'll see the uncut version on blu ray, so they as usual find a way to cash in twice on many viewers.
B001A2ADIQ|5.0|I've been resurrecting my old vintage sound system over the past year.  As part of that process, I have completely cleaned and am now enjoying my vinyl collection again.  Years ago, my high school days, Teaser and the Firecat and Tea for the Tillerman were part of my original vinyl collection.  Having long lost these two albums, I was very pleased to find them again here on Amazon.Com.    The quality of these new pressings are first rate.  Each is the 180g pressings I believe they call them.  Heavier and reminiscent of the earlier days of vinyl.  Was anxious to play them and was pleasantly surprised at how good these albums sounded.  The cover art is also quite pleasant to look at again. It had been years since I had purchased any vinyl music, so I had no idea of what to expect.    I will no doubt be patching up holes in my collection from albums offered here at Amazon.Com!  Very pleased.    I highly recommend these two Cat Stevens albums.  Had all but forgotten how mellow and relaxing they are.  Every song has a message and every message touches you in some special way.
1878424505|5.0|The subtitles of this book are \\"A practical Guide to Personal Freedom\\" and \\"A Toltec Wisdom Book\\" and I believe that Mr. Ruiz makes a case for both in The Four Agreements. This is a short book (only 138 pages) but it is packed with practical, yet challenging, advice on how to live a more fulfilling life. The four agreements about which he writes are:<br /><br />Be impeccable with your word. Mr. Ruiz says your word is the power you have to either create or destroy. Recognizing this, we must understand the power of what comes out of our mouths. When we are impeccable, we take responsibility for our actions, but we do not judge or blame ourselves. Mr. Ruiz says that speaking the truth is the most important part of being impeccable with our word. We must stop gossiping. By becoming impeccable with our word, any negativity will eventually leave our mind, as well as our communication with those important people in our lives. Our self-esteem is directly proportional to the quality and integrity of our word. Impeccability of the word can lead to personal freedom and to huge success and abundance; it can take away all fear and transform it into joy and love. It's up to you to make this agreement with yourself.<br /><br />Don't take anything personally. Personal importance, or taking things personally, is the maximum expression of selfishness according to Ruiz, because we make the assumption that everything is about \\"me\\". Nothing other people do is because of you; it is because of them. Even when a situation seems so personal, even if others insult you directly, it has nothing to do with you. Their point of view comes from all the programming they received. If you take it personally, then you take their poison and it becomes yours. When you take things personally, then you feel offended, and your reaction is to defend your beliefs and create conflicts. You have to trust yourself and choose to accept or reject what someone says to you. When we really see people as they are without taking it personally, we can never be hurt by what they say and do. When you make it a strong habit not to take anything personally, you avoid many upsets in your life. There is a huge amount of freedom that comes from taking nothing personally.<br /><br />Don't make assumptions. The problem with making assumptions is that we believe they are the truth and we end up creating a whole big drama for nothing. It is always better to ask questions than to make assumptions because assumptions set us up for suffering. Making assumptions in our relationships is really asking for problems. Often we make the assumption that our partners know what we think and that we don't have to say what we want. We assume they are going to do what we want, because they know us so well. If they don't do what we assume they should do, we feel so hurt and say, \\"You should have known.\\" Making assumptions in relationships leads to a lot of fights, a lot of difficulties, and a lot of misunderstandings with people we supposedly love. We make the mistaken assumption that everyone sees life the way we do. If you don't understand, ask. Have the courage to ask questions until you are as clear as you can be, and even then do not assume you know all there is to know about a given situation. Also, find your voice to ask for what you want. Everybody has the right to tell you no or yes, but you always have the right to ask. If you don't understand something, it is better for you to ask and be clear, instead of making assumptions. Without making assumptions your word becomes impeccable.<br /><br />Always do your best. Under any circumstance, always do your best, no more and no less. But keep in mind that your best is never going to be the same from one moment to the next. If you try too hard to do more than your best, you will spend more energy than is needed and in the end your best will not be enough. But if you do less than your best, you subject yourself to frustration, self-judgment, guilt and regret. When you always do your best, you take action because you love it, not because you're expecting a reward. When you do your best, you learn to accept yourself. But you have to be aware and learn from your mistakes. This increases your awareness. If you do your best in the search for personal freedom, in the search for self-love, you will discover that it's just a matter of time before you find what you are looking for.<br /><br />Mr. Ruiz has shared four simple Toltec principles that if implemented in our lives, could potentially change everything. This book has the potential to positively impact how you relate to yourself and others.udgment, guilt and regret. When you always do your best, you take action because you love it, not because you're expecting a reward. When you do your best, you learn to accept yourself.

B0013V33DG|5.0|One of the most delightful opera performances you'll ever see, even if you don't like opera!  The singing is superb throughout the cast. Florez and Dessay are in top form and perfectly cast for their roles. The staging and acting emphasize the fun and romance that is inherent in this form of opera.
0060574216|5.0|Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus created quite a stir when it was first written in 1992 because of the veracity of its information. Dr. Gray explained in vivid detail why it is that men and women just don't speak the same language and often misunderstand each other in relationships. After reading this book, it is obvious that men and women have completely different, and sometimes opposed, needs from their relationships. Any person interested in making their relationship better would benefit from reading this book with its practical and simple explanation of the opposite sex.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This movie was well worth the ten dollars I spent on it. I want to buy the soundtrack now. N.P.H. is amazing.

B001EO748M|5.0|Love love love this season! The drama and the passion continues in Season 2 of The Tudors. This was a must buy for me after getting hooked on the First Season when it came out on DVD. Even though I know the story, I still find myself hoping for a different outcome. The actors make the characters come alive to the point that I get attached and hate that someone is going to have to die. Natalie Dormer is incredible as Anne and I hate that the season has to end the way it does, she will be missed. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is overwhelming as Henry and so passionate in the character that I have to remind myself that he is acting and is not the real Henry. Yes I am sure that some will argue that it isn't worth watching because of the historical missteps, but come on its entertainment. I love history - and read books and articles for the real facts, but I also enjoy great entertainment especially historical drama - and this delivers. The attention to detail in the costumes and sets is beautiful and a feast for the eyes. I can't wait for Season 3 but since I don't get Showtime I guess I will have to wait a little longer than others. Keep up the good work Showtime and if you are trying to decide if you should buy this - The answer is most assuredly a YES!
0446677450|4.0|Had I read this book 35 years ago (before it was written), I would have done a lot of things differently!  Going forward, I have changed my view of assets, liabilities, and spending.  I see myself in 3 of the 5 ways cited by the authors for why the financially literate don't develop abundant assets.  I also realized I had (accidently) done a few things right along the way.  Some of the best advice comes at the end when the authors share 10 tips for getting started.  I urge you to read and reflect upon the lessons in this book.  Then pass it to your children or grandchildren and insist they read it.  Apply the learning and improve your (their) financial future.
1577314808|3.0|I've been on the \\"spiritual path\\" for a couple years now.  The first book I read that made me go \\"ohhhhh\\" was Dan Millman's Way of the Peaceful Warrior.  I highly recommend it over this book and it covers the same concepts.    The main problem with this book is that in trying to transcend the Self, which is the primary goal of Spirituality, this book actually makes you obsess over yourself even more.    The best way to transcend the Self, and thus lose all your worries, is to love other people by making them happy, safe, and comfortable.  This means being friendly and kind in day to day life, donating money to charities, volunteering, etc.    When you are focused on others and on God (dirty word these days, I know) you forget yourself.      So, while this book is fun to read because you get to delve into yourself even MORE, I think it is ultimately counterproductive because it makes you focus even more on yourself and your worries, etc.    It might be a good place to start because it certainly gets your mind thinking in some new ways, but its not very practical.    The best guide for spiritual life I've found is The discourses by Meher Baba.  Might be hard to find, check your library.  But trust me, it's the best one!
1563899426|5.0|This is the beginning of great story involving intricate plot, interesting characters, and beautiful places. I would not recommend this book for those under 14 though, since it can be graphic sometimes. I would also not recommend this for anyone without a decent amount of free time. Once you get started, I have no doubt in my mind that you will get sucked in and go in read the other books in this series.<br /><br />This is not to be missed though. It is truly a unique and amazing book.
B000002OX7|5.0|This is a truely wonderful release, that showcases the Who in all their power.  Every tune is special, start to finish, from the introductory keyboard synthesiser opening in \\"Baba OReilly\\" to the final power chord of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".  Sandwiched in between is Daltry's scream in \\"Bargain\\", \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\", Entwhistle's comic rave \\"My Wife\\", \\"This Song Is Over\\", which references the theme that the original release was going to have (\\"Pure and Easy\\" is layered at the end as Townsend sings the chorus) that Pete later abandoned.  \\"Getting In Tune\\" starts melodically and builds the way most Who ballads do, \\"Going Mobile\\" showcases great synth and Pete's vocals, \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" need no description.  One of my favorite disks ever.
B000V3OKW0|5.0|After listen Casals, Yo Yo Ma, Tortelier, Anner Byslma, Rostropovich, I find the best record of Bach 6 cello suite!!<br /><br />Pierre Fournier penetrated the soul of this music, in dance stile, with elegance and beautiful tone!
B000002OX5|5.0|The Who showcase more of their comic side on this release, taking a swipe at the radio stations that they lived with.  There are commercial parities, songs about charactors, situations, etc. The release opens with \\"Aremenia City In the Sky\\", and then introduces you to \\"Mary Anne With the Shakey Hands\\", sung as a tender ballad about a girl with hidden talents.  \\"Odorono\\" is a beautiful song sung by Townsend about an antipersperant ruining a tender moment. Daltrey's vocal on \\"Tattoo\\" is lovely, and the harmonies behind him on the chorus showcase the Who's harmonic proficiency. There frequent commercial blurbs for products and English Pirate radio stations that sandwich the masterpiece \\"I Can See for Miles\\".  The engineering on the original release makes Pete's opening guitar chord on this ring. There are two re-releases, \\"I Can't Reach You\\", and \\"Our Love Was, Is\\" that showcase Townsend's song writing capabilities. The disk ends with \\"Rael\\", which is an indication of future Rock Operas by Townsend.  I recommend this for all.
B000001GXB|5.0|This is my dream's CD!!     I never found a hamerklavier like this...      The fugue of op.110 is better than any other pianist.    And the op.111 reveals the Pollini's spirituality
B000002P2W|3.0|Although this is the followup to \\"Quadrophenia\\" it lacks a lot of the power of the earlier disk.  The songs are poppy, and lack the angst that Townsend exhibited earlier.  \\"Slip Kid\\" is a good opener, \\"However Much I Booze\\" is a Townsend autobiographical piece that he sings well.  The single, \\"Squeeze Box\\" showcases Townsend on banjo during the middle break as well as the comic wit of the lyrics.  \\"Dreaming From the Waist\\" is an often overlooked tune that the band performed frequently live that showcases some of their better playing.  Daltrey's vocals in \\"Imagine a Man\\" are beautiful.  The second side begins with \\"Success Story\\" an Entwhistle tale about making it as a band, that also pays homage to a few older Who songs in the middle break.  The cover was also penned by John, to provide a humerous view of the boys in a connect the dots format.  In all, a good release, but quite a tail off from before, perhaps due to the band's drinking and binging at the time.

B000002P2V|3.0|This disk was released shortly before the passing of Keith Moon, who poses on the cover sitting in a chair labled \\"Not to be taken away\\". His best work long past him, Keith is noticably affected by the years of abuse. Daltrey seems to be trying very hard to hold things together, and does an admirable job vocally. John contribues \\"905\\" and \\"Trick of the Light\\" and does a good job vocally on the first one.  \\"Guitar and Pen\\" and \\"Love is Coming Down\\" are decent Pete songs, and this disk includes additional songs and demos that were not available before.  I recommend it for Who fans, but buy their earlier releases first.

0060555661|4.0|I am not an experienced investor, and maybe that's why I found I did not understand enough of this book to make it worth my time.  I am interested in jumping into the market (as soon as it seems like a reasonable time to do so), and picked up this book as a reference guide to help me get started.  But most of the material went over my head.    I think the audience for this book is mainly experienced investors or students studying finance.  Indeed, Benjamin Graham taught finance at Columbia University.    Now don't get me wrong, the book is brilliant.  I think it probably is, as Warren Buffet claims, \\"By far the best book on investing ever written.\\"  But only if you are already a knowledgable investor.  If you're just starting out, pick up a different book.
0743454537|4.0|Jodi Picoult is well known for writing books which tackle some pretty tough issues that usually involve some fairly young protagonist.  My Sister's Keeper is no different, but it is definitely one of the more heart wrenching books that will provoke as much discussion as it will outrage.<br /><br />For as long as she can remember, Anna Fitzgerald has been a doner for her sister Kate, who has a very rare case of Leukemia.  For years Anna has donated to her sister unquestioningly.  As she blossoms into a teenager, however, she does begin to have questions.  Is the only reason for her existence to keep Kate going?  And if that's so, is she at that point where she can make her own decisions about her body?  The novel explores this very thing when Anna decides to make a decision so great it ends up tearing apart a family that is already on the edge.<br /><br />One of the things Jodi Picoult does so well in My Sister's Keeper is really develop and flesh out her characters.  Each chapter is written from the point of view of one of the characters.  It gives you a lot of insight into each character, and helps you learn what each and every individual character may be thinking.  The characters jump off the page.  They each have their own distinct personalities and we really can begin to understand where they're coming from.  You won't agree with everything a character does or says, but it's nice that there's no one throughout the novel that is portrayed as the \\"bad\\" guy or the \\"good\\" guy.  It is just a book about a family going through a very rough time.<br /><br />Picoult also has several descriptive passages that deal not just with each character, but also what they all go through and how they've come to be who they are.  Picoult is known for doing meticulous research, and it definitely comes out here as we see all the different procedures that Kate goes through.  Her language is so beautiful that we as readers can be sucked into the story with ease.<br /><br />However, this may very well be the problem.  In some instances there are so many descriptions it slows down the story.  Every character has specific memories or flashbacks.  In the beginning this was nice to help us understand the characters, but 300 pages in, when the story itself is really picking up, we know the characters well enough that we shouldn't have to sit through another flashback to show us who they are.  We've already read through several.  There are also many parts where the story gets so bogged down in incredibly long metaphors that last anywhere from a few paragraphs, to one or two pages.  They're beautifully written, but they slow down many parts of the story considerably.  Some of which are critical.  It keeps you reading for the sake of knowing what happens next, but it makes us wonder if all these extended metaphors are really needed.<br /><br />Finally there's the books climax and ending.  I promise no spoilers, but it is most certainly not an ending that will please everyone.  For some it may ruin the entire book as a whole, no matter how beautifully written or heart tugging.  Picoult doesn't hesitate to pull on your heartstrings, but the ending might be pushing it for some readers.<br /><br />The paperback edition of the book also includes a discussion with the author which may give some insight into why Picoult did what she did.  There are also discussion questions for some readers who may feel compelled to discuss the book more.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper is a good read overall.  It has great language and characterization which may help people slog through some of the overly extended metaphors.  The only place I can't guarantee you'll like the book is its ending.  It's a gripping story that will have you immersed for hours, but some readers will not appreciate the way Picoult ties it all off in end.blem.

B001GQ2TGA|1.0|I love Enya. I own all her albums and have been following her music since the beginning of her career. I think she's an amazing artist, and her music is so beautiful that I could listen to it all day long. The material she produced during the 80s and 90s was excellent. Not so much since the 2000s. A Day Without Rain was ok, but I only liked a few songs on it. Aramantine was better. But, she fell way below my expectations with this one.    And Winter Came is one of the most awful albums I've ever listened to. I wasn't all that enthused about the fact that she decided to do a Christmas album in the first place. But even Christmas music is supposed to put anyone who hears it into a happy and mellow mood. None of the songs on this album does that. The arrangements are so dull that they make even classic Christmas music that everyone likes seem depressing and boring. Not even an ounce of real creativity or originality went into this album and it shows---very uncharacteristic of Enya! This is music that you should listen to only if you want to feel sad. I regret buying this CD and am going to throw it away.     A major let down!!!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|If you love the Australian funny movies, you will love this one. I love the story line, and the humour in this movie. My friend showed me this is college and I have liked it since. It has humour, romance and the good girls wins in the end.
0316067601|4.0|I've read some of the negative reviews and have talked to a Navy Seal friend of mine about it.  He loved the book but conceded some of his Seal buddies did not.  You can quibble all you want about the decisions they made once the mission was compromised.  As a story of human grit and determination (both the Seal training chapters and the Afghan mission chapters) the book succeeds completely.  I couldn't put it down.  One of the best books I read last year.  If you know a Seal, you will never look at them the same way again!  And I don't know about you, but after reading what their training is like, the \\"waterboarding\\" controversy strikes me as absurd.  These guys endured worse on a daily basis.
B0000696I0|4.0|After the sucess of the 1st film, it was clear that a 2nd installment of the TMNT saga was on the cards, TMNT 2 The Secret of The Ooze was bigger, more action packed and somehow still keeps the story intact.<br /><br />The story takes place am gueseing A few days after the 1st film, the turtles have got rid of Shredder and his Foot ninjas and have made New York city safe again.....or did they?, because somehow Shredder is back, he is P***ed off and has revenge on his mind, so now the turtles have to stop him once more but it won't be easy.<br /><br />TMNT 2 has some good characterisation which is always good to have in any movie, the action set pieces are once again fast and fun, the film also has some great funny moments, the only beef I got with the TMNT films is the movie soundtrack, for example Vilnila Ice? W.T.F.!....anyway dispite my beef with the music, TMNT 2 will keep kids, adults and TMNT fans entertained for 88mins
0142000655|5.0|Just a fantastic read.  The novel triumphs on many levels.  It is a compelling story, epic in scope (multi-generational) with complex 3-dimensional characters you can love, hate, pity and wonder at.  It is a history study of the emerging culture of California from it's agricultural beginnings to it's industrial age.  And it's a moving portrayal of the human animal, delving deep into what motivates us, what constrains us, what inspires us and answers the question, \\"Does our past, our genes, our parents and our experiences, doom us to a predictable future?\\"  And the answer is \\"Timshel\\".  One of the best novels ever written.
B0000696I1|4.0|Round 3, everytime movies get as far as 3, they always seem to fail, so TMNT 3 will get a mixed reaction from the fans, but at least it tried to take them somewhere else.<br /><br />Here's the story, April come to vist the turtles, she shows them this time scepter she got for Splinter, but somehow it starts up and sends her back in time to 17th century Japan, so now it's down to the turtles to go back in time to rescue her but they only have 60 hours to get her and get back to their time or they will be stuck there forever.<br /><br />I will give the filmmakers props for trying something diffrent with the characters, that is why I enjoyed this installment mainly for this reason  , besides seeing the turtles in full samurai gear is kinda strange and funny, the pace in this film is good, the action is fun as always and the comedy is ok also,  so the story may lack the edge the first 2 had and the acting may seem wooden at times but it don't matter!<br /><br />TMNT 3 may not be perfect but it's still a fun ride for all ages.
0743486285|5.0|While reading this book, I was amazed, shocked, appalled, and I loved every second of it!!!!  Wow!!! This is one of the best books I have ever read and certainly in the top 5 Rock books of all time.  This gives great insight as to what it is like to be a rock star.  It also sheds light on Nikki Sixx's life and what he was goin through at the time Motley Crue ruled the rock world in the 80's.  As a fan of Motley Crue and Nikki Sixx, I have often wondered what it would be like to be Nikki, and now I know.  The reality is not any different than the mystery, not to my surprise.<br /><br />Overall, you will love this book if you are a fan of Motley Crue, Nikki Sixx or 80s rock.  This book is full of good stuff.  If you are reading this, you will not be let down by this book.  Get the book, get the book, get the book!!!!!  You will not be disappointed.

1594481717|3.0|Pink's 'theory' rests on the assumption that the US has excessive wealth. As of this review, Feb. 2009, most Americans are sobering up to the fact that is not, and has not been, a reality for along time.     Given that is a central premise of the book, some of the other ideas start to fall, people will no longer buy $18.00 fly swatters because it has a designer label or 'story' behind it.    On the up side, his warning about 'investing' your career in techniques that can be automated is  true and will only increase with time. Therefore, if someone is in a profession subject to this, they need to cultivate creative or 'right brain' aspects of their career - ones that cannot be duplicated by computer, machine or outsourcing.     His point that wealth has not create happiness is again, valid, as is the creative opportunities to create meaning in life.
B0015FML06|3.0|I saw U2 on this tour, the famous War tour and the cd album does  not do it justice. It is tame and lame. And if you've seen the vhs/dvd show from Red Rocks, you know what I'm talking about. There are only a handful of songs on the cd and they are not even from one show, much less from Red Rocks. Producers of this one were too conservative.    I wish the band would release a cd of the Red Rocks show rather than this rehash. Good cd bootlegs are out there and back up what I'm trying to say.    And I can't help remembering the simplicity, the  honesty, the intimacy of the War tour when I see the circus the band now puts on. Last  two tours seemed forced and Hollywood. Check out the Red Rocks show here and you will see why we fell in love with this band way back when. Bono, get off your soapbox and find your mojo again!
B00004I9VE|1.0|This CD came as SACD Stereo which I did not notice on the cover so I opened it to play.  It will not play on any of our four CD players including the one in our car....and since it was opened, I cannot return it so I am stuck with a CD that I cannot play.  I had never heard of SACD Stereo and did not order it, yet that is what I received.  So I will not order CD's from Amazon.com again.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|Surprisingly this series is actually good, heck it's great. I didn't know what to expect, cause we all know The Terminator franchise is a lot to live up to. But this show simply delivers in all categories. It has action thanks to Sarah Conner and Cameron(the terminator). Drama between John and everyone who wants to protect him. Suspense cause you never know when they will be attacked next. As well as mystery cause to be honest, you think you know what's going on. But you really don't.<br /><br />Also since it's a series you have way more character development, than you would have in the movies. So even thou the show is called Sarah Conner Chronicles. It's really about John Conner and how he develops into the man that will eventually lead us to victory over the machines.
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton delivers a new paradigm for comprehending heredity  and evolution.  What is so promising for me is that it supports  common sense for once.  The author is scientifically consistent  throughout the book.  One gets a strong feeling of certainty about  his facts and his analysis.  Our experience not only can affect our   health and our survival, but also our genetics.  So genetic changes  are not relegated exclusively to the moment of conception.  The way  we respond to life circumstances can also affect the functioning of   our genes.  This book opens many new doors.
0451208706|1.0|Like being trapped in a Russian novel headed nowhere.  The daughter, eighteen years of age in the book, set in the years before WWI, has the mind of a six-year-old.  For instance, she didn't know \\"where babies come from\\" or the gestation period of a human fetus.  Such intelligence does, however, make her perfect fodder for the sophomoric sawhorses of socialism, so obviously embraced by Mr. Follett in the telling.  The protagonist, I suppose, is Feliks, the irresistable (to the ladies)Russian anarchist and murderer.  (Decades ago, humorist Stephen Leacock played this same situation for laughs in \\"Sorrows of a Super Soul\\" from his \\"Nonsense Novels.\\"  Would that Mr. Follett had done the same.)  Feliks, for a repeat murderer, is quite the handsome \\"man of the people\\", though it isn't developed why he keeps murdering so many of them.  But, the daughter (turns out it's his) and her mother cannot resist him.  The mother, whenever in the immediate vicinity of Feliks, becomes a quivering mound of corsetless lust.  The daughter is totally smitten by Feliks' ever-spouting socialist dogma.  Meanwhile, Feliks is plotting to kill Prince Orlov, a lifelong friend of mother and daughter.  I'll give away the ending, since I don't want anyone to waste their time reading this clunker.  Feliks kills the nice, young Prince Orlov, and dies while saving his daughter from a fire that he started.  The end.
B000056OBA|1.0|Although this is one of the best cycles out there, the remastering job DG did on it does more hurt than help (in my opinion).<br /><br />You get quite a bit of digital edginess throughout it, and a loss of the natural warmth and wonderful bloom from the original recordings.<br /><br />It's very difficult to prove this in a review but if you compare the original recordings to the re-mastered versions, you'll begin to see what I'm saying.<br /><br />Mind you, I love Karajan and his '63 Beethoven cycle (I give it 5 stars!), but I would say, stay with the original recordings in the gold and red box set...plus the packaging is so much more beautiful and is perfect for shelf display!
B0016MJ6HY|3.0|\\"My Blueberry Nights\\" features a sweet, delicate story perhaps overwhelmed by a too showy directorial style.  Norah Jones is very appealing, though, and supporting turns by Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Natalie Portman, and especially David Strathairn (as a troubled police officer who Norah meets on the road) lend gravity to the film.<br /><br />A brief making-of/behind-the-scenes special feature is mildly interesting, but it's outdone by a half hour or so onstage interview with director Wong Kar Wai, which took place at New York's Museum of the Moving Image.  The interview is illuminating and interesting, as the director discusses the film and the differences between directing in China and the United States.<br /><br />If you're expecting a lot, you'll find \\"My Blueberry Nights\\" a little underwhelming.  But if you're open to a simple story where emotions and feelings take precedence over innovative story points, you'll likely enjoy it well enough.

1595141715|5.0|I gave this book a five, not because I agree with the message in this book but because I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  I think the things Hannah went through weren't worth killing herself.  The book would've been much more believable if Hannah had actually went through more serious things or at least mentioned a mental illness.  The things Hannah went through are ordinary things.<br /> But besides all that its a good read.  I read it cover to cover in a day. The author has a lot of potential.
0060566108|5.0|I'l make this short... if you want the key principles of how to create a sustainable and simultaneously successful business - get this now. It does not contain the implementation strategy for this, rather examples and principles, nonetheless an essential book for any student of business success.    Brilliant - 5 stars!
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I have been waiting for over a month for this movie, and I still have not received it. I wrote an email to Wayne's World but they still have not sent me anything back. I first tried to get this movie from Ebay, well I didn't get it. Then I tried to get it from Amazon, I still have not received it. So I don't recommend getting it from Wayne's World.
B0017I91LI|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis does the very best he can with the material he has, and certainly the look of the film is immense and impressive. However the characters seem almost taken from some forgotten melodrama, DD Lewis included at times. A little too much Bill The Butcher in the film for me.   Not sure what to make of the ending. I'm finished here now.

0810970686|5.0|I Loved this installment of the Wimpy Kid Series.  Jeff Kinney is a genius.  He has managed to write a series of books that anyone would enjoy.  Whether you are 12 or 25 or 52.  His books are fun and his writing is appealing to people of any age.  As much as I enjoy his writing - I absolutely adore his cartoons.  That is probably my favorite part of his books.  They are simple, but hilarious.  His Shel Silverstein is top notch.  Greg's Mom makes me laugh every time.  His goofy friend Rowley...  I could go on.  He is definitely a skilled cartoonist and a great writer.  So, if you aren't afraid to embrace your inner child or if you're still the same age as your inner child I wholeheartedly recommend this book.  It's a quick read, it's highly entertaining, and will leave you desperate for the next one.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I gave this as a gift, and as far as I know the recipient is very pleased!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|First, I do love Will Smith.  However, I was a bit afraid this movie would be a tad too...well, mawkish.  But, I was pleasantly surprised with unexpected depth that Will Smith provided to pull it off.<br /><br />Smith's character wasn't always gentle or understanding with his son (although he was obviously under an immense strain), but the scene that sold the movie for me was when he and his son ended up spending the night in the BART public bathroom.  With Smith and his real life son, huddled on the bathroom floor, toilet paper scattered around in an attempt at creating a meager sleeping pallet and the tears of fear and desperation, that really touched me.<br /><br />I listened to the Pursuit of Happyness audiobook, but became too frustrated with the beginning to finish it (Gardner's mother raised her kids in a horrible, abusive relationship and just kept getting pregnant and becoming more dependent on the psycho, alcoholic, abusive man that threatened her family on a daily basis), but thankfully the movie didn't dwell on that portion of the book.<br /><br />Not only was this movie positive, but it was also amazingly free from excessive profanity and blatant sex, which I found refreshing.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a movie that rises to uplifting without being preachy or corny.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|I saw this in the theater back in the day. I thought it was great but everyone I knew thought it was crap. I can't understand. I didn't see the movie again for years up until yesterday, when I saw it was on demand and put it on. I had come to forget how great it was, sort of just going along with everyone who said it was crap, but I had to give it a chance. How could Tim Burtons crazy 1950's style martians not at least be slightly enjoyable. Well, I watched it, and sugar baby, this movie is GREAT! I must own it.<br /><br />I shouldn't have let my four year old watch it though. I forgot that some of the film is a little bit extreme for a four year old... he was into it, but some of the stuff I would have definately drawn the line at, had I remembered that it was there. Like the fact that pretty much everybody in the movie gets fried, and their skin melts off; and there are a few (to me zany, cartoonish and hillarious, but to kids...) disturbing deaths. There were a few scenes that the kid admitted being confused and freaked out by, and damned if I could explain. Save this one till they're in the double digits. When the aliens say they come in peace, they are joking.<br /><br />Still, since my kid guniea pigged this one for my review, he did still laugh his fat little brain off. In the end things get pleasant, but the whole movie is pretty much a cynical viewed desecratrion of human society. Warped characters all around. The ugliness and hypocrisy of mankind will never put a bigger smile on your face. And Tom Jones. I forgot about Tom Jones. This movie is GREAT! Did I mention that yet? Stars baby. I give this movie stars.
B0019X3YXM|2.0|*Spoilers Below*    Why does Hollywood feel the need to take classic non-American films and rape them until they're deformed beyond all recognition? It must be nice to make millions of dollars by doing nothing more than crapping on various works of art from other countries. I'm apparently in the wrong line of business.    First off, Jesse Bradford sounds like a weasel and gives a mediocre performance. Just watch his reaction after Elisha Cuthbert lies to his teacher - it's terrible. Cuthbert is your typical Hollywood actress under 30 years of age - very hot, but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Watching her try to be \\"sassy\\" is incredibly painful because at times her mannerisms are overly accentuated to the point where she looks like she's got a bad case of hemorrhoids. As far as supporting actors go, the guy who played the runaway soldier was dreadful, and the old man near the end was even worse. Ji-hyun Jun's performance in the original was no fluke. South Korea has at least 5 times as much youthful acting talent than the States. That's no exaggeration.    This is your typical Hollywood remake that reenacts a dozen or so scenes from the superior original in unimaginative, idiotic ways (ala \\"The Departed\\") in an effort to pander to the dim-wittedness and xenophobia of your typical American moviegoer who would rather slit their wrists than read subtitles. This is evident in the dialogue, which is way too cringeworthy for its own good. Every single line is opaque, thoughtless, and overly simplified to the point of sheer stupidity. Here are some direct quotes from the film:     1. \\"Death, man...death sucks!\\" 2. \\"I like you and the last three days have been some of the most interesting (if not painful) of my life. But my brain is hemorrhaging and my career is ruined and I just think it's better if we part ways.\\" 3. \\"Who would be intrigued by a hot, mysterious, passionate, possibly bipolar, violent, drunken, arrogant, rude woman?\\" 4. \\"Whatever she was going through - it was beyond anything in my experience and beyond my ability to fix. I had no right to judge her. If I chose to stay with her (knowing the risks) all I could do was give her love and respect and see how the story would end.\\" 5. \\"I'm sorry. He's just a guy my father made me go out with, but every second I was with him I was wishing it was you and that's why I called you tonight - I couldn't take it anymore. Charlie, I need you.\\" 6. \\"Hey kid, is this a subway platform or your own piece of drawing paper?\\" 7. \\"You know what? I know that you really don't want to hurt me.\\" 8. \\"Yessss, I'm free and I'm loving it. Train where are you. Wooo hooo. Choo choo.\\"    Hollywood translation: \\"We resent your lack of intelligence, so we are apparently forced to lower the quality of this film by providing superfluous exposition on the part of the characters for the sole purpose of explaining every little thing to you. You are incapable of extracting emotional content from subtle mannerisms, symbolism, or even the slightest bit of indirect communication. Yes, you are a moron, but if we talentless hacks want to make money, we simply need the characters to verbally and plainly explain every little emotion, lest you become completely lost.\\"     Am I the only one who realizes just how much Hollywood hates its own fans? At least 90% of their films are devoid of any and all subtlety. This is even worse in the case of remakes, because they must knowingly suck every ounce of intelligence out of the original film. Wake up people. You can cut the patronization with a knife. These movies scream, \\"You are an imbecile!\\" And yes, supporting them does make you an imbecile.    Oh, but that's not all. If the insipid, moron-proof dialogue weren't bad enough, this movie drops one of the most idiotic psychological twists humanly imaginable. Our two lovebirds decide to take exactly one year off so Cuthbert can heal her wounds, but she shows up 24 hours late because she needed one more arbitrary day for healing. That's beyond ridiculous. Only a Hollywood executive could think of something this mind-numbingly stupid.    The only halfway decent moments in this movie use concepts from the original. There's not a shred of well-executed originality to be found in this steaming pile of excrement. The only positives I can think of are a few pretty camerashots. Hence the 2/10 rating. The only comfort I have is that this vile garbage went direct to DVD. A small victory in the neverending battle against the cinematic dark ages that we Americans currently reside in. Cultural naivety, ignorance, repetition, and incredibly low standards seem to be the favored cinematic ideals around here as of late. However, I must say that the original Korean film is still nowhere to be found at your local video store. One might expect a simultaneous DVD release along with the remake. Such is unfortunately not the case.    People wonder why I generally hate Hollywood cinema as much as I do, but I ask you - my dear reader - how can I not? I don't like to be patronized by a bunch of talentless hacks in corporate suits who insult my intelligence by making a movie like this and actually expecting me to like it. Maybe I'm missing something, because everyone else around me finds comfort in this masochistic, self-hating existence. My fellow Americans may be flamboyant cowboys in terms of foreign policy, but in terms of entertainment they are the equivalent of abused housewives who keep coming back for more. Whether its ignorance or sheer stupidity, they just don't know any better.    May Hollywood burn in hell for all eternity. God knows they deserve it.
1402210086|5.0|I am a huge Georgette Heyer fan (I've read all except her most obscure/difficult to find novels), and this is one of my favorites!! I think some people may have found this book disappointing because it takes traditional regency plots but twists them in a delightfully unusual way. The hero is a bit different from most Heyer types, and although I had my doubts when I first picked up the book, he has definitely wormed his way into my heart as one of my favorite regency heroes. This book is such a fun read!! I still laugh out loud when I read it.
B001KMB6X2|1.0|When I first started watching I was happy. Then about 30 mins later I started lauaghing at the corneyist snowmoblie chase and then a touching\\" I love you man, can I have your bud light?\\" moment ever.  Then I cried because my brain tried to kill me for sitting thru the etire move.  WTF!  Even the DIRECTOR said this movie was direct quote \\" Stupid and violent\\".  I've seen better straight to video THAI movies where I couldn't even understand the language and had the budget of an american teens weekly allowance.  I gave this a one star because amazon doesn't have a picture of a middle finger poking the eye out of a puppy.
B000YAA68W|5.0|This was a compelling story, uniquely told in the form of animation based on Marjane's graphic novels, the simple black and white drawings subtly reinforce the poverty of challenges in Marjane's world.<br /><br />I found it engaging that she does not always portray herself in a positive light (partaking in childhood bullying, and later on falsely accusing a stranger of looking lustfully at her to deflect guilt from herself after being caught outside the home without her scarf).  However, Marjane is immensely likable and understandable, warts and all.  Her restless youth is unflinchingly recalled, with no whitewashing.<br /><br />Sometimes it was very funny (Marjane singing \\"Eye of the Tiger\\", gloriously off-key), many times it was poignant, and all too often terrifying.<br /><br />Courageous, and often just plain foolish, in her quest for self expression and realization, Marjane earned my sincere admiration as a spirit not only free, but very lucky.

B001BMKOZW|5.0|Man, this is the most catchiest thing ive heard in a long time. Great riffs, brilliant vocal melodies and funny as hell lyrics, some pretty deep and insightful too. You can hear from this album, who exactly is the musical mastermind behind System of a Down. Daron has mastered the art of writing great pop tunes and \\"heavying\\" them up a bit. So disappointed they have pulled out of \\"Soundwave 2009\\". If you like anything about SOAD you  MUST get this album.

B00192IOBA|5.0|This album is good, a little fluffy at times with I'm Yours and Lucky, which is not really as much his style. But this dude is pure talent, go buy his live stuff and everything he has come out with. His diversity in music styles is simply unheard of today in a culture that loves repetitious Nickelback. No one can compare to his musically diversity and talent.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|I love Paul McCartney's music, so maybe I'm biased, but this album blew me away. It's incredibly superior to Memory Almost Full and Chaos and Creation. The first time I listened to this album I wasn't sure whether it was one of the greatest albums I'd ever heard, or the worst. So I listened a second time, and then I realized that THIS is great music. It's doing something different, not just making more fun little pop songs (which I love). If you like Helter-Skelter-esque songs, then you'll love this album. I recommend \\"Highway,\\" \\"Sing the Changes,\\" and \\"Dance 'Til We're High,\\" but really the entire album is fantastic.

0307388921|4.0|If you've read anything by Palahniuk before, you should know what to expect from this novel; it has an (almost) unbelievable  twist ending, the protagonist is out of sync with society, the protagonist has women-issues - oh boy, does he ever...well, you get the point...<br /> But just because the guy is a little formulaic doesn't mean he's not a brilliant author, and just because  we might have been here before doesn't mean that this isn't a great book. One thing Palahniuk has going for him is his energy - you can feel it come across the page and slap you in the face. If Jackson Pollock had been a writer instead of a painter, or Vonnegut was a little grittier, or Bret Easton Ellis was a little more clever...well, that would Palahniuk.<br /> The male characters in this book are emasculated - kind of like in fight club - and, same as in that book, it is not their fault. A great deal of Palahniuk's work tends to focus on the emasculation of the male; how there is no place in society anymore for an everyday guy to be a hero, or a cowboy, or a Knight-in-shining-armor, or much of anything at all, because the world has become so safe and consumer-friendly. The Inner dialogue of the main character, Victor, explores his addictions and chick-issues yes, but also gravitates around the fact that he doesn't want to be soft and mushy; he wants to be a jerk, and in the end, both fails and succeeds at the task. If your male and ever had to deal with the expectations of your mother, all of this will seem strangely familiar to you...<br /> This book is a page turner; the dialogue may be a little stilted, but hey, what do you want from the guy, this is the way people actually speak in our `modern times.' Besides, the prose is so visceral and beautiful it gos a long way towards raising the value of his words.<br /> If your into cynical, subversive, humorous, and clever books, you'll probably enjoy novel.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Great cast, great story, buy all of the DVDs. This is the best 30 minute sitcom on TV today! It is clever, witty, and just hilarious. This show will be legendary.
0618871713|5.0|I didn't even know what a graphic novel was until recently, and only read this at the urging of a good friend and avid reader who is very selective in the books she recommends. I had this idea that graphic novels would be comics for adults and in some way \\"dumb down\\" reading.<br />Not so with Fun Home. The combination of great writing and well-done illustrations just increases the story-telling effect. Bechdel is able to show important things in the drawings that might have been hard to describe in the writing...especially at times when the writing is from a younger child's viewpoint. The illustrations show a lot of what is going on...that a child wouldn't recognize.<br />Bechdel is laugh-out-loud funny at times, makes up interesting words that truly should be added to the dictionary, and tells a compelling story. I'm recommending this book to all my family and friends. If all graphic novels are this good, I'm sold on the genre. (but I expect it will be like any books...takes great writing to make them work.)<br />and I agree that it's probably best NOT to know the story line ahead of time...makes for much more interesting and sudden twists.<br />Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help!

0375714669|4.0|The world of post-revolutionary Iran is one that I know very little about, and it was fascinating to see written and drawn here. Ultimately though, this volume was not as compelling as the first one. The conceit of the young author's conversations and confrontations with god with a backdrop of war and oppression was a lot stronger than the confrontations of a teenager with marriage and school.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you enjoyed the first volume, this is a required read that I suspect you will appreciate, if not adore as much as that one.

B000784WMW|1.0|I was very disappointed in this DVD of Jane Eyre.  The DVD is not an original, it must be a copy.  It skips all over the place.   Very poor quality.  I will never buy from this seller again.
B000023VR6|5.0|This album was stolen from my Jeep (along with multiple others) a number of years ago. I missed it and re-ordered it recently from Amazon, great memories were brought back to life as soon as I pressed play. Dre's \\"2001\\" comeback is classic!
B00004S6GL|3.0|3 1/2    It is a testament to this man's indie-pop songwriting finesse, that perhaps his least popular major studio offering, which has been criticized of inconsistencies, remains a pretty solidly engaging disc. It's ok not to call the influential arranger super-unique; Smith's gifts were for taking what had influenced him so profoundly and molding it in clever and exciting new ways. Few would be able to make derivative sound so fresh and inspired.

B00004VWA7|4.0|Essentially a series of high-noodling and free jams with a few exceptions, Pastorius still passes with flying colors due to a profound fluidity with his instrument. Some of the uptempo numbers exhibit an intensity that can rival just about anything this quintessential jazz-fusion bass player offers with WR, with Jaco's singular style of smooth-breakneck playing complimented by vibrant percussion in order to suck listeners right into the vortex of these jams.
B000V86OKG|4.0|Michael C. Hall does deliver a compelling, disturbingly simpathetic performance in this highly entertaining and inventive TV Series.<br />Writing is as sharp as Dexter's knife, the stories are tight, and the characters, three-dimensional (Season 2 goes deep into Dexter's conflicts; we feel like we only got a glimpse of Dexter on Season 1). The characters all evolve. Not once does the series underestimate its audience. That is a rarity in the field nowadays!!<br />And unfortunately, we live in a world where it wouldn't be overreacting to ask for more Dexters - that is, asking for the existence of more killers.... of killers. Violence is everywhere we look and watching Dexter is this sort of delicious escapism where the 'bad guys' are in for a treat.<br />Highly recommended, but its grisly nature won't appeal to everyone. If you're not into blood, this series isn't for you - and too bad, you don't know what you will be missing!

031606792X|3.0|After reading the first three books I just could not wait to read Breaking Dawn. This book was just OK. Nothing great about it. I think in this book Stephenie does a great job seeing that everyone gets what they want. At the end of the book I had hoped the vampires would just kill Jacob...I mean HELLO, how annoying can one person/warewolf be...I had hoped and waited for details about the wedding and then it seem like in one page it was over with. There wasn't that much detail...and the honeymoon night, no details at all. I know that it is a young adult book, but something would have been nice. They started kissing and then she woke up the next morning with feathers all over the place...No detail...Honestly, I had to skip the whole \\"from Jacob's eyes\\" prospective...I couldn't handle the unexcitment. It was so boring...  Books are always better than movies, or atleast that's my opinion and if they decide to make this a movie, I HOPE Hollywood kicks the excitment up a knotch.
B0000009SF|3.0|3 1/2    Putting his instrumental arranging abilities to the test, Zappa proves he can safely be labeled the Mingus of rock, offering a chiefly voiceless, whirlwind fusion trip that is certainly not without compositional excess. I personally find the second side much more connectable then the first's  show-offs which often do not necessarily lead anywhere with musical meaning. While it could have been a brilliant album from the brave anti-traditionalist icon, I will settle for startlingly good.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|'Once' really is my all-time favourite album by Nightwish. It is nothing short of magnificent. There's such variety between the songs, the instruments, the composition. Tuomas Holopainen is a musical genius and undoubtedly one of the best composers of the modern era, and, in my opinion, of all time. However, this was (alas!) Nightwish's last album to feature frontwoman Traja, but she certainly makes it count; her voice can be both powerful ('Romanticide' gives me the chills!) and heart-breakingly soft and mournful, as heard in their beautiful Finnish ballad 'Kuolema Tekke Taiteilijan'. Wonderful to hear them singing in their native language, as well.<br /> Marco also does a magnificent job in songs such as 'Wish I had an Angel' and 'Planet Hell'. This has got to be the crowning achievement for a group of the most talented musicians I've ever had the honour of listening to. There is no weak song present, but, without a doubt, my favourite track (and Nightwish's greatest song ever, in my opinion) has to be the breath-taking 'Ghost Love Score'. But 'Creek Mary's Blood' is certainly not far behind!<br />This album is timeless. I've owned it for several years now, and I love it more than ever. For anyone just getting into Nightwish, this is a wonderful place to start - though all of their work has been uniformally magnificent, even after the loss of Tarja (Anette is lovely in her own right, but she ain't doing them any favours vocally - sorry!)<br />I recommend this album to anyone with enough depth and sophistication to appreciate the power, complexity, mystique and sheer passion of symphonic metal. :) Long live Nightwish!

6301969294|2.0|Can people improve on the past? Can you be successful without compromise? Howard Roark finds a job. Is he proud and arrogant? Should the form of a building follow its function? [Who decides on what function?] Was Henry Cameron right or just an old crank? Is Howard Roark a young genius or just a crank? Is Roark doomed to fail? A telephone call brings business, but they want a change to follow popular taste. \\"Can you beat that?\\" Mr. Wynand wants a new building, he gives the public what it wants. [Who decides that?] Dominique Francon seems incredible in her outlook. Mr. Wynand has a cruel choice for Peter Keating. There are philosophical discussions about power. Do the rich always get their way? Are the characters believable?    Men are working in a quarry. Dominique is haughty. She wants a marble tile replaced. Will Roark be able to satisfy her? Can \\"The Banner\\" find a topic to boost circulation? What about a luxury apartment that uses a new form of construction? [This exposes \\"Yellow Journalism\\".] Does the media fool a gullible public as a joke? [Do you believe everything you read in a newspaper?] Are the rich and powerful that shallow? Is the dialogue pretentious or believable? Do the rich hate the honest and incorrupt? Would Dominique marry Mr. Wynand on a whim? [Is this film unintentionally funny?] Roark manages to survive and succeed. Mr. Wynand wants Roark to build a home that is like a fortress or temple, away in the country.    Gail Wynand makes Roark an offer to build many buildings; he accepts. The problem in Cortlandt Homes is economy: building at a low cost to make much money for the owner. Can they build cheaply and simply. Roark will design the building on the condition that the design won't be changed. Wynand wants a building as a monument. The owners demand changes in the design. [Balconies for each apartment so tenants can enjoy the outside.] But Roark has a plan to get his revenge. What terrorist would destroy the building? A mad egoist? There is thequestion of \\"self-sacrifice\\". \\"Public opinion is what I make it.\\" [These persons seem like cartoon characters, or lunatics.]    Wynand discovers the public can think for themselves when \\"The Banner\\" no longer sells. His Board of Directors insist on changes. Roark addresses the jury and makes a rhetorical plea. Is there such a thing as society? [Some of the arguments are idealistic nonsense.] \\"Can a man exist for his own sake?\\" Can an individual exist apart from society? The jury returns their verdict. Is it as believable as this story? What other work of fiction would make a hero out of a mad bomber? The problem with a message movie is the public is not prepared to accept a viewpoint they don't agree with. One redeeming social value of this film is you won't have to waste more time reading the novel. Did you find some of the ideas to be at odds with reality? What would happen to America if a disciple of Ayn Rand would gain a position of power such as head of the Federal Reserve? Would he serve the needs of society or act for his own selfish interests?
B001CD6FKS|5.0|Speed Racer is a gem of a film.  I have no idea why it got panned by critics, or why some people don't like it.  The only explanation I can come up with is that they either didn't get it, or were expecting something else.      I'll tell you what Speed Racer is....it is the most perfectly executed live-action cartoon you'll ever see.  Yes, that's right, you read that correctly.  Not only does it feature some of the most jaw-dropping eye candy ever, but it's edited in such a way that the whole film is basically a rollercoaster ride, which culminates in one of the best movie endings on film.  I've watched it multiple times, and I still feel the energy of the ending, always keeping me at the edge of my seat, cheering and singing, \\"Go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer go!\\"    The film itself follows a very anime-like form of storytelling.  A lot of the story is shown through flashbacks, with some clever transitions to move it along.  Anyone who's used to watching anime will feel right at home and will have no problems understanding what is going on.  Those that are not might be confused as to what's happening, because they are used to a straight forward way of storytelling.      Now, for the BD itself.  This BD transfer will make your HDTV look so damn hot!  I'm not kidding - you show this to your friends and family, and they will be amazed at the beautiful picture.  My mother, who most of the time can't tell the difference between HD and SD, actually talks about how good Speed Racer looks.      The BD version is definetly demo video material.  The only knock you can give this disk is in the audio (Warner skimped a little on this regard).      Ending thoughts.....Get this film....it rocks! 'nough said.

1595141979|5.0|So it took me a week to read all 3 books in this series.  I just wrapped up Shadow Kiss last night and by far is my fav of the lot.  Ms. Mead did such a wonderful job at building these characters. SHe truely made me care about them as if they were people I knew.  I laughed and at the end I cried.  I still can't get it all out of my head.  I can't wait for the next installment.  These books may be geared towards a YA audience but I am in my early 30's (did I just admit to that?) and fell head over heels for these books.  Keep em'coming Ms. Mead.  In a time that seems to be over run with vampire books you shine brightly.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|It is incomprehensible how Sony could create a gamepad without triggers. Thankfully, Messiah's trigger add-on works perfectly. Mine have never fallen off or come loose despite heavy use. At only $5 you would be stupid not to buy these.
B0000640VO|5.0|Its a shame that some people are too immature to embrace such a wonderful film because of stuck-up and prudish judgements. There are scenes in Amelie showing, for example, the results of her wondering how many couples are having an orgasm in Paris right then..  or showing the interior of the sex shop where Nino works. A great movie like Amelie makes it all the more sad to realize how uptight and musty people can be.  If that werent so I would lend my mother the movie to watch.

0676979025|5.0|Everyone has been to a zoo but virtually no one dislikes it.  In the book, Life of Pi, written by Yann Martel, not only does Piscine Molitor Patel, known to all as Pi, get the joy and excitement of going to the zoo every day, his family owns the only zoo in Pondicherry, India.  One year Pi's family decides to move to Canada and they must take all of the animals with them.  They travel on a large Japanese freighter that unfortunately has mechanical problems during their voyage.  The boat is flooded with water and Pi is thrown onto a lifeboat with many animals from the zoo.  Pi must now survive with limited supplies and an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra with a broken leg, and a threatening 430 pound Bengal tiger as his only company.  Pi is faced with extreme adversity and is desperately waiting for rescue to save him.  One of the main reasons that Pi makes it through his horrible experience is his strong faith his religions.  He partakes in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism.  Pi is a very smart and religious boy.  He likes to see the world in all different angles.  This is why he participates in three religions.  Pi relies on his faith to help him through the many rough times that he has at sea.  He is always able to persevere though because he has faith that he will be saved.  Pi also bonds with the animals on the lifeboat and treats them as his companions.  I thought that Life of Pi was and extraordinary read, that can easily be enjoyed by a wide variety of readers.  Although this book has a slow start and can lose the reader's attention, I would still recommend this book to any enthusiastic reader.  The plot is very original once you get into the book, you will not be able to stop reading until you discover the fate of Piscine Molitor Patel.
0743486285|5.0|[[ASIN:1416511946 The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]    I bought this book back in 2007 and couldn't put it down.  Very honest and kept me interested throughout.  It takes alot of courage, in my opinion, to be able to talk and write about one's addiction and the hell Nikki Sixx went through until recovery.  The emotions, feelings, using drugs, relationships, and so on.  The CD by Sixx:A.M. is also a definate must have to go along with the book.  13 Chapters...13 Tracks.    Both are incredible! Loved reading the book and love listening to the music!!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I received the VHS tape version of this series as a gift a few years ago and enjoyed it very much. With a new HD TV and Blu-Ray player, I was looking for an HD version - - which is not available. This standard DVD set is at least in wide-screen format and looks very good when upconverted by my Blu-Ray player. With very few exceptions (i.e. a shot of a Saturn V lifting off when it should have been a Saturn 1-B), the accuracy and attention to detail is quite amazingly accurate.
031606792X|3.0|Great seller, totally trustworthy. It's a good book, not a great book. It's a must read if you've read the other three. You need closure, right? Happy endings for everyone, which makes the story a little too 'fluffy'. Still, some good scenes stick in my head.
B0013D8LOK|2.0|i'm not the biggest tim burton fan, he seems to be a one note song darn near evereything he does seems to be the same.<br /><br />it's an interesting thing that the \\"demon barber\\" as depicted in this movie is the handsome johnny depp made up to look like a cartoon character and the authority figures of judges and cops are made as ugly as possible. i mean i've never seen alan rickman look so unkempt and homley. the blood is in comedic proportions and the \\"creepiness\\" is totally blown by the over the top mannerisms.<br /><br />in this version of sweeney todd the man is made up to be a victim of everything around him. the judge who condemned him, the woman who obsesses over him and feeds his obsession. yet his outlet for this victimisation to randomly kill members of the comunity, which totally ruins any victim sympathy one might feel for him. overall this movie was pretty crap and just not interesting.

0316017922|4.0|Malcom Gladwell has done an admirable thing with \\"Outliers,\\" his new book that succeeds his bestsellers \\"The Tipping Point,\\" and \\"Blink.\\" No, it isn't the fact that he has given us yet another \\"ahah\\" moment of elucidation and tingly cognitive dissonance. Nor is it his significant accomplishment in showing us the limits and vanity of ego, pride, arrogance, shame, or disappointment over our successes and failures in life--at least where we've worked hard and given it our all. His accomplishment, in this reviewer's humble opinion, is even greater. Knowingly or not, Gladwell has illuminated the value of determinism and naturalism in understanding how our world works. If he is right, he has moved us one click along the path to better using this knowledge to improve the quality of life on earth.<br /><br />Gladwell's central premise is a counterintuitive blast to conventional wisdom: the most important causes of outstanding achievement and/or financial success are not talent, brilliance, or even biological in nature. The most relevant causes are external, circumstantial, and environmental. Let's go ahead for the time being and call it \\"luck.\\"<br /><br />Your reaction to this concept might be strongly negative. In some knee-jerk way, mine was too. As a strong advocate for solid scientific methods, my first reaction was to attack his \\"science,\\" which others have done. More on that in a minute, but the point is that the reaction is presumably normal. In fact, I've now spent years overcoming and writing about my own myopic worldview in favor of rugged individualism, wherein the only excuse for failure is our inability to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, read biographies, and repeat the success of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, John Rockefeller, or Andrew Carnegie. Perhaps if I'd just read a few more books by Steve Jobs or Jack Welch, I would have gotten to the promised land already!<br /><br />Now before you \\"stop this madness\\" by killing the messenger, this may help: Gladwell reinforces the notion that hard work and practice are essential for greatness. To that end, Gladwell says that whether it is becoming a violin virtuoso, an industry titan, or a brilliant writer, there seems to be a magic threshold of around 10,000 hours of diligent effort required to achieve proficiency worthy of such greatness. From Mozart to Tiger Woods, these rules appear immutable. In fact, Gladwell argues that the 10,000-hour rule is more important than superlative talent, brainpower, genetics, or many other factors to which we typically and readily attribute success.<br /><br />But the crucial point of Gladwell's work surrounds the variables that we choose to ignore in our fiercely capitalistic, individualistic world: namely, all the planets that align to provide you the opportunity to get those 10,000 hours in the first place, to access the knowledge and information. And if you are lucky enough to be in the right place, at the precisely perfect time in human history, you might even become unfathomably wealthy as a super success--an \\"outlier.\\" If you are born at the wrong time, however, you could at best live a mundane existence grinding it out like the rest of us, or at worst ... well, you know where that goes: wars, genocide, starvation, disease, dark ages, depressions, etc.<br /><br />Outliers begins with a fascinating and incontrovertible story about the amazing distribution of birthdates among the best junior and professional hockey players in Canada. It turns out that virtually all the great hockey players are born between January and March. Say what? How does that make sense? This is the strictest of meritocracies, and only the best of the best children work their way through the religion that is Canadian hockey. Shouldn't we expect that any child with the talent and will to play the national pastime could make it to the big leagues? Do children born in August not like hockey? Are they just no good at the game for some reason of astrology or something?<br/><br />In short, Galdwell explains that when kids are young and competing all-out to be noticed, get the ice time, get the best coaches next year, and be promoted to the premier group in the next age range, there exist significant developmental differences due to age. When you were born--and the cutoff age at any given level--is a make-it or break-it variable that skills, genetics, and perseverance can essentially never overcome. The kid who is almost seven, versus the kid who just turned six but is on the same team, is going to be faster, bigger, better developed, and will almost always win out as the preferred choice for promotion to the next winning team. Compound the effect year after year, and only the January through March births ever have a realistic chance of achieving greatness, even though the natural talents and level of commitment of kids born in October could be just as great. We think success is based entirely on merit, but in fact it is not. Other factors apply, such as the month in which you are born.<br /><br />From here Gladwell moves to Bill Gates and some of the great leaders of the PC revolution. Clearly Bill has relied only on his brains and raw determination, right? Well, Gladwell compellingly shares Bill's unique story, and implies that through interviews Bill has affirmed his agreement with Gladwell's characterizations; Bill Gates was very lucky. Gates had an unfathomably fortuitous break that granted him access to a computer programming terminal at a time when few computer experts in the world had such access. He got 10,000 hours of practice long before even the great computer experts of the day, due to his age, his freedom, and being in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Bill Joy had a similar story. He was a major force behind UNIX BSD, did a major rewrite of JAVA, and co-founded Sun Microsystems; a large chunk of his code still runs on Macs today.<br /><br />Bill Joy went to the University of Michigan to study biology in 1971. Turns out he discovered computers at one of the first universities in the world to abandon the tedious punch card systems in favor of real-time programming terminals. Though time on the terminals was limited, this provided much greater productivity than most programmers in the world could have imagined at that time. More significantly, Joy then accidentally found a glitch when logging onto a terminal--a glitch that gave him unlimited access! He dove deeply into programming, abandoned biology, and had his 10,000 hours of programming experience at a time when he, Gates, and perhaps a handful of people in the world could accumulate such experience. Combined with his generation's unique position in history, when anyone older was entrenched in a mainframe paradigm and anyone younger would be too late to spearhead the computing revolution, and you get a perfect storm of opportunity.<br /><br />Steve Jobs too, of Apple Computer fame, had unique access to early programming experience. Gladwell even relays the circumstances of some special help for the lad, from none other than Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard fame). Jobs had access to Bill Hewlett?<br /><br />Importantly, there is also a birth-date coincidence among the Silicon Valley elite, as with the hockey players from Canada. 1955, much like the tipping point of the 1830s--when Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Marshall Field were uniquely positioned for great success during a pivot point of human history--this information revolution was similarly magnificent. To learn more about these punctuated points of innovation, examine the new book by futurist and demographer Harry Dent Jr., \\"The Great Depression Ahead.\\"[[ASIN:1416588981 The Great Depression Ahead: How to Prosper in the Crash Following the Greatest Boom in History]]. Mr. Dent has been chronicling macroeconomic trends and \\"tipping points\\" for some while. While his prognostications have produced expectedly mixed results, the retrospective elements of his work are relevant to Gladwell's arguments.<br /><br />You get the picture, though Gladwell delves further into fascinating thoroughfares and side roads along the road to the cause-and-effect circumstances behind \\"outliers\\"--those unique and extraordinary individuals that lie outside any mathematically definition of \\"normal.\\" Throughout, the theme is relatively simple: whether examining studies that show IQ and talent don't matter beyond a certain threshold, cultural factors that affect why airplanes crash, influences of skin color on economic circumstances, language differences that make math retention easier in Chinese, or the unique circumstances that catapulted the Beatles to greatness--there are requirements for greatness. These include some minimum level of competence and diligence, and over 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. Still, these requirements alone are nowhere near enough. For every \\"outlier\\" there are complex, causal factors that together produce the success effects, and the words \\"environment\\" or \\"luck\\" come to mind.<br /><br />Now, is Gladwell writing hard science here? No. Are there leaps and conclusions that often seem to stretch what little evidence is presented? Yes. Could some of his conclusions be off-the-mark non sequiturs? Yes. Still, are there certain concepts and illustrations that make the point while employing empirically testable and seemingly uncontroversial claims? Sure, such as with the birthdates of elite Canadian hockey players. For these reasons, and one more, I highly recommend Gladwell's thought-provoking book, Outliers.<br /><br />The additional poignancy and relevance of Outliers to my world, to our troubled economic times, to education, to violence, to social problems and to virtually all other questions of public policy, is what is most profound about Gladwell's book. Intended or not, Gladwell makes a brilliant case in support of a naturalistic and deterministic worldview--as the most useful method for improving the human condition. It is a worldview that seeks to learn about how the world really works--not how we want the world to function--through our likes and dislikes, superstitions, or fabled narratives. It is a worldview that sees earthly events as a set of interrelated causes and effects.<br /><br />Let's face it, most of us can think of few things that cannot be explained, at least in retrospect, as anything other than interactions of natural events. They may be complex, and science may not even understand them yet, but atoms collide, chemicals interact in the brain, and events unfold. Just two broad categories of variables--environment and biology--come together in a complex cause-and-effect process that in retrospect makes events appear almost predictable. Don't jump the gun now; this is not fatalism, or predestination-ism. But just thinking this way can fundamentally change everything.<br /><br />Does that \\"loser\\" who can't seem to replicate Bill Gate's success--despite taking all the risks and working diligently--really deserve our ridicule as a \\"mental midget.\\" Does better understanding of what got an individual or society to this point in life and time not supplant arrogance, shame, intolerance, and persecution? With better understanding might we be able to help kids born in September to become world-class hockey players, or inner-city youth learn to read?

B000N2HBSO|4.0|Many little tidbits to read and learn; such as the fact that there wasn't enough cases for a lawyer in the many small cities, so they followed a judge around the State.  Up to 6 lawyers would sleep in a room sharing 3 beds (out of financial necessity), for weeks on end.  Interesting stuff.
0743289684|4.0|So well written is this book that one of the members of our Book Club raised the question, \\"Is it too well written?\\"  We don't think so, but the story Ali tells will stick with me for a long time.  I have a different idea about Islam and terrorism.  I have more sense of what life may be like in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and Holland.  An excellent autobiography.

B001PPGAIA|5.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it was release late last year given all the hype, and was not dissappointed!    Director, Baz Luhman, has served up a slab of nostalgia ala Australian style with all those beautiful elements we love from films of the 40's and 50's, breathtaking, sweeping landscapes, gorgeous costumes and two fine actors in Kidman and Jackman who get the essence of the film. It nostalgia in every sense of the word, in every frame. The acting style reminds us of Bogart, Grant, Bacall and Dunne. The story is epic in every way and just lovely. I loved the salute to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"a really nice touch!     Of course we all know how it's going to end. Watching Australia was like eating a box of Quality Street chocolates. Sure I know what I'm getting, but I still love it.     For those of you who want to spend a few hours (and I mean a few; it's almost 3 hours) being completely entertained then thisis the movie for you. I only wished they had inserted an interval on it's theatrical release and made the whole event at the movies a real nostalgic experience.     I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like this movie, unless you just aren't up for a feel good picture. I want to see more movies being made like this!!!! Well done to all!!!
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|[[ASIN:B001GZ6QBU The Dark Knight (Full-Screen Single-Disc Edition)]] This is one of the best Batman movies I've ever seen. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. Heath Ledger truly deserves all the critics' accolades.
6304698526|5.0|Steve McQueen was usually worth watching no matter what he was in, and he's excellent here as an intense but low-key cop. It's a pretty solid police thriller which features a famous car-chase scene that set the standard in its day.     What's interesting to note, according to a documentary on the DVD, is that McQueen did his own driving! No stuntman for him, even at 110 miles per hour through the streets even the up-and-downf streets of San Francisco.    Robert Vaughn, Don Gordon, Jacqueline Bissett, Simon Oakland and Robert Duvall complete the big-name cast, but this is McQueen's movie all the way.....and, for a film about 40 years old, it's not very dated.
B001GKJ2FM|3.0|.[[ASIN:B001GKJ2FM Mamma Mia! The Movie (Full Screen)]]Mamma Mia was, in my opinion \\"good\\".  Not the greatest, some of the actors chosen to play the characters in Mamma Mia were not suited for the roles.  I love Pearce Brosnan in anything but he can't sing to save his soul! Meryl Streep is a great actress but not in this role. Not convincing enough. Sorry! I preferred her in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\".
6304884419|4.0|Here is a realistic-looking and an involving story of the street life in New York City's Bronx section in the 1950s and 1960s. Excellent acting and a good job of re-creating the era and  atmosphere are main things going for this film. Also the soundtrack is very, very good.     The main problem I have with the film is the fact that a cold-blooded killer is made to be the hero - a guy that you root for! Unbelievable. Playing that killer is Chazz Palminteri, who outperforms the more famous and great actor and co-star Robert De Niro. Actually, the co-star is Lilo Brancoto, who was in the news severral years ago for allegedly committing a major crime himself.    It may have a bad message, and gives a couple shots at the Catholic Church along the way, but the characters and the story keeps one tuned to the screen for the full two hours. It was good to see De Niro play the honest, hard-working bus driver who wants his son to have character and not emulate the local hoods.    This is a not a movie for those who wince at the f-word because it's used frequently. This is more of man's movie, really, with males dominating and some good advice on dating and what to look for in women!  Actually, there are so many mixed messages in here - good and bad - it would make your head swim, but it is a crime film very much worth investigating.
B000ZN802W|4.0|McCandless' story is incredibly interesting.  This movie is well done by the director, Sean Penn, and well-acted overall.  It is a movie you really should watch, but don't get carried away by the touch of romance of adventure this story evokes, for McCandless truly was unprepared and thoughtless in regard to what he did. Even if his parents fought and weren't perfect, they deserved better than they got from him.  While this story is absolutely fascinating, no one should entertain the idea they would do what he did. As an entertaining film, especially if you like adventure, survival type things as I do, I think it is one you would watch more than once, just don't emulate him all you young men out there..
B00139W3NE|1.0|As a person who's read the book, I can say the movie's done a pretty good job in adapting the magical world.<br /><br />However, it does have this empty feling after the movie has ended. ( i guess it just tried to compress too much and jumped too fast in a 2 hr movie).<br /><br />It felt it lacked the personal touch of a true sci-fi. They relived too much on the special effects to carry the movie and I felt the actors weren't believable enough.<br /><br />As if they were saying hey viewer, this is sci-fi, so why should I give it my good gun-BLEEP. (even though I just think Daniel Craig is sexy even when he acts fake.)<br /><br />The book was much more enjoyable and I'd certainly wait until the DVD if you're really that interested, but I'm was just passing the time and I'm glad I went to an early show<br /><br />Although I'm kind of disappointed I still spent any money on it.<br /><br />Grade: C - -

B000LC55F2|4.0|In the movie, The Prestige, you learn a magician provides the audience with three acts. (You must keep these in mind as you're watching the entire movie because it's the whole bases of what's going to happen. Incidently, this isn't a sleep on it movie, because every scene is crucial to the ending and figuring out the movie).<br /><br />Without spoiling it for those who are waiting for DVD (I went to the dollar movie for this baby,) I'll try not to mess it up for you.<br /><br />The three acts are:<br /><br />The pledge: The performer shows you something ordinary<br /><br />The turn: The ordinary does something extraordinary.<br /><br />The Prestige: You see something you haven't seen before.<br /><br />Christain Bale (from Batman Begins) and sexy Hugh Jackman (if you don't know him then fooey on you), play friends, who become rivals after Christain makes a mistake and ties a knot wrong on Hugh's wife (but he says he can't remember and I'd like to get the movie on DVD just to find out exactly what knot did he really tie.) This rivalry becomes so vicious that it becomes a battle or a horrible game of tag. (It doesn't look like they want to kill each other, but they definitely are trying to come close). Until one of them dies and the other is charged for the crime.<br /><br />Now I know why they call it the Prestige, but I couldn't figure that out until the end because I didnt' expect the ending at all.<br /><br />To find out more about this movie, check out yahoo at:<br />[...]
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Believe the hype. Slumdog Millionaire, the latest film from Trainspotting director Danny Boyle, is every bit as amazing as you've heard. It's sweet, it's funny, it's tense, it's uplifting, it's spectacular!    The movie tells the story of Jamal, a young Muslim boy (played at various stages by three different actors, but most notably by Dev Patel of Skins fame), who grows up in the slums of Bombay/Mumbai. These slums are the sort of places governments ignore until either a: they catch on fire, b: there's some major world event, like the Commonwealth Games, on the way and they want to clean up the place, or c: the people who live there make them pay attention.    Through a series of unlikely events, ends up on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, where he's about to win the highest jackpot ever. This, of course, leads to questions: is he cheating? How can he be doing this? He's just a boy from the slums, what does he know?    As the movie unfolds, we see exactly how he answers the questions: he relates them to moments in his life. His knowledge of American currency, for example, comes up from a blind beggar boy who told him the name of the man whose face is on the $100 bill. There's another moment where he reads a person in a \\"The Lady or the Tiger\\" kind of way, trying to figure out if the answer the man fed him is real, or a bluff (for the record, I got the answer right before anything was fed. I have no idea why. It's not like I follow cricket, but at some point I must've picked up that bit of trivia and it stuck in my head, rather like with Jamal).    The movie is as flawless as anything I've ever seen. Sure, it's unrealistic; a fairy-tale, basically, but who cares? It's beautifully told with some incredibly good acting and writing. The fact that Dev Patel is not up for an Oscar goes to prove that the Academy is pretty out-of-touch with the world. Well, that plus the fact that they give thirteen nominations to The Curious Case of Benjamin Boring. Eventhe music is noteworthy. I may well pick up the soundtrack.    I cannot possibly praise this film high enough. It is a wonderful, delightful, uplifting movie. If you have a choice this weekend between seeing this and, say, My Bloody Valentine, see this. You can thank me later.      One last side note: for reasons unclear to me the MPAA, that bastion of conservative nonsense, has rated this movie R. I have no idea why. Sure, there's a bit of language and you see some mild nudity, but so what? I'd feel quite comfortable taking children as young as eight or nine to this movie, provided they can read well enough to keep up with the occasional subtitles. The MPAA really just needs to be reformed or go away. We deserve better.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City...and maybe the world because albeit he's a brilliant scientist, he couldn't contain a deadly virus that is unstoppable, incurable and manmade. He is surrounded by blood thirsty overagressive infected victims.<br /><br />Watching this movie by myself is not suggested for those who get passionately involved in watching movies. I almost walked out because i was so scared something was going to happen that I didn't want to happen, but that just meant that Will Smith's acting was so believable that I sat in my chair riveted and rocking in terror at his performance.<br /><br />It had it's great moments and I have to say it was Will Smith's acting that really carried this movie. And I haven't seen a movie in a long time that didn't depend so much on CGI characters and special effects. I wish that the beginning of the movie spent more time watching the destruction and dying of mankind. That would have been better to understand and bring more pain to understanding the drive of Robert Nevell and why he was so intent on staying at Ground Zero.<br /><br />I also wish the producers had invested more into the infected people because I've been more believable \\"monsters\\" in Lord of The Rings.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a Will Smith fan, you will enjoy this movie. I haven't talked to the screen in a long time, but I swear I was trying to tell Will to forget the durn dog and get the heck out of there!<br /><br />Go see the movie and you'll be doing the same thing.

She used to watch Ultraman and Godzilla - things we as the younger children in the house weren't allowed to see. Bedtime was 7pm and all the scary shows were off limits to our young eyes. My sister Sharon used to run under the bed when Batman came out the cave every episode.<br /><br />Yet I was curious about my older sister's eagerness to watch the \\"new\\" show back then and I snuck back down and peered over the banister of the top of the steps to watch David Banner, the nicest and most handsome white man I ever saw turn into this angry huge giant.<br />I don't think my eyes could go any wider as I watched the green giant tear things apart and knock things over.

031606792X|3.0|My neice told me about these books last year and I had no idea what she was talking about and just figured they were young teenage books (ex: Babysitters Club) or something. Since the movie has come out I have seen everyone reading these books not to mention the movie looked pretty good. So I went ahead and bought the firST book, Twilight, to see what the big deal was about. I was blown away and hooked right away. I flew through the next two books in no time. I felt young again and had buttreflies in my stomache with all the romance and et.. Although I didn't admit to anyone I was reading these books ! lol  Then......I read Breaking Dawn and was completely crushed. I couldn't believe what I was reading. I kept hoping that Bella would just wake up from a nightmare. The first 3 books were soo much fun with romance and suspense and the craving for more, more, more. The beginning and end of Breaking Dawn were good. Very exciting that Bella and Edward finally get in on, but then the whole baby thing just ruined it for me. This is a fantasy series and Bella and Edward are barely fresh out of High school, the wedding thing was cool, and then wait for it, Bella's prego, and on top of that with a vamp-baby. Come on !!?????!!!! Then she's all about wanting to keep the baby/ nudger. Not all happy ending's HAVE to include a baby. I could go on and on and on about the whole pregnancy and delivery nightmare but Im sure you get the point.  Conclusion : Iam glad that I read these books, they left me craving more for sure. I usually read true crime and biographical books and so this was a nice change. But I still feel that I was left dissapointed. Not to mention lonely, becuase you really get attached to the characters and when you have been reading about them for a couple of months, they are gone along with the books ending. One nice thing (believe it or not) is that since I started reading the books when the movie came out, I had faces to put with the characters. That was an awesome advantage.                  SO WHAT THE HELL DO I READ NOW?????
B001DPC4RS|5.0|It's hard to listen to \\"Astral Weeks\\" (1968) and consider the fact it was a followup to Van Morrison's debut, \\"Blowin' Your Mind!\\" (1967).    \\"Blowin' Your Mind!\\" took its inspiration from rock 'n' roll and the blues, featuring the Billboard top ten hit \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\". Its songs tended to be more concise and radio-ready, perhaps with the exception of the dark, ten-minute dirge, \\"T.B. Sheets\\" .     \\"Astral Weeks\\" on the other hand is completely different. Its song structure and lyrics are a world away from its predecessor's. It floats along in a much more exploratory fashion, taking more influence from jazz and celtic music than from rock 'n' roll. Its lyrics are much more poetic and elegiac. As a result, \\"Astral Weeks\\" is a deeply meditative and transcendental album.     It may take more time for some to be absorbed into its subtle rhythms. Its hooks aren't quite as obvious, but, once you have been taken in by it, \\"Astral Weeks\\" becomes a great work of beauty and soul.    The 180 gram reissue does \\"Astral Weeks\\" wonders. The sound is much more dimensional, adding to the album's resonance. A must-have for any Morrison fan or audiophile.

B001MW0J2Y|5.0|John Frusciante is an amazing artist, a unique song-writer, and a remarkable guitarist (so expectations were high when I purchased this album).  Initially, after listening to this album once (from track 1 to track 10), my thought was, \\"Great, John's gone soft.  Where's the hard rock?  Why do rock 'n' rollers go soft?\\"  After I finished listening to the album, I was disappointed because I was expecting something heavier.  (And by the way, this album isn't all soft; there are several moments of hard rockin'.)<br /><br />Disappointment fades.  I listened again...and again, a third time (from track 1 to track 10).  Music has a tendency to grow on you when you take the time to appreciate it.  Then, after several listens, I grabbed my dictionary and looked up the word, \\"empyrean.\\"  The \\"empyrean\\" refers to the highest heaven, or the Celestial Kingdom.  Knowing this, I better understood the content and the overall feel of this album.<br /><br />This piece of music, as John might say, is a representation of the empyrean, the highest heaven.  Therefore, this music is meant to sound heavenly (not heavy or rock 'n' rolly).  I was expecting a rock `n' roll experience, but John delivered a heavenly experience.<br /><br />John: thank you for taking us to the empyrean with your guitar; thank you for taking us to a place where rock music almost never dares to ascend.<br /><br />The Empyrean rocks...in a soft, heavenly sort of way.  Buy this album and enjoy!
0765342294|5.0|Orson Scott Card's books have become a staple in science fiction books. Ender's Game, being one of his more popular books, has won a Nebula, and a Hugo award, along with being a New York Times best seller.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card's intriguing characters are mature and responsible; the only twist is that they are mere children. The mix of this maturity in childhood especially appeals to high school freshmen, I believe, who are somewhat in the middle of becoming mature and still being childish.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card does a great job of telling the story through the eyes of a child. While many authors try to see things through the eyes of a child, few succeed. Among this elite group of authors is Dr. Seuss, Roald Dahl, and Orson Scott Card.  While most of the time his character's maturity makes you forget that they are in fact children, occasionally the characters have moments of childhood; these parts were somewhat frustrating only because of the immature language. However that is, of course, a part of childhood. While that trait of the book might not appeal to older readers, I think that it is a trait that makes Ender's Game enjoyable for younger readers.<br /><br />While most writers try to \\"dazzle\\" readers with vocabulary, Orson Scott Card uses far simpler vocabulary but still succeeds in transforming the words on the page into pictures in the reader's mind. While some might dislike this style, I think it is a strong point. One must remember that he is writing from the point of view of a child; no one should expect ridiculous vocabulary.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card's goal was to write a Science fiction novel that captivated the minds of his readers. However, I don't believe he could have fathomed how many minds would soon be sucked into his heart pumping story line. With his complex characters and a story line that keeps the reader wanting more, he easily accomplished his goal.
0618871713|5.0|This is the first comic book I've read in, oh, 50 years.  It's brilliant!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|An incredible tour-de-force, this movie left me stunned ans speechless for hours. Best appreciated on a good home theatre setup with lots of subwoofer capability,  the style of the movie nonetheless holds up well in a more modest setup. In a post 9/11 world, this movie is bound to move you even given the monster-based plot (which is actually scary and very well done).
B0007XBMQG|5.0|I will only say, this is a great work from Beck, very good music, and the vinyl edition is really killer, high fidelity, much better than CD. Of course try to have a good tourntable and needle.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|What can I say, Neil Patrick Harris just knows how to be funny. Not to mention it has Felicia Day and Nathan Fillion. It is a musical though so if they scare you stay away. Otherwise worth every penny.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Finally!!  YENTL is on dvd! For all us Barbra fans YENTL was an amazing tour de force without comparison and as years have gone by it seemed as if Barbra had forgotten us and that it would never be released on dvd.  Well, the wait was definitely worth it for it is presented here as an exquisite 2-disc Director's Cut which far surpasses any expectations I had.<br /><br />First, we get a brief intro of Barbra today talking about the film.  Then there is YENTL.  The video presentation is so crisp and clear it is as if it was filmed today.  It shows no age whatsoever.  And the music.  This glorious soundtrack contains some of Bartbra's best work beginning with PAPA CAN YOU HEAR ME.  All music is glorious and all your surround speakers will be put to excellent use.  The audio is strong even when there is no music.  Dialogue is strong and background surround sound is plentiful.<br /><br />We all know that YENTL was a cherished experience of love for Barbra and here she shares that joy with us.  We get the original theatrical version of the film, an extended director's cut with added footage from Barbra's archives and a splendid commentary track.  I usually don't listen to these.  But here Barbra explains all that was behind each scene of the movie for her.  It is amazing to see how she made her decisions and what the experience was like.  To see the steps she took to make her dream come true is very informative.  And it does not end here.  The second disc has added features aplenty.  There are featurettes.  We see Barbra filming while she is acting and directing at the same time.  We see home movies she took during the filming.  And we see some songs that didn't make the cut of the final film.<br /><br />Now I just want to address all the people who have been griping about how the dvd was originally listed at a much lower price and have anger at Amazon for any preorders being raised in price.  Amazon actually does people a huge favor and lists an item when there is the slightest info on its release.  The original price was based on the knowledge they had and not the final product.  When the studio gave them the true retail price they listed it and when the item details were available they were listed asap.  I am grateful to Amazon for letting me know a product I desire is in the works.<br /><br />Now back to YENTL.  Barbra has delivered and given us an amazing gift with this 2-disc Director's Cut of YENTL and picture, sound and features are all amazing.  I highly recommend this dvd not only to Barbra fans but to all fans of quality cinema.  I always felt this film was underrated.  Her directing here is superb as well as her exemplary acting and beautiful/expressive singing.  This film is one for the history books.ase.

B000HWZ5W4|2.0|This was Plant's 2nd solo album and in my mind a concentrated effort not to sound like Led Zep which is maybe why the album is so lackluster. There are two very good songs here in \\"Thru with the 2 Step\\" and the album's best song, \\"Big Log\\". In both of these songs the vocals, music, and emotion all mesh well together. Most of the rest of the album sounds too restrained and the guitars sound thin and wimpy. I used to listen to this album quite a bit back in the day but it just doesn't hold up well now days.

B00005MNP7|5.0|Although this album doesn't have a mega hit like \\"Heart of Glass\\" or \\"Call Me\\" it is a great album throughout. This album finds Blondie in a mode where they had the balls to try anything and the chops to back it up. Highlights include \\"Shayla\\", \\"Dreaming\\", and \\"Living in the Real World\\".   I love the production on this album. The drums sound great and it really gives Clem Burke a chance to shine. Every instrument is distinctive in the recording and the songs hold up well after all these years. Debbie Harry gets to show a variety of styles to suit the wonderfully varied songs written for this great album.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Its an amazing album, full of hard guitars, mc cready is the man.    their music has improve a lot, they can give us many suprises on the future.    please people listen to pearl jam, not only about the three most popular albums everybody knows, take care of the after grunge era albums, do the evolution, babies.    i mean this band is the best hard rock band ever.    songs:  life wasted: 9  wws: 8.3  comatose: 10  severed hand: 8.5  marker in the sand: 7.9  parachutes: 6.8  unemployable: 9.2  big wave: 8.0  gone: 9.7  wasted reprise: 10  army reserve 7.2  inside job: 10  comeback: 8.0

It has HUGE font that makes me think it is aimed at younger kids than I.<br /><br />I am 17 years old and read this with a friend.  We were intrigued, surprised, and entertained from beginning to end.  The whole time, we were wondering exactly who the target market for this book is.<br /><br />I think it can truly appeal to all ages.  If you like some action, romance, and speculative fiction, take a look at this book.  I am anxiously awaiting for the second book, which will come out my freshman year of college.

0810993139|5.0|We are a family of readers, except for my 9yr old son. He has never enjoyed reading nor being read to. I've tried all sorts of books on all sorts of subjects to get him interested, but no luck. We finally tried Diary of a Wimpy Kid, I assumed he wouldn't read it much past the first few pages as usual. He loved it!! He read the whole book himself and asked if we could get the second one. He is now part way through the second book, and still loves the series! I couldn't be happier.

B001L5SXQG|3.0|So who the hell is Brendan O'Brien and what exactly did he do with Bruce Springsteen? After multiple spins through Springsteen's newest release, it began to strike me that the magnum themes infusing Bruce's best work - guarded optimism, redemption, allusion, delusion, squandered love, dreams crashed, dreams burned, dreams postponed - are nowhere to be found. Unfortunately, Springsteen's waning capacity for introspection and complexity seems to be a permanent fixture of the soft-core O'Brien era and is most glaring on this release and 2007's lackluster, Magic.<br /><br />Tempering my basic disappointment is the fact that Working On A Dream is an exceptional, finely crafted pop album - but like so many goodies spinning behind the glass in any Jersey Diner (or any Bon Jovi record,) this shimmering dessert is all meringue with very little crust and almost no filling. Throughout the disc the songwriting has no aspiration beyond the literal all but sabotaging the record's one stab at epic storytelling, Outlaw Pete. A song which careens between ponderous spaghetti western and an audition for Verizon, weighed down by a constant chorus of \\"Can you hear me?\\" Don't worry Boss, you repeat it fifty times, we'll hear it even from the cheap seats at Giants Stadium.<br /><br />An opportunuty wasted since as an ode to a poorly drawn, cartoonish punk, \\"Pete\\" misses the mark - regrettable, in that the slightest burst of inspired songwriting, could have elevated the idea beyond characiture and been a fitting book-end to WOAD's best track, The Wrestler.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the lowlights don't end with the opening track - do we really care that Bruce has a chubby for the hot bagger in aisle two - well, with the gloriously tedious Queen of the Supermarket she finally has her anthem. And frankly, the less said about Surprise, Surprise the better - at long last a hummable party theme to amuse yourself with while you're waiting for the guest of honor behind the couch. In fairness, anyartist can be given a pass for a throwaway song however, on WOAD that description seems justified far too often.<br /><br />So, whether or not the mayor of E-Street wants to be Boss Springsteen, Hoss Cartwright or Bruce Bon Jovi, my recommendation is that you enjoy the record for the exceptional \\"wall of sound\\" production and not contemplate what might have been if Springsteen had spent more than four minutes of his life scribbling lyrics for this very average offering.
0978053583|3.0|Initially a little afraid that I wouldn't be able to understand the many sections of the book that are heavy on \\"new thought\\" philosophy, the Master Key System quickly put me at ease with the way it was laid out - each chapter starts out with a helpful, friendly letter of introduction from author Charles Haanel and ends with a straightforward, tangible meditation \\"exercise\\" meant to encourage creativity and abstract thought. Also at the end of each chapter is a miniature quiz on the contents that preceded it, which is the only place where the Master Key reads like a textbook. They're helpful, though, as every now and again you may find yourself a little lost & the quizzes help you focus a little more. The book doesn't read like it was written in 1912, that's for certain... vastly ahead of its time in the methods of self help it endorses, I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a self-help book written more recently. Forget about the bandwagon-jumpers and go back to where it started.
006135323X|5.0|This book was informative and engaging for an armchair psychologist and professional salesman such as myself. Ariely describes his experiments and observations on human behaviour with a facility and ease that makes the book a pleasure to read. His background and credentials are impressive too. It's an enjoyable and quick read. I highly recommend it.

B001NP8PQW|5.0|This had previously been the greatest live concert ever released on any format, and now it just got better!<br /><br />When I purchased the DVD of this live show, filmed in Berlin, a number of years ago I was astounded at how amazing it was. I have seen The Cure 10 times throughout the course of my life, and own every studio release, video release, and many bootlegs; yet I still was not prepared for just how unbelievably incredible this performance would be.<br /><br />Now, years later, after many throw away Blu-ray concert releases from artists without half the talent of The Cure, we finally get 'Trilogy' in beautiful High-definition; and boy was it worth the wait!<br /><br />The audio sounds flawless, and the picture quality is light-years better than the already very good looking DVD. This is how you release a live concert on Blu-ray; looks perfect, sounds perfect, and the content is second to none.<br /><br />The Cure combine a live show of three intrinsically linked albums, 'Pornography', 'Disintegration', and 'Blood Flowers' to give fans the ultimate Blu-ray that could ever be asked for.<br /><br />The supplements even shine, with a 2 song encore consisting of 'If Only Tonight We Could Sleep' and 'The Kiss' from the album 'Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me', as well as backstage footage and other goodies.<br /><br />Whether you are a Blu-ray fan, a Cure fan, a live concert fan, or even a moderate fan of any of these things, you owe it to yourself to have this on your shelf.<br /><br />Very possibly the best live concert that will ever be released.
0064430227|5.0|Purchased the book for 2 year old twin grandaughters of a friend. She said the girls listened very attentively even though they are \\"terrible two\\", but not really. They loved it. So grandma has to read it again and again.
B000UFAURI|5.0|I've been a long-time fan of the Foo Fighters and this album didn't disappoint.  It's modern, but it certainly maintains the Foo's signature sound.  I caught them in concert this past summer, playing many of the songs from this album, and they were amazing.  They played for over three hours and they sounded just like they do on the radio.  If you're a Foo Fighters fan, this album is a must.
B0000009NN|4.0|Apart from the wrong-headed remake of \\"Across the Universe\\" (some Beatle songs should be left alone), David Bowie's \\"Young Americans\\" holds up remarkably well. Rock's chameleon extraordinaire gets plenty of mileage from the classic title track and his \\"Fame\\" collaboration with John Lennon. Other superior cuts include \\"Win,\\" \\"Fascination\\" and \\"Can You Hear Me.\\" This 1975 foray into \\"plastic soul\\" remains better than its mixed critical reputation.

B000EWBKKI|5.0|I bought T2 because it's my favorite Terminator, and it was cheap.  I didn't think it'd be anything special on Blu-ray, though, because it's an older film.  The quality was quite impressive, though.  I've seen this movie many times, but I was noticing some details for the very first time.  T2 is a worthy addition to anyone's Blu-ray collection.
0930289234|5.0|To be completely honest this was the first graphic novel I have read. I planned on reviewing it sooner but I wanted to make sure that it wasn't just on par with other graphic novels. After ready 5 others, which were also very entertaining, this is still my favorite so far. The deep story and very human (for the most part) characters made this a very enjoyable read and I highly reccomend this to all fans of comics and graphic novels.
0596007124|5.0|I was required to get this book for my computer science course and it was well worth the money. I have never had a text book like this before, but in the future I will seek out books written in the same style as this one. I ordered three more Head First books after getting through just three chapters of this one because I know that this is the series for me.    Just a side note, this book is written with java being the code of choice, but really is universal for all object oriented languages.    Highly recommended.

0765350386|4.0|The Lord Ruler is immortal--everyone knows that. They also know he harbors a grudge against the Skaa--the ordinary people of the land, and remembers the nobility--descendents of those who helped him in the early days of the Final Empire--fondly. Although the Lord Ruler is said to be a god, the Skaa continue to rebell--without much success or hope. When the Skaa rebellion hires an elite thief, one with the Mistborn talents reserved to the nobility and the Lord Ruler only, the rebellion takes a more serious role.<br /><br />Since her brother abandoned her, Vin has worked for a thief guild. She uses the hint of talent she calls 'luck' to protect the guild and sway suckers into falling into the scams and deceptions on which the thieves depend. But when her guild leader goes too far and tries to scam the Iron Ministry of the Final Empire, she becomes hunted by the Empire--and swept up in the rebellion.<br /><br />Trained by Kelsier, lead thief, Vin learns that her 'luck' is really Allomancy--a kind of magic based on the 'burning' (digestion?) of metals. Becoming a part of the rebellion gives Vin the family she's always wanted, but also puts her in horrible danger.<br /><br />MISTBORN represents a major step forward for author Brandon Sanderson's dealing with characters. Rather than the semi-perfect characters of his earlier novel, ELANTRIS, Sanderson gives us complex and flawed characters, rich world-building and an intriguing magical system.<br /><br />MISTBORN is not flawless. I would have liked more explanation of how Allomancy evolved, what, exactly, the nobles are, and a better explanation of why the Lord Ruler did what he did. Perhaps, however, these questions will be answered in later volumes in the series. Overall, MISTBORN is a huge and complex novel--and well worth the read.

0812932293|5.0|This book should be required reading for business majors and anyone who has ever entertained thoughts of becoming a captain of industry. Branson's off-the-cuff candid style spends as much time sharing what he gleaned from his failures as it does explaining all the maneuvers that led to his most profound successes. What one comes away from in this entertaining read is that life can be a glorious, exhilarating, pulse-pounding adventure that's not unlike the Indian Jones ride at Disneyland; specifically, you scream, you squeal, your heart races, and you get caught up in the sights and sounds and surprises and wonder whatever possibly possessed you to put yourself in the path of spears and snakes and runaway boulders. And then the ride ends and the first thing you want to do is go get back in line and do it all over again.  If a movie were ever made of Branson's life, he'd have to play himself because no actor could ever come close to emulating his charismatic presence and wicked sense of humor.

Rhino USA R2 724592 3D edition (made by WEA manufacturing)<br />7. Shout Factory USA 2666310642 Mini-LP edition (made by Sony/BMG)<br />There are several different masterings present here.<br />1, 2 and 3 are basically the same mastering (by Barry Diament), except 1 has the very opening note starting immediately after pressing Play, whereas the later 2 and 3 have a small amount of silence inserted before the opening of Jerusalem. Otherwise, they appear to sound the same. There is no evidence of the scraping sound at the start of Toccata that was present on UK Manticore vinyl.  Karn Evil 9 First Impression is quite dull and is split into 2 parts as per Manticore vinyl. The sound has a nice unstrained dynamic (particularly in the mid to upper bass) and seems to have been mastered to make the very bright high hat sound less glaringly obvious. This makes it easy to turn up without aural pain, but may be classed by some as too dull, especially Karn Evil 9 First Impression.<br />4, 5 and 6 are the same (in the core album) mastering efforts by Joseph Palmaccio, whereas 6 has \\"The Making Of Brain Salad Surgery\\" appended. Although the mastering of 6 has been credited to Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch, there is no difference in the sound of 4, 5 or 6. I suspect that their \\"remastering\\" involved adding the extra track mentioned above. This mastering has the scraping sound at the beginning of Toccata (as per vinyl), but Karn Evil 9 First Impression is no longer dull, nor is it split into 2 parts (unlike the vinyl Manticore copies or Atlantic CD). The person supervising the remastering of the ELP catalogue for the 1993 Victory releases, Bill Levenson, while investigating the cause of the varied sound during Karn Evil 9, discovered a tape containing an unseparated Karn Evil 9 First Impression that also had sound consistent with the Second and Third Impressions. It appears that this is the original mix-down stereo master tape, whereas even vinyl used something at least one generation removed from that master to enable the fade out/in between Karn Evil 9 First Impression Parts 1 and 2 that separated the two vinyl sides. The sound is much brighter than the Atlantic and is mastered to try and give a reasonably balanced listening experience - not as dull as the Atlantic, but without the same mid bass dynamic as the Atlantic. I love the Rhino 3D cover (and I suspect H. R. Giger would too, as it is much more anatomically correct than any other - the nose is exactly where it should be, unlike all other attempts).  4, 5, and 6 sound identical to me despite different manufacturing plants.

The mini-LP cover chops off half the ELP insignia for a start. The sound appears to be made from a similar tape to the Manticore vinyl and Atlantic CD by Mark Chalecki at Capitol USA, in that it has the dull Karn Evil 9 First Impression, but that track is not split into Parts 1 and 2. It is possible that the two halves were digitally joined.  There is no scraping noise at the beginning of Toccata (much like the Atlantic CD). The sound in general appears to have been equalised to be both brighter and boomier than any prior and is not terribly successful in my opinion, as it doesn't sound relaxed at higher volume. The 2 bonus tracks (an alternate mix of Jerusalem and an instrumental mix of Karn Evil 9) are great and the booklet contains a good essay and some great concert photos., discovered a tape containing an unseparated Karn Evil 9 First Impression that also had sound consistent with the Second and Third Impressions. It appears that this is the original mix-down stereo master tape, whereas even vinyl used something at least one generation removed from that master to enable the fade out/in between Karn Evil 9 First Impression Parts 1 and 2 that separated the two vinyl sides. The sound is much brighter than the Atlantic and is mastered to try and give a reasonably balanced listening experience - not as dull as the Atlantic, but without the same mid bass dynamic as the Atlantic. I love the Rhino 3D cover (and I suspect H. R. Giger would too, as it is much more anatomically correct than any other - the nose is exactly where it should be, unlike all other attempts).  4, 5, and 6 sound identical to me despite different manufacturing plants.

0385338694|5.0|This was my first read of a SK book, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  In fact, contrary to some of the other reviewers, I liked this one better than the Shopoholic books I have since listened to. (Audio book lover, here!) The main character--SS-- at least uses her mind,speaks up, and is clever-- whereas RB generally hides her problems and repeats her transgressions repeatedly and tediously.

You don't have to agree with all his thoughts but respectfully he is the only leader to get that many faithful supporters besides Jesus.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I had seen the Phantom twice in the theater in the past 10 years. Watching this movie gave me a full understanding of the story. IMHO, you will understand the Phantom of the Opera story more so from this movie than from seeing it in the Theater. The movie is tastefully done, well-directed, and the two lead actors have amazing voices.

0061053147|3.0|I approached this book as someone who has always loved watching the hypnotic, gorgeous \\"Blade Runner,\\" but who has never considered it a particularly good movie, and who was curious about how this undeniably influential film was made and was marred. That curiosity was more than satisfied. Sammon seems aware of every question ever asked about \\"BR,\\" as he constantly and cozily calls it, and he does answer those questions--sometimes four or five times in the course of this 435-page book.<br /><br />The writing is awful: coy, fawning, and inexpressive. (One minor example: Actor Rutger Hauer is described as \\"warm but genuine\\" on the occasion that the author interviews him. Does warmth imply lack of genuineness?) Sammon is also so far inside his own fandom that he is unable to deal with the film or its makers objectively. He goes so far as to say that the critics didn't like the film because it was too good for them. (His actual words: \\". . .as if many of the nation's critics had somehow been personally offended by the subtlety and care that had gone into this picture.\\") That's the sort of thing that a teenager would say: \\"You don't understand me [my favorite movie] because you're just not as sensitive as I am.\\"<br /><br />The book is not a critical examination of \\"Blade Runner\\" or a study of its influence on the cyberpunk genre. It is more like a straight narrative \\"making of\\" book (the sort that is usually one quarter its length), with the viewpoint that mostly everyone now agrees that it is a great film, so let's see how it got that way. With that point of view acknowledged, if the thing is to be done at all, one might as well go all the way, with all the detail that has been assembled here, and I did find a lot of it quite interesting. The organization is okay, although it could be better. The book could definitely use an index.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of the book is that it appears, from the comments gathered by Sammon, that \\"Blade Runner\\" wasas much a Rorschach test for the people who made it as it was for critics and audiences afterward: everyone has different explanations for what went into the movie and what things were meant to \\"mean.\\" Some would argue this is evidence that the film lacked a coherent vision; others that a shambles (such as \\"Casablanca\\") can add up to a great movie. At any rate, Pauline Kael was right: whatever you think of \\"Blade Runner,\\" it definitely has its place in movie history.
0552150827|3.0|While at the basic core of it all, the plot is an interesting and enjoyable one, that's really all it is--basic.  There are no subplots, and plenty of minor characters that could have had interesting stories.  Kinsella's storytelling has, no doubt, developed over time, as Remember Me? certainly had subplots.  Still, this is not her best work.  It was easier to get into than the other books, starting off very interestingly while the others took a while to really get interesting.  It's definitely a good premise (if not highly Queen of Babble-ish, although I'm pretty sure this came first), and was delivered well, just lacked oomph.  It's all told in a little bubble though, in her office and small parts elsewhere.  Just a little too little.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5
B001DHXT2A|5.0|Louis Leterrier should now be every Marvel superhero fan's new best friend. His \\"Incredible Hulk\\" is ever so much the wild, jaw-dropping blockbuster that Ang Lee's well-intentioned mood piece could and should have been. For me to simply say I was enthralled would be a gross understatement. This exciting, masterfully executed film blew me clear out of my chair!    Edward Norton is Bruce Banner, hands down. He channels Bill Bixby's persona from the television series so perfectly, it's practically uncanny. And, the Hulk? Let me just say, seeing is believing! This is a phenomenally vast improvement over the spotty and altogether underwhelming CGI from Lee's film. The closing showdown with the equally impressive Abomination definitely makes an impact! It therefore goes without saying that I left the theater a very happy man.    And now, I get to relive it whenever I want on DVD. The Three-Disc Special Edition, despite its hefty price tag, is clearly the one to go with. It offers extensive behind-the-scenes insight, most of which details the overall good times and dedication shared by everyone who helped make this movie so very satisfying. These are all people who obviously harbor a true understanding and respect for the source comic and television show. It is their sheer enthusiasm that makes sitting through this material all the more enjoyable. There are also quite the number of deleted scenes, spread out between discs one and two, that I found particularly interesting. That as it may be, I can still see why most of them were omitted from the final cut. Disc three, as many will already realize, grants viewers an opportunity to download a digital copy of the complete film to their I-Pod or personal computer. That may not personally appeal to me, but I still believed the remaining features were certainly more than enough to warrant a purchase.     I'm fairly positive most others will feel the same.
B000002LCX|5.0|This album rules. All of the Smiths' albums rock, but this one is special. In many ways, it can be considered their weakest or worst album, at first glance. But it grows on you. I hated it at frist, and then loved it most. \\"Death of a Disco Dancer\\" was one of those songs I hated at first, and now consider their most Radiohead-type song (i'm a huge radiohead fan). \\"Death at One's Elbow\\" is total rockabilly madness. I love this album; and the more i read about people hating this album, the more i love it!
B001AIRUOU|1.0|My wife and I have run a haunted house for Halloween for the last decade.  She's the mover and shaker, I follow.  One would think that this movie was right up our alley.<br /><br />Pretty much from start to finish we both were drop-jawed aghast at this movie.  Not that there weren't a few good bits so maybe this review deserved two stars, not one. (good bits: the two-faced mayor, the naughty kids bringing back the poor (spoiler deleted, sorry!) instead of Sandy Claws...)<br /><br />I don't want to rant; I have several friends who love this movie and our neighbor bought the collector's edition for my son as a Christmas present since we're so into Halloween.<br /><br />In terms of technicalities, I thought that the music and singing was fine; I personally enjoy stop motion animation albiet my wife really dislikes any video entertainment that is too visually unbelievable (e.g. older Doctor Who in addition to most animated features).  I don't have any real opinion on the DVD menu features and special features; we put the disc in and it played without error.  :-)  I'm not a huge Oingo Boingo fan like some I know but I enjoy Danny Elfman's music both just as music and also in the context of movie soundtracks.<br /><br />But really the story is unbelievably bad.  It's far too childish for adult viewing and it's far too malice-filled for a younger audience.  Santa's kindness and generosity was, in the end, the only redeeming factor for this movie.  The only lesson learned by Jack (the protagonist) was to be happy with whatever lot life has given you.  I would have liked some form of enlightenment or betterment over the course of the story.<br /><br />I just really do not see the context in which this can be seen as a great story.  The mechanics, voices and music are great.  There were moments when even though I was still filled with horror, I chuckled at a gag or two but wow what an unwatchable movie.  I really hope that my son decides not to watch his present again.  Ever.  I will leave the room.I will leave the room.
B000002J1Y|5.0|I have been into Yes and progressive rock since about 2006, but hadn't gotten many Yes albums since I had inherited my father's 4 CD [[ASIN:B000002JNV Yesyears]], a box set encompassing Yes's work from 1969-1991. But I decided to get Yessongs now, since my favorite period of Yes was their work in 1972 (with [[ASIN:B00007KWHP Fragile]] and [[ASIN:B00007LTI9 Close to the Edge]]), and this album encompasses both of those albums, and also [[ASIN:B00007KWHN The Yes Album]].     It should be noted that there are two drummers on this album, Bill Bruford and Alan White. Bill Bruford plays on \\"Long Distance Runaround\\", \\"The Fish\\", and \\"Perpetual Change\\" on this album (which were the songs from the \\"Fragile\\" tour that are featured on this album). He quit after the recording of the album \\"Close to the Edge\\" to play with King Crimson, due to him believing that Yes had peaked with \\"Close to the Edge\\", and Yes would forever be in the shadow of it. Alan White, formally of The Plastic Ono Band, joined in for the \\"Close to the Edge\\" tour. He amazingly managed to learn all of the complex drum parts of some of Yes's most complicated songs (like \\"Close to the Edge\\") within three days, before the band went on tour. He picked up the rest of the songs later. But back to \\"Yessongs\\" now.    The first song is an introduction for the band, the \\"Finale\\" section of Igor Stravinsky's \\"The Firebird Suite\\" (which is from [[ASIN:B0001ENYLM Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring; The Firebird Suite (1919)]] an absolutely excellent classical album, of which I highly recommend). Then Yes comes... more like smashes in, with \\"Siberian Khatru\\", which works very well live. Personally, I think this is the best song on the album, but I would not be surprised if someone disagreed with me, the album is full of great renditions of Yes songs.   Next comes \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\", which does not lose the energy and the raise-the-hair-on-the back-of-your-neck vocals of the studio album.   Then there is my third favorite song from this album, \\"Perpetual Change\\", which is extended by 5 minutes to a much better version. The song also includes a drum solo from Bill Bruford, my favorite drummer.  Although the next song \\"And You and I\\" does not sound as good as on the studio album, it is still the best live version I have heard of the song.   \\"Mood for a Day\\" turns out amazing, with Steve Howe able to prove that he can play the highly difficult song outside of the studio. Really, it's just amazing to hear such a complex song played perfectly live.   Next is a song that appears on none of the Yes album. \\"Excerpts from The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" are, well, excerpts from Rick Wakeman's solo album The Six Wives of Henry VIII, recorded the same year as Yessongs (1972). This shows Wakeman's astounding abilities on his keyboards. You'll notice when you listen to the excerpts that there are multiple keyboards playing. None of these are overdubbed, they are all played by Wakeman at once.  \\"Roundabaout\\", for many Yes's most noticeable tune, is next. I think it sounds alright, but the live rendition featured on the album [[ASIN:B000002J25 Classic Yes]] is much better, in my opinion.   \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" also suffers the same fate as \\"Roundabout on this album, and I would also recommend the live version of this song on Classic Yes.  The often joined songs \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" and \\"The Fish\\" are up next, and these are noticeably longer, nearly 7 minutes longer than on \\"Fragile\\". This is because \\"The Fish\\" (a collection of bass guitars played by Chris Squire on \\"Fragile) turns into an improvised jam between Squire and Bruford. Overall with these two songs, \\"Long Distance Runaround is faster than the studio version, but the jam on \\"The Fish\\" can seem like an eternity.  Then there is \\"Close to the Edge\\". This is my favorite Yes song in the studio, and is a very ambitious progressive rock masterpiece. Sadly, but not necessarily unexpectedly, it doesn't work as well live. It's just too bigto play live. But Yes did an alright performance, just know that the studio version is much better.  \\"Yours is no Disgrace\\" is next, and is my second favorite from the album. The live version turns into a much more guitar song, which works out great. There is also an improvised guitar solo in the song, which sound good.  \\"Starship Trooper\\" ends the album, on an overall good note.     Overall, the album is absolutely great. There are some songs that don't sound quite as well as they did in the studio, but these are more than made up for by other songs, like \\"Siberian Khatru\\" or \\"Perpetual Change\\". If you are a Yes fan, a progressive rock fan, or just a fan of classic rock, I highly recommend you buy this album, which shows a great live band at the pinnacle of their greatness.

B000XA5K48|1.0|I'm all for mindless action when it's done right but this was just brutal. I like all the actors yet found them all annoying in this. The action is unimpressive, the dialogue is appalling, and there is essentially no story whatsoever.     This is pretty high up on my \\"Worst Movies of All Time\\" list.
0345350472|4.0|I've always meant to get around to reading Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.  I came across it again the other day, and decided now was the time.  I haven't seen Blade Runner for many years, so I felt sufficiently distant from it to give the book an honest read.    The movie was a fair bit of a departure from the book, as many other people have noted.  The androids of the book, other than Rachael, have only brief appearances.  Roy Baty was much more exciting in the movie-- here, he is simply used to show the lack of empathy in androids and then quietly destroyed.  Still, Dick did a very effective job of describing how similar to us the androids were, due to their high intelligence, yet still how alien (and dangerous) due to their lack of empathy.    The biggest difference between the movie and the book is the book's emphasis on the quasi-religion of Mercerism.  Humans are able to use empathy boxes to share each others' emotions, and also those of the quasi-diety Wilbur Mercer.  The androids, lacking empathy, are unable to participate in Mercerism, and seek to discredit and destroy it.  I thought this was a great conflict based around the central theme of the book, but was confused by the actual physical manifestation of Mercer and what that was meant to imply.  I also got the impression that Isidore was actually Mercer, or that might have just been the results of him fusing with the Mercer personality?  That was a little strange.      Still, a good book, highly recommended.  Complex enough that it probably deserves a second read.
B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idol released some great rock songs over the years, and this has them all.
B00011CZQU|4.0|Listen to the director commentary, and you'll hear Guillermo del Toro saying that he wanted the Blade sequel to be a fun, gory, comic-booky experience.<br /><br />Well, he succeeded in the way that only Guillermo del Toro can. While the first movie about the Marvel vampire-hunter was dark and gritty, &#34;Blade II&#34; is gloriously gory and full of rapid-fire violence, unashamed of its animeish action sequences and tongue-in-cheek humor (&#34;Catch you later!&#34;). Wesley Snipes and del Toro give it a suitably monstrous charm, although David Goyer's leaden dialogue bogs down many promising scenes.<br /><br />While a monstrous hooded vampire preys on other vampires, Blade (Snipes) manages to track down his vampirized mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and cures him of his vampirism. Then a pair of vampire ninjas arrive, bearing a message for Blade: ancient vampire lord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) wants to meet with him. Turns out there's a monstrous vampiric mutation called the Reapers loose -- highly contagious, really disgusting, and preys on humans and vampires alike. Blade reluctantly agrees to work with the elite vampire assassin squad called the Bloodpack.<br /><br />Of course, tensions run high between the vampires and the little gang sworn to kill them -- especially when they arrive at the rave club House of Pain and lose some of their number. Blade takes on the Reapers' leader, Jared Nomak (Luke Goss), only to discover that there are some nasty secrets behind the Reapers' origins. And Damaskinos' plans are far nastier and further-reaching than anyone could have guessed.<br /><br />Those expecting a copy of the first &#34;Blade&#34; movie should leave the building now. Guillermo del Toro's direction gives &#34;Blade II&#34; a very unique flavour all its own -- it's faster, more grotesque, more fantastical, and more infused with quirky humor. The one sour note is the magical return of Whistler at the beginning, where it turns out that whoops, he wasn't QUITE dead and he's getting better. Contrived much?<br /><br />And del Toro has fun with the action -- lots of grotesque gore (those flip-out Reaper mouths), anime-style action (Blade garrotes a vampire on a motorcycle) and highly destructive gun battles. The first four-fifths of the story are just mindless shoot-'em-up-and-burn-up-to-ashes Reaper-hunts, but it mutates in the last act. Suddenly we're faced with a vampiric tale of betrayal, revenge and Grecian-style tragedy.<br /><br />The big problem with this movie? Goyer's dialogue is hit or miss. Sometimes it's hilarious (&#34;You're human.&#34; &#34;Barely. I'm a lawyer&#34;), and sometimes it sounds like he put it in because it looked cool on paper (&#34;There's an old saying: Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer&#34;). Much of the time, it's the latter.<br /><br />Wesley Snipes seems to be having a good time here, with lots of wild action and some wry humour (&#34;Now you got an explosive device stuck to the back of your head&#34;), and Leonor Varela provides a hint of possible romance as an autopsy-performing vampire princess. And the whispery-voiced Luke Goss manages to take a truly repulsive character (&#34;so... so sweet!&#34;) and give him an air of tragedy.<br /><br />In fact, most of the acting is pretty good in this movie, although most of the actors don't get a lot to do (Donnie Yen is particularly underused), though Ron Perlman is wonderfully loathsome as a neo-Nazi vampire who gets on Blade's bad side. Norman Reedus is intensely annoying as Scud, though -- you'll spend a lot of time hoping that someone shoots him by accident.<br /><br />&#34;Blade II&#34; is a very different beast than its predecessor, and del Toro does a great job with some truly mediocre scripting. Worth seeing if you have a strong stomach.QUITE dead and he's getting better.

B0000B1OGD|4.0|This is a remarkably well made movie (for the time) about a hidden valley.   It shows amongst other things why you can't trust people where money is involved, and why superstition is so bad.    If you like old sci-fi movies, you'll like this one.    The integration of the stop-motion photography with the real actors is well done.
B000XYNFD2|5.0|I have a 9937 Coin-edge bezel watch and the 8926 Coin-edge, as well, and the 9937 clearly outshines the 8926. The bezel on the 8926 barely moves, and the date magnifier is small and cheap looking. The watch feels light. The 9937 is a great looking, ultra-solid and accurate timepiece. It looks and feels like a very expensive watch. Grab the Coin-edge if you can -- they are still available. A Swiss automatic of this quality for around $350 is the best deal for a quality watch I've found, anywhere. Invicta made a reputation selling quality, inexpensive watches, like the 8926; but save your money and buy the 9937 -- you won't be sorry.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This is a good buy for those who made it through the 60 until now without getting many songs from Stevie Wonder. It has all of his best. They're good recordings.
B00132D808|4.0|I never heard Panic's allegedly mainstream previous release.  Picked up this album on a record store sweep earlier this month, and a few of the tracks have worked their way into heavy rotation on my player, particularly \\"Mad as Rabbits\\".  Modern sensibility combined with pop/rock vibe, while the horns and harmonies broaden the sound without taking away too much from the catchy nature of many songs on this album.  Some of the songs are still a bit too meandering and theatrical for my taste, and I could definitely do without the strings and piano flourishes but overall I am enjoying quite a few of the tracks.  While taking a page out of the Beatles playbook isn't anything new, that doesn't make it a bad idea.
B000000P17|5.0|Spaghetti is one of the most underrated releases of all time. It rocks from beginning to end. Usually Spaghetti gets ranked below GNR Lies as their worst release. This is only because Spaghetti lacked the big single that Lies had in \\"Patience.\\" This record aims to do nothing but rock out hard, and it delivers the goods with aplomb.
0446615625|4.0|I very much enjoyed the book and its characters.<br /><br />As a hack writer, I appreciated that the main characters are flawed and realistic.  Often the main characters become invincible and unbelievable, have an answer for everything... and ultimately lose me.<br /><br />Villains in the story (Hemingway and Gray) share this \\"super\\" quality, and that was unfortunate, but not enough for me to put the book down.<br /><br />The story line was in line with current America and while some details and coincidences were extraordinary, this is fiction after all...<br /><br />If I wanted 100% believable details I wouldn't be reading fiction.<br /><br />Good story.  Good characters.  Fun read.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next in the series.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I hadn't listened to Dylan since he went Christian in the '70s, but I picked this one up because I needed something to listen to on a long cross-country drive.    Wow!    No way I thought the ol' boy still had something this bright, funny and energetic in him.  Some of it rocks the blues like Blonde On Blonde, some of it is Tin Pan Alley with Dylan's unique lyrical touch and all of it is wonderfully arranged and produced.  The backing players are superb.    Great album.  If you haven't listened to Dylan in a while, get it.

0545128285|5.0|Better than I expected! This fun collection of five stories by Beedle The Bard offers a window into the wizarding world of Harry Potter. While keeping her promise of not writing another Harry Potter book, Rowling allows Professor Albus Dumbledore to give readers insight and elaboration through his commentary following each of Beedle The Bard's tales (the tales can be compared to the muggle's Grimm Brothers Fairy Tales - although completely different). \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\" is especially dark and bloody - parents would be well advised to not read this particular story to young children; it is not a good bedtime story for any age.    After the tale called The Fountain of Fair Fortune, Dumbledore shares in his commentary that Mr. Lucius Malfoy had requested a ban on this specific story and the two had exchanged several letters on the subject. Dumbledore claims: \\" This exchange marked the beginning of Mr. Malfoy's long campaign to have me removed from my post as Headmaster of Hogwarts...\\". I found Dumbledore's commentary on \\"Babbity Rabbity and Her Cackling Stump\\", to be the most informative, interesting, and amusing of the five stories.     The Tales of Beedle The Bard is a volume of just over 100 pages, extremely easy to read and features not only cover art by Mary Grand Pre (who did the cover art for all the US versions of the Harry Potter books) but also illustrations within the stories by J.K. Rowling herself. Rowling has done a wonderful job on this book and I look forward to reading future works by her - whether they have anything to do with Harry Potter or not; she's a fabulous author.

I think it is a very listenable album, but so far I haven't noticed any standouts.<br /><br />If you like FF you will like their new album.
055358894X|5.0|Another book I picked up while waiting for George RR Martin to finsh writing Dragons. I couldn't put it down!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|loved the movie filmed partially here in chicago and on top of all of that free super saver shipping was quick!
B000VSBX34|5.0|I am a Beatles lover and I have shared this with my 5 year old daughter. I purchased this movie to watch it with her. I have lost count as to how many times she has watched this. She repeats lines from the movie and knows every word to the songs. I was able to explain a very important part of her Mother's life by introducing her to them in this movie. A very lighthearted movie with some of the best music ever created.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just got hooked on Firefly after my daughter brought it home from a half-price book store. The show has been cancelled for years now, but after watching it-I'm left wondering why? Why would Fox be so stupid as to cancel such a well written, beautifully acted amazing show? Because Fox has idiots at the helm, that's why. Joss Whedon is a master story teller, I couldn't stop watching all the shows, and cried at the end of the movie sequel, Serenity. If you've seen it, you know why. As my husband said, it was like finishing a great book, but you're sad because there are no more adventures for your beloved characters to go on. These charactors and the writing had real staying power-Fox, you blew it royally. You had the makings of a phenomenon in your hands, but you let some stupid suit cancel it. I hope those decision makers got fired. Firefly has a rabid following of fans who would love to see it back on the air-extend the olive branch to Joss Whedon, and come to your senses!  (Sorry for the rant to Fox, I know this is supposed to be just a review-and as a review-I LOVED IT!!!)
B00000K0DQ|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Slow and obvious, Dead Man Walking impressed a lot of critics and academy voters but I must confess to finding it rather boring; the acting is good enough (Penn more than Sarandon) but the characters don't draw much interest from the audience and the lack of conflict and tension render the film rather dull.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|this season 4 was as good as all the rest,but only a few epiesodes not the usual 23.and i havent even started to watch the new season on tv.
B000059TEQ|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Yes it's a schmaltzy tearjerker, but it's a successful schmaltzy tearjerker that develops characters we care a reasonable amount about; if you're the audience for Love Story (you'll know if you are) and haven't seen it yet, then bump it to the top of your Netflix queue.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I see the reality the true war, I like this serie because shows the reality of the war, we don`t need more wars only we need peace
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A romantic movie that takes a different arc than the standard meet-cute/happy-time/breakup/sad-time/happilyeverafter is always appreciated, and the wonderful Italian scenery and sweet interaction between Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck make this film a delight.
B001P22HK8|5.0|Not nearly full price at 14.55 for an e-book. I feel this is just the beginning of we the reader getting the shaft. Maybe they'll get the picture if we don't give in and purchase. You've got to love greed!
B0000640VO|3.0|The Bottom Line:    An overrated and inexplicably-beloved film that tries to hide the fact that it's a fundamentally ordinary movie (odd but lovable couple kept apart by contrivances until the final scene) behind layers of sugary schmaltz, watching Amelie is the cinematic equivalent of eating cotton candy till you're stuffed.
B000MV90IU|5.0|If you're into classic movies, blu-ray editions, you'll want \\"Bullitt\\" in your collection. It is worth the money spent to own this classic in blu-ray. Bring back the days when you first went to the theatre to watch on the big screen. I highly recommend \\"Bullitt\\".
B000TGCR38|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A red-blooded adventure of a war movie, Black Book is consistently enthralling for the entirety of its 140 minute running length; though the bookending sequences feel unnecessary and the screenplay is not exactly subtle, this is a quite a little gem from Paul Verhoven.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I never received the order and got a refund from Amazon pretty quickly. A1 Courier service is HORRENDOUS.  They lie on their tracking system and there's no real way to see where your product is.  That being said, I decided to just buy the controller in a store to make sure I actually got what I paid for.  Amazon was prompt and courteous - they just need to fire that delivery service!
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|The Bottom Line:    As long as you can understand the sometimes-thick accents (an occasional problem for American audiences), you'll probably be impressed and entertained by this wonderful little film that combines a sweet little romance with effective and realistic musical scenes; Once is a rough and uncomplicated gem.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|This movie is an 80's classic and a real must-see for all teenagers currently in high school! This movie gives you a real sense of how siblings, parents, administrators and high school can really make you life hell! \\"Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.\\"
B000W1V5VU|3.0|The Bottom Line:    An improvement over the shaky second installment, Ocean's Thirteen does a reasonably good job mixing light humor and light caper; it's a pleasing-enough, forgettable film that appeals to fans of the series without offering anything substantial.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|This is in its self a great movie, but coupling it with an awesome 1080p quality is even better. I love this movie and watching it on blue ray was even more spectacular. Crisp picture perfect.
B00005KKAQ|4.0|Bright Midnight: Live in America is a live album with Doors that was released 2001 and is compilation of performances in many different US cities between 1969 and 1970. The liner notes are written Danny Sugerman. The CD booklet has a cover photo of Morrison. We also get some black and white photos of the other members of the band. 4/5.
1416511946|1.0|this is the worst book i've ever read. it's nikki whining about his drug abuse, which he did by choice, page after page. i used to think motley crue was a bad a** bunch of hardcore guys, now i realize the \\"craziest\\" guy in the group was a complaining whimp. i would hate to read the other members \\"memoirs\\".
B000MCIBAW|5.0|Strange Days being the Doors 1967 release and their second studio album contained such hits as \\"Love Me Two Times\\" and \\"People are Strange\\". The cover is quite interesting has a bunch of people acting like circus folk. The CD booklet is quite nice and the lyrics are easy to read. 5/5.
B000M341QE|5.0|Scorsese, DiCaprio And Nicholson Are Awesome !!! Mr. Scorsese Is At His Best Here !!! 5 Star Flick !!!
B000000WCV|4.0|Ah, Thomas Bangaltar and Roule Records' finest. If you like this album you should check out the Stardust single \\"Music Sounds Better With You\\". I still have the original release on cassette... teehee.
0439023483|5.0|I bought this book because it was recommended by Stephenie Meyer, the author of Twilight. I don't know if it would have came up on Amazon's recommendation list that I have set up for myself or not. But I am sure glad I found out about it! I love this book and cannot wait until the second one comes out. Hunger Games is unlike any other book that I have read. I even let my younger sister (who is in her mid twenties) borrow it. I think it's a book for any age group. I can't wait to get it back from my sister (whose had it for a while) so i can reread it.
B00030590I|4.0|Great action throughout the movie, and an even better story. Jet gives one of his better performances in this one. The visuals are amazing and the fighting is in incredible. Great movie
6300214400|4.0|Leonard Nimoy at the helm creates great and memorable interaction between the original cast, but the action scenes are a bit weak.<br /><br />I just watched this film for the first time and found it to be a very enjoyable adventure and continuation from the outstanding Wrath of Khan with even greater bits of comedy and comraderie amongst the cast.<br /><br />Unfortunately the fight scenes are very rushed and important deaths are just glossed over with little or no attentioned paid to them.  Christopher Lloyd as the villain is serviceable but his motives are not always clear throughout the film.<br /><br />Overall this was a satisfying film from a non-trekker perspective and I'm curious to see what happens to the now disintegrated enterprise.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|I must say, after reading some reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. But I liked it. I agree that it could have used a bit more backstory to explain the origin of Jumpers but even without a lengthy explanation the movie was easy to follow. As for actors, I thought Hayden was great. Easy to watch and believable in the part and I think he and Rachel Bilson have a nice, unforced chemistry. Jamie Bell was great too. If they ever do make a sequel, I'll have it on my watch list.
0312983867|2.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed the Plum series up until \\"Hard Eight.\\"  I had been hoping that Stephanie would improve professionally and personally and instead found that she slid backwards on both.  I only finished it because friends and positive reviews of #9 convinced me that things get better then.    But #8 fell to the bottom of the pile.  I found myself more annoyed than amused by Stephanie.  The build up between her and Ranger for books 1 - 7 has been well done and, in a word, HOT.  But even her hooking up with Ranger was profoundly disappointing - a one night thing?  Really?  I wasn't expecting them to spend the next day picking out china patterns but...?  And the insta-sex with Joe following a harrowing, white-knuckled experience that could have resulted in Stephanie's death is ridiculous.  Again.  Maybe I'd have to actually BE a female bounty hunter to understand Stephanie's point of view on this because I'm baffled by it otherwise.    The cars blowing up.  Enough already.  We get it. She has bad luck with cars.  But does she truly have to be so stupid to not realize that herself AND leave the keys, purse, cell phone, etc. in the car while a crazy rabbit is after her?  AND has blown up previous cars?  It's become a punchline rather than a funny little quirk.    The handcuffs, lack of bullets, total ineptitude when apprehending an FTA stuff...  Good heavens, this is the 8th book in the series, not the first or fifth.  At some point, logic dictates that she would either (A) smarten up or (B) quit the job.  Since she's obviously not going to quit (and I'm still not sure why she doesn't - she'd actually be a decent PI instead), a loyal reader would have some faith that Ms. Evanovich would let nature take its course and have Stephanie learn some lessons and not repeat the same mistakes AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN.    But no.    Our girl Steph is even MORE inept and short sighted than before.    Other things that I felt weighed the book down:  I'm not sure why she doesn't move to another apartment, even in the same building, that does NOT have the issues with the fire escape, though her living on the ground floor would probably result in her being finished off immediately.  Surely there are other apartments in Trenton that would give her the alleged \\"security\\" and companionship that comes with apartment living...    Why doesn't she clue Joe or Ranger in earlier when clearly she's being stalked by a psychopathic killer?  The creep can't be arrested but clearly, by the 8th book, we've all come to learn that the law can be murky at times when Stephanie, Joe and Ranger are involved.  And #8 blatantly emphasizes this as well (her mom's hit & run, Abruzzi's \\"suicide\\").      Is it her pride?  Maybe I'm supposed to be impressed with her pride and independence - but I'm not.  She comes off more as foolish and delusional about her abilities and almost juvenile in her defiance to ask for help from anyone other than Lula.  And it's not like she EVER has any self-confidence, as she is always more shocked than confident that she'll escape the Predicament of the Day.    I've read some reviews on \\"To The Nines\\" (so far, so good) and will give it a shot, but if this were the last book in the series, I'd have considered it a mercy to bury it for good.
1400076943|4.0|Two thumbs up for this story told from an African perspective.  Kambili the shy young Nigerian girl, and her brother, Jaja, are from a well-to do family that includes their submissive mother, Beatrice and tyrant father, Eugene.  Eugene, a staunch Catholic, rules with a heavy hand and his family is slow to disappoint him.  While on a visit to their Aunt and cousins, Kambili and Jaja get to see life the way the other half lives and these experiences transform Kambili and Jaja from sheltered \\"rich kids\\" into young adults with voices and minds of their own.  There are so many other layers to this story, though - religion, politics, wealth/middle class, young love, abuse.  This was quite a find for me and a very enjoyable read.  A solid four star! I look forward to reading more work from this author.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|Having seen the movie more than once has given me a more nuanced appreciation of this epic movie. Its storyline tackles the relationship between two people coming from different cultures who eventually found themselves together -- initially at odds, in love, and part of a family unit -- all amidst the backdrop of the sprawling Australian outback, the divide of races and social strata, the age-old clash between good and evil, and the onset of the second world war in the Pacific! The movie experience is like curling up with an extraordinary epic novel - and at the end feeling what a well-spent afternoon it has been!     The movie's length does justice to this tale of love and adventure in a faraway culture and of unusual natural beauty. The cinematography provides all the lush scenes of the Australian landscape, the rush of blood in some of the most awesome action scenes, and the loving closeups of the story of the relationship between Lady Sarah Ashley, The Drover, and their defacto son, Nullah! The musical score gives the movie the perfect complement to the excellent cinematography. The story unwinds from an initial meeting full of comedic winks ( including the now famous shower scene - featuring the leading man!) and clashing cultures. It then dawns on the central role played by the child Nullah and his aboriginal culture. Plus what would an epic movie be without the quintessential villains? As the movie progresses and we witness the triumph of the independent cattle company versus the monopoly, it also gives us a slice of Australian history and its development in its early frontiers. When the second world war breaks out and it marches down to Darwin, we are caught in another story between good and evil, so cinematically well-portrayed. And they lived happily ever after, with a twist --the expected end of a truly epic movie!     Who are the main characters and how are they portrayed?     Lady Sarah Ashley is the English rose who became an adopted daughter of the Australian frontier. She is transformed into a loving nurturer of a child and the harsh land because the relationship which came into her life also changed her outlook. Nicole Kidman very ably portrays this complicated woman who changes from a non-sympathetic character to a caring heroine. This transformation is so well portrayed in the changing face of Lady Ashley - from the very beautiful and well-turned out woman to the woman whose inner beauty shines through her bedgraggled locks and almost plain face, through her pained expression as she undergoes tragedy and is touched by sorrow, and finally to the look of someone who has come to terms with what is important in life. This is one of Nicole's best movie portrayals!     The Drover has a mysterious past and a rough image as we are first introduced to him. He is a man who is iconic in the history of the outback but it was his reaching out to the shunned aboriginal community in the past which showed that he was an extraordinary man. In the song by Elton John, played second in the movie credits, called The Drover's Ballad, his story turns out to be rich in tragedy and a life full of love for the outback, which gives us more of a complete picture of this man with a heart of gold. The tragic life seems to follow him even much later in the movie - and this is where he shows his heart on his sleeve! Hugh Jackman is magnificent in the role and it is hard to imagine anybody else giving a more masterful performance. The magnificence is not just in how he looked ( Baz Luhrmann did show Hugh Jackman as the representation of physical perfection...surprisingly, because the other choice was Nicole Kidman) but also in his acting chops. There are several scenes where Hugh displays his acting range at the highest emotional level - when he realizes that the people he loved may have become victims of the tragedy of war...and then the realization that fate had actually been kinder. Who can't help but be mesmerized by his face and his voice in the scene by the burning war HQ and at the ruined bar, in the Mission Island rescue, and at the wharf in Darwin? Had the past of the drover been more meaningfully played out on the screen, the role could have garnered Hugh an award recognition!     The third important role is the child Nullah, as charmingly portrayed by a new child actor named Brandon Walters. He charms everyone except the villain. He is in a sense at the heart of the story and Brandon makes us follow Nullah's journey with almost a maternal/paternal eye for his welfare in the story. At the end, he is conflicted about his real family and culture, but I am sure that when Nullah grows up, it will both cultures and both families that he will truly call his own!     Kudos likewise to the actors who portrayed the main villain, the iconic aboriginal character, the Drover's friend and main man, even the hotel keeper and his gruff ways...as well as to the other Australian actors who gave life to this epic story.     The creatives have done well to transform such a tale magnificently on screen! Baz Luhrmann provides the vision and the direction of the story-telling with such interesting and charismatic characters and amidst a magnificent background of natural beauty, culture, and slices of history!     While the movie could only be given full justice in a cinema with its impressive big screen and excellent sound, I would still love to get a DVD/blu-ray version to allow me to see it again and again - much like wanting to read and re-read a very good epic novel!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This was my first Jane Eyre movie and I think it was perfect. I just read Jane Eyre for the first time last month and quickly fell in love with it. This movie isn't exactly like the book but surprisingly I'm ok with that. I normally hate book-to-film adaptations but this was well done. I liked that they chose to make it contempary so Jane Eyre neo-phytes (like myself) can catch on. Toby Stephens plays Mr. Rochester perfectly and Ms. Wilson was a great Jane. I don't know if I will see any other movies but if I do this will be the one to beat.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|Interesting how a single rifle shot can start a staggering chain of events with international ramifications.  The shot was not fired with malice, nor with evil intent, but with carelessness; yet the response is a series of mixed signals, misinformation, and definitely miscommunication.  Using the Tower of Babel as rich allegory, director Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu (try saying that three times in a row) tells a powerful story of confusion and cultural conflict in his compelling film BABEL.<br /><br />Here four totally separate (or so we first believe) stories play out simultaneously, on three continents.  An American couple (Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett) is vacationing in western Africa when they fall victim to a bizarre incident; a farmer and shepherd (Mustapha Rachidi), trying to eek out a living in the Moroccan desert, sends his two young sons out to protect his goat heard, and gives them a rifle to protect the livestock from predators.  Meanwhile, the American couple's nanny (Adriana Barraza) makes a most unfortunate decision to take the couple's two children from San Diego into Mexico to attend a wedding; while in Japan, a deaf-mute teenage girl (Rinko Kikuchi) is having a most difficult time coming to grips with the recent death of her mother--even while authorities are searching for her businessman father (Koji Yakusho) to question him for a shooting that occurred in western Africa.<br /><br />Inarritu (with the astute help of writer Guillermo Arriago) weaves these stories together until the viewer understands the confusion, the miscommunication--the cultural disconnect.  And his cast is superb:  Pitt and Blanchett are outstanding, while the young Kikuchi appears in one of the film's most eye-opening scenes.  BABEL is anything but a \\"feel good\\" movie, but for viewers looking for a complex story compelling them to think, this is it.<br />\\"If you want to be understood. . .listen.\\"<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:1413406114 Walk-On]]

0896760839|5.0|I am quite fond of this book, it not simply giving illustration to what was worn, but also giving insight into how it was made, repaired and in general used by the original owners.  I am very pleased to have this volume in my library.
0061689246|5.0|This is indeed a gentle fairy tale.  It's a beautiful story.  The guy gets the right girl at the end, not the one he thought was right at the beginning.  That's the best part -- the boy grows to appreciate real women, while the heroine is lively and intelligent.
1932100660|5.0|I am not much of a reader so when i was suggested to read this book i bought it with no real desire to ever read it, but after reading the introduction i was actually upset when I had to stop reading it! I took the book everywhere with me, so even if I had a couple minutes of down time I could read it. I am now reading it for the second time and find it even more AMAZING!  I can honestly say this book will save my life, and it has.  I used to eat meat and dairy with the best of them, and had a closed mind like most as well, but when I read this, i was absolutely shocked to say the least! Every fact is backed up by facts which is what I liked.  The book covers so many things people have been brainwashed about and I now suggest everyone that I know to read this book. They will not regret it.  This was the best $11.00 I have ever spent!
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This is one of the truly greatest love stories.  I found \\"Love Actually\\" to be quite refreshing and not the typical predictable love story with a happy ending.  I was amazed at the tempo and the way the movie sectioned off into each fun-filled episodes that was so entertaining and emotionally moving at the same time.  You were never bored or left hanging in the atmosphere of a scene.  The scenes just got better and funnier with each character portrayal.  This movie was very surprising. Like a bag full of treats for everyone.  I watched it several times and enjoyed particularly, the acting of \\"Colin Firth\\" and \\"Hugh Grant\\".  These two English actors were never my favorites but after this spectacular movie, I am a fan of both for life.  If you are an  incredibly romantic person and love people portraying real life situations that you can wholly identify with, then this is your movie.  You know a movie is worth watching when you really hate the holiday emphasize but find that it really didn't enter your mind that it was made for Xmas.  You truly would watch it because it is just what it is, a heart-warming adventure on cinema.  I hope everyone watches it at least once and discovers that they are captured by it.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|The Shortbus was nothing more than soft/hardcore porn. I mixed the label to say that there was alot (the entire background in one scene) of sex happening, but it wasn't too much for the premise of the movie. It opens with one of the lead characters sucking HIMSELF  off. Then the sexual content get more intense from that point on. I recommend the movie, if you feel like, as the director says, 'a story that happens to have real sex in it'. But the plot of the psychiatrist trying to find HER orgasm seem a little but crazy (in a good way), as soft porn usually does.  The characters are interesting and cute enough to have you follow on their journey, but what else is there?

0810970686|5.0|As a parent or a boy who doesn't like to read these books are wonderful.  My son would ask at least once a week when the new one would be out.  As soon as he got it he immediately sat down and started reading.  I hated to ask him to quit reading and go to sleep as normally I would be asking him to quit watching tv/playing video games and go to sleep.  He read it straight through the first day he got it and then read it again, just as he had done with the others in this series.  The only thing that could make it better is if there were just more of them.

In this book you get not only Nikki's point of view but the point of view of the other people that watched it all go down, Friends, famly, ex lovers. I have read this book twice and intend on reading it again.
0061150142|5.0|This book had so many different elements in it. I don't usually read books that are so serious and I have to say with themes of murder, suicide, abuse, teen pregnancy and adultery this book had a lot of serious elements in it. What made the story so accessible were the characters. I was completely drawn in by the various reactions different characters had to highly stressful situations. Luckily, even with such heavy topics, the story never actually got very dark, or at least not to the point that I felt emotionally disturbed. I was truly interested in being taken on the ride of a murder trial and living through several months in jail.  I particularly enjoyed getting into the heads of the four parents in this story and the different way they each react to a terrible situation. The Pact was different for me, but I enjoyed it.  I am certain to try another Piccoult book in the near future.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|This gun is pretty cool, It shoots about 30 ft. Sometimes it gets jammed and the bullets bend but the overall gun is great. The scope is not very accurate so you will have to point it just a little higher than your target. Overall Its a good gun with realistic loading.

0780626966|5.0|I won't talk too much about the movies themselves since we've all seen them at one time or another. I can say that the price was hard to beat, and they arrived in great shape. All the special features are too many to mention, and they are great to watch after watching the movies.    I sat down and watched all seven in a row after I got them even though I only planned on watching two or three initially. They are that good. They drew me in and I could stop watching them.    I love all things horror, and A Nightmare On Elm Street collection is no different. I anticipate buying many movies from Amazon in the near future.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Truth, they say, is stranger than fiction, and that is certainly the case with CHANGELING.<br /><br />This amazing story is, indeed, one that would be difficult to believe if it were not factual.<br /><br />Oscar-nominated Angelina Jolie stars as Christine Collins, a single mother living in 1928 Los Angeles.  One day, while at work at the telephone company, her son vanishes without a trace.  A nationwide search proves fruitless until, five months later, her \\"son\\" is located in the Midwest and returned to Los Angeles.<br /><br />The problem is that the kid is not Collins' son, even though the police insist that he is.  After all, it would be very embarrassing to this then very corrupt police department if they'd found the wrong boy, right?<br /><br />When Collins keeps insisting that they've returned the wrong boy to her, the cops arrest her and put her into a mental institution, planning to keep her there until she stops her \\"rant\\".<br /><br />In the meantime, another detective, working a totally unrelated case, makes a shocking discovery involving a brutal serial killer who may be responsible for the disappearance of Collins' son.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has directed another powerful motion picture, enhancing his reputation as one of our finest directors.  The recreation of time and place is uncanny, and Jolie delivers a superb performance.<br /><br />John Malkcovich, Jeffrey Donovan and Amy Ryan co-star.<br /><br />DVD extras include two featurettes in which Eastwood and Jolie discuss the making of this unusual film and the actual case upon which it was based.<br /><br />© Michael B.

0316017922|5.0|Don't let the statistical term for the title fool you, or intimidate you, because this book is an easy read, written in standard English.  The ideas presented here are thought-provoking, substantiated, and objective.  Gladwell does not have an agenda, rather he's making some very intelligent observations about the world in which we live.  Among his other observations is the fact that some people born just before the Great Depression were in the perfect position to finish college or come home from WWII (with the GI Bill) at a perfect time to take advantage of our economic upswing.  Those born in the 1830's (Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, etc) were primed to take advantage of our paradigm shift into an industrial age in the 19th century.  Had Vanderbilt been born in 1850, he would have missed the boat.  Bill Gates, born in 1955, rode the Computer Revolution to success (along with his 10,000 hours of programming, which is an interesting story in and of itself).      You'll learn why you don't mess with a Southern man (I like that one), as well as why Asian children tend to perform better at math (it's not genetics).      Although not explicitly stated in the text, the general idea is apparent:  All people are basically the same.  We have to work hard, but we also have to find the right opportunity.  You can take a small child out of Botswana and an Iowa farmer's child, give them identical educational opportunities, and probably see basically the same results.      This book makes one wonder:  what opportunities are we missing right now, and what's coming down the road?  If we really are headed for a 2nd Great Depression, am I at 29 years old at the worst possible age, while my children may benefit greatly, or vice versa?

B00127RAJY|4.0|I have been doing the 30 Day Shred for a month.  I do it about five days a week.  I haven't gotten to level 3, but each level is challenging as long as you give it your all.  I'm watching what I eat (reduced calories by 500 a day) and doing this program.  I have lost 5 lbs, my jeans are fitting so nicely, and I didn't have much to lose in the first place.  I'm very pleased with this product.  I gave it four stars instead of five because it does still take individual willpower to get the most of this video (do it at the best pace and weights you can handle each time.. push harder once you get stronger), and she does get a little annoying.  Like others, I try to turn down the volume pretty low after I know the routine well.  Get this product, use it, see results!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This is a very intense prog-metal album by Dream Theater, the best band of the 21st century (so far) and also the most cerebral.  Check out the articles about the album on Wikipedia and [...] which explains how the entire album (music and booklet) is unified by a coherent vision.  Every time I get a new Dream Theater album, I am thoroughly impressed and amazed.  These guys really rock.    Some commnents on the songs:  \\"The Root of All Evil\\" continues Mike Portnoy's Alcoholics Anonymous suite.  \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You\\" offer spiritual hope.  \\"These Walls\\" and \\"Panic Attack\\" continue DT's commentary on psychological states of mind.  \\"Never Enough\\" expresses a rock star's frustration with under-appreciative fans.  \\"Sacrified Sons\\" is a poignant song reacting to the attacks of 9/11.  The 24 minute title track is a complicated work in 5 parts about the cyclical nature of all things that reaches a climax at the end of the fourth part when James LaBrie repeats the phrase \\"Trapped inside this Octavarium\\" 4 times.  Every song is thoughtful and musically rich.

B000009O8A|5.0|I rented this movie many years ago in VHS and liked it so much that I purchased it in DVD. If you enjoy nudity in your pics, you will certainly enjoy Camile Keaton's cute perky little breasts and the blatent full frontal nudity appearing in much of this movie. The rape scenes are graphic, believable, and clearly visable but not to the point of being pornographic. The story line is weak and predictable but with Camile Keaton parading around fully naked the story is not really important. The DVD has \\"chapter stops\\" which enable you to return to specific scenes at will. If you are looking for a titillating movie, this is the one.  I understand there are other versions of this movie, but i purchased the Original Uncut Version and am very happy with it.
0525951113|5.0|Daniel Suarez has taken Neal Stephenson's place as the premiere sci-fi tech novelist, and this is just his first novel. Daemon, which tells the story of a dead MMO game developer's daemon's attempt to change and run the world, is an amazing, non-stop tour de force of energy, excitement, thrills and brilliance.     The Daemon is triggered when news of its creator has died. It then begins its mission of killing, recruiting, and taking over the economy of the world. A myriad number of people, from a police sergeant, identity thief hacker, and government scientists attempt to stop the daemon from gaining dominance. Along the way we are taken on a brilliant ride that we never want to end, in a world eerily similar to our own.    I could not put this book down. It was simply that amazing. If you miss Neal Stephenson, especially since Cryptonomicon was his last great book (the last four are simply horrid), then you will want to definitely check out Daniel Suarez.    I can't wait for the sequel, which is coming out in 2010.

0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals had been on my reading list for some time before I picked up the book.  First, it is very well researched and written; I looked forward to reading it and it held my attention so I often forgot what time it was.  I had not read about Abraham Lincoln in depth before with most of my reading about this period concerned with the overall Civil War with such books as Shelby Foote's \\"The Civil War: A Narrative.\\"      The focus of this book is Lincoln and his cabinet with specific emphasis on his relationship with the three men who also sought the presidency in 1860: William Seward, Salmon Chase and Edward Bates.  Edwin Stanton was not among Lincoln's rivals but he had met Lincoln when the future president was a lawyer and was working on a case that Stanton argued in court.  Doris Kearns Goodwin provides an overall picture of the Civil War battles and generals but the details are concerned with Lincoln, the members of his cabinet and their families.  Ms Goodwin's book traces how the three rivals for the presidency, all hostile to Lincoln, were transformed into allies by working with the President and felt respect and love for the man leading the country through its most difficult period. My fascination with the book was how these relationships began and grew during the conflict of the Civil War and how Seward, Stanton, Chase and Bates worked together (and sometimes against each other) and how they contributed to the effort to bring the Union together.  We learn about how Lincoln made such decisions as what form his Emancipation Proclamation took and when it needed to be issued and how crises such as the early defeat of Union forces was felt by all of the cabinet members and how they felt about sending so many men to fight in a conflict that cost so many lives and maimed even more of their countrymen.    Not knowing many details about Lincoln I found Ms. Goodwin's book was highly informative about the 16th President presenting him as a human being with all of the positive and negative aspects of his life. I came away knowing and respecting Abraham Lincoln much more, and I can say the same about his rivals.  An aspect of Ms. Goodwin's book that I found interesting is her frequent quoting from sources as she describes a scene. As an example, the following lines relate the reaction of the audience following Lincoln's Gettysburg Address:     \\"When Lincoln finished, \\"the assemblage stood motionless and silent,\\" according to the awestruck George Gitt. \\"The extreme brevity of the address together with its abrupt close had so astonished the hearers that they stood transfixed. Had not Lincoln turned and moved toward his chair, the audience would very likely have remained voiceless for several moments more. Finally, there came applause.\\"     On occasion, there are some passages that over use pronouns like \\"he\\" and \\"his\\" that made me uncertain as to who was being referred to in the text.  By reading a few lines I could be certain who was being discussed. A good example is on page 621 where the final paragraph says:     \\"Addressing a packed audience the day before his departure for Sherman's army, he began by calmly summarizing the report's findings. The self-control swiftly vanished, however, as he turned his anger on Chase.\\"       Team of Rivals is a magnificent book and is a well-organized and researched book about Lincoln.   If you are interested in the Civil War period and Abraham Lincoln, in particular, this book should be on your bookshelf.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|This was a top notch legal thriller -- stylish with decent dialogue, taut plot with some interesting twists, a well developed villain and protagonist, and excellent acting all around.  The weakest part of the film for me was the obligatory love interest, but that was a very minor distraction.  Five stars may be a tad excessive, but for its genre it was one of most engrossing I've seen.  I did guess the ending a short while before it was revealed, but not so soon that it spoiled the suspense.

Ever since then, my whole perspective changed on Music and Punk itself. This spawned into me checking out all the old Punk bands like The Clash, The Dammed, The Ramones etc. Since then I haven't even bothered to listen to GreenDay, Good Charlotte or Blink182. I realized they were just a bunch of talentless punk wannabes who were just in it for the money and had nothing important or intelligent to say. I'm so glad I bought this album. This is true Punk music.

1591841666|5.0|We've all been there, right? You know...That point where you've been working really hard at something, giving it your all, but  it feels like you're treading water or walking in place. You just don't seem to be making any progress. And though you may have started sure success would be right around the corner if you just kept plugging away, at this point you're beginning to wonder if it's all been a waste.     Maybe you're headed down the wrong path...Or you don't have what it takes...Or you're not sure you can keep up the pace without seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. If this sounds familiar, according to Seth Godin, you're in \\"the dip\\".     The question you now have to answer is: Are you stuck in a dead-end cul de sac, or are you just in a temporary dip? Knowing this will tell you whether to keep on keepin' on, or quit and find a different path.     This little book helps you tell the difference between a temporary dip and a dead end so you don't waste valuable time and resources going down the wrong road. And so you don't give up when your goal is within reach (but perhaps just out of sight). Hallelujah!
B000GIXIBY|5.0|I became a fan of Bruce Campbell after seeing 'Army of Darkness' when it was first released in theatres. I am not a horror fan by any means, but this movie is more comedy than horror, and it's a film that I enjoy every time I see it. I bought it so that I could view it with a bunch of guys, and they all agreed it was worth seeing. I haven't seen either of the 'Evil Dead' movies but may do so, sometime in the future. The HD side played fine for 10 minutes, and then pooped out, so we flipped it over and played the regular DVD side, which due to upconversion seemed the same to me. I don't think the disc was the problem--my friends HD player has had similar problems in the past. If you want a fun movie with some horror, some action, and lots of humor (including references to many other movies), see 'Army of Darkness'
1400064287|5.0|Ever wonder why some (often incredibly crazy-sounding) urban   legends seem to stay around forever? Or what makes a catch-  phrase like \\"Where's the beef?\\" turn into a national obsession?   If not, maybe you should. Because the answer could have a big   impact on your business.     In Made to Stick, brothers Chip and Dan Heath explain the six   traits that make any idea--whether it's a line from a sales   presentation, a slogan, or your elevator speech--\\"sticky\\". Using   the acronym SUCCESs, they define these traits as Simple,   Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories.     It's a formula anyone can follow, and if you're in business you   owe it to yourself to learn how. This book makes it easy, and   it's just plain good reading. I highly recommend it!
1400082773|4.0|\\"Where once I'd felt the need to live up to his expectations, I now felt as if I had to make up for all his mistakes\\"  So says Barack Obama of his father in the sentence which is at the core of this fascinating memoir.     Written 15 years ago when the unknown Barack Obama was the first black President of the Harvard Law Society the book sold modestly. Unsurprisingly now back in print it is a best seller. Most politicians write their memoirs after, rather than before the event justifying and glorifying their actions. Or they write political tracts full of self promotion. This is neither of those sorts of book. Instead we enter the mind and inner thoughts of the 33 year old Obama as he tries, at times painfully, to grapple with the sense of his own identity and purpose.    Obama's autobiographical details are as unusual as they are intriguing and offer some sort of explanation as to the man he was later to become. Born in Hawaii to a black Kenyan academic and white university student who hailed from Kansas he spent his primary school years in Jakarta before returning to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents and attend a private high school. The only memories he retains of his father are from aged 10 when \\"the old man\\", as Obama calls him, returns from Kenya for a brief, tense family Christmas in Hawaii. When the Old man, now in his third marriage and with numerous children, is killed aged 45 in a Kenyan car accident Obama is robbed of the opportunity to establish a relationship.     Obama writes lucidly with wonderful turns of phrase and if his chosen profession fails to work out he has another readymade as a writer. We sense his confusion and resentment at school where he is known as Barry, kids run their hands through his tight curls, give him high fives and treat him like a cool street rapper. He hangs out with his white grandfather in black bars and at card games and tries to grasp his grandmother's fear of being robbed by a black man at the bus stop.We follow his progress as a student where he lives in a flat eating soup from a can and even sleeping rough in New York when he is locked out of his apartment. A growing desire to try and understand the place of the black man in America takes him to Chicago and there are some moving insights to his work as a Community Organiser; surely the most thankless of tasks. We read of his efforts to motivate communities where on cold weeknight evenings he speaks in church halls at woefully attended meetings. He tries to understand the paradox that as many of the black people in this most divided of cities become successful their communities break down; they retreat to soulless suburbs and lock their doors. The final section of the book is cathartic as he visits Kenya and meets his large extended family: \\"My name belonged and so I belonged, drawn into a web of relationships, alliances and grudges that I did not yet understand\\".    Some strong characters emerge from the pages:   His rather sad maternal Grandfather, Gramps, so full of dreams and aspirations but who finishes as a failed insurance salesman. His streetwise assistant in Chicago, Johnnie, who was as happy discussing \\"..jazz, black women's backsides or Federal Reserve Bank policy..\\".His wonderful Kenyan half sister Auma who because of intelligence and verve finds herself supporting the extended Kenyan family. And inevitably his father who transforms from debonair, wealthy , bright high level public servant to womanising, drinking, feckless failure and then back to somewhere in between over the course of the narrative.    Criticisms of such a brave book seem harsh. His mother appears briefly and is not well drawn yet we know she was his most powerful influence. The subject matter is by nature introspective and though never self indulgent or pitying may have benefitted from more wit. Some sections are overly long.    What else can \\"Dreams from my Father\\" tell us about the 44th President of the United States? His intelligence and eloquence go without saying but here is a man who is also self critical, analytical, sensitive and contemplative. He will need a full hand of all these talents as he embarks on his greatest challenge to date.    One senses however that he no longer feels the need to either live up or make up for the dreams of his father.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" has a brilliant cast and contains moments of pure genius. The story follows the exploits of a troubled suburban family as they drive across the country to enter their seven year old daughter in the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" pageant. I am a big fan of both Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell, but in this case I think Carell did the better job as a formerly suicidal professor (and America's number one Proust expert). My favorite scenes in the film were of the interactions between Carell and Paul Dano as a angst-ridden teenager who has taken a vow of silence related to his desire to become an Air Force pilot (you'll have to watch the film for all the confusing details.) Dano and Carell manage to be both genuinely disturbed and genuinely touching, especially late in the movie.<br /><br />The plot is more than a bit contrived and formulaic, although the last ten minutes were rather unpredictable. I found the film to get off to a very slow start, and the pace to be somewhat plodding throughout, although the last half hour is more captivating than the first hour. Although this is a movie about a family, this is not a family film, and the R rating is there for several reasons, not the least of which are very mature themes, and excessively foul language, especially from Alan Arkin. I was extremely pleased, though, that the film skewered the unfortunate scourge of sub-teen beauty pageants: I was genuinely creeped out by the young contestants (and their families.) The conclusion of the pageant was shocking and, while amusing, made a serious comment on contemporary mores.<br /><br />The cast is talented, and the critiques of modern society, particularly the exposure of the false values of the winner and loser, are frequently on the money if you look past the superficial veneer of the movie as strictly a comedy. Despite the obvious talent that went into the movie, I was less enthusiastic than I expected, given my respect for the cast members: the pacing was often slow (particularly at the outset), and the script was full of gratuitous exchanges seemingly placed simply for shock value and a cheap laugh (e.g. Arkin's diatribe to Dano about virility) that went far beyond what was necessary to establish the lack of functional cohesiveness as a family unit. There are moments of unadulterated brilliance in the film, but it is by no means deserving of the highly effusive praise from such luminous sources as \\"Newsweek\\" and \\"USA Today.\\"ly at the outset), and the script was full of gratuitous exchanges seemingly placed simply for shock value and a cheap laugh (e.g. Arkin's diatribe to Dano about virility) that went far beyond what was necessary to establish the lack of functional cohesiveness as a family unit.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is a surprisingly dark production, with hidden depths of meaning and cultural references.    Rather unexpected, seeing as its produced by Pixar, owned by Disney, and marketed as a ''kiddie'' show.       Consider these:-         (1) Wall-E has tens of thousands of other colleagues, all dead. He's the last one left 'alive'.  How does he manage it?  He survives by scavanging spareparts from his dead colleagues. I.e. he's conceptually a cannibal.  But driven to cannibalism in order to survive.  Very dark and gloomy.     (2)  Then you ask yourself,  why did all his colleagues died, and why only Wall-E survived?  He has become different - i.e. he MUTATED. And the source of of his difference must be 'faulty' or non-standard programming. He must have mutated, became different from his original \ programming, so he learnt how to survive by scavanging, self-repair, and finding shelter against the ravages of weather and nature.  His mutation is also shown by his ''deviant'' behaviour of starting a memorabilia / musuem like collection of trinkets significant to himself.     (3)  He watches old musicals on an old VSH videoplayer somehow patched into an i-Pod.  More evidence of his mutation.  Note that there is no evidence that any other of his colleagues indulges in such behaviour (nor for that matter, survived long enough to develop a behaviourial pattern like that).     (4)  At another level, the tale of Wall-E is also the 'Adam and Eve' Biblical story rehashed / transposed into an alternative future setting.  Wall-E is the innocent, 'male'.  Eva the svelt, powerful, high-tech, simultaneouly threatening and seductive personification of the eternal Siren.      (5) Eva brought back to Axiom (in a womb-like receptacle in her torso) evidence of life, thus Eva represents the life-bringer/bearer female principle.     (6)  However, Eva's 'gift' or message is a highly dangerous one, because it threatens the very existence of the highly automated ''idyllic'' lifestyle mankind has apparently achieved for themselves in Axiom.  Thus, Eva is both the Eve-Tempress, and Pandora's box, rolled into one.  Eva is the bearer of news that will destroy mankind's idyllic, Paradise-like innocent existence.  In a word, Eva IS the forbidden fruit, bearing a message of death & destruction disguised as hope.    (7)  Eva's gift seduces the current Captain of Axiom into launching a mistaken, idealized quest to return all his passengers to Earth.  Surely this is a descent into Hell.  All the passengers onboard Axiom are so urbanized, spoilt and decadent that exposure to Earth's environment and a forcible return to an agrarian economy would likely cause very high rates of death.     (8)  ''Auto'' - the Hal-9000 like figure of Axiom - is portrayed as a villain, trying to cover-up and deny Eva's message.  But really, was he the villain, or just Virtue mis-portrayed ?  Or he was just trying to save Paradise from being destroyed, preventing humanity from being cast out of Paradise?  Of all protagonists in the show, Auto seems to be the only one conscious of the destruction that would surely await the passengers of Axiom once they return to Earth.  Did that occur to any of us watching the show? Wall-E may be cute, but my favourite character is ''Auto''.     Why do I like Auto? In terms of idea and archetypes, Auto's the ancient mythic Dragon-character (horoscopically I am a Dragon), guarding jealously a treasure - in this case the treasure is the sole surviving example of high civilization and his trusteeship of millions of obese, helpless child-like humans, dependant every minute of their hapless pampered existence on Auto's comprehensive 5-Star-Hotel like everything-catered-for ''Room service can I help you?'' environs.     ''Auto'' for me personifies and represents duty, loyalty to duty, and self-sacrifice. He operates under a severe burden - of the knowledge that Earth has died, and the conditions then would be utterly fatal to his naive human charges (the Captain thinks pizzas grow on trees furgawdsakes!!). As such, he has the almost unbearable burden of continuing the cruise indefinitely into the future.     Auto is a tragic-hero figure, tragically miscast in the role of a villain just because he's the only protagonist in the movie realizing that a return to Earth (not your ideal sylvian Garden of Eden even in its state today in 2009!) would easily cause 99% of his passengers to die horribly of disease and famine, and he heroically ACTS on that realization - by attempting to cover up Eva's message of doom. I luuuurve 'Auto'. Duty and Loyalty are his watchwords. On the altar of servitude and duty, he sacrificed even his perceived 'virtue' and comes across as a heartless, obsessive villain.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|Here's the deal. We saw this movie at the theater just over a year ago and came across the dvd at the library and picked it up to watch again. May I just share that if you haven't seen this, it's worth your time. We were able to also watch the extra cd that shows the making and it is quite amazing.<br /><br />If you're a Beatles fan, it's a no brainer, you'll love it. If you're not sure you want to hear others singing their songs or tempting your mind with what \\"just maybe\\" could have been meant by \\"strawberry fields\\" or \\"Dear Prudence\\"...well, maybe you should. I could go on and on... loved it and want to own it now and by it for family and friends! Enjoy~

0143038419|1.0|The real struggle of this book is not that of the author, but of the reader trying to decide whether to wade through yet another page of poorly written dross. If it were a comedy, it might be the poor woman's Seinfeld - a book about nothing. Unfortunately it does not rise to such levels.    The first section \\"Eat\\" was largely narcissistic and boring. I made it as far as chapter 12 of 36 only because I kept thinking,\\"It must get better than this.\\" I won't know because it was not just completely self absorbed, it committed the cardinal sin of being dull.    I skipped to the second section \\"Pray\\", in the hope that it might get better. It was an improvement but could have been a badly re-written version of Celestial Prophecy. I couldn't discern the voices  of the different characters. They all sounded like the author. The Texan, the Indian, even God all spoke like the author in Yoda mode. Everything just happened at the right time, right place, right situation. Unfortunately the author seems  to have left out parts which may have been difficult for her to deal with. A shame because these would have lifted her and her friends from being one dimensional caricatures to three dimensional people.    The third section is just chick lit romance. If you like that then you'll enjoy the third part. But don't expect much improvement on the other two sections in terms of writing, character, or narcissism.     If this were a work of fiction, it wouldn't make it to the publisher. As a memoir, it's a boring piece of self indulgent shallowness. That this book made it to the best seller lists is more a comment on the vanity of those who liked it that the quality of the work.     Definitely a Do Not Recommend

0634022296|4.0|This book has tons of Beatles songs. The songs are listed alphabetically, on each page you will find the lyrics, chords, and chord diagrams for each song. Its easy to use. I am a beginner and I think their songs range from easy to pretty difficult. This book has definitely exposed me to more unusual chords I haven't worked with before...some very easy. Its actually helping me to improve my guitar playing. I would suggest this book for anyone that enjoys the Beatles and playing the guitar.     One negative thing I did notice is that there are so many songs, unfortunately many I have never even heard, so this book may be overkill for people like me that have only listened to about 8 of their albums focusing mostly on their greatest hits.

B00028HBKM|2.0|Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", while undoubtedly a well-done and stunning movie, is also thinly veiled propaganda for traditionalist Catholicism. It's remarkable that so many evangelicals have expressed support for it. But then, many evangelicals and similar groups co-operate with the Moonie Jonathan Wells. So perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised by their opportunism towards Gibson?<br /><br />The traditionalist Catholic slant of \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is obvious in many ways. Some of the situations depicted in the movie aren't found in the Gospels, but in the visions of a Catholic mystic, Anne Catherine Emmerich. Others seem to be Gibson's own invention, but they are consistent with Catholic tradition, as when Satan mocks the Madonna and the Child. The whole concentration on the violent suffering of Jesus also looks very Catholic. So is the use of the Latin language. Jesus speaks to Pontius Pilate in Latin, although Greek would have been more likely. While Pilate was a Roman, the lingua franca of the East Mediterranean was Greek. There is no indication in the Gospels that Jesus used an interpreter when speaking to Pilate, which suggests that the Gospel writers assumed their conversation to be in Greek (which is also the language of the Gospels themselves.) So why the use of the Latin language? Presumably because Latin is the traditional liturgical language of the Catholic Church. Indeed, much of the conflict between traditionalist Catholics and Vatican II Catholics has been over the use of the traditional Latin mass. I also noticed that the Latin spoken by Pilate and Jesus in the Gibson's movie sounds like Italian! Apparently, ecclesiastical Latin does have an \\"Italian\\" pronunciation.<br /><br />But the most contentious issue concerning the movie is, of course, the real or perceived anti-Semitism. The Jews of the Sanhedrin certainly look like anti-Semitic stereotypes. Herod Antipas is depicted as an effeminate gay. Also, Pilate is cast in the role of unwilling executioner, as in the Gospel of John, the most anti-Jewish of the four gospels. Of course, it's difficult to make a \\"pro-Jewish\\" traditional Christian movie about Jesus. Traditional Christianity isn't pro-Jewish, anymore than Orthodox Judaism is pro-Christian. However, Gibson should at least have excised the more blatant stereotypes. That Gibson later made anti-Semitic remarks during the infamous DUI incident, hardly helped his case, despite his public apologies to the Jewish communities.<br /><br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is an artistic achievement as a movie, but due to its problematic contents, I can only give it two stars.

B001G9LVGG|5.0|When I heard that Loreena Mckennitt was recording a new album, I was ecstatic, with many high hopes, and I must say that I am far from being disappointed.  These new songs for the season are not only soothing and relaxing but bring out a real seasonal spirit.  Though the style is a bit more medieval compared to her previous album, I have fallen in love with it all the same.  The way that Loreena can form a mental picture in your mind while listening is completely awe-inspiring.  I hope to hear more from Loreena Mckennitt in future days, for she just seems to get better and better.    -I.R. Skaggs
B000BZIT5M|4.0|I've seen a lot of Boheme's on video.  This one's pretty good.<br /><br />Acting-wise (and vocally) I like Stratas a lot, though I find Zeffirelli's taste in sets over-the-top.  And the lighting and acting in the 1960's Karajan version are so bad as to be obtrusive.  I don't know if there's a perfect Boheme on video or film, but this one comes close.<br /><br />This production has its shortcomings (including the tenor) but Cotrubas's acting, vocal and physical, make it deeply touching.<br /><br />On the down side, the garret is overly bright and has an odd physical layout, though one the staging uses well enough.  The Musetta I find vocally shrill and a bit hammy (but isn't it always so?).<br /><br />And the Rodolfo Neil Shicoff opens his fishface and screams inches away from Mimi's nose in a disturbing fashion:  he's loud, louder and loudest, and we never think he's a person, always an opera singer.  Not good.<br /><br />On the plus side, Ileana Cotrubas effectively paints Mimi as a simple person--remarkably simple.  You get the idea that I think is in the libretto:  Rudolfo talks about poetry but Mimi IS poetry.  She's so simple, she doesn't know she's dying--even when it happens--and a fur muff can delight her, even in her last hours.<br /><br />She even vocally portrays the death effectively.  It's difficult for a smart person to portray someone simple without mugging, but I think Cotrubas does that here.<br /><br />There are other pluses.  Thomas Allen is handsome and youthful in this role, and it's nice to see him in something besides Mozart.  When he and Musetta fight, you know very well that it's all foreplay--a keen bit of insight.<br /><br />The Colline and Schaunard are characterful and fun.  And musically, it's all good enough not to distract.<br /><br />Usually I tear up a bit in the last act, maybe shed a tear during Rodolfo's last cries of anguish, but in this I was consistently just about bawling.  Maybe not the right yardstick, but it says something.

1401207138|3.0|I am obviously not giving 3 stars for Watchmen itself, which is both the greatest graphic novel of all time and one of the greatest literary works of the 20th century in any medium (an opinion shared by TIME Magazine literary critics). This Absolute Edition, however, doesn't make justice to its content. The paper is the same as in other editions, and the binding is very poor, getting loose upon first reading in the copy I own (5th printing). For a sample of how a REAL Absolute Edition should be like, check out Absolute Sandman (leather-bound, round spine and much superior glossy paper). Maybe the simple hardcover edition is a better value even for the serious collector.

0316017922|4.0|Falling into the category of books that I like to call \\"Why things are/happen,\\" Malcolm Gladwell lays out in Outliers a set of stories and studies about success, and it's antithesis failure, with a quick pace and interesting thesis--success is not necessarily the bastion of the smart or wealthy, but a combination of genius, culture, and timing.<br /><br />Although I had initially thought Outliers would be a \\"how you too can get rich and be successful,\\" I soon realized that while conclusions and policies suggestions might be gleaned from the chapters and stories, the book was more interesting for its pure explanation of seemingly inexplicable events.<br /><br />For example: why are hockey players more likely to be born in January, February or March than September, October or November? Why are Asians better at math than Americans? How can knowing ones birth in New York predict ones profession?<br /><br />Serious. And interesting. I could not put it down, and I found my mind stimulated from the first page to the last, and still I keep finding my mind returning to the ideas and possibilities it presents.
0312360266|1.0|Seriously, this book SUCKS!  It was hard to read because I felt I was getting dumber with each turn of the page.  The overall story of the book could have been great if only it were well written.  The whole concept of a vampire finishing school and two separate worlds within a society can definitely make for a good book.      My two largest issues are 1. the writing and supposed \\"talking like a teen\\" (honestly, I don't know any girls who talk like that other than the steriotypical Hollywood blonde Barbie cheerleaders in every really bad high school flick) 2. God forbid (literally), if you are a Christian or have any faith in God.  It makes Christian or \\"people of faith\\" out to be horrible villians that are only concerned with being judgemental and in a way \\"evil\\", while also making fun of sacred Christian ritual.  It definitely seems that the authors have some personal issues with God or at least some \\"people of faith\\" in their lives.    I guess to sum it up on the whole, I feel this book could have been great, but unfortunately misses the mark so completely as to only get one star.  This is coming from someone who always gives at least two stars for effort.  Yeah, it is really that bad.

B001O7JHVG|5.0|Why not release movies that aren't necessarly classics on Blu-Ray? Is Blu-Ray only for great movies? I don't think so, studios decide what will be released and there's certainly a reason why they decided to release Tango & Cash. OK it's not great but I believe it's a pretty good movie, lots of action, funny jokes along the way, very good story and good pacing all along. It's entertaining which is the goal of every movie.  Besides, the DVD version was in widescreen but wasn't anamorphic (means that even if you have a 16:9 TV it didn't adjust to the size of it. So the Blu-Ray version will correct that big flaw.    So Tango & Cash on Blu-Ray, I'm a buyer!

0307269752|3.0|The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo has good ideas for a story.  It's based on two situational questions; To what extent would a failed investigative writer go to obtain his redemption? - And - What would a sub-culture detective do with an intriguing case about a man who may have set up to fail by an corrupt industrialist?<br /><br />Sounds good, right?  I thought so too!<br /><br />As I said, the set up is great and it is. At the start of the novel we find Mikael Blomkvist at the worst time in his life, he's been sued for writing an incorrect story about a wealthy industrialist.  In the meantime, a security company (with a investigations department) has been hired to prove that Blomkvist has been set up, enter Lisbeth Salander, the girl who by eponym is the title of the book.  I won't give up what happens, but suffice to say that she (Lisbeth) is not a typical P.I.  She's different and so is this book.<br /><br />Let's start with characters.  Larsson does a terrific job in creating characters.  Lisbeth Salander is by far the most memorable P.I. I've read in a long time.  She's real because her tragic circumstances make her larger than life.  Blomkvist and the rest of the cast are also well crafted.<br /><br />So character and premise make for a promising story and I wish I could say that the rest of the writing were just as promising, but it's not.  The book is filled with lots of telling in narrative, which would have played out beautifully in scenes to show what happened.  Then there's also the use of passive verb sentences and adverbs.  In writing, adverbs are like pimples on a beauty queen - the two don't belong together.  Larsson uses them far too much.<br /><br />He also intrudes into the story in an effort to make connections from previous chapters into the one you may be reading at the time.  The omniscient author - as it's called - should stay out of the story for the sake of the story.  An example of this is in pages 52 and 53 when Larsson, in a chapter about Blomkvist, intrudes to remind the reader that \\"... Just as Salander had guessed, it was his continual infidelity that drove his wife to leave.\\"  At this point and on page 53 we know that Blomkvist and Salander have not met, they have no clue that the other exists, but Larsson knew.<br /><br />Does this review sound pedantic to you?  Well, I'll be the first to admit it is because the techniques Larsson employed quite liberally in this book - many modern authors do - damage this novel.  Why?  First, there is no substitute for good writing, even in commercial fiction.  Second, the techniques are short cuts used often by first time writers and here's where this review takes another turn for the better.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson was a first time (fiction) writer when he submitted this novel and it's sequels for publication.  He may may have been short on experience with using language (and grammar) in fiction because it's visible in The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo.  Perhaps, his use of language gets better in the next two novels and/or a lot may have been lost in translation from the original Swedish version. That's why I give this novel the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Now, honestly there are lots of novelists - American and European - that write a lot worse than Stieg Larsson.  There in is the state of the publishing world today; it is lamentable that publishing houses spend next to nothing on proper editing.  So blame the publisher as opposed to Stieg Larsson for the flaws in this novel, may he rest in peace.<br /><br />Hence, I strongly suggest that readers should set their sights low with this book.  Expect next to nothing and you may find a gem inside.  Enjoy and remember that writers are only as good as their editors.er that \\"...

From the first time I saw him in the \\"Looks That Kill\\" video, I was hooked. I was in my teens and had to find out everything that I could about him. I always found something in his lyrics to relate to. Growing up, not fitting in, knowing there was more out there for me in life than what was right infront of my face. So of course when the book came out, I bought it right away, and didn't put it down until I finished it. Wow, is my face red. My hero? Yeah theres a touch of sorrow for me, as I had to take him down from the petistol that I put him on. I mean we all heard about the drugs, but never did we knew how bad it really was. For those that were around him, the pain must of been unbarable to watch someone you love killing themself. For those who tried to help him, \\"Thank You\\". For those for gained from this \\"F... You\\". This was an unbeliveable story. From begining to end. I belive there is soo much good that will come out of this book. For those with additions and those living with people with additions, you really should read this book, or at least get the Sixx AM cd. It gave me an insight on the mind of an addict, one trait that I didn't have in common with Nikki. But with this new insight it brings me a new found love & admiration for him. I now have dusted off my image off Nikki and put him right back up there on that pedistol. This truly is a behind closed doors look at what addiction is all about. I highly recommend it!

0142000663|4.0|This is an excellent book to have read. Steinbeck's style makes it feel natural to read though this large book that initially scares off many readers. While many people shy away from the classics, they are part of our common culture. Reading The Grapes of Wrath will help you understand your culture at a deeper level.
1844137864|4.0|This is a GREAT coffee table book.  Lots of great photos of his works presented well with great comments and anecdotes scattered throughout.  Covers his work on public places (such as bridges, statues, landmarks) to his bold methods of putting his art up in plain view in public and in some pretty well known art museums.  His art has great, thought provoking messages so it's so hard to not like this type of expression.  It can run from hilarious to almost scary.  I am going to take away a star because I find that while I like his art and his audacity to place it on an uncommon canvas and keeps it relevant to the everyday public, I find his messages tend to jump on the band wagon.  He protests the war, corruption of the justice system, the greed and ambivalence of big business, etc.  Not new territory to tread.  While it brings these issues back into the minds of the reader or viewer, the messages aren't anything nouveau.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I began the 30 Day Shred on January 5th and decided that after one month, I would come back here and review it. Well, here is my 30-day review. I am 5'1\\" and weighed 129 when I began this video. I now weigh 119. Yes, I have lost 10lbs (half of what the video 'suggests' you will lose). I do this work out 6 days a week. I don't know how heavy the weights being used in the DVD are, but I use 5 lb weights.    As everyone has already said, even Level 1 is pretty tough (I'm currently working on conquering Level 2). My only complaint about this video is Jillian herself. She talks WAY too much during the workouts, often repeating herself or stopping to make fun of Natalie (but never Anita, for some reason). I've timed some of the 'circuits' and they are not all as long as she claims. For example, the first set of push ups she tells you to do actually last about 45 seconds when she says she wants you to do 30 seconds of push ups. I suppose that could only help you become stronger, but it seems like she's talking so much that the time escapes her mind. I also don't like her remarks about going \\"jean shopping\\" to motivate you. Not all of us want to go \\"jean shopping,\\" and after hearing it almost every day for 30 days, I hear myself trying to mutter \\"shut up!\\" in between breaths. I have started working out with this video with the volume turned down. It also bothers me that she doesn't do all of the workouts completely, because she's standing there talking. I understand that she needs to multitask because it's only 20 minutes, so she has to show you tips and what not to do while you're working out. Still, it almost seems like the other girls are more fit than she is.     Nonetheless, I have rated this 5 stars because it has helped me lose weight, and Jillian's annoying personality isn't enough to keep me from doing the work out everyday.

0385340990|5.0|Did the reviewer at Reed actually READ this book?  Contrived?  Disjointed?  I should say not.  It is a absolutely beautiful book - made even more compelling in audio format - that will stick with you long after the last words are read.<br /><br />A must-read.
B000P12LWY|4.0|Very entertaining.  As noted by other reviewers, the historical inaccuracies are disconcerting (combining Mary and Margaret into one person was rather inexplicable).  I also don't understand the title \\"The Tudors.\\"  The series starts with Henry VIII - ignoring his father's rise, a fascinating store on its own.    Now I'm well into the second season and Henry is still not fat.  Also has designer hair.  How can this be?    Still, it's fun - a great way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon.
159668139X|5.0|A welcoming and thorough introduction to handweaving, Deborah Chandler's \\"Learning to Weave\\" has, for good reason, become a favorite \\"textbook\\".  Her writing style is not only patiently detailed for those who are beginners, but also consistently reassuring; she easily establishes a rapport with her readers.  Chandler goes beyond the basics of handweaving in this well illustrated book, making \\"Learning to Weave\\" valuable as an ongoing reference tool with numerous examples of weaving styles and techniques that one may not have explored.  A year ago, as a novice handweaver, I participated in a weaving workshop for which \\"Learning to Weave\\" was recommended as a reference.  It was great advice.  With Deborah Chandler's book it continues to be easy to move along with confidence as a handweaver creating satisfying projects while also developing my skills.  Thank you, Deborah!
B001676320|5.0|Bought it more for Chicago than EWF but the video quality and mastering of this video is excellent, so is the audio.
B001MYIXAW|3.0|video and original sound quality are good, what you would expect from a standard bluray. but, there are some things i didnt like. the english voice overs are terrible, worse than what you'd expect from typical voice overs -- although, theyre fun to listen to with other people if you like to laugh at that kinda stuff. voices sound silly, and they sound like they were just slapped over the ambient sounds, dont go together very well.    also, if played on a ps3, for some reason directional pad and x do not work for playback options. you must rewind/fast forward with l2 and r2, and you must play with start button. this is the first time ive seen this on a bluray, usually you can just use left n right on the dpad, and you can just press x to play. not with this bluray.    extras were kinda lame. i mainly bought the bluray for the extras, as i wanted more backround on the characters and stuff.    the deleted scenes are only four short clips that dont really add much value. one shows oskar tapping elis back and singing a song, another shows that lady vampire (one eli bit) vomiting, another shows oskar playing rough with eli and making vampire sounds, i suppose, just playing (that was probably the best deleted scene, but i can see why it was taken out), and then another one shows a bully scene where that kid at school makes him make pig sounds and then you see oskars pee ball, but theres no explanation so if you havent read the book you wont know what it is anyway.    behind the scenes is like 7 mins long, poor video quality, and they basically just show you some of the filming in progress, how they did the pool scene, the movie maker explaining the environment in the film. it was alright...    then you have, movie posters. swedens was better than ours.    then you have some photos of the cast. most of them are of the kid who played oskar. i think theres like one or two shots where eli is in the photo.    the bluray itself... probably one of the most disappointing blurays ive purchased. the movies good, though. love the movie.

B000YAA68C|5.0|I never thought that I would say this, but `P.S. I Love You' is one of those movies that changed the way I viewed an actress, for the better.  Don't get me wrong; when Hilary Swank is on point she is ON POINT.  Just watch her stunning work in `Boys Don't Cry' or `Million Dollar Baby', both films garnered her Oscars.  The thing is, when you strip away the strength of the script or the power of the genre you have a substantial loss of talent.  Her performances in films like `Freedom Writers' or `The Core' and even `Insomnia' prove that she is not always `on point'.  That said, I was a little worried about how she'd fare with a romantic comedy (dramedy really).  I really thought she'd blow this one.<br /><br />She nailed it.<br /><br />I sat down to watch this movie with my wife because we are both fans of Gerard Butler (not because he's especially talented but more or less because he's nice to look at and or listen to) and we both adore the comedic talents of Lisa Kudrow.  We didn't expect too much, but what we got was a very nicely crafted tale of true love and the tragedy that is grief.<br /><br />Holly and Gerry are a feisty married couple who obviously adore one another despite their differences.  This is seen in the opening scene (which lasts for like ten minutes) where they fight and then make up in a rather realistic manner.  That was my initial thought going into the movie; that it seemed real, and I wasn't expecting that at all.  Next we learn that due to a bran tumor Gerry has passed on.  Holly has a very hard time dealing with this, obviously, but she has friends and relatives intent of helping her through it.  It appears though, that the only one who can save her is Gerry, who comes back into her life through a series of letters he'd written and arranged to have delivered to her over the course of the next year.  With the help of these letters Holly learns to let go and find herself again, find that naïve teenager Gerry first met and fell in love with; the girl with dreams and ambitions and a bright future.<br /><br />Be forewarned, `P.S. I Love You' will most likely make you cry; or at least come very close.<br /><br />The acting is very well done across the board.  Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon are both wonderful as Holly's closest friends.  I only wish that they had a little more screen time.  Kathy Bates is always wonderful, and her portrayal of Holly's protective mother is very genuine and moving.  I am not a huge fan of Harry Connick Jr., but he manages to be entertaining here.  I feel that his character was a little insensitive and rather unlikable at times, but it was what they were going for and he nailed it.<br /><br />The stars of the show here are Swank and Butler who just ooze forth with chemistry that I didn't see coming.  We all know that Gerard Butler is a major dreamboat complete with a nice physic, an accent and loads of charm; but who would have thought that he was such a compelling actor?  He really nails his character inside and out and makes Gerry one of the most appealing men on screen.  I'm sure most any woman would love to have a husband like Gerry.  Swank blew me away with her mastery of her characters emotional fluctuations.  Holly is feisty one minute, giddy the next, defensive the next, heartbroken the next.  She's inspired and confused and aggravated and filled with adoration and she nails every shift, every feeling.  She gets every part of this woman right and delivers to us a complete and whole character, a person we can love and feel for.<br /><br />Another thing I really appreciated about the film is that, as much as it is warm and sentimental, it never shies away from the harsh realities of grief.  Even the way that some of her friends deal with Holly, the way her mother almost resents her grieving at times, the way that Daniel can't seem to get passed the fact that there was a Gerry; the way that Denise and Sharon want to move on with their lives regardless of how that hurts Holly.It makes for a much more realistic venture into the life of someone who has lost a loved one.<br /><br />The world keeps on moving and eventually you have to catch up.<br /><br />In the end I highly recommend this movie.  It is a truly above average film that understands how to make a romantic comedy that has the right amounts of dramatic tension and realism to make it more than just another genre film.  As far as these types of films go, this is truly one of the best.  This is a film that could easily get passed over by those who consider it just another one of many, but it rises to the challenge and becomes something much better than expected.life of someone who has lost a loved one.

1582701709|1.0|As I read The Secret, I couldn't believe that the professional who recommended it to me embraces the nonsense this book spews out. Turns out, she doesn't - I ordered the wrong book. I read the first four or five chapters, and was stunned that anyone could seriously entertain most of what the authors wrote. They do touch on some long-held beliefs shared by people throughout the ages, but they have an ability to turn such nuggets of truth into a life view that embraces the pursuit of wealth and fame. And you can have it, too - just follow the law of attraction! After reading the biographies of the various contributors, it is obvious that the book is a painfully thin-veiled advertisement for the  workshops, books, and programs they are hawking. I'm very surprised well-known, otherwise fairly wise people didn't see that coming from the start.

B001KMB6VE|3.0|Although my wife and I usually love most of Vin Diesel's work, especially the SciFi, this was a disappointment to both of us. The story is to familiar, the acting decent, and the effects good, but this just didn't stick out in a crowd of Apocalyptic movies. This seemed very much like \\"Children of Men\\" in story. A top mercenary is hired to excort a young pregnant female to safety. Take away the cloning and there is very little difference. I suggest this one as a rental. Decent quality DVD with very little replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Resident Evil: Extinction\\".<br /><br />CA Luster

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I would like to say that I have read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\".  This movie TOTALLY LACKED the details and fullness of the book.  I expected much more from this movie.  The costumes and the cinematography were beautiful.  But the story line left me wanting.<br /><br />It was like reading the cliff notes for Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" - Married woman in Russia falls in love with soldier, runs away, gets hit by train.  The movie didn't have any of the details of the rise of Anne Boleyn, the persuasion and manipulation of Henry or the problems that she caused with the country.  The main thread throughout the movie was sex.  I do understand that power was bought and traded with sex.  But it only seems that this movie was made in order to show Portman and Johansson half naked or more.<br /><br />This movie was a total disappointment.  Understand that a movie based on a book will never be as good as the book.  I do think though that a reader should expect more.  I wish that I could have given this movie less than a star rating.  I wouldn't recommend this movie version.  I do recommend either the BBC or HBO (The Tudors) versions.  They do the characters and the historical drama more justice.
B00007KLJJ|2.0|Wonderful cinematography, costumes, settings and locations but a poor and senseless plot.The battlefield \\"tactics\\" are absurd, if there was one thing that the British knew how to execute, it was the square. The same tactics had been in use by them for 200+ years.(and used artillery to break up cavalry). Long and boring (interminable ) scenes interspersed. Good talent wasted on an awful plot.
B000001FFJ|5.0|A masterpiece. Tom Waits recording career can be divided into two sections (so far). The second begins with Swordfishtrombones, an experimental alblum using unusal percussion instruments. While I like much of it, Waits is obviously experimenting with new sounds and approaches.    In Rain Dogs it all comes together. Great lyrics, a great sound, a unique voice.

B000002UAR|5.0|On there seventh studio release, the Beatles turn out one of their most unique and well know albums.  Revolver is anything but Rubber Soul part II.  The Folk-rock type pop of the previous release is mostly gone in favor of a much more eclectic mix of pop, hard rock, experimental, and some of the first psychedelic rock.  This is just one of several reasons why Revolver has such a high status in rock music.  Another reason is that Revolver was one of the first albums to be thought of as an art work in its own right.  More than just a collection of singles, each song on the record acts as an essential building block to the overall masterpiece.  The Beach Boys also pioneered this kind of album with there Pet Sounds record.  But were as Pet Sounds mostly relied on well crafted pop, Revolver broke down barriers for what a rock album could be.    Perhaps more than any other Beatles album, there is a little of something for everybody here.  Such variety would normally hurt an album's unity.  Hard rocker such as \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" and \\"Taxman\\" (the latter written by George Harrison) should seem out of place next to the light pop of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" but somehow they all work together nicely.  John Lennon and Paul McCartney are beginning to split as far as there songwriting goes.  John comes up with darker tunes such as \\"Doctor Robert\\" (about a doctor who prescribes uppers and downers to celebrities) and \\"She Said She Said\\" which is also about drug use.  Paul McCartney is lighter and more whimsical with songs like \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" (the latter is again about drug use).      So I guess its possible that alot of the innovation here was fuelded by the group's psychedelic drug addiction, but I am sure alot of it was based on their amazing imagination as well.  Psychedelic rock may just be the result of too much LSD but it is still one of the most eclectic and imaginative rock sub-genres ever.  Revolver is a perfect example of that innovation.  The dark moments of Revolver (Tomorrow Never Knows for example) show that Hallucagenic drugs could be frighting and even lunacy inducing.      The fact that Revolver is the beginning of an important stage in rock's development (the psychedelic era) just shows how important the album itself is.  In way, this album pointed the way towards not just psychedelic but art rock, experimental, and even alternative and punk.  The Ramones for example were influenced heavenly by Beatles.  No serious rock collection should be without this album.  Sure its influential but it wouldn't mean much if the album was un-exciting.  And this album is definitely a very exciting listen.
B000ECX0QU|4.0|After the cold war in East Germany in \\"Torn Curtain\\", Hitchcock had to deal with the big bad wolf, the USSR. And he did in this film, though it concerns more Washington and France, but only a little bit Cuba and practically not at all the USSR, directly at least since the bad guy is the USSR. We are in October 1962. A top KGB official defects to the USA and reveals a few things, but little, about Cuba. He confirms at least something is happening in Cuba. Hitchcock finds it funny to insist on the incompetence and impotence of the Americans, and particularly the CIA. That's the first remark from the KGB fleeing official. But it is shown in length. They are obliged to go through a French secret agent in Washington to get the information they want, including the pictures of his mission to Cuba for surveillance of the Russian deliveries. And it is funny how the French commercial attach&eacute; of the French embassy is going to use his connection with another French agent from the French West Indies to approach the necessary person in the Cuban delegation to the United Nations General Assembly to get a copy of the agreement between the USSR and Cuba. And he will then go to Cuba himself to get the hard photographic data he needs. What is surprising is not the fact that some French secret service people helped the USA at a time when they could not get what they wanted, in 1962 when the world was on the brink of a nuclear war. What is funny is that this film comes four years after the decision by General de Gaulle to kick NATO out of France, and one year after the famous 1968 events and in fact the year when General de Gaulle resigned from power in the spring of 1969. The film was made in 1969. The film was released in the USA only on December 19, 1969 and mostly in 1970 for Europe. It shows how without the French the missile crisis in Cuba would not have been solved by John F. Kennedy, a recollection that goes against the strong campaign against General de Gaulle and France in 1969 due to the strong opposition General de Gaulle took against the Vietnam war in 1967 and 1968, including his famous speech in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, shortly before Nixon sent US troops into that country. But the film has another interest in the title and what it means: a spying ring directly in the French government at top level of specialists and technical executives, just under ministerial positions. That ring called Topaz was spying in the French government and NATO for the USSR. The film shows how the poor commercial attach&eacute; is mixed in the doings of that ring without knowing at first and then knowing and trying to expose the ring and the men, but expose them within the very power structure of France, which is the way things are done in France: keep everything within the family circle and let's wash our dirty laundry in private. They even let the top rung of that ring leave for the Soviet Union when the whole business is finished and the commercial attach&eacute; is sent back to Washington from where he had been called back. There Hitchcock is becoming in a way funny, scary too, but definitely funny. The French and their little love affairs, and their little private luncheons and dinners, the French and their republican aristocratic dealings and etiquette, and of curse their cute eighteenth and nineteenth century houses and mansions in Paris, these places you hardly see behind their majestic facades. And Hitchcock even uses well-known French actors from the 1968-1969 period and makes them speak English with a very elaborate English French accent, far away from the French accent we all associate with camembert, red wine and bread baguette, but that has all to do with fluent English spoken by bilingual French individuals. Maurice Chevalier's out. It's that humor that is funny, both strange and ah ah. But with time I am afraid it has aged and is more nostalgic, for those who can remember, than really active today. Though Cuba is still there and stillstanding in its revolutionary shoes, though pretty worn out and being renovated as fast as possible, in these days when all the ex-Maoist and ex-Soviet guerrilla or open warfare movements like the Tamil Tigers, the FARCs and the Nepali Maoists are moving out of the violent terrorist picture and eventually back into the political and economic vaster democratic picture, and Russia is definitely still trying to put the Soviet boots back on and rebuild their past glory and power. The great change is that China is the potential first economic power in the world and that they have decided to associate quite a few people with them in that new role. We might finally reach a real multi-polar world twenty years after the fall of the Iron Curtain and of the dual-divide across the big global cake.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesvolutionary shoes, though pretty worn out and being renovated as fast as possible, in these days when all the ex-Maoist and ex-Soviet guerrilla or open warfare movements like the Tamil Tigers, the FARCs and the Nepali Maoists are moving out of the violent terrorist picture and eventually back into the political and economic vaster democratic picture, and Russia is definitely still trying to put the Soviet boots back on and rebuild their past glory and power.

0440241413|1.0|I picked up this book for a recent plane ride because it looked cute and is a bestseller. That said, I don't think I even have the right words to express how much I hated it (and yes, I finished it, though I don't know why exactly -- bordedom, I guess).    Kinsella is an adequate writer, no doubt. But Becky has got to be one of the dumbest, most annoying, positively IRRITATING \\"heroines\\" I've ever had the displeasure of reading about. Why is this a bestseller? Why is she so beloved? Why is this book funny? I just don't. Get. It. I don't get what's cute about a lying moron who can't get her s--t together. I don't get what's cute about a compulsive spender who can't control herself and is extremely selfish to boot. I don't get what's that interesting about well, shopping. Doesn't she have any other hobbies? If Becky were someone I knew in real life, she'd be the sorry person whom we all laughed at behind her back. I'm outraged that this flightly little twit is considered a literary hero when all I wanted to do was reach into the pages and shake her until her tissue paper for brains fell out. Blech.

B00008EY65|5.0|This 2 Disc Special Edition is great. In addition to the great movie, the special features are incredible. There are even some hidden easter eggs for those who want to look for them
B0017CW5J4|4.0|A very cool and clever idea for a concert.  These guys deliver.  A definite keeper for the collection.  Sound and video presentation is very, very good.
B000784WMW|4.0|First saw this movie on PBS some years ago.  It is a good adaptation of the book.
055358894X|3.0|Lynch creates a wonderful world, almost tactile in its descriptions.  And there are some clever side characters.  But I never grew to know, or care about, the main characters.  I didn't cheer for them, didn't worry about them, and so this book ultimately disappointed me.  Pretty phrasing, a very creative imagination, but it left me thinking that it could have been much more.
B001L5SXQG|1.0|Really? Bruce, is this the best you could do this time? This album is really very horrifying. It's bad. Very bad. Laugh-out-loud bad at times. The musical equivalent of a Twilight Zone episode starring Bill Shatner. it's as if Springsteen and Weird Al Yankovic got together and said: \\"Hey, let's make a parody album. We'll write a bunch of horribly bad songs using mock Beatles/Roy Orbison/Beach Boys/CCR/Slim Whitman arrangements!\\"  Not that there's anything wrong with those artists - they were giants (yes, even Slim Whitman). But it would have been far better if Bruce had covered an actual Roy Orbison song or Beach Boys song, etc., rather than try to roll his own.     It's exasperating. This album relentlessly evokes a \\"What the f@#!?\\" reaction on every single track. I just can't fathom the decision making process that allows songs like \\"Outlaw Pete\\" and \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" to actually make it through the entire lengthy and very expensive production cycle. And exactly WHO had the brilliant idea to include the sound of a supermarket bar code scanner in the mix on \\"Queen\\"? I'm sorry, but that's pure cheese.     \\"Working on a Dream\\" is just wrong from one end to the other. Do yourself a favor: if you feel the need to buy a Springsteen album, find any previous album you may have missed - or even a second copy of one you already own - and buy it instead. You'll be glad you did.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I just had a baby and really need to get in shape.  This is perfect because I am totally 100% out of shape and really needed something that isn't ridiculously hard, but was still a challenge.  This is it.  I'm still on level 1, and when I'm ready I'll go to level 2 when I need a little more.  Plus, it's only 20 min/day.  It's hard with a infant to get away from the house or spend an hour working out.
0810995212|4.0|Despite the authors' shortcomings, and it appears that the other reviewers' complaints are justified, this is a visually enchanting book for all interested in the history of men's fashion illustration, as well as many other iconic images of the twentieth century American traditions.  Leyendecker's covers for magazines such as THE SATURDAY EVENING POST helped establish the visuals for American holidays and sports that are still valued today.  This reviewer's copy was received as a gift, and a most welcome one that anyone interested in graphic arts would appreciate.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller works great and feels much better than the old sixaxis.  not to say that the sixaxis is bad, but this controller just feels more solid than the sixaxis.  The battery does die a little quicker on the dualshock than it does on the sixaxis but that is to be expected when adding in the rumble feature.  Overall its just a great controller and for $40 it really can't get much better.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best fitness dvd I've ever had the pleasure of owning.  I was so excited to get it in the mail and as soon as it came I popped it into my dvd player.      Jillian is remarkably motivating and always pushing you to do your best no matter how many times you watch the dvd.  She never gets \\"old\\" or \\"annoying.\\"  With each new level she kicks your butt even harder.  I really thought I was in good shape until I started Level 1.  I'm on Level 3 now and I'm sore as ever.  I've been using this dvd for about a month and I've lost 10 pounds!  Just make sure you watch your diet too.    If you buy this dvd you will not be let down!!
B001EOQWF8|5.0|This is more a review of Amazon's service than movie.The movie is great!1st disk i received had a damaged keep case so i called and was told a replacement new blue-ray would be sent out and to not bother sending damaged copy back.New copy was delievered next day !!!Amazon is the best and only place i will ever buy movies!!!!!!
B0011NVC98|4.0|I'm not going to speak to the complaints over the movie's technical merits/failings, since it's a stylistic choice whose success or failure can be endlessly debated. If everyone liked everything, nothing would be worth doing.<br /><br />What I do note is the continual objection that the movie does violence to 'the real story of Beowulf.'<br /><br />I think this is grounded in a fundamental misconception, since the story we read in English Lit is no more 'the real story of Beowulf' than this movie - our taught version is a retelling by a Christian, centuries after the tale was first told, who is casting more than a glare askance at it. Whatever the bards sang of 'Beowulf', we can feel certain that it was at the very least quite different from the version our Christian monk preserved.<br /><br />That's rather the point. Different generations retell and retailor stories to fit their age. A Christian monk retold 'Beowulf' because he disapproved of several aspects of it. This movie is simply another retelling. What will make it 'true' or not is whether it affects how people see and tell the story of 'Beowulf'. If its detractors are right that the movie does such fundamental violence to 'Beowulf' and so ought never to have been made, then this version will pass away. The important stories all tend to find their way back to their true tellings.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is a fantastic CD with lyrics that sound eerily relevant today. Sixto is an engaging artist. Very enjoyable.

B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This is now my Favorite Musical.  I've seen the stage play (excellent also) and I saw the movie in the theater.  Now that I have the DVD, I'm looking forward to watching it many times.  It threads around a cute romantic comedy, and how do you best ABBA's music?  The songs, for the most part, are sung by people who do not sing professionally which makes it even more believable.  The scenery is to glory in, a breath of fresh air!  Adding to all that is Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan and others that make this DVD - WOW!
B0001ZX0OM|5.0|had to keep your mind onto the movie or it didn't make too much sense
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This is an interesting film which maintains a fine dark gothic feel, blended with elements of the modern thrown in for good measure as well. They could have just called it \\"Vampires vs Werewolfs\\", because essentially this just takes the idea from Aliens vs Predators and transposes it for use with two of the best known gothic horror icons.<br /><br />Where it lets itself down is the lack of character development. Yes it has plenty of action. You certainly won't be dissapointed on that front. After a while though you know when you see a lot of people walking purposefully, that they are going to end up in one hell of a fight with or without guns and it happens over and over. In the end I really didn't what happened to any of the characters...<br /><br />One clear influence is The Matrix. The start of the film is almost a direct copy of a famous scene from that film. Many of the characters walk around in long black leather coats which is also a Matrix influence. That said this does have a considerable amount of style and I will be quite happy to watch this again.
B001KL3GY0|5.0|Another amazing album from an amazing band.<br />This is a solid album.  There are 3 standouts on this album though, \\"Ulysses\\", \\"You Girls Never Know\\" and \\"Lucid Dreams\\".  Lucid Dreams melted my face off. I can't help but compare them to the Beatles after listening to this album.
0545128285|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book. I was expecting something other than what I got. It appears that most are caught up in the Harry Potter mystique and the JKR worship and cannot evaluate this book on its own merits. I am an avid Harry Potter fan and own all the books and movies but did not find this book entertaining.The stories are inapproriate for young children and the book should have a PG-13 or TV14 rating. I was glad I borrowed it from the library and returned it after reading 70 pages.

0446614459|2.0|Starts of well, but then peaks around the middle, its almost as if Baldacci started with a brilliant story but couldn't figure a brilliant way to end it. Hence we have the ridiculous plot and totally childish and incredulous ending...Skip.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I gave up on Metallica when Load was released and St. Anger was possibly the worst production ever ( goodbye Bob Rock ). Then I purchased Death Magnetic. When I played the CD I was blown away. Death Magnetic is not only their best release since the 80's but maybe their best ever!!! You will understand why it took a few years to record. Thank God Metallica chose Rick Rubin to produce. I now have faith in Metallic again. From start to finish Death Magnetic is a  ride you never want to end.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|Absolutely love this CD, especially the often played \\"Mercy\\".  Makes me want to dance whenever I hear the beginning of that song.  What a great, unique voice she has.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love this BBC series!!!  I am a fan of English historical movies and this has become one of my favorites.  The photography, costumes and scene work of this movie are breathtaking.  The range of emotions portrayed by the characters is a tribute to their skill in the craft of acting.  The time period of this movie creates a wonderful clash between the need to modernize versus the beauty of simple, rural English life.     The subtile romance between the two lead characters that develops throughout the movie is acted to perfection and very romantic.  In the movie, she transforms him from an ill tempered man/boy into a more compassionate man and he transforms her into more of realist but yet does not break her spirit.  As is typical with English romance, they both battle their pride and love until they are finally completed by each other.    If you like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Kiera Knightly(sp) or \\"Emma\\" Gweneth Paltrow, you will love this mini-series.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These have worked great for a cardio workout.  The sound quality is good, and loud - which is important to me since I am using it for biking.  They are very comfortable, and unlike ear buds, they don't fall out.   We have 2 pairs of these and both of us love them.  The price is great too!
0307454894|4.0|Just a short comment.  Of course it is inappropriate (and in most countries illegal) for a 36-year old and a 15-year old to have a sexual affair, but that is so beside the point of this book.  Others have rightly pointed out the moral dilemmas of those involved, and they had nothing to do with sex. Rather, they have to do with having the moral integrity to sacrifice oneself for a larger good, an act somehow beyond the scope of either Hanna's or Michael's character. But who of us has not gone along with the crowd?  Have we not all failed at times to buck a tide of prejudice or political correctness? There is a fine line to walk between recognition of human frailties and condemnation of despicable acts.    The undercurrent in this book is sex, a sex that for Michael grew into an all-consuming passion, one that formed him and haunted him the rest of his life. And no one should underestimate the capacity of a 15-year old to be passionately, deeply, if unwisely--in love.    I read this book several years ago in my book club, never imagining that it would some day be a film.  (And I just learned today that it was an Oprah's Book Club choice!) Haven't seen the movie, but I do recommend the book. Read it thoughtfully.  It's not just about Hanna and Michael, nor about Nazis and the holocaust. It is about all of us, and our integrity or lack of it.
B001O03NCW|5.0|For people who like folk music, this is a great CD. True, it is a movie soundtrack, and true, there is a little bit of content that makes it sound like a movie soundtrack, but the remainder is pure roots music. Some are original recordings mined from the past when rural radio was king (and remastered for our contemporary ears) and some were recorded specifically for this CD, but they are all really great songs. Give it a listen if you're on the fence; you will know immediately if it speaks to you.
1400086035|5.0|Another \\"how does he do it\\" in Christmas Carol.  Brings the story to life as no other presentation.
B001RLJ26Y|5.0|I find this series to be superb.  It is believable, brilliantly conceived, and addictive.  I happened to find it just looking at the shows and series available.  I hope Abrams and his development team continue this venue, and give all who watch as many intense moments as they have created for the first season.
B00005QB42|5.0|Great CD.  My yoga teacher uses it in our stretch yoga class.  Thanks for the fast service.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|I found the movie pretty good and entertaining. I just saw it a second time<br />and still found it good. but as the previous reviewer mentionned, there is<br />a little surprise in the movie and come out as Les Grossman.  There was<br />something different about this character...i just coul'dnt put my finger on it<br />till he started dancing in 2 places in the movie...these 2 parts ,,i dont know<br />how , but improved the movie with its music and moves....then i found out that<br />Les Grossman is played by the one and only John Travolta....Atta Go John...<br />good work and thank you Ben Stiller for keeping the dancing and not deleting it.<br />  A keeper
B000002H97|5.0|This is my personal favorite Metallica album, it's an awesome album with alot of classics like Enter Sandman and The Unforgiven and many others, the only differance from this album and the rest is that they went from speed metal to classic heavy metal, but this is still one of the greats, highly recommended.
0446310786|4.0|It served the purpose. The book had no writing, underlining or highlighting, which is what I was concerned about and is what the seller had promised. The only complaint, if you can call it a complaint, is that the book smelled musty and old.  My daughter complained about the smell everytime she had to pick the book up to read it.  Since I bought the book for a fraction of what a new one would have cost, I told her to deal with it.
0375836675|5.0|I had previously read \\"The Book Thief\\" by this same author, and loved it.   It was deeply moving and quite sad, but written in a wonderful style.     \\"Messenger\\" is written with the same style, but the plot doesn't have the same depth of sadness.       I thoroughly enjoyed the imaginative story line, the style, and the characters.    It's a fun, engaging, \\"feel good\\" book with a positive message for everyone, regardless of age.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Got this for my hubby's bday, and he loved it!  He's actually already seen it before but wanted to have a personal copy so he could watch it over and over.  I bought this same set for my Dad for Father's Day last year, and he was excited!  He's already gone through it twice!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|No he is not Frank or Bobby. But he is the best that we have now to redo some of the classics and his own songs, Home on this cd, are very good. Start with this cd and you will want more.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|Anybody with music in their blood will relate. Good little movie with<br />good music, good budget, good action and no anoying smart kids. Well<br />directed with originality. Watched it late at night, and i was able<br />to make it through....had to be good heh !
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Every once in a while, spending extra money on a blu-ray is worth it.  Take Serenity, for example, - top notch picture/top notch sound;  heads and shoulders above the standard definition dvd. As far as the movie goes it has sci-fi action, humor, adventure, and a story line that is intense and believable.  If only all blurays could look and sound as good!  Now, when does production of Serenity 2 begin?...
0316010669|5.0|I do not go to the bookstores anymore as Amazon has them beat in price and service.
B001D8W7CW|5.0|This is a fun horror movie that lots of people have since copied. Several actors received their first real exposure (pun intended) in this movie and Piper Laurie restarted her career. This film does have some fine grain in certain scenes but this was never a high dollar production and I'm doubtful that it is going to get much better.
B001LRJH0U|1.0|I usually enjoy the three main actors. Especially, Harris. But the story is bad, poorly presented and the direction is terrible. Harris needs to stick to acting. Westerns need to make a comeback but this one sets them back and would keep younger viewers from ever wanting to see another one. This is an insult to the classic westerns.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Stay away from these guys ,30 days and still have not received my order. They never answer email. I have filed clam with Amazon waiting for answer.ONCE AGAIN STAY AWAY DON'T ORDER FROM THEM.

B000FS9MV0|5.0|\\"Hold Me Now\\" is just an amazingly beautiful song - it has to be considered one of the best ever written and best ever performed
1433502399|5.0|I am extremely happy with my purchase.  The price through Amazon was excellent and the Bible itself is of high quality craftsmanship.  It contains an abundance of study notes and graphics.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a good study Bible.  I have also been using the Read Through the Bible In a Year from the back.  I like the layout of reading a section in four different books each day.  It has been a blessing!
B0000067L3|5.0|I have to let you know that I never been a big Eric Clapton fan. But even I have to acknowledge that he's simply one of the all-time great guitarists, even if a lot of what he's done isn't to my liking. For many, even Clapton-detractors, Cream is without a doubt the finest and most interesting band he ever played in. Each of the three musicians had experience before, so they were no strangers to music when they got together in 1966 and recorded and released their debut, Fresh Cream. That one was more pop-oriented, but the blues influence was still there, as there were covers of blues songs. Disraeli Gears is without a doubt the band's high point, which included several songs that became radio staples (\\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", \\"Strange Brew\\", etc.). The band moved to psychedelia which really served them well.    Now comes Wheels of Fire, which was a double album set, one studio, one live, so you get to see what this band was made of in both settings. Let's start with the studio set: many of the songs are Jack Bruce (and Pete Brown) and Ginger Baker (with Mike Taylor) originals, with a handful of covers of blues songs originally done by blues artists. We all heard \\"White Room\\" plenty of times, it's became very much an FM radio staple. It bears more than a striking resemblance to \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\", right down to Clapton's use of wah-wah, and similar scales. \\"Sittin' On Top of the World\\" is a cover of a blues song, by Howlin' Wolf. Even during Cream's psychedelic phase, they hadn't forgotten their blues roots. Clapton never made a secret that he was big on the blues, as that constantly showed up throughout his career, through the various bands and his solo career. Of course, some people felt the material on this album was uneven, certainly not the easiest stuff to get into, and some people felt they could live without the stuff Ginger Baker wrote. But these songs to my ears are quite good, even if a bit peculiar. One of them being \\"Passing the Time\\". Way back asa teenager (around 1989, I was not alive in the 1960s, I was born in 1972) I first heard that song and disliked it, I was put off by Ginger Baker's singing and the circus organ. But hearing this song many year later, it isn't that bad, and I really liked that intense jam that comes out of nowhere showing Jack Bruce's bass skills and Baker's drumming. The jam fads back into the more mellow state the song started. Felix Pappalardi provided some cello work as well. The Jack Bruce/Pete Brown \\"As You Said\\" might not to be everyone's liking, but I thought of it as a nice experimental psychedelic piece (the only thing missing here was sitar). Strange use of phasing, I get reminded a little of the Beatles' \\"I am the Walrus\\", but it didn't quite have the big hooks that made the Beatles song so popular and such a big hit. Baker and Taylor's \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" is an interesting piece where Baker narrates about two characters forced to close a shop because they were selling \\"atonal apples and amplified heat\\" with \\"Pressed Rat's collection of dog legs and feet\\". \\"Politician\\" might be familiar to many of you FM radio listeners, this one another one of those blues songs, but this time a Baker/Brown composition, rather than a cover of an old blues song. Baker/Taylor's \\"Those Were the Days\\" sounds very much like a traditional psychedelic Cream song, this time Jack Bruce doing vocals, so it sounds like Cream as you expect. This is probably one of the greatest songs Cream did that you don't hear on the radio. Next is a cover of Albert King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\", another familiar blues song that everyone has heard on classic FM radio. \\"Anyone For Tennis\\" is sadly not on the original LP (it should have been), Clapton takes on vocals here. I really dig the use of recorder and percussion. The song originally came out as a single (its flip side being \\"Press Rat and Warthog\\"). So it's nice to see it included on the CD reissue as I really think it deserved to be on the original album. The second disc is certain to polarize many a listener. It's mainly a solo showcase for Clapton, Bruce, and Baker. You keep hearing about those live Cream improvisations. You get your chance here! You either find them mindblowing or boring. Remember that many people think the same with the Grateful Dead and their live improvisations, even if what they did was very different. First is Robert Johnson's \\"Crossroads\\". We all know this one, another radio staple. It has full band interaction. Then comes a cover of Willie Dixon's \\"Spoonful\\". If you're familiar with the studio version off Fresh Cream, you'll notice this one is considerably longer with an extended Clapton guitar solo. Bruce's \\"Traintime\\" is largely a harmonica solo (I wondered if this inspired the Blues Travelers? Of course Bruce's harmonica playing and sound was different from John Popper's). \\"Toad\\", Baker's time to show, was originally off Fresh Cream, this time the drum solo was way extended. This is where it would scare the more casual listeners off for good. But he has such a creative and imaginative approach to drumming that I wanted to listen to this drum solo. That drum solo certainly inspired the likes of Led Zeppelin, and Jethro Tull (\\"Dharma For One\\"). The studio original, I'm certain, inspired Iron Butterfly's \\"In-a-Gadda-da-Vida\\" (they also happened to share the same label: Atco).    I understand that there were versions of Wheels of Fire that had the studio and live versions sold separately, but most commonly is the double album set. Here in America, the album was originally released with a silvery cover. The cover artwork is by Martin Sharp, an Australian who also did the artwork to Disraeli Gears (no surprise, as the artwork is quite similar). But this one isn't color, but I really thought it looks better against a silvery background, as opposed to a gray background like many later prints.    It's strange that Wheels of Fire isn't exactly the most accessible album out there, and at the same time, it became one of the best-selling albums (along with Iron Butterfly's In-a-Gadda-da-Vida) in the Atlantic Records/Atco discography.    Cream also had a big impact on power trios to come in their wake. For example, the James Gang, their debut album, Yer' Album (1969) sounds to me like an American version of Cream. Check out Joe Walsh and his extended guitar improvisations, plus Tom Kriss' heavily fuzzed bass (he only appeared on that album) and similar bass playing. Mountain would not exist were it not for Cream, especially became Felix Pappalardi was a member of that group (and Leslie West's vocals often reminds me of Jack Bruce). I'd like to mention the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but they were Cream's contemporaries, and equally influential. Cream also influenced plenty of non-power trios too, including Jethro Tull, where the British press hailed them as \\"The next Cream\\". Mick Abrahams' guitar work was inspired by Clapton. Clive Bunker gave an extended drum solo with \\"Dharma For One\\". The more bluesy explorations were not unlike Cream's. And they also did a cover of \\"Cat's Squirrel\\" (of course we knew what happened to Tull afterwards: Abrahams left, Martin Barre came in, and Ian Anderson moved the band towards progressive rock, which certainly hardly hurt the band any).    Cream is one of those bands I should have reviewed their stuff ages ago. They are really one of the greats of rock, and while Wheels of Fire might be a bit much for the newbie (start with Disraeli Gears), it still comes highly recommended.
B000O77SRC|5.0|I was ten when this movie came out and I was taken to see it by my parents.  Since then I've probably watched it fifty, sixty, seventy times and it still delivers and still makes me smile.<br />On top of the happy memories I have associated with this movie there is also the place it holds within its genre.  It is probably the most influential action movie of all time.  Taking the motif of the lone warrior to the extreme, this movie's pitting of gruff loner John McClaine against charming villain Hans Gruber is a wonderfully overblown chess match that mixes action and humor, blood and gunpowder,  machismo and heart all together into a perfectly seasoned dish of pure entertainment.<br />This movie crated the mold that action movies have been trying to fill for decades now.
B0000V46KY|5.0|Invariably whenever I am listening to this CD and someone comes to visit they ask, \\"What's that you're listening to?\\" I have meant to buy/listen to this landmark recoprding for years. I was not disappointed when I finally came around.  Tranquil and contemplative, the musicianship is first rate, each track is a gem and MOFI's remastering provides a relaxed non-fatiguing presentation. I can (and do) listen for hours.  Highly recommended!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Awesome movie, I loved the theatrical cut... however, this is like a whole different movie. Worth the buy.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Al has a very boring voice, but there are some parts of the movie that are not completly dry. What I did have a problem with is that he sure didn't talk about how cows make methane gas or how raising cows affects the land (yet shows his families farm land where they raised cows). This is just selective information. Just like farenheit 911, this movie only gives the viewer some information. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. The movie is a great way for people to push for a global tax on carbon dioxide (even though plants use it and we exhale it). Some scientists disagree with the theory of global warming. So please don't let this be your only reference to the subject.     [...]
0064430227|5.0|Crockett Johnson's allegorical retelling of Books 1-6 of Vergil's \\"Aeneid\\" is still as powerful today as when it was originally published in 1955.  After being startled by a \\"dragon\\" guarding apples - a reference to the Achaian menace brought on by the Golden Apple of Discord - Harold/Aeneas is forced into an involuntary sea voyage, accompanied only by the moon (here a stand-in for his patroness/mother Venus).  He lands in a pleasant country, and enjoys a seaside feast (the wealth and luxury of Carthage), accompanied by a \\"hungry moose\\" and a \\"deserving porcupine\\", allegories for Dido and her sister Anna.  It is no accident that it is Anna who is the \\"deserving\\" one - Dido, who spurns Iarbas in favor of trying to divert Aeneas from his divine mission is satirized as thin and rapacious.  Abandoning these at their banquet of overabundance, Harold/Aeneas continues his journey.  He tries to climb a mountain to help locate his objective (the land where he is destined to settle), but it is only after a plunge into an abyss that he can gain enlightenment.  Here Johnson has replaced the Roman conception of the underworld with a more strikingly literal representation - there \\"wasn't any other side\\" of the mountain, merely a void.  Finally sensing that he is near to his destination, he passes first by a false house and then an entire false city - obvious metaphors for the false destinations such as Sicily which tempt the Trojan settlers.  Harold/Aeneas \\"asks a policeman\\" (King Latinus) for directions, but, as Aeneas is guided by divine destiny, Latinus merely directs him \\"the way he was going anyway\\".  Vergil's theme that a divine origin - and the firm religious foundation built upon this - is the wellspring of Roman glory is well symbolized by the ending;  the journey of Harold/Aeneas ends when he embraces \\"pietas\\" and the destiny placed upon him by Venus, and builds his \\"room\\" around her (thus establishing the Roman race).  Crockett Johnson's masterful interpretation of this theme through spartan monochrome illustrations offers a remarkable counterpoint to Vergil's ornate Latin verse.  But the pinnacle of his creation lies in the titular instrument.  It is no great exaggeration to say that Vergil's patron, Augustus, was at the time engaged in remaking Rome in his own image.  The author's metaphor is dual - Harold is not merely Aeneas, founder of the Romans.  He is Augustus, the fulfillment of the Aeneid's central prophecies, redrawing Rome with an imperial purple crayon.
B000EWBKKI|2.0|I thought it important to add my vote to the \\"Buyer Beware\\" movement cropping up with this BD. If you care about a proper presentation of this modern classic, avoid this (at least) fourth DVD release due primarily to the lackluster transfer. This thing heads up all the BD sales here on Amazon, there's a good reason it's so heavily discounted. You will get what you pay for. A great movie, yes, but certainly not a showpiece for your home entertainment setup. And the bare bones aspect of the release isn't a saving grace.     Lions Gate, step up and release a version worthy of the source, for this and T1. Amazon, jumbling up these product reviews is just dirty. Two stars for this release, I'm guaranteeing five for the eventual proper release... which will be a my quadruple-dip on this title. They won. I'll be back.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|Springsteen's most powerful songs seemed to come from inside the heads and hearts of great real and imagined characters - Spanish Johnny, Madame Marie, Rosalita, Mary in Thunder Road, Wayne in Darlington County and so many others inspired a first hand narrative that put us in the songs with them.  Characters like these got scarce - maybe because celebrity forced Bruce to spend more time in a bubble to preserve what little privacy he could, or maybe just because he had moved on. With the notable exception of  The Rising, people we meet in his recent songs are more often written about from an outside observer's perspective.  The music also more seems more detached these days. Raw urgency and dynamic arrangements grew increasingly rare on studio recordings after Born In The USA and all but disappeared long before Magic and this release. While fewer of the songs on this collection swim in the lush arrangements of his 2007 release, most continue his current fascination with the multi-layered pop production he grew up listening to.  If you are okay with that context there is a lot to like on Working On A Dream.  If you're not, well, the real life Madame Marie passed away last year, so we can't ask the woman  the cops busted  \\"...for telling fortunes better than they do\\" how long Bruce will stay on this path.  And hey, an 'okay' release from Bruce is still better than most albums.  rockinsights.com

0307277453|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but the information was not particularly \\"sticky\\" for me.  On the other hand, it is probably better to own this and have it handy, rather than to check it out of the library.  Because referring to it in the future seems likely.  Multiple things going on: Modern human anotomy, evolutionary antecedants (and explinations of wierd stuff--I like knowing where hiccups come from) and the story of his professional work.  Recommended as a solid and worthwhile tome.
0780626966|5.0|Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm St. is a classic horror franchise.  I totally loved this genre growing up!  It's part terror, part comedic but classic horror film collection.  All of the movies are great, some better than others with great cameos in several films like Rosanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean), Yaphet Kotto (Alien), Lisa Zane (Bad Influence), Patricia Arquette (TV's Medium & David Lynch's Lost Highway).  It won kudos from fans for its ground-breaking special effects as well as teenage fantasy sequences.  This is an overall classic horror series.  It was very entertaining to take a stroll down horror-movie memory lane.  Buy this set, you won't be disappointed.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This film will open the eyes of all who view it regarding how the United States compares with other countries in caring for its sick. In a word - poorly. As Americans we must ask ourselves how we let our healthcare system get to this point and then be ashamed. We owe it to ourselves and our children to radically alter or replace the system with one that enables all citizens and visitors to receive affordable and quality healthcare. I purchased multiple copies of \\"Sicko\\" and gave them to friends as XMAS gifts as one baby step in doing my part...
B000002UAU|5.0|Some reviewers have trashed this album, because it \\"aint rock and roll.\\"  How true, but also how irrelevant.  It's just great music, so why get hung up on the fact that it does not fit into a particular genre?  By that logic, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and \\"Kind of Blue\\" suck as well.    \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" truly revolutionized popular music.  Anyone who was alive at the time (as I was) or who has listened to music thoughtfully knows this. But it was not merely great in its day, it is still great today.  I would make two points that are often overlooked:    1)  In this album, Paul completely changed the role of the bass in pop music.  He moved it into the sonic foreground and provided the most melodic baselines that had ever been heard.  On virtually every \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" song, I find myself humming along with the bass as much as with the primary melody.  In my book, this level of bass playing has never been equaled, except possibly by Paul himself.    2)  Ringo's drumming is right on the money--so musical, so supportive of the songs.  Just listen the cool riffs on \\"Day in the Life.\\"  No, Mr. Starkey does not whale away, as is the current style, but that is a good thing.  Heavy drumming would have been completely out of place here.  My all time favorite drummer is Keith Moon, but to have put him and his hyperactive drumming style in the middle of this music would have ruined it.  Ringo is a very underrated drummer, a fact that many really good drummers appreciate.    Yet for all its greatness, \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" is not my favorite Beatles album.  That honor goes to \\"Abbey Road,\\" which is still the high point of pop music.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I remember one night on a business trip, bored in a hotel room eating room service soup and flipping channels, when I was fortunate enough to stumble into the the pilot for this wonderful series. There I found myself, transfixed with the clever, humorous dialogue that wasn't afraid of using language that may fly over some people's heads while remaining outrageously funny.  In no time, I was laughing so hard that I had soup coming out of my nose.<br /><br />The show has improved over time, its characters have developed distinct personalities, and is the only TV show that I look forward to (or watch)  during the week.  I hear that ratings are understandably good; may its run last enough to brighten many more years of our lives...<br /><br />SHELDON FOR PRESIDENT!  :-)

B001EO748M|2.0|I was rather deceived by the second season of The Tudors. It seems to me a soap opera visually splendid but with an unconvincing leading couple. It is hard to believe that England survived such a moron king and Anne Boleyn's evolution from bitch to saint (in the last episode) is quite unexpected. Living abroad I missed the possibility to have subtitles (my DVD reader does not recognizes the close-captioned subtitles).
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Shaun of the Dead is definitely \\"tongue in cheek\\" zombie humour.  Shaun and his friends are so accustomed to seeing Brits shuffling around as if on thorazine, that they don't even notice zombies walking the streets.  The movie is more centered on Shaun winning back his girlfriend than surviving the undead plague rampaging the island.  There is a \\"play within a play\\" as the surviving group attempts their best zombie impersonations in order to ascertain safety in their local pub.  The extras (i.e. zombies) act brilliantly as well, and keep the film moving along.  In the end, boy wins back girl, and gets to \\"have it all\\" as you will see in his shed at the end of the movie.  Brilliant!!!

B0018AVNKC|3.0|Insanely inventive characters and a generous helping of darkly macabre visuals permeate every facet of Coraline, and the wildly imaginative world created certainly works to overshadow any shortcomings the film has in story and pacing.  Upon closely examining Coraline's storyline however, one can find a rather poorly developed villain and numerous plot devices that give the young adventurer far too much help, consequently reducing the severity and intensity of her trials.  But at least everything looks fantastic.<br /><br />Having just moved to the eerily isolated Pink Palace Apartments, and being consistently ignored by her parents, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) finds herself terribly bored.  But all that changes when she discovers a mysterious hidden doorway that leads to an alternate world - one that parallels her own but seems much better.  In this other reality Coraline finds what she believes she's always wanted, but she soon learns just how deceptive appearances can be...<br /><br />At first her visits to the other world seem like dreams - she has a more loving, playful mother, an exciting father who actually likes gardening (something Coraline enjoys) and amazing food, instead of the goop she's usually served. Even the eccentric next-door circus ringleader Mr. Bobinsky is more jubilant and the dramatic theater-loving neighbors Miss Spink and Miss Forcible are entertaining. While every \\"Other\\" character has improved, each one has buttons instead of eyes. And the catch becomes apparent when the Other Mother insists that Coraline adopt button eyes of her own.<br /><br />It's darker and more sinister than Henry Selick's previous stop-motion films James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas, but has familiar elements from the visionary mind of Neil Gaiman. It's like a darker, twisted version of Alice in Wonderland, complete with a talking cat. The atmosphere is splendidly enchanting, the environment is unique and the visuals are top-notch. The animation is also seamlessly blended between puppets, extravagant sets and computer graphics. The pacing, however, is a little slow and the production as a whole doesn't succeed as a family film (or even a children's movie) due to its unnerving plot.  And while our heroine receives plenty of attention, the villain's backstory is mysteriously absent, leaving one wondering the point of orchestrating such an elaborate facade.<br /><br />Coraline debuts in 3D, but overall doesn't take advantage of the technology. Objects don't jump out from the screen, and few scares are derived from poking into the third dimension. If 3D isn't available in your area, don't worry - you're not missing much.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinslended between puppets, extravagant sets and computer graphics.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|I give this movie three stars because of the acting and don't blame  the actors for this film's shortcomings.  The film itself is a victim of poor editing as some of the  glue that should have held this story together was left on the  editing room floor.  The actors worked with the material they had but  I don't believe the characters were fully developed, particularly  that of Penelope Cruz. I enjoyed Woody Allen's Match Point much more as it was a complete story.  In the end, this was much like many Euro  films that at the end your left saying \\"huh, that's the end - you're kidding!\\"
B00164IV9G|3.0|Is it the feel-bad movie of the year? Although it's disguised as a Valentine's Day chick flick, and the advertising tries to convince guys that it isn't filled exclusively with mushy stuff, it's certainly not fun-loving. Exposing, analyzing and patronizing complex relationships, He's Just Not That Into You is a startlingly relatable film that alternates between reasonably entertaining and \\"drudging up bad memories.\\" It's more sophisticated than you might think and the humor, which is fairly consistent, doesn't resort to raunchiness. The dating crowd will want to take note, however, that this isn't the type of movie you want to watch with your significant other, as you'll both probably leave feeling guilty, paranoid, overly inquisitive, or all three.<br /><br />The film follows several relationships, each one originally independent of the other, until they all seem to collide at the conclusion. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) assumes the stereotype of the pathetic, desperate girl, who obsessively waits for her many dates to call her back. She resorts to begging, stalking, and other degrading acts to win the attentions of multiple guys, each one shrugging her off. Alex (Justin Long), a friendly and experienced bar manager, steps in to give Gigi a few pointers on her depressing failure with the opposite sex. Relying too heavily on his advice and his playful concern, she starts to think Alex is interested in her, leading to even more angst. Their story is the most interesting, considering Alex's often eye-opening advice and the humor in Gigi's failings.<br /><br />Ben (Bradley Cooper) was rushed into marriage with his wife Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and resultantly falls for the sensual flirtations of Anna (Scarlett Johansson). After a quick seduction, Ben realizes he's destroying the relationship with his wife, but Anna is fixed on the idea that Ben could be her true love. Meanwhile, Conor (Kevin Connolly) is wondering why Anna, who is his current girlfriend, won't sleep with him. This section of the film is the most serious, with tragic and emotional twists at every turn.<br /><br />Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) have been happily in love for seven years, but when her younger sister announces wedding plans, Beth begins to question why she hasn't been proposed to. Neil doesn't believe in marriage, but Beth feels it's a necessity - leading to doubts, heartbreak and the most unlikely segment of the film.<br /><br />There are an additional few love stories thrown in, each involving several of the characters from the major three plot lines. Perhaps the most inspiring piece of He's Just Not That Into You is the storytelling approach, which carefully intertwines almost every single character - by the end of the film, it's really just one complex story. The problem is that a series of serious relationships that are falling apart, getting glued back together, or never having a chance to develop, is occasionally not varied enough to keep audiences amused.<br /><br />The large and recognizable cast is delightful to see, introducing a new familiar face every ten minutes, and the humor is universal and doesn't resort to cheap yucks. The film puts on display every single stereotype, mold, rule, exception, and dilemma of relationships; some are predictable while others are surprising, but the whole spectrum is present. Told chiefly from a woman's perspective (guys are terrible and dishonest most of the time, although at certain points the men get their more unbiased viewpoint portrayed) He's Just Not That Into You is likely to rub a great many people the wrong way. It's not a date movie by any means, but it's also not as unintelligent as it appears.<br /><br />- Mike Massieion of the film is the most serious, with tragic and emotional twists at every turn.

B000O76PKS|3.0|Many death-metal groups cannot even muster the energy to make marginally compelling music, so it is no surprise Opeth is often cited around the top of many metal lists, a band who has consistently at least attempted to raise expectations as to what a growl and crunch-chord can achieve. But, praising innovative death metal is almost as sadly easy as praising innovative hip-hop, with almost as little true innovation taking place.

B001GM28HO|4.0|I first heard Lady Gaga's single \\"Just Dance\\" on a MySpace page and instantly loved it.  Then I heard Poker Face and LoveGame and liked those too so I picked up the CD.  Just Dance starts out the album and of course, is my fave song.  LoveGame is the second track and while I'm not too into it now, I have a feeling that after a few more spins, I'll like it.  Paparazzi is one I will probably skip but not every time I listen to this album.  Poker Face really has a good beat except when she stutters the \\"p\\" in \\"poker\\".  Eh, eh (Nothing Else...) caught my ear as well as Beatiful, Dirty, Rich and The Fame.  The latter two tracks are not my usual cup of tea per say but I like them.  Next comes Money Honey and it isn't bad but it's not the best either.  It's another one I think I might like after I listen to it more.  Starstruck is catchy... I like it.  Next up, Boys, Boys, Boys which does kind of remind me of Gwen Stefani in a way when she sings \\"I like you alot alot\\" but make no mistake, she is not trying to copy Gwen.  Paper Gangsta is one I don't know what to think of.  Brown Eyes is skippable, I don't like it and I doubt I'm going to warm up to it.  I Like It Rough and Summerboy finish up the album.  I Like It Rough is a good track and Summerboy is too but it isn't as good.  This is where she really reminds me of Gwen Stefani.    All in all, still not sitting here thinking I wasted my money on this CD.  But at the end, I stick with saying it starts out good then goes downhill somewhat from there.  Seriously though don't base your decision about whether or not to buy this album based on my review, or any others for that matter, because at the end of the day I like what I like and that may differ from what your taste is.

B001BLSEHS|5.0|I am amazed to see this recording available. I found a LP \\"CUT-OUT\\" version back in the early 70's at a local department store. I immediately recognized it as having the same tracks as the late 60'American release differing only in the album cover. Of course this original LP only came with 10 tracks and my copy is definitely not a remastered CD.     This LP was an excellent debut for traffic, and although not a \\"concept album\\" which was popular at that time, all tracks are very good. I especially enjoy Berkshire Poppies, Giving  too you, and of course Steve's \\"Mr. Fantasy\\" which he took on to Blind Faith!
1932907009|1.0|I read all the reviews and still thought with so many good ones the book should have something good. But no.     He goes on and on about a lot of things that he thinks are right, without giving any explanation, expecting the reader to believe on it for the sake of it or because he tries using a lot of cool (or retarded in my opinion) terms for script genres / problems / tricks.    Really amateur, not a deep insight into anything. u can sit down and read it at a library in 2 hours.

For instance, the unflappable cheer of \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" is hard to resist. And the more I listen, the more I like.     One thing I will commend Bruce for.  When so many CDs are the 10-song iTunes limit, he gives us a whopping Bakers Dozen songs lasting over 51 minutes.

6302775302|5.0|Mark Knopfler and the boys give a concert in the Netherlands in 1992. This is a combination of material from a couple of albums (CDs), combining some of the older stuff with his new (at the time) material.     While this concert isn't as good as Knopfler's \\"A Night In London,\\" it's pretty solid. It's a bit more mellow and the group isn't very animated, yet the concert is a pleasing one.    Good crowd shots help pump up the interest, and a fast number does come on, the impact is all the more. The crowd, despite a lot of rain, was into it here, giving great support. Europe has to have some of the best rock crowds in the world.    The above review is on the VHS. I don't have the DVD yet, but after reading positive reviews here, will definitely get it.

B000O77SRC|4.0|This remains one of the modern-day \\"classic\\" movies that was so popular that is spawned several sequels. It was just great entertainment value.  The sequels, by the way, never topped this film.    The story was ludicrous: one man beating an entire group of terrorists with outrageous, almost-impossible feats - another \\"Rambo\\" mentality flick - but it worked. The action scenes are memorable; Bruce Willis is good as the macho hero and David Warner is excellent as the villain.    I do wish filmmakers would stop the bias against law enforcement. In this film, they show the acting police chief and all the FBI agents to be arrogant, stupid and crude....just what Hollywood always does to anyone in authority.    But the film gets away with its flaws because it grabs you early on and never lets you go.....a very involving story.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|'Slumdog Millionaire' is an improbable 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy goes on game show to get girl back' story, and yet at the same time a cinematic treat and finally such good fun that any glitches in the narrative are easily overlooked.  Director Danny Boyle ([[ASIN:B0001XALTG Trainspotting - Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]]) has once again successfully eluded being pigeonholed as a genre director or as someone who revisits the same ground over and over with 'Slumdog', and even if the entire effort is not the most original, it's told with such energy and passion that it feels like a new experience.      The young actors in 'Slumdog' are what elevates this film, in addition to the disturbing yet fascinating scenery of their journeys through Mumbai.  When it comes to the scenes in the slums, I'm sure there will be as many different opinions as there are reviewers, but personally, I thought the director gave an honest glimpse of a world that I know very little about.  What I especially appreciated was how he did not try to play on the viewers sympathy by taking time to over-emphasize the horrid conditions.  He simply filmed - and viewers may draw their own conclusions.      And it is horrid, but that reinforces the vitality of these characters - that they are survivors.  What is even more endearing are the child actors who portray the main characters in the flashback sections.  According to an interview I caught the end of, they were plucked from the very slums the movie is set in.  All of the main characters (at whatever age) are played by young actors that without fail carry their roles with confidence and skill, until I couldn't hardly help but root for them as they tried to overcome all the obstacles between them.    It is possible that the depiction of the slums in this movie, and Indian society as a whole, may overshadow the movie.  I think that would be a shame, though many of the images certainly have the ability to engender strong feelings.  I would encourage viewers sensitive to small children in extreme poverty think twice about watching, but I have to remember that, even though it doesn't conform to my views, this society has been successful for centuries.      I did have a few minor problems with the film, though not really enough to drop the rating.  The biggest one was a scene that I felt was a swipe at Americans, who are shown as seeing a problem and only know how to throw money at it.  Stereotyping good hearted people who honestly try to do something doesn't help accomplish anything.      This is almost a faultless date movie, and even though the characters are just teenagers, there was a mature feel to the whole film.  On the night we went, it was also senior night at the theater, and we were surrounded by the over 60 crowd.  But I was very impressed at how well they all behaved, and afterwards overheard them talking amongst themselves about how well they enjoyed it.  I do think that this movie deserved it's R rating though.  There are some early scenes of torture, plus some gun violence, and the life portrayed in the slums itself can be disconcerting.  Otherwise, call it a positive and affirming movie with a only a few drops of saccharine for flavor.
B00005JMXX|3.0|I was leery of a heavy propaganda piece on \\"global warming,\\" but I still saw this and found that, yeah that's what it was, but it was really more of just a straight adventure story than anything else.....and not a bad one, at that.     The first 50 minutes of this two-hour film have the \\"fun parts\\" where the special-effects dominate. We see all kinds of radical weather disasters that are extremely dramatic and entertaining to watch, even if they don't make a bit of sense.    After the blizzard and sub-zero, unlivable weather conditions arrive the movie settles down to a young romance and survival story with Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Rossum and other people trapped in a library in New York City and Jake's father, played by Dennis Quaid, walking all the way from Philadelphia to rescue him.     Yes, it's very, very far-fetched - the whole thing - but it's a fun adventure story with nice people. It's especially refreshing to see Hollywood portray a father as being so loving and selfless. The romance wasn't overdone and the young people were not profane and/or annoying, as so often is the case.    Except for the over-exaggerated and extremely erroneous scare tactics of this movie, and a ridiculous portrayal of the Vice Preseint of the United States, the movie works strictly as an entertaining fantasy-adventure story.

B001DJ7PR8|1.0|From all the glowing reviews, I guess I saw another Woody Allen film with the same title.  Aside from the performances, there was little to enjoy.  The script meanders, and the constant voiceover was unnecessary and irritating.  You don't need to have the voiceover tell me that they spent their evenings drinking wine and eating in cafes if you're showing the actors drinking wine and eating in cafes.  At the end of the film, the characters had not evolved and nothing came of their time together.  The entire series of events was of little consequence and so was this film.
0743486285|5.0|Whether you are a fan of Nikki Sixx or not this is an incredible read. It is well written, heart wrenching, deeply touching, sometimes humorous and at its core sends an important message.   This book covers just one year in the life of Nikki Sixx and the ups and downs he experience not just professionally but personally. It is not just told by him but by the people who were around him at the time which gives great insight into how things looked from both sides of an addicts life. It is indeed humbling to see a person who had it all. The money, the fame, the girls. Was struggling with the same sense of of lonliness and depression that many of us deal with. The fact that Sixx came out of this alive is amazing and when you read this book you will see why. Part of the profits go to charity. Sixx himself has lobbied for change in policy when it comes to help for addiction and set up his own charity to help keep troubled youth off the streets. I believe this book is worth its weight in gold to show the dangers of drugs from someone who has lived through it.
B000002GQH|5.0|I am somewhat surprised that neither this album nor any of Moody Blues' albums are listed on the \\"essential recordings\\" list.  As much as any other album of the late 60's this album captures the feel of that time. Certainly far more contemplative that Hendrix or Zepplin, Threshold of a Dream captures the spiritual essence of those days of uncertainty.    Although I love all of the Moody Blues albums, this album holds special meaning for me as it was my introduction to the band. As a child of the 60's (I was a Sophomore in high school when it came out) the music of this period defined my life.  This album, In Search of the Lost Chord, and To Our Children's Children's Children became daily fare along side the more energetic music of Zepplin, Hendrix, The Who, Cream, Tull, et.al.    Though I have no favorite album...there is simply too much good music out there to pick from...this album remains on my top 100, keeping company with Take Five, Sargeant Pepper, Blood on the Tracks, Aqualung, Zepplin II, Abraxis, Wheels of Fire, Dark Side of the Moon, Gaucho, Avalon, Joshua Tree, Sister Sweetly...well there are just too many to even begin.    Lush, spacey, magnificently orchestrated, wistful, with a little bit of irony, there just isn't a better album out there...equal in different ways...but none better.
1433502410|5.0|The online edition of the excellent ESV Study Bible, which is free   when you purchase the print edition, is worth the price alone.   The online edition includes the content of the ESV Study Bible,   plus a column for personal notes; ability to highlight; interactive links;   and the ability to listen to an excellent audio recording of the Bible.    Since the ESV Study Bible is not yet available in large print, the audio   feature together with the ability to increase font size on your computer   is very helpful. A superb product!
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I'm a JM fan, this production is well setup, devided in acoustic tracks, then in duo and finally with the band...all songs on this BD are excellent, highly recommend this BD.
B00068TJM6|2.0|The watch actually received had problems that do not appear on the same watch as seen in retail stores.  I would have returned the watch except that the band had already been 'sized' since it was a gift.  The STOPWATCH minute hand on my watch cannot be set at zero.  It is about a half of a click off (either plus, or minus) at the start and then appears to be dead-on at the 30 minute mark but is actually reading a minute high. Even the ALARM minute hand does not seem to 'line up' exactly on the minutes at various positions on the dial.
B0013POLS8|5.0|Excellent musical production, Mariah as always singing to her last breath awesome show!...quality of video is exceptional as well as audio.
159562015X|5.0|This book is a classic--and one I have shared with many clients.  I would highly recommend it for individuals interested in working more effectively.  My business networking group also used it as an \\"ice-breaker\\" when we were first getting to know each other--it was great fun to talk about our strengths and how to apply them in business.  Highly Recommended!
B000IHYY52|3.0|Good selection of artists, although concert or show is quite short, expected a longer presentation ...overall it is a good concert
B001PO6EX2|3.0|I think there are some valuable insights and tools in Nonviolent Communication, and I'm heartened to see a yearning growing among people, the desire to be able to talk to and listen to each other more fully, freely and openly. At the same time, for someone who wants to learn to talk to others (and themselves, as well!) in a more open and less defensive way, in a way that makes it easier for people to speak openly to each other, I find Sharon Ellison's book, Taking the War Out of Our Words: Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a much clearer, more complete and more effective paradigm and method for a non-defensive model of communication than Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication.<br /><br />I have found value in Rosenberg's lists of feelings and, in peripheral ways, in some of his exercises, among other things. However, while one of the stated aims of the process is to eliminate judgement and criticism, I respond to some of his dialogue as if there is judgement hidden within it. I also find his methods rather cumbersome.<br /><br />Taking the War Out of Our Words gives me a different and considerably more positive experience. In the presence of Ellison's writing - explanation, description, exercises, examples and so on - I find myself relaxing, and feeling safe even while I confront and acknowledge the ways in which I myself act defensively. I find encouragement and acceptance, as well as simple, clear steps I can immediately begin to apply to the way I say things. It has been my experience that these small changes often make a rapid difference.<br /><br />Ellison's process speaks more strongly to me than Rosenberg's, and I find it more gentle as well as clearer. I believe her framework is simultaneously both more radical and simpler than Rosenberg's. To me, Marshall Rosenberg's system nibbles at the edges of our difficulties in communicating with each other, where Sharon Ellison's sweeps the rubble out of the center and starts rebuilding the structures of our communication, but in a way that makes an intuitive kind of sense.<br /><br />Ellison examines and identifies the fundamental structures of our language that, it seems, almost inevitably cause defensiveness between us, even when we don't mean them to. I find her tools profoundly practical and useful, and I find it easy to begin applying them; and even though the process of becoming significantly less defensive is a long one, and not very easy, the encouraging experience of little successes - some of them quite unexpected - helps keep me going. It also seems to me that achieving the smallest changes, working with everyday issues, is in the end what seems to create the real shift.<br /><br />Despite my own preference for Sharon Ellison's paradigm and tools, I would not want to discourage anyone from trying Rosenberg's program. At the same time, I would encourage anyone who experiences difficulty in applying his system not to give up on the hope of learning a more open and peaceable way of communication, but to have a look at Ellison's book and see if you find it more helpful.
031606792X|1.0|This book is terrible SMeyer should be ashamed of herself. I can't believe this junk got published.  Trust me- STAY AWAY from Meyer.  It's NOT good reading, not by any stretch.  It's bad fanfic.  Like Rob Pattinson said- it reads like Meyer's sex fantasy journal that got published on accident.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Sit back down at your home studio piano, and start recording.  you could do dozens of standards, just like this, and they would be wildly successful. Give people an MP3 library to pick and choose from, you should do ALL the standards- in the style of this wonderful CD...    I downloaded this CD off iTunes a couple nights ago, as I have recently developed an interest in Mr. Jarrett's work, and wanted to hear his solo work.  I sat on a plane last night looking out the window at a western sky at sunset that was about as lovely as I've seen, listening to this album.  It was pretty much perfect.  The moron on iTunes who did the review of the album gave it a negative spin.  wasn't sophisticated enough for him. Please ignore him, hopefully he's found something in life more constructive to do.  If you like piano music; thoughtful, peaceful, introspective playing...you will love this cd. There is nothing wrong with emphasizing a beautiful melody as it is written, nothing wrong with keeping the jazz phrasing minimal, but effective.  I have tried to like Bill Evan's solo album \\"Alone\\", but i can't do it.  he doesn't seem to know where to go with it, and he loses you in the process.  This CD... these are 5-6 minute versions of great songs, beautifully arranged and performed perfectly.  The music is very understandable, especially for folks, like me, who enjoy jazz stylings but don't worship at its altar of endless, loosely structured, improvisational orgies.  If you know anything about solo piano- its the LEFT HAND.  listen to what he does with the LEFT HAND.  it is wonderful, and it ain't easy either....
B0013GSQH4|5.0|my brother is into all those kind of books he loves this one so I made his birthday for him lol
0316010669|5.0|there appears to be two major ways of reading: by topic, by author.<br />this book made me want to read the other things this author has written.<br /><br />it is about thin-slicing. a study on the mostly unconscious first few seconds of a decision. both the good things about it and those times that it fails.<br /><br />a quick and very well written book. recommended.
B001GQACGO|1.0|I like Beyonce and was excited to purchase this CD.  But, before I received it in the mail every one of my friends that had it already said it sucked and they were huge Beyonce fans, bigger than me.  I tried to stay positive but...this CD does suck (compared to her other CDs). There are literally only 3 songs worth listening to from both discs. I wouldnt recommend wasting my money on this CD unless its a gift for someone that is literally begging you for it.  Just listen to \\"Single Ladies\\" on the radio...
1878424505|4.0|This book has inklings of 'A New World' by Tolle and repeat what many, many self-improvement books proclaim.  The Four Agreements has been one of the simplest ways I've read that we are truth and love and to live in the present.  Yet, it is so hard for most of us to have.  However, author, Ruiz, explains so well why we fear and hide from the very feelings we want.<br /><br />If you would like a quick and simply worded book to lift your spirits and feel positive, this book can do it.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie is great because of the effects and action. I've never seen a movie that looked like this, my kids loved it! It's a pretty long movie, but it will never lose your attention.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I saw this movie twice in the theater then purchased it for myself and several family members.  It has such a great message and can be enjoyed by both adults and children.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My sister and my two nieces were doing this video and talked about how great it was so I bought it.  I am on day 22, and I am amazed (still) how hard it is to get through the first circuit.  Maybe its because of all of the jumping jacks in the warm up and the first circuit.  After that, the workout breezes through.  I love that it lasts only 20 minutes (really about 25), and I can tell that my body has changed.  My thighs and butt are much firmer and my abs are getting there -- although with only 3 minutes of abs, that is going to take a lot longer.  I love the punches in the second circuit.  You can pretend that you are punching Jillian!  In level one, after about 5 workouts, I progressed to the harder version of everything except the push ups (there are 2 women with Jillian -- one doing the hard version and one doing an easier version of the exercise). I would recommend this dvd for anyone needing to workout, but who does not have a lot of time.  I also recommend starting out with lighter weights and working your way to something heavier so your arms don't feel like they are going to fall off!
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|Acting (if you could call it acting!) horrible, the singing shrill and does not in the least compare to Abba, the screen play ridiculous.  I can't understand serious actors like Meryl Streep and Colin Firth even accepting this disaster screenplay - what a MESS all around - simply ridiculous.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|I liked about half of The Rising, but I never play it any more. Same for Magic. WOAD, after 4 full LOUD listens in the car this week, seems to be the best Bruce rock disc since Tunnel of Love.    If nothing else, it makes me think of what TOL might have sounded like as an E-Street album. By the way, I think if WOAD was EXACTLY the same but sung by Johnny Cash and produced by Rick Rubin it would be hailed as an all-time great album. But so many Bruce fans are haters (that's a whole mental study waiting to be done) it even gets bashed on home turf.    I know there are a lot of folks who wish for 1970's retreads, and that's cool, but I like the fact that Bruce has changed his sound a lot lately and still has not produced duds of the magnitude Dylan and the Stones have. That's pretty remarkable.    Anway, haters click out. Open minders, read on for quick thoughts on a few tracks.    Outlaw Pete - This has been called an attempt at a murder ballad, and also has been ripped for the baby lyrics. If you follow American music pre-1960 you'll see the kind of bragging that leads to legends of diaper wearing baby thieves. It is not a murder ballad in the traditional sense, but it is a pretty iconic outlaw story. And I love how each time \\"Can you hear me\\" comes around it has a different meaning, from the young Pete seeking attention to the \\"ghost\\" Pete calling out for his daughter.    Queen - The same melancholy stalking that made \\"I Wanna Marry You\\" creepy fun is back. What guy hasn't seen a checkout girl he thought about taking home? It's just that most of us never turned the idea into art. By the time the high pitched backing vocals come in, this song is in a sonic swirl worthy of anything Bruce has done.    WOAD - It is a folk song. I bet it is the one from this album that people are covering 20 years from now.    Good Eye - I keep hitting replay to hear when Max and Garry come in. Damn that grooves!    Tomorrow Never Knows - Again, if it were Johnny Cash, we'd be bowing down.    The Byrds Set  Life Itself - Kingdom Of Days - Surprise, Surprise    This is one of the best three-in-a-row stretches he has ever had. Life Itself, with its twisting backtracked guitars has the burbling drone from verse 2 on that is classic late-era Byrds. Kingdom of Days continues the feel mixed with a little Beatles - is that Yoko signing?, while the incredibly catchy Surprise, Surprise sounds like McGuinn and Lennon replaced Lofgren and VanZandt.    I favor folksy Bruce, so Last Carnival and The Wrestler are comfy places for me.    But unlike Magic where i skipped tracks at almost every listen, this is a straight-through disc for me.    I cannot believe how much I love it.    Rob    PS: One of the neat things about Bruce's career is that he can change his sound. Greetings through The River dic 1 are relatively similar. From The River disc 2 you start a more folk-styled blend that streaks through his work up to The Rising. But then, BITUSA, TOL and WOAD make a great trio of pop records.    And thing is, even on the panned pair of LT and HT, there are just great freaking songs. With Every Wish and I Wish I Were Blind are enough to warrant HT. And LT, I dare say most artists would be happy to write If I Should Fall Behind and My Beautiful Reward in their CAREERS, lest have them both on a lesser album.    The man has never released an album without great songs. That is unreal.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I bought this 3 cd set for my husband for Christmas after he mentioned that as much as he enjoys Van Morrison, he hardly had any of his music. This cd set is PERFECT!! We both love the way that songs from different eras are sprinkled around making it a very interesting musical experience. This is a must have for anyone's musical collection!
0375701427|5.0|I've yet to read a book by Phillip Roth that I don't enjoy.  Amazing literary works, and this one is no different. The Swede's lunative, insane female dog of a daughter, Merry, reminds me so greatly of some of the looney tune protestors in my old hometown, Eugene, Oregon, and the mentality displayed by not only Merry but the idiots she embraces is a startling perspective on some of nonsensical so-called countercultural revolution that took place during a very tumultous time in American history.  I'll admit that I had hoped to see an ultimate resolution in answer to Merry's actions, as well as that dumb broad that swindled the Swede out of his money, but I guess it's ultimately a good example of an author not being able to give everything to everyone out there.  Regardless, I was amazed by this book.  Thank God the '60s are over.
1400049628|1.0|I found the pace of this book to be pretty bad. The information given might as well have been in bullet points. The little fictional background given is mildly entertaining at best, and dreadfully boring most of the time.    Much of the \\"advice\\" is either irrelevant to any zombie fan, not amusing, or just plain silly.    I was really hoping to enjoy at least one chapter of this \\"guide\\", but unfortunately I did not. Just finishing it, and it is not a long book by any means, was a challenge.    If you were thinking about picking this up, pick up 'Zombie Haiku' instead, it is not only funny, witty, aesthetically pleasing, and creative, but much more worth your time.
0812589041|5.0|For me, this was an ideal novel. I felt pulled me in right away, I cared about the characters, and the story line kept me excited from start to finish. It touched my heart and stimulated my mind. Perfection!
B000EWBKKI|3.0|I'll keep it short and sweet since there are so many reviews here.    If you're looking at the Blu-ray disc and wondering why all the reviews are for the 'Ultimate Edition DVD', so was I!     I guess they cross reference.    Anyway, the only thing you need to know is that this is NOT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT of T2, so be warned. I'm sure there will be a subsequent re-release of this in a Director's Cut Edition in an attempt to get people to re-buy the Blu-ray another time; on top of the countless times we've all purchased this on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, Blu-ray, and whatever is coming next. For that reason, and that reason alone I have marked down my score on this. I don't approve of the blatant money grab, and as a fan, it offends me.    The movie itself looks and sounds great though, especially for its age. In my opinion it has aged pretty well, considering the advancements in technology since its original theatrical release. Again, my average score is in response to the disregard for consumers, trying to take us to the woodshed one more time to milk this old (but fantastic) classic.    Please vote for me if my review helped, thanks!
B000KIPT30|2.0|I tried using the Behringer MicroAmp to distribute music to multiple sets of computer speakers. Sadly, it is unusually subject to interference that causes speaker noise when there is no music playing. I disabled other electronic equipment, including a wireless router, and I shifted power outlets, to find the problem isolated to the Behringer MicroAmp. Even unplugged from its 12V power source, the Behringer would cause speaker noise. The MicroAmp is very light, and I suspect the problem might be inadequate shielding. However, I did have to use 1/4\\" Male to 1/8\\" Female adapters, so that might be part of the problem, but I think that is less likely. The same problem occurred with multiple adapters. For what it's worth, I don't recommend the similar product by Rolls, either (the blue one). However, I have been very happy with this item: [[ASIN:B000M0TN6U ART HeadAMP 4 Stereo Headphone Amp]], which includes 1/8\\" jacks.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|For anyone who read The Other Boleyn Girl novel, this may have been a disappointment for you. I loved the book, but when I compared the movie to it, the movie left a lot to be desired. When I looked at the film as just a film, standing alone, with no basis for it, I loved it. It was a great film, and it added a few things that I wasn't expecting that were credible.    For people like me, though, who adore learning about the Tudor period, the film was innacurate, even ignoring all that was left out from the book. I was grateful for its tasteful love scenes, since I am not a fan of graphic sex scenes, but much of the movie didn't really hit the mark, I thought, when comparing it to Henry VIII's real court and the real characters. Some of the dresses were a little over-the-top, I thought, especially the shiny green one Anne is wearing on the DVD cover. My favorite scene that I thought was the clearest view of the characters was Anne's breakdown.    I thought Natalie Portman was an outstanding choice to play Anne, and as much as I like Scarlett Johannson, the part of Mary Boleyn was not right for her. Standing by itself, the film is respectable and a great way to introduce more history into the cinema, but comparing it to real history or the book, it falls behind.

1594201927|2.0|Human preferences and values can not always be described by a scalar. (Beardon, et. al., J. of Mathematical Economics, 37, 17-38, 2002)  To be accurate utility must then be a vector.  (Thrall, et. al. Decision Processes, Wiley and Sons, 1954, pgs 159, 167, and 181)  Consequently money can not be a simple scalar like it is today.  (R. Jones, sci.econ.research, Jan. 3, 2008)  A kind of vector credit card could be created but the question arises, what components should vector currency have.  At a minimum currency must describe the human needs to survive and reproduce.  Population control is critical and one component would be a reproductive allowance which would sanction childbearing.  An individual's allowance would depend upon their age, number of offspring they already have, their health, IQ, genetic factors, etc.<br /><br />A second component of vector currency would be devoted to contributing to their longevity.  The amount of this healthcare allowance would depend upon an individual's age, current health, number of dependents, IQ, genetic factors, etc.<br /><br />Additional components may be desirable.  A third component of vector currency would cover all expenses not specifically related to healthcare and raising a family.  The credit available would depend upon the individual's occupation, age, number of dependents, etc.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|Excellent, well-written movie that everyone should enjoy. I wasn't too impressed with Cars, Ratatouille was better, but the story telling in Wall-E is a return to the early Pixar brilliance, especially when one considers that the movie has little dialog to carry it.
0385340990|2.0|I couldn't read it.  It seemed forced.  I couldn't believe any of the characters.  The dialogue sounded like it was trying to be cute.  I only got about 50 pages into it and realized that it was work and I only needed to read for fun.
B00005U122|5.0|Para mi como \\"new Pink Floyd fan\\" este concierto me parece de muy buen gusto, buen sonido y calidad de video. Vale la pena tenerlo y no le paren bolas a los que le dieron 1 o 2 stars rating... Es Roger Waters y punto. El tiene mucho credito con la musica, letras e ideas de la maravilla de PINK FLOYD. DAVID GILMOUR en PULSE es buenisimo tambien y es mas \\"concierto format\\". Ambos son talentosos y espectaculares. YOU CAN'T GET WRONG WITH THIS DVD FOR JUST 10 BUCKS, C'MOM HAVE IT, ENJOY IT AND BE HAPPY,IT'S PINK FLOYD. IT HAS GOOD SONGS....

B001FBSMW6|4.0|This is a great album.  \\"Spiralling\\" is possibly one of the best songs I have heard in years.  Nothing disappoints, and even though it is a departure from the previous albums in some areas of style, each song is perfect in its own way.
B0017CW5J4|2.0|This is one of the first blu-ray titles that I purchased.  It was high on my list because I loved \\"The Complex Rock Tour\\" on DVD, but the video quality on that DVD was terrible.<br /><br />The video quality on this \\"Megastar\\" blu-ray disk is good, but in every other aspect the \\"The Complex Rock Tour\\" is superior to \\"Megastar\\".<br /><br />Bottom line:  the \\"Megastar\\" concert is disappointing.  The blue men themselves seem to be just going through the motions, the audience often seems bored, the sound quality is muddled, and the attempt to use \\"infomercials\\" during segues is almost embarrassing to watch.  Pondering what went wrong, it seems that the focus has shifted to everything other than the 3 blue men, to the point that the title characters seem to be an afterthought.  If the theme of \\"The Complex\\" was \\"watch these quirky guys make amazing music on odd instruments\\", the theme of \\"Megastar\\" is \\"listen to this backup band, with some disinterested guys dressed up in blue added for free.\\"<br /><br />About half way through \\"Megastar\\" the song \\"I Feel Love\\" is performed.  This was a highlight of \\"The Complex\\", featuring Annette Strean of Venus Hum in the electrified dress.  I have to give \\"Megastar\\" credit for boldness in its attempt to perform this song without Annette Strean, but unfortunately the attempt succeeded mainly in illustrating how lame \\"Megastar\\" is compared to \\"The Complex.\\"<br /><br />As another reviewer said, if you haven't seen \\"The Complex\\" you may like \\"Megastar\\", but if you have seen \\"The Complex\\" you will find \\"Megastar\\" uninspiring--it has no soul.
0316017922|5.0|\\"Outliers\\" is one of the best non-fiction books that I have read. \\"Outliers\\", according to Gladwell, are people who are hugely successful and are considered by most people as really different from the rest of the world in terms of talent, skills and abilities. But is it really the full story?     In his book, Gladwell is looking at \\"outliers\\" of our world and trying to understand the real reasons for their success. What really defines the future chances of any Canadian boy to become a famous hockey player? Is it talent, physical strength or... his day of birth? Is Bill Gates a one-in-a-million computer genius or was he simply incredibly lucky? Why so many children of Jewish immigrants in 1930s became famous lawyers? Is it simply a coincidence? There are many themes, examples and anecdotes in this small book; there is also a lot of research done on the related subjects - psychology, social studies, history and business -  that is referenced in this book. Sometimes, Gladwell's conclusions are obvious common sense; sometimes, they are surprising. I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise for the people who still hadn't have a chance to read this book - and it has all the suspense of a good thriller (including a lot of airplane's crashes).    One thing that I can promise to any reader: this book will make you think. Also, you will want to re-read it - sometimes to find contra-arguments, sometimes to check the point. So far, all my friends and colleagues who read \\"Outliers\\", enjoyed it. What's more interesting, people have different angles and perspectives - so they apply the \\"outliers\\" logic to different situations: leadership in the company; importance of acknowledging cultural heritage; the different approaches to children's upbringing; the role of luck and opportunities in our life. And sometimes it may be just fresh unbiased look at the world around us.     You don't have to agree with Gladwell's conclusions - some of them are \\"far-fetched\\", even in my (biased!) opinion. Still, I think that any book that makes us to get out of our \\"box\\" is worth reading - if only to make our minds a little bit more open. And Gladwell is one of the best writers, who are able to do just that.
B000NA77YO|5.0|I will start out by saying in my mind you should buy all the Dio era Sabbath albums but this \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is a good set of their songs and it has 3 new songs. I love the Ozzy era Sabbath but the Dio era is what was going on when I first got into Black Sabbath and in my mind all 3 of the studio albums they made together are excellent. We could argue over which songs should be on here but who cares? All of these songs are great. Ronnie and Tony together is magic. I also like all 3 of the new songs and think \\"The Devil Cried\\" fits in with some of their other classics. I might catch some flack but I feel like the Dio version of Sabbath is one of the greatest metal bands of all time right their with Priest, Maiden, and the original Sabbath.

B001KMB6X2|4.0|Vin Diesel plays a tough guy who is hired to smuggle a special girl out of mongolia, through Russia and Canada, to the United States in a near future almost postapocalyptic world.<br /><br />The movie is pretty much one extremely long action sequence punctuated by Vin Diesel making gutteral grunting noises as he intimidates bad guys.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Vin Diesel<br />-The special effects were good<br /><br />Cons<br />-The story really doesn't hold together well<br />-The near future is rendered just ok (tries to be bladerunnersish but falls well short)<br />-The story has no conclusion<br />-There is little rationale for why the characters do what they do<br /><br />Overall, this movie presents a paper thin plot for Vin Diesel to Kick Butt.<br /><br />The movie is replete with cool special effects, Vin fighting in a cage, Vin playing with CNNs interractive screen in his trunk, cool special effects, blowing things up, blowing things up, gutteral grunting from Vin, more gutteral grunting from Vin.  No Plot.<br /><br />If this sounds like your idea of a great enteratining movie, go out and rent it or buy it.  If this reads like the movie is a complete mess, steer well clear.<br />[...]<br />I will say this, if this movie didn't have Vin Diesel and the neat special effects - it could very well wind up being one of those horrible plotless Sci Fi Channel movies that tries to be a B movie but is really an F.  It gets the stars it gets because of Vin and the special effects.<br /><br />If you want to see how a movie like this is done correctly, try watching [[ASIN:B0006GVJE4 The Fifth Element (Ultimate Edition)]] where you get Bruce Willis trying to recover some precious rocks with Mila Jovovovich (SP?) across borders, on starships -- but in contrast to Babylon AD, in the Fifth Element, you get great character development, a bit of comedy, lots of action, and very memorable characters.  In short, there is a right way and a not so right way to do a movie like this.  Babylon AD is an example of how not to do it while The Fifth Element is an example of how to get it done right.o get it done right.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I had heard a lot about Jillian Michaels and her DVDs and never really paid attention because I thought it was another fad thing. On a whim, I decided to order the DVD and I did level one for the first time yesterday because I did not have time to make it to the gym between classes like I usually do.<br /><br />I had heard that it was VERY challenging and that is what made me get this in the first place. It was not too difficult for me or anything, but I definitely felt like I was getting a workout. I don't have weights so I used soup cans instead. I'm sure it will be way more challenging with REAL weights, especially because I am so used to training my arms with heavier weights to begin with (20-25 lbs). Overall, I was really pleased. I am SO sore today. My legs have not been sore like this in a very LONG time! I like feeling sore though. Makes me feel like I did something!<br /><br />A lot of people complained about her talking the whole time and how awful and obnoxious the music is, but I found that the talking actually made the work out go faster and helped me improve my form if I found that I was suddenly getting sloppy. There's no room to think \\"HOW MUCH LONGER?!\\". I can honestly say that thought never went through my mind. It really tests your stamina. If the talking does distract you, there is an option on the DVD that allows you to turn the talking off (it just mutes her voice, but keeps the music going). As far as the music goes, I really didn't find it obnoxious at all like some people said it was. I mean come on, its a WORK OUT DVD!! What did those people expect, Michael Bolton tunes?<br /><br />As people have previously mentioned, Jillian uses the 3-2-1 method per circuit: 3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of strength and 1 minute of abs. There are 3 circuits per level and there are 3 levels TOTAL. Each workout is roughly 20 minutes long; essentially, there is 18 minutes of actual workout time and 2 minutes of warm up and cool down stretching.<br /><br />I don't really have anything bad to say about the 30 day Shred. My only complaint is a petty one and that is the brevity of the work out; However, I realize that this is a DVD based on the convenience and simplicity factors. That is the premise of this DVD. Its supposed to provide a relatively easy to perform, but challenging work out to people that lasts under 30 minutes. Some people don't even have that much time to spare! I'm only \\"complaining\\" because I usually aim to burn between 450 - 700 cals a day in cardio and this one burns roughly around 140 calories for me (That is based on doing 18 minutes of vigorous calisthenics with my weight of 124 lbs; How many calories someone burns while doing this depends on their weight). I'm more than likely going to combine this with some extra cardio. If I do rely on this to be my sole physical activity for the day, it will be on my \\"active recovery\\" days when I do minimal physical activity just to get the blood flowing and the muscles pumping.<br /><br />All in all, its a solid work out. You totally get an adrenaline rush when you're done and feel a sense of accomplishment. I felt like I was being worked hard, but not to the point of exhaustion and thats always a good thing!<br /><br />If you're looking for a 30-minute, intense, but not impossible workout, AND one that gets your heart racing, your blood flowing and your muscles pumping, this is it :-)ad to say about the 30 day Shred.

B001E780W8|5.0|I personally believe that this is an awesomely good cd. Everybody keeps whining about, \\"It's not as good as the first\\" or something to that effect. I can't think of many bands at all that's always measured up to their first effort, and those that have stuck to one type of writing, I ask, how long did they last? Not long. Musical style, to an extent, is something that needs to change and grow over time for a band to truly move forward. I honestly think that this is their most musically-mature effort to date.        Sure there's a couple of slower parts on the cd, but wheather those songs are typical Slipknot songs or something a little different, you'd come to expect it since this is their first true collaberetive effort. You had more ideas from different angles coming in on this one than before, which I think is totally cool because it gets more of the band involved in the writing process. Besides, those songs are still good. Just because is not the typical sound doesn't make it bad, just makes it out of some people's taste. And most of those people are youngin's that think no band should ever evolve and everything should sound the same...always. And the fact that people are calling it a bad cd just because it's not a remake of the original slightly angers me.       That being said, there are plenty of brutal songs on the album that you'd expect to come from Slipknot. They are as heavy as ever, enticingly     intricate, and masterfully written. They are true masters of their craft.      I highly recommend this to any TRUE Slipknot fan that knows good music when they hear it, and are not just caught up on the novelty of it all. If anything, they've gotten better at what they do, they know how to use their instruments VERY well, and am not AT ALL let down by this one.
B0019M06JS|5.0|When it comes to Bossa nova, Eliane Elias is simply the best, and this is her best album by far.  She sings such amazing versions of songs like \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" (which I hope Renee Olstead would record someday), \\"Desafinado\\", \\"The More I See You\\", even the Stevie Wonder gem \\"Superwoman\\".  Her cool, collected vocals relax as well as conjure up images of summery thoughts.  This album is a must for any Bossa nova aficionado bar none.

B000FS9MV0|5.0|Renee Olstead really outdid herself. After 2 years in planning and several postponements due to marketing and tracking problems, Skylark is finally here, and well worth the wait.  She sticks to the standards she does so well, plus does some original blues inspired original tunes (most she co-wrote with producer David Foster) that are out of this world.  Best of all are the original \\"Midnight Man\\", and the classics \\"Skylark\\", \\"Hit The Road Jack\\", \\"Thanks For The Boogie Ride\\", and also the original ballad \\"Hold Me Now\\".  Chris Botti (who appeared on her debut album) appears as well as blues guitarist Robert Randolph.  This signifies she can belt the blues as well as project the beauty of standards,  cementing her vocal versatility.  This album is absolutely spectacular and this is what we've been waiting for all these years. Thanks Renee, we wish you continued success.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Not quite as good as Magic (IMO), but damn somebody show me another rocker pushing 60 making anything this good.  My only major quible, I wish Bruce would stop with the F bombs already, your a great writer Bruce, leave the cussin to 20 yo rappers please.  Otherwise a great album, and a nice DVD that comes with (the \\"Night with the Jersey Devil\\" vid is a hoot).  Cant wait to see Bruce and the ESB in Philly in April.
031606792X|5.0|This book takes on an entirely different dynamic than the previous books. It is just as extremely emotional, but there are plenty of surprising twists and turns on the way. It is a relief to finally see that Bella and Edward seem to be at the point where they will be together infinitely. The romance that fuels this book is so vivid and precise that it is literally like walking in their shoes. It is having a front row seat to a love that is awe inspiring and completely spellbinding, and still like being on the edge of your seat as though you yourself were experiencing a first love all over again.    There is still the tumultuous relationship between Bella and Jacob that brings all the past wounds to light. Jacob has to deal with just as much as Bella does in terms of the super natural suddenly being thrust upon him, a first love that is painful, and having to deal with everything even though his heart is breaking. I have an extreme amount of sympathy for Jacob as this story plays out. I also empathize with Edward. He has dealt with a lot of things that he wasn't prepared for and adapted the best way that he knew how because of the love that he possess'. I can imagine it would be extremely difficult to make the decision that she has to make. I would of made the same choice she made, but I still understand the difficulty.    The super natural world reveals itself on a much grander scale as the story climaxes. The abilities and gifts that some of them have plays a very huge role. It is also very interesting to discover Bella's ability and the ways in which she is the one that pretty much sets the stage for the outcome. I also liked the way her and Edward's relationship evolves as the story progresses. There are so many layers put forth in this book and they interweave and intertwine a story that is captivating.    Out of the entire Twilight saga this is my favorite book. It brings together the romance, the tragedy, and the inevitability of what would happen to the characters. I was on the edge of my seat, staying up all night to discover where this tale would take me. I was not disappointed, but instead drunk with the euphoria that injected its way into my brain from the book. I was surprised by what came into play and where the characters where taken. It is a book I will certainly read again and again for the sheer pleasure of the story.
B000059TFO|4.0|Mississippi Burning is set in 1964 when three civil rights activists are murdered in a small town by the Ku Klux Klan... Two of them were white and one of them black...<br /><br />Based on actual events in Philadelphia, the screenplay centers chiefly on the hostility relationship between the two FBI agents (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) sent down to the small Mississippi town to seek information about the vanishing of the three victims... Immediately upon their arrival, they are greeted with hostility by the local law enforcement and the town in general...<br /><br />Dafoe's Ward-- in charge of the case--comes off as the embodiment of everything those men in the south dislike about the \\"Yankees\\" who are coming down there commanding them how to act...<br /><br />Anderson(Hackman), who was once a Mississippi officer himself, has a special feel for how to settle things with Southerners... He uses his charm to win the confidence of the friendly wife of a Klansman deputy, whom he suspects holds the key to unravel the details of the case...<br /><br />The scenes between McDormand and Hackman are the best of the film... They dramatize how quickly two lonely people can match...<br /><br />The film succeeds by being gripping, emotional, and disturbing... Alan parker graphically explores the hatred, motivations and mentality that were once flaming through the American society in the 60's.
B000002LFL|5.0|If you are not a Smiths fan then you do not need this cd. Only for the hard core. A lot of good songs are omitted here but still a great cd from start to finish. I myself nver knew how good Johnny Marr really was.
B00005N5S2|3.0|The film transported everyone back to October 20, 1944 where we seemed to be part of the great Philippine 'I Shall Return' landing scene... It was on that Leyte shore where General MacArthur reaped his fame...<br /><br />Above all, Gregory Peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great general... It is the stride, the set of the shoulders, the intensity... It's what both men have had in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion... With MacArthur it was for the military... With Peck it was for the challenge of acting... An Academy Award winner for \\"To Kill a Mockinbird\\", an Oscar nominee for \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\", \\"The Yearling\\", \\"Gentleman's Agreement\\", and \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\"--he has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist; from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney; from biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower... He has brought to them all his own unique insight, his character, his sincerity, warmth and love, and especially, his humor...<br /><br />There is a scene where 'MacArthur' stands on deck with the 'President of the Philippines.' We can hear the dialogue: \\"General, I hope the water isn't too deep,\\" says the 'President,' \\"because my people will find out I can't swim.\\" Then come Peck's sonorous voice: \\"And my people are going to find that I can't walk on water!\\"<br /><br />As \\"MacArthur,\\" Peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry... Through him we felt MacArthur's emotions: we knew his anger, his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family...

B001EOQWFI|5.0|Art. This is what this movie is. Amazingly designed, animated, and the best part is to see the emotion without words, wordless speech and message. Amazing movie, one of my favorites, and the blu ray quality is just out of proportion.    Recommended for any one! a great buy!
B000P0J024|5.0|I am a fan of all the artists on this CD and the DVD is a real asset to the CD. If you are into 60's, 70's, or 80's music you will absolutely love this set. I highly recommend it and it was a great addition to my collection of stuff.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Excellent, clear, full screen, just fantastic.  I don't do many reviews, but I have to hand it to the BBC, they did a great job building this collection of both the wildlife, and scenery of our planet.  you will not be disappointed, I assure you, and the price is reasonable.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I read \\"Charlie & The Chocolate Factory\\" as a kid and even saw the Gene Wilder movie version of \\"Charlie & The Chocolate Factory\\" too....     However, this version of \\"Charlie & The Chocolate Factory\\" takes the cake! Johnny Depp is a fabulous actor and am always amazed at how diverse his acting talents are. He does a superb job playing the role of Willy Wonka! It worth watching \\"Charlie & The Chocolate Factory\\" just for his performance alone!    I loved the acting by all cast members, the special effects were done well, costuming and even the set design were fabulous too. The story was great too. It has been a number of years now since I've read the novel, \\"Charlie & The Chocolate Factory\\", so can't remember how closely the follows the book... If recollections serves me well, this movie version followed the book fairly well.    I think this movie version of \\"Charlie & The Chocolate Factory\\" is well worth watching if you haven't seen it already!

B001GKJ2DY|1.0|I am a complete ABBA fan, so the thought of watching the movie \\"Mamma Mia!\\" sounded right up my alley!! Plus the idea of a story revolving around Abba's songs was a novel idea too, which was another reason I was game for watching this movie.    Okay, let's just say the story line is cheesy! The singing was horrible and the acting was bad on all counts.... I would have thought with the all star cast of Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Christine Barabski, Julie Walters, and so on that this movie would have been great... at the very least acting wise!!     I say skip the movie and listen to Abba's Greatest Hits!!

B001EO748M|5.0|This series produced by Showtime Channel is an excellent production, as well as an interesting view of an historical figure - Henry the 8th.   Yes, the one with all of the wives. The outdoor shots were mostly in Ireland and beautifully filmed.  The costumes are great and modified somewhat to be more to our modern taste.  Note Henry's haircut and small beard.  A great series! I can't wait for the 3rd season.;
0618918248|5.0|This is a wonderfully entertaining, thought-provoking and intellectual read. Dawkins has a charming way of rationalizing so many aspects of this wonderful existence of ours. I truly appreciate his passion to 'enlighten' his readers with his 'matter of fact' explanations.<br /><br />Personally, I believe that because religion has destroyed countries, beliefs and entire civilizations over the centuries, it is time for us to recognize that these gods [or God], these goddesses have been our own creations, our own fabrications that were used to give us reason, explanation and false truth to the unexplained universe and answers to this mysterious world. Truth is more fascinating than fiction; science and reason are more powerful than religion.<br /><br />Grow. Learn. Conserve. Preserve. Question. Denounce. Educate. Change. Free your mind.

My mother is 89 and my sister is 68 and has a mild form of cerebral palsy.  My mother doesn't see well so we bought her a big flat screen TV and this is very beneficial to her.  My sister has been subject to seizures over the years so neither she nor my mother can drive.  They both really love movies and Santa Claus the Movie is a feel good story.  I am very pleased that I can purchase the movies they like through Amazon.  It's a great experience and I will buy more for them.  This was a Christmas gift and arrived before Christmas so they could put it under their tree.  Thank you for making it so easy to purchase and ship to them.    Judy Hanlon

141690977X|2.0|This book is fill of flawed pop psychology. The authors survey was flawed for they did not share the sample sizes, ages ect. The over simplification of some serious subjects makes the conclusions irrelevant.     If you want to know that you are 'into each other' communicate with each other of every subject important to you both.    I know two couples that broke up when this book came out for the woman (it is a book, that by demographics is 95% purchased by woman) over things from this book, that were really not relevant to where each couple was in their relationship. One of them got back together and burned the book in the fireplace (that was funny) and are now married and the other two could not get over the (wrong) message the book sent as a whole. Now they have much hyped movie coming out, which will make this subject even more distant from reality.    A better bet than the movie, go out to dinner, have a great conversation about all the is right with your relationship and then cover the concerns.
0316017922|5.0|I've been waiting for this book since I learned that Malcolm is working on a new project. I enjoyed reading Outliers (I actually red it in one day) which is, similarly to author's previous novels, challenges conventional point of view and presents well-thought arguments and factual information as alternative. It is the book about successful people and their path from the very beginning to the top of their careers, with Bill Gates and Amadeus Mozart as just two of those represented. I would not want to spoil the reading with more details - just pick up the book and you will see for yourself.
B001E5FYS8|3.0|The phrase \\"the book was better\\" has been utilized by bookworms to annoy movie buffs for years, and in the case of Man on Wire, there is no better line than to balance one's judgment upon.<br /><br />Petit's large book \\"Up In The Clouds\\" (not Man on Wire) was a testament to the artistic pursuit.  The expansive duration of his \\"project\\" spanning almost half a dozen years, read like a rollercoaster ride, soaring in inspiration at one moment, plunging into depression, but steadily gaining momentum.  When he and his accomplice Jean Francois had to sit motionless under a tarp for hours to evade security guards on the night before his faithful walk, the excruciating event was expertly documented in the book.  In Man on a Wire, director Jame Marsh intercuts the long hours with flashbacks and interviews, almost exempting the viewer from the taut suspense that creates the tension in Petit's high wire story.<br /><br />You will miss, for example, Petit's rebellious, anti-authoritarian childhood in France, the proposal from Dustin Hoffman in NYC, Petit's incessant arguments with Jean Louis, the people who pull out of the project and disappointed Philippe (but whom he, nevertheless, thanked), betrayals from people the moment the walk was completed, a quick victory hop in the sack with an anonymous fan, Petit's refusal to endorse advertisements and commercials in the wake of his success, but also his generosity in offering to walk again if a tower (or towers) should be erected in the place of WTC.  You will also miss the beautiful 1902 story of the collapse of the San Marco tower, which Petit shares in the afterword as solace for the events of 9/11.<br /><br />What the movie does offer is COLOR.  To Reach the Clouds is in a black and white format, meaning all photographs are in B/W.  Man of Wire offers color versions of some of those photographs and whimsical footage of early days leading up to the walk.  Silent-film style clips of tall-hatted Petit moving through the streets in his unicycle is also a humorous treat.<br /><br />The delightful Jean Francois, always ready to come to his aid (as oppose to Jean Louise, always criticizing Petit like a mother hen) gets interviewed in present day as well.  His lovely manner is surely a testament to how good-natured people age gracefully.<br /><br />If you are not a reader, then I gently suggest you begin this DVD by watching the extra \\"interview with Phillipe Petit.\\"  In the 12 minute monologue from the man himself, you will get a taste of Petit's artistry and a sense of what his book 'Up In the Clouds' is about.  In addition, it could also be taken as a \\"footnote/warning\\" to the documentary itself.  Petit says:<br /><br />\\"The film is not my film...I have my own film in my head...very precise...my film is very different than the film that James did.  James decided it is his vision, taken from my book 'To Reach The Clouds' He decided to give a lot of importance to the human feelings and the human drama, to the point that I think he manipulated a little bit - some of those interviews to make it more dramatic.  As you see there are many tears and many question marks of people seemingly torn by what they would like to express but are not able to or whatever.  This I have no comment, as this is not part of my adventure.  My adventure is a fairy tale of a young man falling in love with two towers.\\"<br /><br />In the extras, there is also a 10 minute illustrated (color drawing) educational documentary for children and a film short documenting his earlier walk across the support pillars of the Sydney bridge.<br /><br />The director should also be complimented on leaving footage and mention of 9/11 out of his film in order to capture and retain this good memory we possess of the Twin Towers.humorous treat.

B001GKJ2FW|4.0|I love ABBA. Meryl Streep is arguably the best, most versatile  actress on sets today. She's also pretty pretty. (Sound like Buddy Holly, but it's  true). Cast, cinematography, DTS sound, and this film still could have  tanked. But, alas! Mamma Mia! roars into your frontal lobe and then infests your soul. What a trip.   A thin script it has an original premise, although I refuse  to hint at what it's about, lest you might guess how it ends up. Trust me-as have millions of other-- erudite-types, Mensa monkeys and film buffs.   you're in for 108 minutes of a living room get-away.  It's all filmed in  the kind of tropical island everybody wants to see though few ever get closer than a big screen and Blu-ay player.   Watching this film is a vicarious thrill and as close to being there. as need be. When  Ms. Streep sings  the title song and later, \\"Dancing Queen\\" you wonder if there's anything  she can't do. Her character REALLY does with style and good taste.   All of which could be said for the entire film.

The book identifies and removes any and all excuses made regarding being \\"stuck in a rut\\" or \\"why are they successful and not me\\".

0307455874|5.0|What Mr. Obama has brought to the table with this well written, heartfelt and sensitive book is the idea nay, the promise of what it means to be not-so- much an American, but a human being!  Since I am not a politically oriented person, the policies and opines from the President are a bit lofty for me.  That doesn't mean I don't appreciate them, I'm just not well versed enough in the \\"Health Care problem\\" for example, to offer any relevant or cogent opinions; except to say that it certainly needs tending to.<br /><br />No, what I got from this book was a relatively close-up view of the leader of the free world and his ostensibly sincere, bridge building, rigorously calculated plans to insert a sense of spirituality (and I don't mean religiosity!) honor, pride and dare I say - compassion, back into the oval office in particular and government in general.  I say \\"ostensibly\\" as the proof of course, is in the pudding!<br /><br />It is quite evident to me, based on this thorough and complex manuscript that President Obama has a genuine affection for the electorate specifically; as well as people from all walks of life.  The sentiment that he wants everyone, (and by \\"everyone,\\" I mean\\" EVERYONE\\") to learn, grow & succeed - leaps off each page.  If he is able to instill half the virtue, unfailing decency, uncompromising character and almost boundless imagination & intelligence into the white house that is replete in his book, then America will be in fine, capable hands.  Finally.  Five stars for the book, and six stars for his efforts in office thus far!
B001DHXT1G|5.0|Well this one is Incredible. I will tell you the truth that I love Eric Bana. When I heard that Edward Norton will play Banner and Bana is out, I said that I will never watch this movie ... I changed my mind and I'm glad I did it. The Ang Lee Hulk is a different movie than this one, both of the movies have Hulk as prime character but the Ang Lee one is more of a drama, this one is more of an action flick.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|I found this movie to be very good. Many people are giving it a low rating (or bad review) due to the flaws in the science in the movie. Also, some are just staring at the movie and not analyzing it to get the whole truth to it. There is a lot of meaning behind the movie if you pay attention closely to it.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|If you like the show, you'll LOVE the movie! It's bittersweet to see it end, but the movie is awesome!
B0010X745K|2.0|*Spoiler*  As I'm typing this, I'm finishing up the last few minutes of the movie.  The Mist itself is a great cinematic idea-a creepy ominious thing that contains-what, exactly?  I won't tell you here, but suffice to say it is trippy, creepy, gross and almost throw-up disgusting.  It has plenty of twists and turns and the usual characters that you'll root for to get killed.  But the ending, while a good twist, was nothing more than tragic.  (Here's where the SPOILER comes into play:) Did we really need to have the film end this way?  Did it have to end in one of the main characters in a future psych ward?  (Trust me, after all the character's been through, he/she's gonna need it.)  For Graphics, CGI effects and acting: I give it four stars.  The monsters seem pretty creepy.  The story gets a three; inventive but not quite good enough for ole Steven.  But for the overall package, I'd have to give it a two: it was more depressing than interesting and showed more gore/violence/disturbing stuff than it needed to (perhaps I'm watching the unrated version?).<br />In a nutshell: gory, deeply disturbing film about human nature and what happens when people become monsters.  Lots of language and did I mention the blood (?), an engaging film that nonetheless has the viewer reaching for something happy afterwards.  You've been warned.
B0012GVKW8|2.0|I'm not going to review the Movie contents like others on here are oddly doing? I'll leave that for sites like IMDB and movie critic websites. If they are here its obvious they know enough about the content because they are looking to buy it??? This is supposed be about the product quality. Now that that is out of the way!! There are no extras like the DVD release had so you are only buying this for the HD quality and you will need to keep your DVD formats if you are a collector.  I'm not going to waste your time telling you about the Movie as we all know its just plain and simple awesome!! But what I will tell you is that this release on Blu ray for the price you are paying you would have thought they could have included the extras from the DVD version. I wouldn't expect them to be in HD format but at least add them on??? There is no \\"Andy's Lost Tape\\" None of the making or Emergency broadcast extras. They have just slapped it on Blu ray for the sake of the movie. Not good for a collector at all make sure to keep your DVD release.
B000S1ROOQ|3.0|It is a Blu-ray, a German Blu-ray.  To watch the movie in English, you need to know a bit of German to go into the menu which is in German and switch to English and turn off the German subtitles.  Otherwise, it is good disc.
B001GM7G8K|5.0|I never was a big fan of the Eagles,(I am a fan of Don Henley's solo efforts) but after hearing them on this concert tour and buying this CD, I am. I loved it. I don't think there was a song on it I didn't like. I especially liked the title track and \\"Waiting in the Weeds\\". I think the writing, craftmanship, and performance is definitely as good as anything they've done. Warning to die-hard Eagles fans: it's somewhat of a departure from the classic Eagles sound of yesteryear. It contains more pop and blues sounding tracks than I would expect from the Eagles. If you can get past the fact that they don't sound exactly like they did 30 years ago, you'll love this record.

015206057X|5.0|Love this gem of a book.  It's darling and is currently one of two of our toddler's favorites - the other is the Barn Door book.
031606792X|1.0|Ok, I liked the first one. As these books progressed they got stupider, or I got smarter. I really want to tell all the girls reading these books a couple of things:  1. If a guy stays up and watches you all night, sends people to restrain you, wants to know your every thought and says he loves you within days, and causes your life to be over when he leaves you,hes not \\"Just like Edward\\", hes an abusive jerk.  2. If you wake up after sex covered in bruises, its NOT ok no matter how sad and James Dean-y your boyfriend is afterward.  3. Renesmee is perhaps the worst name in the history of literature, and I dont care how you couch it, men who love children are pedophiles and they all claim thier creepy love is \\"non-sexual\\". Jacob was a cute character till that whole skin-crawly sub-plot.  I know I am now the enemy of every 12 year old in the world, but to set an ideal for girls that translates into horrific abuse in the \\"real world\\" is irresponsible.   Just to mention I work wth domestic violence victims, and everybody thinks they have an Edward, till he beats or kills them. When your boyfriend kills you in real life you dont turn into a beautful immortal. You become a bloody bag of meat that your parents have to come identify with your dental records.
B000O179FO|3.0|Technical a good bluray movie - but I think it was an average movie. Perhaps I'm not just into musicals...
0312383320|5.0|This book was hilarious and just as good, if not better, than her numbered novels. I really couldn't tell the difference between this \\"between the numbers\\" book and her regular numbered books. It had the antics of Lula, hunky Ranger, funny Diesel, hilarious Grandma and all of Stefanie's antics, plus a few surprises. I would recommend this book wholeheartedly.
B000GH2YPG|1.0|I have not even recieved the book yet, and I placed the order at the begining of January for a Bookclub I am involved with.  I am fortunate that our local library had a copy, or I would have been up a creek!  Needless to say, I am not very happy.  When I placed the order, It said that it might take up to the 29th of January for the book to get to me.  Well, I am still waiting.
1897299214|4.0|I normally do not like graphic format, but I made an exception here because of the subject - North Korea - and the bizarre cover illustration. You have to see this cover to believe it! It does come up in the story as well.<br /><br />The book is well worth a read. I did not give it 5 stars, since I found it a little inconsistent in parts, and it ended rather abruptly. It also did not dig all that deep in places - although considering the subject and the graphic format, that might have been very hard to do.<br /><br />The book depicts the adventures of an animator who is in North Korea supervising a project for a French television company - apparently artists are cheaper there than in Europe these days, and the Dear Leader needs some hard currency for cognac or some other \\"essential\\". The author's handlers try to keep him under control while he does his work and sees what they want him to see.<br /><br />North Korea must be a truly bizarre place. I guess like the author, you have to have a sense of humor to get by there, but as he recognizes, it is a pathetic place in many respects. I wonder what will happen there when the people finally figure out what has been done to them by the two Leaders.<br /><br />If you liked this book and like mysteries, you might want to check out the Inspector O series that has recently come out. It features a North Korean police detective who knows what the regime really is and is just trying to get by and still do his job as honorably as he can under the circumstances.
031606792X|4.0|I have read some of the positve reviews and some of the negative reviews and this is what I think.    I believe that some of the negative reviews go way too far in their criticism of this book and it seems more like a personal attack on Stephenie.   I did feel a disconnect between Bella and Edward when she was pregnant but after Bella bacame a vampire I found my Bella and Edward again. All their love and humour which they share came back.    There was no way that everyone would be won over by this book but I enjoyed it and couldnt put it down. Stephenie would never be able to win as if she had let someone die then everyone would be upset about that and now with a happy ending there are complaints. I am thrilled about the happy ending as I wouldnt have wanted it any other way. People are pointing holes out in the series now but please this is a fantasy and not reality. Its just that these characters have become so real but it is based in fantasy.
B00000EGD7|5.0|It was the last days of May......... a newly-liberated 14 year old was just beginning to discover the awesome treasures lurking in the bins of local record stores. He had a few dollars to spend, and managed to talk his hideous new stepmother into driving him to the nearest strip mall. He had recently found out that there was more to music than Mom's depressing Ray Price records, his older brothers' John Denver and Carpenters wimp-fests, and Top 40 radio from CKLW radio out of Windsor, Canada.    He had smuggled a couple of life-changing cassette tapes into his home, carefully hidden in his sock drawer from his gospel-listening mother's concerned eyes. And what a couple tapes they were! \\"Toys in the Attic\\" and \\"Rocks\\" by Aerosmith transformed a clueless teenager into the epitome of bad-attitude kick-butt rock fan.    What does any of this have to do with Blue Oyster Cult and this album?    Well, this album was one of the first records I ever owned, and it is still as amazing to me as it was the day I put it on my Dad's turntable, and slipped on the headphones. This album, along with a few Aerosmith records, saved me from a life of country music, John Denver, Carpenters, and Top 40 Canadian radio, because, God help me, there were some days before I got those first few records where I found myself singing along to \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\" and thinking the Carpenters' use of fuzz guitar on \\"Goodbye to Love\\" was pretty \\"daring\\" and \\"neat-o\\".    Ok, the record......... IT FREAKING ROCKS!!! YOU JUST HAVE NO FREAKING CLUE HOW HARD IT ROCKS!! IT REALLY REALLY REALLY ROCKS!! (and so on.....)    For those who only know this great American band by \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\" (cuz he has more cowbell) or \\"Godzilla\\", GET WITH IT! GET THIS ALBUM. GEEEZ.    If you don't like this album, you don't like good hard rock. You might want to look elsewhere for musical fulfillment. (I wonder if my brother still has his old Carpenters' records. Maybe we can make a deal.)

B0001KZM3O|5.0|Floyd is Floyd...thru their different stages, from \\"arnold layne\\" to \\"welcome to the machine\\", from \\"not now john\\" to \\"dogs of war\\" and then some, pink floyd have always had a unique way of telling a story, giving us a whole chapter, rather than just a headline...  When anyone listens to a Pink Floyd album, it's not like sitting down and turning on the radio...it's more like opening up a book, and exploring each page, with it's twists and turns, and yes, character development...  ...and Floyd had plenty of that...  And this album was the culmination for alot of fans and critics alike, with Roger Waters so evident in his 'power struggle'...  But, that's not to say \\"the final cut\\" is a bad album...quite the contrary...  It actually creates a tremendous 'stamping' on what was going on at that time...and yes, it does travel familiar ground that Waters covered before (and we all know that many of the songs were 'leftovers' from \\"the wall\\"), but, i don't think people would be so harsh about the record, if David Gilmore had participated a bit more in the vocal category...  Hearing Roger try to blurt out the story all the way thru, is just a little 'pretencious', to say the least, basically, because he has that kind of voice...  There's anger, there's ego, and there's no let up...Gilmore has an inviting voice that makes the listener actually want to listen...  ...and listening has always been what Floyd albums are about...the content has always been the main focus, rather than a catchy beat or top 40 hook...  The substance is there...but even a good book using bad ink is still a little hard to read...
B00006JIA4|5.0|I recently became a fan of Queen and this collection has some great songs. I was looking at Vol. I and II separately and I think this was a better deal. I absolutely love these cds! The booklet is very nice. Overall this is a sweet collection of Queen and it's at great price.

B0013LL2Z2|3.0|Thirty years after reading the book as a teenager, I am now reading it to my kids at night before bed. I remember the book as being pretty cheesy - and now I realize that, although it is a great story, it is VERY poorly written.    It's unusual when a movie is actually better than the book it is based on, but they really \\"fixed\\" a lot of the issues that the book has. Ok, the movie isn't perfect.  It's campy and somewhat silly, and the production work is so ... 1970's. But the story flows well, much better than the book, and has a completely opposite ending - which is actually a more satisfying resolution to the story.    Don't watch this movie if you're looking for a great piece of art. But if you want good sci-fi story with very pointed social commentary, then you should see it - Logan's Run is a fun, original, and satisfying romp.

B0002N4ZEW|4.0|Porcupine Tree fills a great gap for those hungry for more Pink Floyd, particularly the earlier works.  \\"Voyage 34\\" is a tribute actually to Pink Floyd, as hints of \\"The Wall\\" and practically the whole catalogue from the David Gilmour era make no attempt to hide.<br />  This is fine, because Porcupine Tree are an astonishingly brilliant band and can pull it off and still be themselves.  No vocals except spoken word snippets are here, leaving the music to do the soothing, soaring, tripping and floating.  Steve Wilson playfully recalls the main motif from Pink Floyd's \\"Run Like Hell\\" during \\"I\\", and Richard Barbieri provides keyboards and synths that proudly pay homage to Rick Wright, and since Wright's passing, it becomes a flattering tribute.<br />  There are some weird moments throughout, but mainly we get an instrumental workout with washes of guitar and loads of effects.  Is it trippy?  Probably, but this fan has never imbibed, so to speak.  Rather, \\"Voyage 34\\" recalls the best moments of Floyd, a little of Alan Parsons and PT's own signature sound for a CD that will have classic rock fans smiling and younger fans hearing a band that can create so many different moods over their several albums.  Porcupine Tree deserve to be huge, and maybe they'll catch on in the U.S. like they have in Europe.

B001KMB6YG|4.0|This was actually a pretty entertaining movie. You can't automatically hate it just because of who stars in it. If you like action and scifi, I would recommend this movie.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|. . . and I'm not just refering the CD Cover. All of the songs on \\"Graduation\\" sound and feel colorful. There are tons of catchy melodies and lyrics throughout the album. We get to hear excessive infusions of techno and funk in songs like \\"Flashing Lights\\" and \\"The Good Life\\". And it's nice to hear a Daft Punk sample in \\"Stronger,\\" which is my favorite track. \\"Homecoming\\" with Chris Martin is a treasure, while \\"Barry Bonds\\" with Lil Wayne is interesting enough. \\"I Wonder\\" is probably the weakest song; I don't like it very much.<br /><br />So this album is basically Kanye's most colorful so far. It'll probably be a long time, however, until we hear another Kanye album like this for a long time, since \\"808's & Heartbreak\\" marks an extreme musical and lyrical departure.<br /><br />Grade: A-
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This movie had me from \\"I had a dream...\\" and I melted, swelled and streamed hot tears till the very end. I am honestly tired of critics that aim cynical shots at movies like this and call it \\"mere fluff\\" or \\"bad technical direction\\" etc.     Yes some movies may deserve it- but not this. The idea that this movie is just \\"mere fun\\" and a bad adaption is ludicrous!     I think the opposite. Movies like this evoke a passion in us that fires our spirit and maddens our souls. It engages us, makes us want to leap, to celebrate, to sing to dance to burst through our skin and scream with pleasure and joy! I'm sorry but cynicism is SO 1990-2006. It's tired, old, tedious and an old bore.     The \\"elitist\\" pretentious negative take on this film is just that- pretentious just to BE pretentious. There isn't any solid foundation behind their dry criticism. Technically it's NOT perfect- but passion, character, and explosive beauty can override the film flaws- if you will. Of course we must have critics. I myself share my opinions on anything and everything. It's what makes us work harder and strive to be better. To see what we wouldn't see ourselves- pointed out to us by others who want to be constructive.     However, I am tired of people saying such work like this is \\"mere fun\\". I'm sorry but the fact that this is moving and celebratory and shakes you to your core with pure vivacious power IS what life is about. Yes it IS fun- but it's about Love and Friendship and beautiful human nature interacting and adoring and loving each other- all expressed in music that is ALIVE and BEAUTIFUL!     There's a lot of schlock out there that receives critical acclaim b/c it's dark, avant-garde, disturbing, shocking, etc. and quite frankly- a lot of the time it's a formula for pretention. God forbid we should give a wink to a movie that flushes your soul out to your skin and gives you the delightful shivers- and makes you want to throw a party and kiss all your loved ones.     I love the rushof it- the imperfection- the way it's thrown together and grabs you and tosses you into the mix, drinking in the lushness and dancing with sheer abandon.     FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!    A real dream.

0765342294|4.0|I just finished reading the science fiction novel called Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card.  It was a decent story about a fast thinking child, who is shipped out to battle school to be trained as a soldier in the expected alien invasion.  Because the battle school instructors have seen his ability to think fast, and innovate, they know that they cannot treat him like a regular student.  They make him 100% accountable for himself, even when people are out to get him.  When he shows himself to be true leader material, the battle school administrators throw every challenge, twist or turn they can imagine his way.      As I do not wish to spoil the story, I will not talk about Ender's progress from this point.  Ender faces many hardships with the daily grind during his training, his battle school teammates and enemies.  He struggles as well with the mental demands everyone has for him, and the mental stress caused by the family he left behind.  Throughout the story, you begin to feel the same emotions as Ender, which are not all bad.    I would recommend this book to any reader under the age of fourteen.  Although I enjoyed the book, and it was on the honors reading list at my high school, I think that the concepts of the children engaging in outer space battles would be much more enticing to a younger audience.  But over all, good read, good story, good book.    Thanks for reading.    Please give feedback.

The CD cover is of some hotel but the photograph is grainy and of poor quality. The CD booklet is quite nice and for every track we get a list of whom and what they play.

0553383663|2.0|I only made it to about page forty of this book - so apologies if it improved a lot after that point - but I couldn't read much further.  This book was almost completely uncritical of Google and its founders.  OK, so Google's impressive (why I bought the book in the first place), but it doesn't deserve the somewhat Pravda-esque treatment given here.  The founders are undoubtedly interesting and successful people, but not as pure and perfect as this book suggests.  This book is OK if you want to read about a fantastic success story; but look elsewhere if you want a fully rounded picture of this internet giant.

B000KRNG5E|5.0|It started with a woman doing a very stupid thing, where you want to say \\"are you crazy?\\" Women in horror films seem to put themselves in harm's way for no good reason. The beginning was creepy and the mood continued by being bizarre. I was suspicious of everyone, wondering who was in on it. Argento films are great also because of the interior design of the sets, or the buildings he had transformed.
0763631205|5.0|Have been collecting movies based on the Dicken's Christmas Carol for years.  Looked for an unabridged copy of the book in hardback and was delighted to find this one.  The price was great and service was fast. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|This film is creepy, gross and beautiful. The atmosphere is perfect right away, with the storm approaching. It was interesting to find out in the extras why these adult women acted so juvenile. It's because Argento originally wanted to use children in the roles, but I guess he and a collaborator thought using kids would be too difficult. It's also interesting that the film was based on a real story that Argento's former girlfriend was told when she was a kid. This turns up the creep factor when you think of how people acted like nothing strange was going on, mainly the women running the dance school. It took a lot of imagination to think of how to kill off these characters. Some of the ways are really sadistic, and are meant to make people suffer.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|Before I'd gotten the album I read the Rolling Stone review...5 stars...Bruce himself saying, \\"This three album run('The Rising', 'Magic' and 'WOAD') stand up to any three we've ever produced.\\"  So the pump was primed.    I bought the album on the first day and immediately put it in the car cd player and...I wouldn't say was dissapointed, but was definitely underwhelmed...I thought, 'Ah, Bruce-Lite.  His weakest rock album since 'Human Touch'.  'Queen of the Supermarket'...what the!?  'Surprise, Surprise'..you've got to be kidding me??...these are leftovers.'  After a couple of days I pulled only four tracks to put on my iPod...'Outlaw Pete', 'Working on a Dream', 'Life Itself' and 'The Wrestler'...the rest, I thought, 'Eh, 2nd rate Bruce.'    And then...once the expectations were gone, once I started really LISTENING to the album, once I pulled in 'Magic' and started playing them back to back things started to change.  The music started to take over...the lyrics started to come together.  'Queen of the Supermarket' wasn't just a pedestrian character sketch it was an off kilter love song, it was big, it was bold, not so much in the lyrics, but the music, the arrangement elevated it to great heights it..it...used the f word(so sorry, no iPod for that one). Other songs started to come to life, Bruce's voice started to come through the wall of sound and it sounded like he was seeing the world with new eyes.  Love was new, the 60's were new, Bruces romantic side was reborn.  I think Bruce uses the word 'love' more on this album than any three Bruce albums combined.    So the big question is, is this as good as 'Born to Run' or 'Darkness on the Edge of Town'?  Well, no, just like we can never be 21 again Bruce can never be an unknown again breaking free of the pack.  No matter what he does because of his past the bar is just too high. The subject matter here is more reflective of life and love rather than statements of politics or characters going through the underbellyof life.  This is a solid collection of songs.  In my mind none stand out as much as the best of Magic, but solid nonetheless.

Also, seasoned programmers could find many hints as the book is an instance of how an expert explains and teaches to newcomers.    As a reading suggestion: in section 1.6 Ideals for programmers, a general programming process is explained and the importance of how testing, analysis, design and programming are related is noticed. So, for a perhaps better reading, I suggest the sixth paragraph which says:    \\"We can describe the process of developing a program as having four stages:\\"    would be clearer if read this way:    \\"We can describe the process of developing a program as having four activities:\\"
B000001FO4|1.0|Cinderella's second album is not worth listening to.  If you are a lover of \\"Night Songs\\" you will be severly disapointed with this album.  Almost every song on the album is boring; there were no hooks in any of the songs.  I listened to the album once and do not plan on listening to it again, unless I need a cure for insomnia.  Any hair metal fan who loves listening to awesome catchy guitar riffs, and music with energy, should not look here.  The songs on this album are just like the album's cover, plain and boring.
B001GQACGE|5.0|I was not a fan until this CD came out.   I think she has grown into an exceptional  person both personally and professionally.    I wish her continued success.  The industry   needs more people like her.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I believe this CD firmly cements Metallica as the greatest metal band of all time.  We all know about their legendary 80s tracks and then the departure in the 90s to blues-rock which turned off many of the fans.  But Death Magnetic is a true return to the style and composition of earlier works.  And in my opinion, the songs on DM rival anything off Master Of Puppets, Ride the Lightning,etc.    I feel confident that 20 years from now I will be listening to the songs off DM on a regular basis and still enjoying them, which is the earmark for a classic and well-crafted song.  Although I like every song off DM, my favorites would That Was Just Your Life, All Nightmare Long, and The Judas Kiss.  As has been said, there is clearly a problem with the mixing and you can hear clipping especially on the song Broken Beaten Scarred.  Whle this is an annoyance to be certain, it doesn't take away from my 5 star rating.  Pick this CD up and enjoy it!!!
0061684384|5.0|Wow, this book is very well done.  I laughed out loud in  parts.  Really gives someone like me (tattooless),   a good look into the tattoo world.   This one will stay on my bookshelf as a favorite for  the rest of my life.   Well worth the price.  A great prose and a great visual.
B00151QYSA|4.0|This is an awesome Adam Sandler classic! It's a very funny movie about a slob named Sonny Koufax who adopts a 5 year old kid named Julian who is dropped at his apartment door. He adopts him and shows him how to drop sticks in front of skaters, tie his shoes, clean messes with newspaper, teach him and the delivery man to read, take him trick-or-treating on HALLOWEEN, shop, etc. Later, he has to go to court because he claimed to be his room-mate and tricked the system. Does Sonny prove that he's mature enough to keep Julian? If you love comedy and Adam Sandler, you'll love BIG DADDY!!!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Since I am a big fan of the show, this was a must have for my collection.  Now that season five is in full gear on ABC primetime, and answers are being given to us at a fast pace, it was great to watch the first 4 seasons again.  I saw, and heard, stuff I didn't see the first time.  If you are even the slightest LOST fan, buy this product.
1400044162|5.0|Like the events of Rwanda and Uganda, the true depth of the tragedies of the Nigeria's civil war largely escaped the Western world's consciousness and are only brought to light in remarkable books like Adichie's \\"Half of a Yellow Sun.\\"   Biafra's ill-fated struggle to establish an independent nation is beautifully and elegantly told through the eyes and voices of twin sisters of wealth Olanna and Kainene, and a highly intuitive 13-year old houseboy Ugwu.  Olanna is mistress to a highly ideological university professor Odenigbo who fervently supports Biafran independence.  Kainene is married to a British expatriate Richard who is enamored with the land and its culture.  All find their own reasons for remaining in Biafra.  And through them we learn how the people lived, loved, starved and suffered during this tumultuous period.      I, for one, am old enough to remember the Nigerian civil war and the million that perished during that struggle.  I remember seeing the covers of magazines showing the starving Biafran children.  Yet, the events then didn't seem as real as reading \\"Half of a Yellow Sun.\\"  Perhaps a befitting epilogue to this story is Richard's manuscript which was entitled \\"The World Was Silent When We Died.\\"

I will just enjoy it as the nice change of pace that it is; interesting and good ride music. Listen to samples before you buy.

031237593X|5.0|I have been a fan of Sharon Kay Penman for over 10 years, and this has been her most impressive read to date. Richard III has been portrayed as the \\"evil uncle\\" for centuries. This, for the most part can be attributed to the chroniclers of his time. After all, his blood enemies, the Tudors, were the victors in the \\"The Wars of the Roses.\\" But Penman masterfully presents Richard as a man--compassionate, scrupulous and loyal. Was he responsible for the disappearance/murders of his nephews?  I believe he was most likely aware of \\"how\\" (and by whom) they vanished; but I can't see him as the perpetrator of such an atrocity

B000E97X66|5.0|Bruce put his guitar away that night thinking this show had gone badly? My gosh -- what would a good show have sounded like??? This CD just melts all the other CDs in my collection and obliterates all the other songs on my ipod. How can a live album be this good?<br /><br />First, Bruce's singing is absolutely phenomenal. Seriously -- he sings better in a single take on a single night than the multiple takes in the studio over the year. The setlist is inspired. The E Street band is just dead on and dead tight that night. Many of the performances surpass the album version of the songs -- \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\", \\"She's the One\\", and \\"Rosalita\\" certainly do. The version of these three songs on this album are so good that it is now hard for me to listen to the album versions -- especially of \\"She's the One\\". \\"She's the One\\" is so transcendent on this album that the version on BTR now sounds like a demo. I wouldn't have ever thought that was possible. I'll still take the album version of \\"Born to Run\\" -- but I could live with this album as my only Springsteen album (if I had to!). I want to add that Miami Steve adds a whole bunch to this set and nicely rounds out the sound. You must own this album. The only problem is that it will make the rest of your collection pale by comparison!!
6302752337|1.0|Two men on motorcycles stop at a bar in a rural area. They test the powder they are buying. [No arms for security?] Back in the States they resell the powder to a very rich man. They hide their money and start on a long journey. No concern about time? There is no room at the inn for them. They stop to fix a flat, and are fed at a farm. Then the trip continues. When will they get to the Mardi Gras? \\"Porky Pig\\"? They arrive at a settlement. [How successful will they be?] Do they dine on bread and beans? Do the inmates run this asylum?    There is a parade in the next town. Do they have a permit? They meet a local character in the jail. Will he go to the Mardi Gras? Is there another society that is highly evolved? Is this just pretentious babbling to pad out the movie? They stop at a small town. People make comments, and they leave. Will somebody come after them? They arrive at that house of blue light. Then they go to the Mardi Gras to see even stranger sights. We see a New Orleans cemetery (people are buried in vaults). The picture drags on as they pass around a bottle. The scenes suggest intoxication. They leave the next morning. \\"We blew it.\\" Then there is an end to their journey due to an accidental meeting with a pick-up truck. [Do you find this a credible ending?]    This film was a popular success due to its unusual story and the many songs, which masked a poor story. Today it is not worth watching. Could it be called \\"The Days of the Living Dead\\"?
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you've seen doctor horrible online and you liked it at all, then you'll love the DVD if only because of commentary the musical. If you haven't seen it already then you'll love it and you'll get commentary the musical too. Definitely worth it if you've ever seen Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, or Felicia Day in any of their other roles.
1582701709|2.0|Too fancy design and void of real contents. It tries to convince you that the power to get what you want in life relies solely in seeing it with your mind. It doesn't mention real, hard work at all - what is even worse, it laughs at the idea of the slightest work done in the direction of your dreams. It uses Quantum Mechanics theory to support its arguments in an irresponsible custom, as it applies them totally out of context. \\"Proofs\\" of the power of the Secret (capital letter, sic) are just the mention of very dubious facts in the life of persons who have their web site on the internet.<br /><br />This book has at the same time a good speech about modeling one's mind for a better view of the world. The Secret's best asset is a poetical view of the world, but reveals no secret at all, other than a healthy state of mind.<br /><br />Good for people who won't ever do (less want) manual labour, or engage in long projects with a high dose of frustration, or bosses with a solid social network of contacts to assign the heavy tasks to them. A bad buy for more down-to-earth people who know that in the attaining of any goal *some* kind of work is involved.
B000V674CU|5.0|John Mayall has had a long history of Brit Blues and skirted the edges of jazz many times.  On this album he brings the two genres together with a great lineup of performers:  Mayall: harmonica, guitar and piano  Blue Mitchell: Trumpet  Clifford Solomon and Ernie Watts: Sax  Ron Selico: Percussion  Freddy Robinson: Guitar  and the best for last...Larry Taylor: Bass.      I plead guilty to being a bassist.  Taylor is the best in my book and he demonstrates it on this album.  Along with Ron Selico they provide an unshakable foundation for the rest of the performers.  Taylor's adaptability to many different genres is demonstrated here as he and Mayall slide from the traditional I-IV-V blues patterns to almost free-form jazz.      Each track has its own \\"personality\\" as is the case with most of Mayall's albums.  Country Road starts with a blues format that combines the British and Chicago styles.  Mess Around moves a little closer to R&B and reminds me of Junior Wells Messin' With the Kid.  Good Times Boogie's awesome bass line and guitar solo jump right into a jazz format.  Change Your Ways has a watermelon flavor;  Dry Throat starts out as a slow blues piece but the horns add a definite jazz sound.  Mayall blows his brains out with Exercise in C for Harmonica with harp and \\"mouth percussion\\" that made Room to Move so interesting and Taylor's bass solo shows off his generally under-rated virtuosity in a pure jazz piece.  Finally, Got to be This Way begins with Mayall's signature style of the blues, then adds a jazz component with the horn, guitar and bass solos.    Considering that this album was recorded in 1972, it amazes me with the \\"maturity\\" of the music it contains.  If you're a traditional 12-bar blues fan, you might not enjoy it as much as some of Mayall's other albums.  But if you enjoy great music and performance by some of the best non-mainstream musicians in these genres, then you'll probably love it as much as I do.
0061020710|4.0|It's a good read, but it's not quite as wonderful as Terry Pratchett's later books.  I guess he just hadn't quite settled in his niche yet.
1401207138|5.0|I heard about this novel from a couple of coworkers and heard that a movie would be coming out. So I went online to review some prices and read that i could get it for less than 60 which was a great deal. I finished Watchmen in about 3 days and i recomend to anyone who loves mystery/crime, action, and humor. I can not wait to see the movie and i hope it is as good as the novel
B001N26GFM|5.0|After I read the novel by John Boyne and heard the news that a movie adaption was currently in theatres, I was slightly scared that the film would be too extreme and dramatic for me, because I don't do well at all with films that scare me or make me sad- and thinking about the plot of the book, I knew watching a movie version would tear me to pieces.  But, as it happened, my school went on a field trip to see the movie a few weeks after I finished the book, and I ended up having to watch the whole movie through and write a report comparing and contrasting it from the novel. And guess what?- I sobbed like a baby in front of all my friends.  Although the last parts of the movie are very sad and deeply patronizing, it is overall a very good adaption of the book that caused so much controversy among young readers like me(I'm 15 by the way).
0805047905|4.0|I felt compelled to write a review after reading many of the reviews by adults who don't get it.  All I have to say is, it's not whether you get it, it's whether the kids do.  And every kid that I know including those  in my 3 year olds class love it and that is all that matters. It says something to them & why should we adults argue about a book that kids love.  And oh! What about the fact that they show an interest in a book!  Review an adult book that is for adults.
0060557818|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I have read a couple of books by Gaiman this one was by far his most enjoyable. He seems to write about things that are just beyond our perceptions. I wish that he would have gone into more detail about these people who have slipped between the cracks...<br /><br />Anyways I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to friends.
0385340990|4.0|The silly title initially put me off. Who wants to read about Potato Peel Pies, and why on earth would they have their own society? But this book, told in letter form, is so charming and engaging right from the start, that it would be a reader with a very sour nature who wasn't taken by the story.<br /><br />The book takes place in London and on Guernsey after World War II, with a famous writer being drawn into the small island dramas via letters from its residents. The horrors that the people on Guernsey suffered during the German occupation are explored, as well as human kindness and love.<br /><br />This is not a book that is particularly complex or challenging. When my book club discussed it, there was very little dissent, which doesn't make for a very exciting book club meeting. But the letter format makes this a quick read, something great for a plane trip or when you're feeling too busy to commit to a more complicated work.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. By the time you understand the title, you'll be completely fascinated with the entire novel.
B00005JPO1|5.0|With a Series of films so iconic as the INDIANA JONES series, it would have been too easy to have made this into a colossal turkey. But thanfully, with the original stars, Ray Winstone and some superb additions to the cast, this has turned out very well.The FX augment the story ( as you can see in the extras in Disc 2). I wound up buying two copies of the Double disc edition, one from BEST BUY which has the Crystal skull mounted on a model form in a gift box, and of course I have not opened it... yeah I know, very geeky. But I got the second copy from Amazon and   watched it.  THE DVD: Pretty well perfect, except that disc one has no commentary. Disc two has some promo for the absurd game \\"Lego Indiana Jones\\". There is a lot of Detail in the extras , and it shows the way the film was made, brilliant material.

B0018AVNKC|4.0|\\"Coraline\\" is a frighteningly beautiful fantasy, filled to the brim with delightfully bizarre visuals and one-of-a-kind characters. Some may say that it's too dark for young children, and indeed, it is, in essence, a family-friendly horror movie. But I suspect that most children will find it more dazzling than scary; through the painstaking but rewarding process of stop-motion animation, writer/director Henry Selick retains the essence of the original novel by Neil Gaiman, crafting a tale that's just creepy enough to thrill audiences without sending them running out of the theater. It's also presented in 3-D, although the process isn't as impressive as you might think it is. I stared at the screen through a pair of special glasses, and yet I never flinched or covered my eyes when something came at me from off the screen. No matter--dimension isn't important as long as a fun story is being told.    With \\"Coraline,\\" we're once again invited to explore an alternate world hidden amongst our own, specifically within the walls of a house (Gaiman has tackled this subject before with films like \\"Mirrormask\\" and stories like \\"The Wolves in the Walls\\"). In this case, the alternate world is a lot like ours, except it's better. That's exactly why it appeals to Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning), an adventurous young girl leading a very dull life. Her parents (voiced by Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) are too busy writing articles for a gardening catalogue to take any notice of her. She's surrounded by eccentric but boring neighbors in her new home, which was once a Victorian house but is now an apartment complex. There's nothing worth exploring inside or outside. Worst of all, she never feels as if anyone is listening to what she's saying. Maybe it would help if they didn't keep calling her Caroline.    Then she discovers a small door hidden behind a wall of an old parlor, a door that covers a tube-like portal leading to the alternate version of our world. Things are so much more interesting there, including the people, who are reflections of the people in Coraline's world. There's one small physical difference: They all have black buttons instead of eyes. When we first see Coraline's Other Mother (also voiced by Teri Hatcher), we immediately sense that something sinister lurks behind that vacant, artificial stare; she's a little too sweet-natured, a little too accommodating. It's as if she wants Coraline to stay in this alternate world forever, not as a daughter, but as a prized possession. Coraline's suspicions are confirmed when the Other Mother hands her a box containing two black buttons, a spool of thread, and a needle.    There comes a point when Coraline must not only rescue her real parents, who have been kidnapped, but also free the souls of three dead children, who have been imprisoned in the alternate world for who knows how long. With the help of a special green stone, Coraline will play a game with the Other Mother, a hide-and-go-seek game, a finding-things game. If she loses ... well, let's just say that losing won't be a good thing for her.    Another fitting way to describe this film would be to call it a Good vs. Evil fable, where a wise but non-complacent hero battles it out with a malevolent force. Coraline is daring, but she certainly isn't fearless, which only makes her that much more relatable as a character. She even has to be helped at specific points, as seen when the local cat appears in the alternate world; we quickly learn that, once in this world, he has the ability to speak like a human, specifically in the voice of Keith David. (Is it the independent nature of cats that inspired Gaiman to make this character a bit haughty?)    As with any good fantasy, \\"Coraline\\" features a number of side characters, each with a unique personality quirk. Coraline's downstairs neighbors are Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (voiced by Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French), former actresses who speak as if they were trying to be heard in the balcony section. I don't know whether or not it's unfortunate that we only see their Other selves giving a performance (to an audience primarily made up of Scottish terriers). Her upstairs neighbor is Mr. Bobinsky (voiced by Ian McShane), an eccentric circus performer who gets from point A to point B using only acrobatic poses. He claims to have a troupe of mice training for their next performance, although the only mice we see belong to the Other Mr. Bobinsky; the show they put on for Coraline is one of the film's best scenes.    Finally, there's Wybie Lovat (voiced by Robert Bailey, Jr.), a boy not much older than Coraline. He's awkward and timid, always hunched over, always sneaking up on Coraline, forbidden from entering the apartment complex because of his grandmother. This character was not in Gaiman's novel, and truth be told, I'm not sure he was needed for the film. He and Coraline have a few interesting scenes together, but there's always the sense that the story would have been just fine without him. It certainly was when Gaiman wrote it. Be that as it may, \\"Coraline\\" is still a fantastic explosion of creativity, a haunting, vibrant fantasy teeming with visual goodies. It's a dark film--not unpleasantly dark, but dark nevertheless. It works in much the same way as a bedtime story, many of which hint at the possibility of bad things happening. You know your children better than I do, but keep in mind that many are more fascinated by the macabre than by the mundane.
141690977X|1.0|I know this book has a billion reviews but I thought I'd do my part to add to the one star reviews as a public service, especially since the movie is coming out. Mind you, one star only because you can't choose zero.     My friend instructed me to borrow her copy of this book. At the time I was a self conscious and lonely single woman and thought it might help me learn what I'm doing wrong. Even though I was already annoyed and insulted at the title, I read it.     Many have made good points so I won't be a broken record. I just want to share that I met a guy a couple years ago. While he did email me first, he was very slow to respond to me after that. If I listened to this dumb book I wouldn't be married to this wonderful but very shy guy who constantly tells me how lucky he feels to be with me.    I guess in Gregg's world men aren't allowed to be shy, they all have to be giant A--holes like him.

B001FSDOZO|3.0|As one of the few current rock bands that can still sell CDs in large quantities, Nickelback can pretty much release anything and it will top the album charts. Thus we get 'Dark Horse', a collection of very commercial rock anthems and over-the-top power ballads. But then, that pretty much describes every Nickelback album.<br /><br />What makes this one stand out is its precision mix and painfully cheesy choruses, courtesy of veteran cheese whiz Mutt Lange, brought in to perform his production mastery on an already-overproduced band.<br /><br />A few good tracks stand out (the excellent first single \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\") and the rockers \\"Burn It To the Ground\\" and \\"Next Go Round\\"), but otherwise we get schlock like \\"Never Gonna Be Alone\\" (probably a future single) and absolute crap like \\"S.E.X\\", which at minimum should have been relegated to a future b-sides collection.<br /><br />Chad Kroeger does know how to write good riffs, and definitely knows what sells, but with titles like \\"I'd Come for You\\" and \\"Something in Your Mouth\\", it's obvious they're often more preoccupied with misogynistic lyrics and double entendre than with making a really good album.<br /><br />Their previous LP ('All the Right Reasons') will probably go down as their classic, while 'Dark Horse' will be seen as its mediocre, though quite popular, follow-up. Yes they are rock stars, but it has yet to be proven whether or not they are a band for the ages.

I had the original album back in the late sixties and would dream along with it as a high school student. Since then I've purchased the CD and later the mpg3 collection. Like an old friend that has survived the test of time (over 40 years now). Lascio Ch'io Piango has become my favorite \\"singing in the shower song\\" after endlessly replaying her rendition. Beau Soir opened my soul to the beauties of Debussy. Pavane puts me into instant reverie. Quite romanticism, impressionism... qualities semingly absent in today's world, but much needed.

0671042858|4.0|A pleasant surprise from Stephen King.<br /><br />For years, I had not worried about this being the only Stephen King book that I hadn't read. Many people said that it really wasn't a great book and several said that they had started it but never finished it.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't know what the problem was. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a gripping story about a little girl who is lost in the woods. It narrates the trials and tribulations of her journey and struggle to survive on her own in a seemingly unending wilderness. During this we are shown the incredible strength of her character even as she falls deeper and deeper into madness. Along her journey, she encounters many pitfalls and dangers along with a brush with the malevolent supernatural.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining story and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|This case is very bulky. Seems to be durable material, and I like that it has a strap, something I have not seen in other cases. However, the red dot that slides for \\"easy\\" access is not so easy. I'd call it sticky access.   Other than the hanging strap, there is NO reason to buy this. I recently found a slimmer design at BabiesRUS that is made by Huggies and has a flap in the center to access wipes. This Skip Hop case opens to one side and is hard to grab the wipes out.     I would like to edit my review to be only one star. After one week inside the case, my wipes were dried out. This is not acceptable.
0064407667|3.0|Finished reading this recently and I have mixed feelings. While I found it to be an entertaining and quick read, I am unsure about its appropriatness for its target audience. While I have absolutely no issue with the darker subject matter presented, I do have issues with the way in which some of these dark ideas are developed. Olaf is a wonderfully evil and looney character, we get that pretty clearly in the book as well as the theme that he will stoop to any level to attempt to get the childrens' inheritance. What I disagree with is that a lot of what Olaf and his cohorts do is unnecessary in a book aimed at children. They are just as evil without the drinking and without Olaf being quite so threatening and physically abusive. I just think that it was a bit harsh for young children. Reading (especially at that age) should be an enjoyable escape, not an uncomfortable experience.    But then again, maybe I'm way off base here. I don't know.
B000002UDB|5.0|Magical Mystery Tour by The Beatles was a horrible movie but the soundtrack is absolutely delightful!

I highly recommend this strange but catchy album.
0743437497|5.0|The Shining is a complex tale combining the supernatural elements of a haunted hotel with the paranormal powers of a boy with the ability to shine and an intense character study of a man driven deeper and deeper into madness.    Laced throughout with an undercurrent of tension, the story moves us quickly on a roller-coaster ride of events that lead to an intense, action-packed conclusion.    The main story revolves around a man and his family who are trying to regroup their lives and take one last chance at attaining some stability. Jack Torrance has had a long history of drinking and rage issues that have threatened to tear his family apart and have recently lost him a prestigious teaching position. Taking the job as the winter care-taker of the closed for the season Overlook Hotel seems like the perfect way to re-bond with his family and to write his novel. But the hotel has other plans. Plans that send Jack spiraling doward deeper and deeper into insanity.    In a previous review, I mentioned that Salem's Lot is my favorite King novel. I continue to stand by that statement even as I say that The Shining is one of his better written novels. The depth of the story and richness of his description in this novel are at the top of his game.    Truly a great novel that I highly recommend.
B000002UAC|5.0|With the Beatles was The Beatles second album. This cd has a lot of covers but the band did a fantastic job with songs like Money, You Really Got a Hold On Me, and Please Mr. Postman. You get some Beatles penned tunes as well like Don't Bother Me, All My Loving, and It Won't Be Long. Great cd, I highly recommend it!
0452257743|4.0|Roadwork    This is my lowest rated King book so far. Not to say that it is a bad book or that I would discourage anyone from reading it, but it's definitely not on par with the majority of King's other works.    As usual, character development is top notch and the plot itself has no real problems. My problem with the book is that it really takes forever to get anywhere. The basic theory of the plot is that we see a man's descent into madness as everything that he has worked his entire life for is being taken away from him. He systematically sets out to destroy anything that he has left and tries to find a way to exact some sort of vengeance against the powers that be who have ruined his existence.    I have no problem with this storyline except that the way that it plays out, a lot of it is a rehash of what happens to the mind of Jack Torrance in The Shining. It's not nearly as nutty as The Shining, nor do we have the supernatural overtones in Roadwork, but I just got the general impression that I'd experienced the feel of the novel somewhere else.    Anyway, I don't want to condemn this story in any way. The main character is compelling and endearing in his way and the novel definitely has some strong moments here and there, I just felt that it took a little to long to get to some of them.    The Running Man    It's the future and Ben Richards journeys to the Network Games Building to apply for a job as a contestant in order to supply the money to feed his family and provide medicine for his sick infant daughter. The job he gets ends up being more than both he and the Network bargained for!    The Running Man is a fairly well written tale set in the now not too distant future. Interestingly enough, the country is riveted to their free-vees in order to watch what is in essence nothing more than an unending stream of reality television game shows. It makes me wonder if Mark Burnett based some of his ideas upon this book and the (sort of) related movie.    Once Richards has moved through the application process, the action moves along at a pretty brisk pace and there are some really nice elements of storytelling apparent throughout. My only complaint is that King tries a little too hard with creating the future setting and goes overboard with the names and slogans for things that he uses in his setting. At times, especially during the beginning of the book, it's a bit cheesy and distracting.    The Long Walk    The Long Walk is another of Stephen King's novels written as Richard Bachman. In the traditional style of his Bachman writings, it is much more raw than most of his other writing. I enjoy the change in style as it lends even more realism to his writing and makes the story even more intense.    The Long Walk isn't really a horror tale so much as it is a tale of friendships formed under dire circumstances. We see up close how this interpersonal relationships grow and dissolve and reform again with great frequency throughout the race. It is also about the strength of the human spirit. When pushed to its limits, the human mind continues to push the body on into realms never deemed possible by the rational mind.    The story is a good one, if a little predictable, and even though it moves along at a slower pace than some, it's almost like we are right there with the walkers as follow-along spectators. Rich in detail and character, the slow pace doesn't make you want to stop reading, if anything, it enhances the tension.    I truly enjoyed rereading this novel and plan on visiting it again in the future.     Rage    One of King's earliest works, Rage wasn't published until he had established himself and when it was, it was published under the author name Richard Bachman. This novel is definitely raw in many aspects, but I think that is what helps to give it its charm.    The story centers on a student who kills his teacher in front of his class and holds the class hostage for most of the day. He and the class then discuss a variety of issues, but the main conversation revolves around what has led him to this. King's narrative and character development really help to pull the reader into the story and there is enough tension to help keep things moving when it starts to seem that it's going to be dull.    Not the most action packed or scary of King's novels, but still manages to be a page turner. I rank it up with the top of his novels from the story-telling aspect of this novel alone.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This action drama is suspenseful enough to hold the viewer's attention.  The plot is implausible, but it is easy to follow, has unexpected twists and is not predictable.  The positive qualities of this film far out weigh the flaws.  Good music, colorful characters, and interesting scenery provide a plus.  Tom Cruise plays the rarest of all creatures, a sociopath with a work ethic.  The chemistry between the two main characters is believable and fascinating.  Several murders occur, but the audience is spared graphic violence.  The comic relief offers some laugh out loud entertainment and works with the plot quite nicely.
B00006ADFL|5.0|This is the film where Peter Jackson really showed he had \\"arrived\\". An astonishingly assured and original film based on a notorious New Zealand murder case from the 1950s. A very young Kate Winslet is superb and so is Melanie Lynskey as her impressionable friend. Easily the best New Zealand film ever made.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Nothing really special to say.  Works like a charm, exactly the same as the original battery.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|I enjoyed this album because of the  nnovative \\"strive\\" from Paul Mccartney. Many of the songs are either melodic , or straight ahead  rockers.In particular , \\"Nothing to much out of sight\\" ,\\"Highway\\" and \\"Light from your lighthouse\\".\\"Sing the changes\\" is a great ,uplifting tuneful hymn. \\"Two magpies\\" is another great tune.Much of this album is experimental recalling \\"The White Album\\" and other experimental Beatle's work. The music leads one to enter another sonic world.<br />Great effort! -Frank Degifico
0385508417|4.0|Or holiday fluff?<br />I couldn't decide between the two, but since I'm a great fan of John Grisham's courtroom novels, I thought I'd be nice to him.<br /><br />Skipping Christmas is basically a modernised version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. It is cleverly done. The twists in the plot are funny. It does make you think for at least 5 minutes.<br /><br />I have seen Dickens rehashed badly too many times before. Fortunately this is a far better effort than those.<br /><br />If you have a few hours to spare, this is a good way to be thoroughly entertained. Not Tolstoy, but well above average.<br /><br />Merry Christmas at any time of year!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Movie is great and it only took or should i say we receved the movie 2 days before it was to get to us thanks
0440234743|5.0|I heard this was the first novel John Grisham wrote after he became a Christian (I could be mistaken). I was curious how his new faith might affect his writing.     From a Christian point of view, Grisham has demonstrated  what it means to be a gifted writer instilling parts of his faith into literature without being trite, simplistic, obvious, boorish, or dull. This is in contrast to many Christian novelists who are religious first but are really second/third rate writers.    From a reader's point of view, virtually everything I enjoyed about Grisham was there. The courtroom, the characterizations, the plot. This is a Grisham legal thriller that ranks with his best.    Thoroughly recommended for fans of Grisham, legal thrillers, and especially for Christians who think that Left Behind is the pinnacle of Christian writing (they're wrong!)
B000HB3QRG|5.0|The shocking part is no one has reviewed this LP! Released in 1979 on the dark horse lable. This LP is just one of the many sides that make up the unknown mystery. That make the man George Harrison. Offten overlooked when he was with the beatles. Forgotten by the Rock world years later. Maybe they just never understood him. This LP is filled with little gems that show. the experimental side of George., reaching into his soul to bring out masters of music. 10 full length tracks, Hard to pick a song I disliked on this LP.<br /><br />1) Love comes to everyone<br />2) Not guilty<br />3) Here come the moon<br />4) Soft-hearted hana<br />5) Blow away<br />6) Faster<br />7) Dark sweet lady<br />8) Your love is forever<br />9) Soft touch<br />10) If you believe
B00139W3NE|1.0|This review is for those who hated the books but thought the concept behind it was good. If you were hoping if the story was taking through a different filter it might be good you will be disappointed. This movie was just as big of pile of rubbish as the book, if not more so. I actually lasted longer in the book than the movie.
B0017HPHBM|3.0|It's a good movie but \\"The Dark Night\\" is much better.  Not saying that this wasn't good but I guess that I got spoiled watching this after \\"The Dark Night\\"
B000WEMH3C|3.0|This cover wasn't very expensive and now we know why....you get what you pay for!  We didn't even have it six months and it's time for another.  I will order one more durable the next time.  The handle of the BBQ tore through from the top.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I really liked this movie.  A lot of people had a problem with this movie on the way that it was filmed but I think that it adds a lot to the whole feel of it.  It'll be a good franchise if they build on it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Anyone shopping for a second remote for their PS3 should defintely purchase one...and purcahse it from Amazon.com.  The deal is fantastic and being that your PS3 only comes with one remote, buy a second one to either challenge your friends at a 2 player game or use one remote while you charge your other one!
B000028U0Y|5.0|One of the greates Live disks that I have hear in a long time.  Pick it up if you like his music.
B001P9KR8U|2.0|The film starts off well enough, when they were kids in the slums.  In particular were some scenes on an Indian train that reminded me of some scenes in Gandhi.  Seeing the evil people using kids to beg on the street really hit home with me, it's everywhere in China.  And it's sick.  There were also some good, funny moments during the interrogation scenes when Jamal stood up to his tormenters.    But I don't think the romance worked at all.  The relationship with his brother didn't feel real at all either, it felt very tacked on.  And I found it hard to care about the main character, especially because he spends half his screen time mute, staring into space.    Will he win the money and the girl or lose both.  I didn't care at all one way or the other.  I didn't find much fun in the film, and there's absolutely nothing there to think about.    It really is the worst Oscars ever.
B0017I1FNK|4.0|This is classic of Harris folk-country tunes. Great selection of songs from Harris written to Tracy Chapman and Merle Haggard. As usual, the musicians are superb in their melting with Harris' voice. Some great vocals by Miller, Parton, and Starling make this a reverent beauty.
1563894696|2.0|I really wanted to like this one.  Loeb and Sale get a lot of things right, not least of which is the beautiful, moody, pitch-perfect art (the best visual service anyone's done for the Batman, for my money).  The story has all the elements for a great crime drama but they just don't come together.  The story moves so fast that there's little to no time for characterization.  Batman barely says anything in the entire book that isn't either straight-ahead event narration or phoned-in \\"justice for my parents etc etc...\\" filler.  He's hardly even an agent of change for the plot; most of his time is spent on brief and too-familiar jaunts with familiar villains who seem to appear only out of obligation, or to hide the fact that Batman has almost nothing to do with the plot.  They pull the same stunts they always do (why are crop dusters so plentiful anywhere near a major metropolitan city?) and waste a lot of time that could otherwise have been spent on an interesting murder plot.    Some of this can be chalked up to misdirection, which is surely a good ingredient in any mystery, but the bizarre, illogical, and unmotivated actions taken by quite a few of the characters don't get any illumination in the final reveal.  If anything, the final answer asks for even more leaps of faith and acceptance of unlikely and unpoetic coincidence.  It feels like a noir flick where you only get half of the \\"parlor scene\\" at the end.  The closer you examine it the sloppier the whole story proves to be.  There's real potential in the build-up, but the payoff just doesn't live up to it.    After reading this, it's not too hard to see some parallels with the story problems in \\"Heroes\\" (which Loeb also had a hand in, until recently).  Too much emphasis on creating moment-to-moment (chapter-to-chapter, episode-to-episode) impact, with no consideration on how those moments have to hang together and create a unified story.    But I do have to say, and I just about never say this, The Long Halloween is probably worth a flip through on the strength of the art alone.
B000M343BM|5.0|Not much more needs to be said about Major League.It's one of the best baseball movies ever with very memorable characters and funny lines.The story is familiar by now, a group of cast offs and misfits are brought together by an owner betting they'll be so bad that she can move the franchise out of Cleveland to sunny Florida.Things start out bad but soon turn as they come together gradually over an exciting season to take the pennant from the defending champion Yankees.I highly recommend Major League for baseball fans!
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Christian Bale is by far the best Bat Man. Crime fighting is always a hit for me, and with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, two of the finest actors in film today, this movie gets high marks all round.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The film is a masterpiece with great performances by Bale and Ledger.  The Blu-ray version has excellent PQ and AQ,it is a must own.  Before I bought the Blu-ray version I rented the DVD version and I wasn't impressed with the PQ.I have to say the DVD version is one of the worst transfers I have ever seen,I've seen VCD's with better PQ.On my HDTV the color and tint were off and it has major moire,it might be ok for a SDTV but if you have an HDTV then the Blu-ray version is a no-brainer.

B00004T9VY|3.0|First off - the music itself is beautiful, absolutely love the album.    I've been a Cat Stevens fan for many years and enjoy getting the best version of the music when options are available. In ~2000 when I got the 'Best Of' collection and later this album, I sensed something not quite right with the remastering - it sounded crystal clear but harsh and on a good sound system, very fatiguing.  More recently I got a copy of the old 1988 Mobile Fidelity remaster CD and compared the two.    Big difference folks!  I think on an average sound system / car / iPod, this CD can sound quite good since it emphasizes the treble and adds some 'zing' to the music.  But on a good full-range sound system, this album sounds like how an oversharpened picture looks; harsh and annoying, lacking the subtlety which to me is a large part of the beauty in Stevens' music.    To make matters worse, when I import the WAV file into Adobe Audition, I see there are a number of clipped samples; objective signs of compression and casualty of the loudness wars.    Bottom line: This CD sounds okay, and may be preferable on lower end sound systems.  The more discerning fan / collector / audiophile should spend the extra bucks (can be quite expensive unfortunately) to get the superior Mobile Fidelity release.

B000002MUN|5.0|I have been a devoted to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers since I've been thirteen years old.I've always love their entire catalog of songs and have nothing but the highest of praise for every single member that has ever been lucky enough to live the dream and become the best rock and roll band period.My love and respect to them is undying and am proud to be a fan of theirs.And it all started with this Album Wildflowers.I can't even stress to you more how magical this album is and I remember first hearing it's first single when it first came out and instantly loving it and wanting to here more.And soon after owning the Album and listening to it over,and over,and over,and over.Until I played so much the tape broke,so I went and bought another copy.<br /><br />Now,with this Album introduced to the Band is For Tom try a style of music and storytelling that was unlike the him or the Heartbreakers and essentially and for all intents and purposes a Solo Album simular to his 1988 Album Full Moon Fever.However,like the three previous Album lead Guitar Mike Campbell have played on the Tom Petty Solo Albums and Heartbreakers ones as well.The band regrouped after a hard and difficult time with their previous Album Into The Great Wide Open which is widely consider the less responded Albums.The sessions were at first marred by animosity by a few members by Tom's sparatic use of them in recent years in the recording studio.Drummer Stan Lynch that has been with the Heartbreakers since 1977 was fired by Tom after repeated complaints about the new material of Wildflowers and making recordings sound sub par either purposely or by designed.A new drummer was found and the rest is an musical odessy of imagination,artistic peaks and an most intimate and soul satisifying musical experiences I promise you (especially if you're a Fan already) that you will experience.<br /><br />This Album is an enigma more than any previous ones before it.Because of the fact is that you can't define or put a theme that almost always are found like in other Albums Tom Petty or others.And I believe the the aforementioned Name-Wildflowers really makes you feel good.You'll think about past loves of family or great times in your life.There are songs that are pure Rock and Roll at it's finest like the song You Wreck Me Baby.But the most hard hitting pure coolness Rock song I've ever heard is Little Honey Bee.Now,listen to that song and don't tell me that Tom Petty is the most Coolest People of all time.But I have to warn you:If you're alone drunk listening to the Album later on that will literally break you down emotionally that you'll begin to tear up and go on the most introspective songs I've ever heard.One all these years later affects me so much that drunk or sober listening to it I swear with exageration speaks directly to my Soul like that song was written in a way just for me that song being-It's hard to find a Friend.It's such a powerful song I don't care who you are when you listen to this song it feels such a powerful emotion from it that afterwards you feel really good like your soul has been scrubbed clean.<br /><br />I could keep going with this Review,I could write more about this fantastic Album and my great memories I've had listening to it throughout good and bad times of my life.But the magic of this Album is discovering for yourself about what it means to you.And I don't care if you like Rock,Alternative,Rap,Country or even Metal.If you truely love listening to excellent Music do yourself a favor to get this Album.I could not recommend this Album highly enough.Please get it and enjoy the results of what happens when a group of increadable Musicians come together and create an Album of heart felt,honest and inspired Art in the spoken word ever made.This Album has no equal and will never have one.ost always are found like in other Albums Tom Petty or others.And I believe the the aforementioned Name-Wildflowers really makes you feel good.You'll think about past loves of family or great times in your life.There are songs that are pure Rock and Roll at it's finest like the song You Wreck Me Baby.But the most hard hitting pure coolness Rock song I've ever heard is Little Honey Bee.Now,listen to that song and don't tell me that Tom Petty is the most Coolest People of all time.But I have to warn you:If you're alone drunk listening to the Album later on that will literally break you down emotionally that you'll begin to tear up and go on the most introspective songs I've ever heard.One all these years later affects me so much that drunk or sober listening to it I swear with exageration speaks directly to my Soul like that song was written in a way just for me that song being-It's hard to find a Friend.It's such a powerful song I don't care who you are when you listen to this song it feels such a powerful emotion from it that afterwards you feel really good like your soul has been scrubbed clean.

B0013FSL3E|3.0|A trash compactor falls in love with a laser-armed plant incubator.  Gifted animation with everything to offer except really good writing.  A pleasant divertissement.  A trivial pursuit.  A bon-bon, or apertif.  A tidbit with a ham-handed moral.  I'd watch it again though.
B000VLE3IS|3.0|The DVD is worth the price alone.  Vintage cuts are all positively first rate, especially Immigrant song, In My Time of Dying, and Kashmir.  The CD is NOT that different in sound as the remastered studio albums.  Still sounds flat, little impact.  Anyone expecting a modern recording will be sorely disappointed because it simply is not this.  The music itself, stands alone as fabulous as always, just don't expect it to sound very much better than what has been around for years - it just does not have that fullness, striking, sonic perfection of today's recording techniques.

159448385X|5.0|Very few publications are worth five stars.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\"  deserves much praise which it received from our book club.  Hosseini has progressed from the tale of two young boys in \\"The Kite Runner\\" to produce, with compelling insight, a story of three women from different generations who endure hardship and oppression in Afghanistan. A master craftsman, Hosseini's work is skillfully structured and lyrically worded.  Highly recommended.
B001ESYAJY|5.0|Working without the breadth of thematic material afforded by the superb storyline of Casino Royale, David Arnold has nonetheless crafted a melodic, colorful, and pulsating score that is a very worthy follow up to his incredible score for Casino Royale.  Again, if you're looking for the great Monty Norman theme to blare out repeatedly, then get a Bond's Greatest Hits cd; as with CR, Arnold has woven the theme through the fabric of the score which makes it that much more exciting when it appears.  The subtle re-appearances of the beautiful but almost tragic Vesper theme and the sweeping CR love theme are reminders that Quantum is a film not only of revenge but also memories.  With all due respect to the Bourne films, which all Bond fans must thank the re-direction of the series to what Ian Fleming originally intended, when it comes to a comparison of the scores, there is no comparison.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|I have listened to this album a hundred times and it always seems fresh and interesting. I always seem to hear something new with each listen. This is the first real experimental album that Simon made using musicians from Africa (\\"Rhythm Of The Saints\\" follows in this mode with South American personnel). The album is absolutely stunningly brilliant from every conceivalble aspect: lyrics,tone,instrumentation,vocals you name it it hasn't aged a day. Listen to it (but not just once).

B0000AKY7R|5.0|When I was in my early teens, my old guitar teacher exposed me to this album. I was overwhelmed! Two guitar shrieking for joy and speaking delicate poetry! The souls of the musicians soaring through the heavens, and inviting all to join them and share the beauty they beheld.<br /><br />Much guitar playing degenerated into a mere show of chops. This was followed by a rebelling against the intellectualized playing into a sloppy nilism. Few realize the value of true beauty in music.<br /><br />There's enough ugliness in the world. Perhaps we should look to beautiful music like this to realign our perceptions - and polish the mirrors of our souls.

I highly recommend it to all who enjoy the beautiful Heavenly voice of this super talented singer! You will float among the clouds as you hear her singing these lovely songs!

B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Leonard Maltin recommended it and from the minute I saw the clips I wanted to see it.  I felt the same way about \\"The Remains of the Day\\" back in the 90's and that film turned out to be excellent.  Instead of renting Vicky Chr... I decided to buy it sight unseen which I don't take lightly being unemployed.  That mistake cost me $22.    Twenty minutes into Woody Allen's latest had me asking \\"when is it going to get good?\\"  I was asking myself that all the way to the end.  I usually like \\"slice of life\\" films such as the aforementioned \\"Remains of the Day\\" or \\"Un Coeur en Hiver\\". Those films have scenes that you want to see again such as when Emma Thompson wants to know what kind of book Anthony Hopkins is reading and backs him into a corner.  In VCB there's not one scene I want to see again and the only couple who have any chemistry together is the male lead and his ex-wife, Penelope Cruz, and that's only when they're not fighting.    I gave this film two stars.  I would have given it 2.5 if it were possible.  It would be an OK rental but I don't recommend buying it.  Sorry Amazon.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|The music is a complicated, layered, gorgeous affair. The mumbled vocals get annoying and just get in the way, however.  After the first two listens I got the impression that they had lots of great musical ideas, but nothing lyrically to say.  Maybe it would have been better as an instrumental.
B000NA28IE|5.0|I saw this movie a few weeks ago after I read the first book again, and yes I was disappointed by the smallest important details that they found necessary to change for absolutely no reason whatsoever, but the acting and picture of this movie made up for it!!! I'm not someone who puts a movie on his hit list because it's not like the book, cause I've experienced this before with \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\\" This movie cut important characters out of the book that brought tears to my eyes when they changed it. Brom's death, however, was AMAZING. I cry everytime I see that part. Some parts in this movie that they changed I loved, like the appearance of Brom is much more believable and awesome than that of him in the book. I had trouble picturing an old geezer whooping but with a sword (a cane, maybe). This Brom made more sense and fit the character more.    The sad part, though, is the fact that they CAN'T make the sequel until they remake the first one. The reason is because they cut and changed so many characters and details out that it's impossible to create the second one. I don't know how long it will take for Christopher Paolini to trust producers with the story again, but I pray that he finds a decent producer and director to create this story EFFECTIVELY in movie form.    If you've read the book and are afraid to see the movie because people say it \\"sucks,\\" don't listen to them. I heard from everyone that this movie sucked majorly, but when I saw the movie I was amazed by how good it actually was. From what I heard I expected overacting and cheesy scenes. The only incredibly cheesy scene was when Saphira flew into the sky a baby dragon (she's so CUTE as a hatchling) and came down a full-grown dragon. I was just like \\"Oh no they didn't!\\"    If you have read the book, you may or may not like this movie, depending on how upset you get when a movie is unlike the book. I recommend for you to rent this movie if you have read the book because peoples views willbe different on this matter. If you have NOT read the book, you will love this movie. If you disregard the changes they made from the initial storyline (the book)then I can't think of any bad parts of this movie.    P.S. Durza is AMAZING!!! The person they chose is perfect for the part.
B000001GGV|5.0|Does anyone else play with greater delicacy, clarity and precision? Pogorelich's abilities are astounding. His digressions from the norm make you hear the music again, revive your interest and give new insights you never had before. His other recordings are just as fine. If this is controversial, I'll take it. He's taken me deeper into the music. For those who don't know Scarlatti, you don't know what you're missing. Find out.
1416550518|3.0|I enjoy stories where reminiscence is involved, no different for this book.  I liked the character Grace, it was someone who had lived a long, and, for awhile, an interesting life.  I do disagree that the book was 'slow' (as others had indicated).  I found it a good read.  Several things that bothered me about the story?<br /><br />1. What was in that Lock-Box that Hannah had left Grace?  I want details! (Granted it was enough to enable her to get a PHD - through the Depression, no-less!  It must have been plenty!)<br /><br />2. I wish that Ms. Morton would have dwelled a little on her 'career' outside of service!<br /><br />Again, for me, those were the two items that proved disturbing.  Other than that, a good story!<br /><br />I also agree that this story should receive cinematic consideration (translation:  make it into a movie!)  My rating: 3 stars!
B001F290E4|3.0|great voice, nice sounding arrangements but generally he's not singing the meaning of the words, just the words themselves. (check A. Hamilton's Point of it All if you want to hear someone singing like he and the song are one.)    i would call this suburban soul or better yet, a manhattan collard green/spare rib bistro . . . . . . (exactly).    or fried fish and grits with capuccino.    but if you just love his voice you'll enjoy it.
B00000425L|5.0|It's Friday night, February 6, 2009 at 6:16 in the evening.  I'm at my desk (everyone's gone!), am I'm listenting to the CD as I type this review.  This CD is truly excellent!  Vladimir Ashkenazy puts feeling into this performance, it really does feel like a 'personal' effort on the musician's part.  An example:  I also own David Helfgott's CD where he performs \\"Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto\\" along with several of the Etudes.  Helfgott's Prelude No. 1 and Ashkenazy's Prelude No. 1 are in different worlds from start-to-finish.  Make no mistake, I enjoy both versions, but Ashkenazy's sent a chill through my bones!  I invite you to get a copy and see for yourself.  My rating:  Five stars!
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Hearing it the first time I wanted the CD, it is a bit different than the older coldplay, but still great in every way. As a person-band changes and their life experiances change, they tend to be drawn in different directions, unfortunately most get a \\"do no wrong\\" complex and go into the toilet. Coldplay however has held it together the way bands like U2, DMB, REM, and many other greats have.<br /><br />A few of the songs took a couple times of listening to get them, and into them, and now I have no song I don't like on the CD.<br /><br />If you think this is a muddy poor cd, turn off your cheapo boombox, and get something worth listening to.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|A mix of kinetic energy, an undertow of suspense, and a dash of Dicken's, Slumdog Millionare has become the breakout indie hit of the year. I was drawn to the film after its win at the Golden Globes and after viewing it, I can see why there is so much fuss over it.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one, abliet with a refreshed, updated feel. Young Jamal has become an overnight sensation after his amazing streak on India's \\"Who Want To Be a Millionare?\\". With just one more question left to win big, the question on everyones mind is, how on earth did this kid from the slums, with no formal education, stable living conditions, and answering questions that have stumped dozens of contestents before. Slowly, we are taken back in time and shown Jamal's life, as each question he is asked pretains to a certain event in his life. All the while, he hopes to find the love he lost long ago, and maybe even come on top.<br /><br />The film literally crackles with intensity. The locations are awashed in a bright gold color, the camera is fast and moving (though no so much to make you dizzy), and the music is so lively and kinetic that it's almost like your actually in the movie with these characters, with Danny Boyle being the main person involved in this, injecting so much life and vibrancy that the film just pops off the screen. He also manages to equally balance the drama, humor, and tenderness of the screenplay without it coming off as to heavy handed.<br /><br />All the cast members do great, and while there is no particular standout, they all equally play of each other and hold their own scenes, with no one being overshadowed or underplayed.<br /><br />But what I really liked about the film was that (minor spoiler) unlike most other drama films, by the end of the film, you feel so happy and lifted that you just want to jump up and down as Jamal goes for the million dollars. I can't remember the last time a movie has actually made me grab my seat in suspense, baiting my breath, hoping and praying that Jamal actually wins it all and gets the girl. Plus, the Bollywood dance at the end was just so spectacular.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionare is definintly one of the best films of 2008, and whether your a Bollywood fan, drama person, awards seeker, this is the film that has everything for everyone. You do not want to miss it, Slumdog really is that one film you can't miss.actually wins it all and gets the girl. Plus, the Bollywood dance at the end was just so spectacular.

B0018OAPAW|3.0|Considering Rise And Fall, Rage And Grace a rock album, I have to give it 5 stars. The songs have a nice melody, they have good lyrics (well, except for Stuff is messed up, they messed up the lyrics on that one), the whole album is just solid and great.    However, if you like Offspring's Offspring-Ignition-Smash-Ixnay on the hombre stuff, or even Americana and Conspiracy of one, you will be very, very disappointed. The first four songs have a bit of the good Offspring style, that's it though. Only the first half of Hammerhead and Trust in you verses were really Offspring songs you know - the rest was classical guitar, piano, samplers, Linkin Park style, singing about love, calmness, no fun at all. Who needs those complicated drum beats? Who needs the harmonica-sampler during the Trust in you chorus, which by the way ruined the whole song? Who needs samplers at all? Who needs the weird sound of the snare drum? Who needs so many classical instruments? Who needs the piano intro, then hi-hat, then bass drum, then i looooooooooved you lyrics and everybody's crying? Who needs the lame crunchy-mild-distortion (NO, this album no song with their old good distortion!)?    What I needed were the fast, solid and not complicated drum beats, melodic guitar riffs with tons of distortion, cool bass lines and crazy lyrics. The Self Esteem coolness, the power of Meaning of life, the All I want speed, Session craziness. All of it is gone. Gone and doesn't seem to be coming back...

0452287588|5.0|Tolle's book is something that can make sense out of the whole world.  It isn't a theoretical book that will insist upon a specific doctrine. It resonates beautifully with the teachings of all spiritual leaders.  And it involves a practice that is constantly with us - being concious of oneself constantly.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I do not mean to offend Mr. Vincent and his review.  However, does he not understand that this movie is a FACTUAL movie.  This is not a movie with \\"a trite boring plot\\" with the same old revenge stuff we always see about New York.  This was the REAL New York.  How do I know this?  I am  Irish for one thing.  I am VERY proud to be Irish for another thing.  I researched and found amazing details about these two gangs and how they were basically the first gangs in America.  The Dead Rabbits was an actual true to life gang.  There is an Irish tribute band for the Pogues called \\"The Dead Rabbits\\".  I also found a terrific image that I have saved that says \\"The Dead Rabbits\\" on it, with a square in green around it and a couple of shamrocks around it.  I am having it put on a T shirt for myself.  Interesting, because I am a 42 year old woman who will soon be teaching.  As I said before I am proud to be Irish.  Watch it again, this time wrap your mind around the real \\"reality\\" of it, then come back and lets see what your review is this time.  By the way I do agree with most everyone about Cameron Diaz.  I usually just forget she is even in the movie until someone brings it up.
076790592X|5.0|At the recommendation of my son, I bought this book.  It is a \\"fast-read\\" and well worth reading.  You will not want to put the book down until you have finished reading it in its entirety.      The book arrived in a timely manner and in new condition as noted.
B00049QQHI|5.0|I watched this movie many years ago.  I knew who Jim Carroll was long before I ever heard of The Basketball Diaries.  When I saw the movie I did not even realize that Jim had actually written these diaries.  Personally I love reading other peoples diaries or watching them on a movie.  It makes me feel good to know that other people out there are just like me.  Don't get me wrong I have never been hooked on heroin, but I was once in the \\"major\\" partying scene for a very long period in my life.  I knew several people who were hooked on heroin.  I chose at an early age not to do heroin, partly because it scared me and partly because my best friend told me she would kick my a** if I did (she saw what it did to her two sisters).  I was a little surprised at the Amazon review.  Maybe the guy is really young because everyone I know who has seen this movie knew who Jim Carroll was, even my sister who is 9 years younger than me and all her friends.  Considering that she grew up in the 90's I think that says a lot for Jim Carroll.  I am buying this movie because I have two sons, ages 9 and 11 and soon enough they will need a little taste of \\"the real world\\".  We live in a small community and there is not much \\"reality\\" when it comes to the world of drugs.  They have their annual drug talk and come home and tell my husband he is using drugs when he drinks a beer with a friend.  I am the real \\"druggie\\" in the household since I actually smoke cigarettes everyday (God forbid!).  This is what this town sees and thinks of drugs and that culture.  This movie is perfect for showing what actually happens.  Yeah, drugs are a lot of fun.  I am admitting the cold hard truth.  But everyone has to pay the piper, yeah I guess that is kind of a pun.  You stay with the peers and the drug culture, the clubs, the bars, the apartments and yes, even the basketball courts and the drugs will bring you down.  I find it amazing that there are actual people in this world who still care enough for other people to work hard to get them out of the drug scene.  Most people I know have just had to remove themselves from the scene or they would succumb to it once more, even when they absolutely did not want to.  The lure, the wild promise of a great time, probably one of the best times you will have had in a really long time is to much to turn down.  So while inside your screaming \\"NO, NO NO!!!!\\" your eyes are looking right into the eyes of \\"the friend\\" offering whatever it is you have done and are about to do again.  I really do not want that life for my boys but I can not be a hippocrite either.  Thats why this movie is the best.  Plus they can identify with Leonardo DiCaprio, both of them watch Titanic at least 3 times a year!  I hope this review helps someone.  I hope it helps in whatever way you need it to help.

6302158095|5.0|I had this movie as a kid but not sure where it ended up. For Christmas my mom bought us a DVD/VHS combo and sent along many of my Disney movies. I was obsessing over getting this movie for my 2 year old and when I found it here on Amazon at such a great price I had to jump on it. It came in just a few days (faster than I thought) and in outstanding condition. I will be buying more VHS classics from here again!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|It has been a couple of months since I watched these disks over about a week. I then gave the set to a friend who did the same. It now seems that every day I have a flashback to that viewing or something will trigger the memory. I don't know exactly why, but this story and this telling of it linger on the mind. It's as though I was there living it, the memory is that deep. Now, isn't that what storytelling is all about?

B000WC4A8O|4.0|I am a big Led Zeppelin fan who recently got into vinyl. However, trying to find all of their albums on vinyl, in good condition is hard.    They are either in great shape and too expensive, or in bad shape.    I knew they released a new greatest hits album recently and said to myself \\"maybe they put it out on vinyl\\", and they did.     The upsides: 180 gram vinyl. Its heavy, its durable, and it less prone to \\"wear and tear\\". Has all their greatest hits from just about every album. The art work on the inside is just awesome. The LP sleeves are really neat. That is something I love about vinyl (besides the superior sound quality), its got lots of neat stuff in it, and this is no different. It came packed very well, and the records were even packed up in a dust cover made of plastic (rather than just stuck in a sleeve)    Downside: It has only one down side, it misses A LOT of great songs from Led Zeppelin III and Physical Graffiti. However, it is a greatest hits album, and I do not think Custard Pie or The Rover ever made it as a \\"greatest hit\\" in the eyes of most teenagers who would buy this album (CD really).    With that said, it was great to find a 4 LP collection of almost every album they ever had. It has the best songs from I, II, III, IV, Houses of the Holy, Physical Graffiti, and even their last few albums (Coda, In Through The Out Door, Presence). If you are looking for some great Zeppelin vinyl, but do not want to search around for almost impossible to find LPs this is what you want.    I will post some pictures of the art work and records themselves when I get the chance so you can see what comes with it.
0896762629|5.0|Patterns of Fashion 4 is the most impressive collection I've ever seen of photos, drawings, descriptions, and patterns of actual period garments.  In this case, the period garments are 16th-17th body linen (shirts, ruffs, collars), and they are described with expert skill.  Since I haven't attempted to reconstruct any of the items, I cannot say how helpful the patterns are, but the text and photos provide a wealth of information about period underwear, and shown me that many more of such garments existed than I had imagined.  A fabulous reference; every costumer interested in 16th or 17th century European costume should have a copy.
B00009L1OB|5.0|Although this album may not have aged QUITE as well as Rio, it is a masterpiece.  It was the overblown, overproduced, overly-poppy album that Duran Duran absolutely had to do -- and they did it perfectly.    Seven and the Ragged Tiger could have benefitted from some \\"breathing room\\" somewhere in the track listing (as in a spacious, breezy, tempo-free song), but at this point in their careers, the members of Duran Duran had no such \\"breathing room\\" in their chaotic lives, so I can see why this was reflected in the album.    I am a songwriter and have analyzed the theory behind these songs...let me just say, from a musical point of view, the chords and melodies are fascinating and incredibly original.  The sheer number of key changes that go on in these songs, oftentimes without the listener even knowing, is hard to comprehend.    Duran Duran are infamous for not knowing the strength of their own songs.  I've seen the set list of their current tour, with that God-forsaken Timbaland/Timberlake record they just released, and I think that these guys just don't know which of their classic songs to play.  In terms of Seven and the Ragged Tiger, the biggest blunder of this kind was not including \\"Secret Oktober\\" on the album.  It is one of the greatest recordings ever made.    Oh, and don't blame Simon for cryptic lyrics.  I mean, come on, sometimes even MY head is \\"full of chopstick.\\"  Such lyrics were just his style...and not everyone can be Morrissey.
0545128285|4.0|Pros:  Good imitation of fairy tales, an interesting look into Dumbledore's character, a good look into some of the attitudes that underlie wizarding culture.    Cons:  Isn't long enough, not really as good as the actual Harry Potter books.      Part of the charm of the Harry Potter books is the author's ability to make you feel like you are immersed in a full world.  Rowling always gives enough detail to make you envision the world without giving so much that it comes off as too much exposition.   Witches and wizards and spells and magical creatures seem fully real.      In \\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\", Rowling expands upon this magical world through five fairy tales.  The writing style is perfect -- go pick up Grimm's and you'll find that it is in a very similar style.  The subject matter fits in well with traditional \\"muggle\\" fairy tale motifs (gore and all) with the exception being that magic is taken for granted as a normal part of the world.  As is often the case with real fairy tales, these wizarding fairy tales tell us a lot about the values and fears and conflicts that underlie the society that invented them.  Rowling allows us to better understand the culture of the Harry Potter world by letting us glimpse these old stories that hint at how wizards viewed their magic, the ethical use of it, and their relationship with the muggle world.      In case you have trouble interpreting the tales, each fairy tale comes with commentary by none other than Albus Dumbledore.  Besides allowing us to better understand the themes in each tale, this commentary also offers a fascinating look into the mind of Dumbledore, one of the series' most controversial characters.      My biggest complaint about this book is that it is a bit of a rip off.  Like a student trying to pad a paper, the publishers have messed with the margins and font sizes and added pictures in order to achieve even the relatively short length of this book (just over 100 pages).  There are five short fairy tales here, hardly enough material for a thirteen dollar book.  Also, if Rowling had really dug in with this idea and written, say thirty fairy tales, then we might get a much more complete look at the wizarding world.      But perhaps it is better that she didn't.  Although this book is charming in its own way, it never quite manages to draw me in quite the same way as the main Harry Potter books.  It is well done, but the format just isn't as interesting.  4- stars.

1592289444|1.0|Walking through a blazing desert for days without food or water, crossing mountain-terrain in minus degrees for days without food or water.

0439023483|5.0|When you first start this book, if you've seen the movie the Running Man with Schwarznegger, you're thinking this is just a children's version of the movie.  Not so.  Meet Katniss and Gale, two friends and hunting companions.  Meet Prim, Katniss's little sister.  The day of the Reaping has come.  On this day every year everyone in the districts (what was once North America) gathers.  One girl and one boy from each district are chosen to play in the Hunger Games.  Only one child can come out of the Hunger Games the victor.  They must kill each other until only one stands.  The winner is then wealthily, never goes hungry again, and gets a big fancy house to live in.<br /><br />Prim, who's 12 years old, is chosen, Katniss takes her place by volunteering for the games.  Certain her life is now over, the boy is picked, Peeta.  Katniss and Peeta know each other vaguely.  After being taken away and put through all the presentation ceremonies they are thrown into the arena.  But they have a plan.  If they play at being in love perhaps the rules will change.  Peeta does all he can to protect Katniss.  On camera their every move is recorded for all the districts to view each night.  Coached to show their caring for one another, it became clear to me, Peeta wasn't acting.<br /><br />There is a lot of action in this book.  And I actually cried when Katniss's ally is killed.  And I wanted to slap Katniss for most of the book because to me it was obvious Peeta really does love her, he's not just acting as thinks he is.  This book was a real page turner for me.  It's a story about a cruel nasty world written by a brilliant author.  I could not wait to finish it to see what happens to Katniss, Peeta, and Gale.  It's tragic, lots of death, to kids becoming adults and leaves you ready for another book.

B001LF4IA6|4.0|I've been a Springsteen fan for quite some time now.  He is my personal hero, the one artist whose music I come back to again and again.  That being said, this latest release is a bit . . . different . . . from his other stuff.  The most noticible difference is that it is missing the angst of Springsteen's typical work.  He is not angry over political or social injustice here.  This album is about growing older, and being happy and content with that reality.  The one CD in his catalogue that it can be compared most readily to is the 1992 album LUCKY TOWN, which dealt primarily with having a family and raising kids.  If you buy WORKING ON A DREAM (and I recommend that you do), don't expect the intensity of BORN TO RUN or DARKNESS.  Expect instead a wise retrospective on life, love and loss that is sometimes funny (Queen of the Supermarket), a little bluesy (Good Eye), and often very poignant (Kingdom of Days).

0143036424|5.0|Walt Longmire-hero of Absaroka County!! Walt is perhaps a different kind of hero-imperfect- who cries at injustice-who makes mistakes-drives all the women in his life crazy which includes his female deputy, Vic, his secretary Ruby, who actually runs the sheriff's office, and his daughter, Cady.  Walt is respected because he cares about people no matter who they are and of course he always gets his man (or woman) though it sometimes takes awhile.<br /><br />This is the second time I've read \\"The Cold Dish\\".  I didn't write a review the first time.  This time around I absorbed the book a bit more.  Craig Johnson's books are not meant to be read quickly.  There is too much too absorb and they are slow and easy with a lot of description of the country and the characters.  When you finish the book you will have made friends with several secondary characters you will want to meet up with again. Henry Standing Bear (Walt's life long friend) is probably my favorite. The great thing is you can visit these characters again in his next 3 books and another coming out in May.<br /><br />Craig Johnson is quite the story teller and makes his characters come alive.  In \\"Cold \\"Dish\\" Walt deals with the deaths of 2 young men who were involved with the rape of Melissa Little Bird, a young Cheyenne girl.  Besides trying to find out who murdered the young men, Walt has to try to keep the other 2 remaining young men involved in the rape safe and that turns out to be no easy task and Craig uses some great humor to lighten what could be an otherwise dark story.  I tried to think why the name \\"Cold Dish\\" for the title of the book.  It is explained at the end of chapter 11 when his friend Bear says; \\"Revenge is a dish best served cold\\".<br /><br />Mr. Johnson is one of the best new authors I have come across in awhile.  I think we will be hearing a lot about him in the future.  I know he spends a lot of quality time on his books and it shows.  I have all 4 of his books and anxiously awaiting his 5th installment of Walt and the people of Absaroka County.Walt and the people of Absaroka County.

0452289963|5.0|Per Eckhart Tolle, the language in 'A New Earth' (as well as his other publications - print, audio, and video) is a 'pointer' to make us aware of who we truly are. His message is the message of all great masters - what is different is the clarity with which it is given, and in the process he does away with many of the misrepresentations and misinterpretations that have accumulated over the millennia.    Any criticism i have read or heard is from people who are not 'getting it' - mostly defending their point of view based on their conditioning. There is no space for unconditioned thinking in a conditioned mind, and conditioned minds are the root cause for all of the atrocities committed by mankind against mankind.     ET's message shows us how we are able to get away from this, by showing us how we constantly sabotage ourselves, how we can change the way we think (and how not to take ourselves too seriously) and thus become free to live in peace and joy.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I read the book before I knew that HBO was making a show based on the series. Since I read the book, I was very interested in watching the show. The show is similar, but the book is completely from Sookie's view point. Therefore, most of the character story lines are made up by the show's writers. The show also has a lot more sex in it than the book does. I like the show, but the book is a lot better because some of the show's story lines are silly.  For example, vampire blood make Jason and Amy hallucinate, but when Sookie drinks it, it just heals her.  She does not have any hallucinations.  The hallucinations Jason and Amy have are dumb, too.  However, TrueBlood is the only vampire show on the air now that Moonlight is gone.  Also, it is better than Moonlight was, so, I give it five stars.

B000Q66PXE|1.0|Given the recent track record of HBO and with the BBC on board, I expected something a whole lot better. Trite, juvenile, historically dubious and with sex and violence that was formulaic in a time related sense - this is perhaps the worst HBO series I've seen. The incredible coincidences that kept the main characters to the forefront was pure soap opera. For Season Two, it appeared that the screenwriters were given a quota of four letter words as they appeared frequently and gratuitously. As to the acting, hardly patrician and Lindsay Duncan has sunk to new depths. I thought that she was pretty dreadful in A Year in Provence but she outdoes herself here.

B000FL7CAK|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed season I and had great expectations for the second season as well.  The characters are a bit more trashy in the second season to the point where it can distract from the plot.  On the positive side, there are plenty of laughs and witty come-backs that keep things light.  Overall, I would purchase this set again.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|Danny Boyle certainly knows how to tell a good story as he weaves together an entertaining yarn of growing up hard in Mumbai.  He builds the plot around \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\" using the questions to reveal Jamal's hard life, as the chaiwalla seems to know all the right answers much to the chagrin of the host, Prem Kumar.<br /><br />It takes a little while to get on track but Boyle and Loveleen Tandan never lose sight of their characters, charting a course that has a number of amazing twists and turns.  While Jamal never gives up his pursuit for the lovely Latika, his older brother Salim is the one who figures out how to get them out of one jam after another, but not always to Jamal's liking.  Some of the scenes are pretty harrowing, as one would expect from being forced to live on the street after Jamal's and Salim's mother is beaten to death in a race riot, but ultimately Boyle keeps to the spirit of Bollywood moreso than Dickens.<br /><br />The cast is an intriguing mix of first-time actors and Bollywood stars, as fantasy meets reality.  I can see why the movie is such a favorite among audiences. One would have to be pretty callous not to give into the kinetic energy of the movie, and let yourself be taken along on this wild ride.  The movie is loosely based on the bestselling book Q & A by Vikas Swarup.

0316010669|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a way that makes you believe you are being let in on newly-unveiled secrets. He did it with human social behavior in \\"The Tipping Point\\" and does it again here in \\"Blink\\" with the hidden world of the subconscious human mind.<br /><br />In \\"Blink\\", Gladwell tackles the way that the human mind can sometimes make near-instantaneous judgments that are often inexplicable, even to those who make them. Examples range from art experts who can tell a fake at a glance, to a tennis coach who can tell when a player is about the double-fault, to (less admirably) police officers who \\"know\\" a suspect is a criminal. There's a bit of benign bait and switch behind \\"Blink\\" in that it initially seems to suggest that we are about to be shown how to harness a great source of untapped, infallible interior wisdom. But while telling how some people do manage to make critical decision in the blink of an eye, Gladwell spends far more of the book discussing how our minds are fooled by our upbringing and experience, leading to horrific judgments that can have catastrophic effects.<br /><br />Gladwell's main focus in the book is on \\"thin slicing\\" -- the way our judgments are often based on seemingly insignificant portions of behavior. A surgeon's likelihood to be sued for negligence, for instance, can be predicted quite well on the basis of the tone of voice used when speaking with patients; a couple's likelihood of divorce on the number of insignificant facial flashes of contempt they show in a short conversation. Human minds, in another example, are incredibly well-tuned to pick up subtle fleeting signals from the faces of others. Maxwell makes the controversial, but I think on-target, point that our faces are not as much *controlled* by our minds, but are extensions of our minds. This is suggested by experiments that show how mood is changed by affecting an angry or happy face. But the connection goes the other way, and the mind is expressed by unconscious facial expressions that appear in milliseconds, betraying inner conflicts and fears. A film of British spy Kim Philby, when slowed downed considerably and viewed by and expert in facial expressions, betrays flashes of a man both fearful and proud of his duplicity.<br /><br />Gladwell also explores the subconscious -- the \\"mind behind the locked door\\" as he calls it, whose judgments strongly influence our behavior. He cites studies in which subjects, exposed to a set of words relating to old age, walk away from the test more slowly than do controls. That's one thing. More controversially, he contends that minority students score lower on a test -- if, that is they are asked at the outset to identify their race. Presumably, raising the race issue also raises unbidden associations with lower intellectual expectations. Aside from being potentially inflammatory, this last example seems a bit too pat in its suggestion that minorities devalue education and that more conscious biases are not also at play. But while \\"Blink\\" shows how our subconscious can be fooled, it also provides ways to defeat its worst tendencies. Gladwell's story of the successful car salesman who treats all customers alike, thereby deliberately blocking irrelevant signals (dress, age, gender, race) that fool others to dismiss potential customers, show that our mistaken snap judgments can be overcome.<br /><br />Gladwell's writing is fascinating, but not entirely trustworthy. He has a maddening tendency to fudge the story to make his point. He cites precise percentages when they agree with his thesis, but replaces them with vague language when they don't. And anyone who reads psychological literature will find Gladwell's sense of certainty a bit suspect. Gladwell's treatment of the Amadou Dialou shooting by 4 white cops in was a case in point. Avoiding the standard rationales for the killing (self defense by police backers and race by Dialou supporters) Gladwell spins a tale in which cops lost their ability to \\"mind-read\\" Dialou by rushing him, then getting lost in an adrenaline-fueled autism-like state. It's own thing to suggest this as a possibility. It's another to state it as a certainty.<br /><br />\\"Blink\\" is an interesting read when taken with a grain of skepticism. The picture it paints of the ways -- good and bad -- that we make quick decisions might help us overcome our reliance on gut impressions that are built only on cultural assumptions. The heroes of \\"Blink\\" are those whose \\"snap\\" impressions are built a database built from years of personal experience. In a society in which the most ignorant get to broadcast their opinions, thus affecting the \\"experience\\" of their audiences, this is refreshing.n getting lost in an adrenaline-fueled autism-like state.

B00003CXSP|5.0|Hannibal is, like Silence of the Lambs, an expression of a great tale by Thomas Harris with its main character portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. In Hannibal one sees evidence of the justification of the assertion of many critics and movie goers, that Anthony Hopkins is truly one of a handful of great actors making movies today. The scenes crafted by the director, the make-up and the music, all combine to elevate the suspense in this film. Perhaps of all the great elements that come together to make this film so good, none was more evident to me than the choice of the actress to play Clarice. In this part we are treated to images and performances of Julianne Moore. She is surely one of the most talented, sexy and beautiful women in movies today. If you are a male, whether you are 18 or 75, you are very likely to find yourself wishing for more from her in future films. I have always been an Anthony Hopkins fan and now I find that I am also a Julianne Moore fan. This film holds your attention and it ends with a real dramatic flair as a final gift from a gifted director. Buy it - own it - and look at it often.

But I was expecting a soundtrack geared toward teenage girls-so wrong. Even though I'm sure they love it also, this song has many beautiful tracks that most any music lover should not miss. Of course Flightless Bird is no.1-so so beautiful-you should hear Leave Out All The Rest-a real gem. But the drums halfway through Eyes On Fire will have you wanting more-Tremble For My Beloved is so pretty- as is Bellas Lullaby-and I was most surprised by \\"Never Think\\"-a bluesy kind of song that is exceptional. You wont be disappointed in any of these.

1563899426|4.0|Fables: Legends in Exile #1 collects the first five issues of Bill Willingham's Vertigo comic.<br /><br />The high concept is a wonderful conceit--what if fairy tale characters, ranging from Snow White to Bluebeard, all lived, in secret, in New York City (and upstate New York in the case of the animals).  Trying to avoid revealing their nature to the populace, they are a small community unto their own, and yet, unmistakably, expatriates in the Greatest City on Earth.<br /><br />And what happens when one of these (implied) immortal characters is brutally killed, and the evidence points not to an ordinary New Yorker, but one of Fabletown's own denizens?<br /><br />With this idea, great drawing and writing,and plenty of visual eye candy, Fables is an example of a good graphic novel which uses the full strengths of the form. Certainly one could have told this story in a straight novel format, but this is a case where seeing is believing.  Snow White as a deputy Mayor.  The Big Bad Wolf as a detective.  Prince Charming as a schemer using his looks and charm to make his way in the world. These characters have pasts rooted in their fairy tales as well as previous relations between them in the expat community.  We get the feeling that the characters have always been there, hidden, in New York. There is a continuity to their existence.<br /><br />And much more awaits the reader.  It all works so very well, and the murder puzzle is a fair one.<br /><br />I look forward to at some point getting additional graphic novels of the series (something I need to do with a couple of others, like Sandman...).  In the meantime, if you have any interest in fairy tale characters and in graphic novels (or love the former and want to try the latter), this is a graphic novel which is a painless way to try and enjoy the form. If you love Urban Fantasy, this volume is a must.<br /><br />The only downside is that only 5 issues of the comic were collected in the volume. I read this almost *too* quickly.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.

1400079594|5.0|I have been a fan of P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves stories since I read \\"Jeeves Takes Charge\\" in high school, and, naturally, this time he does not disappoint.  The book is sharp, funny, reads quickly, and is vastly entertaining.  While it might be preferable to the Wodehouse newcomer to start with some of the earlier stories (pick up \\"Carry on Jeeves,\\" which contains the above mentioned story), this is as good a place to start as any.  The humor ranges from subtle to laugh-out-loud hysterical.  Trust me; pick it up and you'll read it over and over again.

It's hard to decide who's best cast in this film. Each character is terrific, although Emma Thompson is the most fun to watch. As the chain smoking writer narrating staid IRS agent Howard Crick's (Will Ferrell's)life, she drives the story. It's definitely worth watching more than once.   The Spoon songs on the soundtrack are a bonus and perfect match.

006135323X|3.0|This book helps explain some things that marketers need to know. I've never understood why anyone would be enticed by an offer of \\"free shipping,\\" as there is no such thing. Those pesky UPS drivers just insist on being paid for spending all day delivering packages.    The book provides insights, most of which are based on simple experiments. Each experiment had a control group and was conducted under what appears to be a modicum of rigor. But the experiments may as well have not been conducted. The reason is the test subjects were people under the age of 25 and the testing was for the characteristic of rationality. The subjects are not, therefore, suitable to what they were being tested for.    You can't rent a car if you are under 25. Do you know why? Because humans do not fully develop their judgment centers until that age. The human brain takes a long time to mature, and 25 is the rationality barrier. Thus, the experiments were on subjects who, due to their physical immaturity, are irrational. Testing people in this age group for irrationality is like testing window panes to see if they are transparent.    The experiments are therefore invalid.    That Ariely would even use these experiments in this text is a negative. But he compounds his error by extrapolating the results onto people who have crossed the rationality barrier. This barrier is a physical thing, and there's no getting around that. Quite simply, his test subjects have very different brains from the people upon whom he extrapolates the test results.    That's clearly a foul.    Thus, we have to accept Ariely's conclusions without the support of his experiments. In fact we have to accept them in spite of his experiments.    Fortunately, he draws on other examples and he presents logical arguments. Generally, I agree with his conclusions--or, rather, his conclusions tend to agree with how I already view things. That doesn't mean his conclusions are correct, and he provides precious little to back themup.    Given what I just said, the book has value. The value lies in the questions the author raises and discusses. Ariely takes an open-minded approach and pursues each topic in a style that is engaging, conversational, curious, and mildly entertaining.    I enjoyed reading the book. I liked thinking on the questions Ariely raised. I liked thinking about his answers to those questions, and I liked the fact his answers were often \\"food for thought\\" rather than trying to take on a false tone of \\"absolute truth.\\" He raises some serious social questions, yet doesn't abuse the book as a chance to preach a particular political agenda. He does correctly hint at the irrationality of some failed public policies, such as the disastrously expensive and totally ineffective Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but not in a way that posits that either wing of the Demopublican Party is better than the other.    This is the kind of book that can provide a starting point for people who like to talk about things other than the normal trivia that, irrationally enough, passes for conversation. For example, it would be interesting to take off from his ideas on the \\"self control\\" credit card to discuss the actual underlying problem of weak personal discipline. Why is that problem there? What can you do about it? Why do even well-disciplined people have bouts of ill-disciplined behavior? Ariely provides a dozen or so such topics that can make for serious social conversation among friends.    This book consists of 13 chapters and 244 pages of text. It has a long introduction, a short set of backnotes, a fairly robust bibliography, and a decent index.    Chapter 1, The Truth about Relativity, is the most important chapter for marketers. It talks about how people are swayed by one price relative to another.    Chapter 2, The Fallacy of Supply and Demand, talks about how price anchors affect market prices much more than supply v. demand does.    Chapter 3, The Cost of Zero Cost, explores the brain-deadeningallure of \\"free\\" and provides many examples of how people will spend more to get something for free.    You'll find similarly intriguing topics in the next 10 chapters. Any one of these topics could be expanded to the size of the entire book. But that would make for reading that is just too heavy for most people. This book isn't hard science. It's popular reading. But it's popular reading with some oomph to it. Read the book, ignoring the irrelevant research, and you'll probably find yourself enriched.

1401219268|4.0|With all the hype surrounding the movie coming out (March 2009), I had to get the source material. After all, it's only the \\"most celebrated graphic novel of all time.\\" I had to find out for myself why.<br /><br />It only took a few pages. That's how long it takes before you forget that you're reading a comic book. You're enveloped in a murder mystery on a grand scale. You're in a world that bears a striking resemblance to our own, yet is just not quite the same. The characters are rich, complex, and jump off the page. Soon you feel as if you're a part of this new world. You feel a burning desire to look forward in the book, desperately wanting to find answers. But you stop yourself because you don't want to spoil the amazing story that is being laid out in front of you. You ache to find out...who killed The Comedian?<br /><br />The principal characters are much like us. Ozymandias, Rorschach, Nite-Owl, Silk Spectre, and The Comedian are relatable, fallible, and possess no superhuman powers. They are not the \\"super\\" heroes you're used to. Dr. Manhattan is the only exception, having omnipotent powers that are without rival. Their story takes place in 1985. Costumed crime fighters have hung up their tights. The threat of nuclear annihilation is strong as the Cold War strains the relationship between the United States and Russia. In the midst of this global angst, there's a killer on the streets. And that killer is targeting mask-wearers.<br /><br />Alan Moore ([[ASIN:140120841X V for Vendetta]], [[ASIN:0958578346 From Hell]]) demonstrates a prowess that I've never seen before in comic books. So much so, that calling Watchmen a comic book seems to be a disservice. This is literature. Moore aptly weaves both past and present together into tightly wound yarn filled with symbolism and metaphors. Textual excerpts from books, newspaper stories, and documents are mixed into graphic storytelling to create an infinitely compelling package.<br /><br />Watchmen comes so close toperfection, it actually saddened me to watch the ending unravel to a point where I was once again reading just another comic book. It feels rushed and like Moore was in a race to tie up loose ends. In doing so, it devolves into a somewhat hokey mad scientist conclusion that was both unsatisfying and mildly irritating. Had I built such high expectations during the book that it's climax could not possibly live up to them? Possibly, but the fact remains. Without spoiling anything, it frustrates the reader because the Cold War actually ended without a shot being fired...severely nullifying the punch Moore was trying to pack. Had Moore waited a few more years before starting the book, would there be a different resolution? I'd be interested to know.<br /><br />Despite its somewhat dated elements and subpar finale, Watchmen is an amazing piece of work. It definitely belongs on any must read list. The over-sized hardback is truly a great presentation and enhances the art of Dave Gibbons. Included are notes from Moore on the world and its characters, of which were originally going to be extensions of old Charlton characters, like Captain Atom and Blue Beetle. He explains the change in direction that had to be taken after learning that he could not use these old characters and how he molded them into new ones. There are also interesting bits of art, sketches, and script work to finish it off.

I started it once and put it down...not because it wasn't good, but because I knew that I was going to experience a journey.<br /><br />Finally, I picked it up and fell into the story of a medical tragedy and the complex and changing life of a woman with early onset Alzheimer's Disease.<br /><br />I work in an internal medicine clinic. We see patients who succumb to the process of dementia in all of its forms. It's a lot like watching a flower slowly wither and close into itself. Still Alice is poignant and as true to life as I can imagine and in my limited experiences.<br /><br />Our visit into Alice's life begins with her vibrant life and right before her 50th birthday. She is on top of her game and is a respected professor/speaker at Harvard, in the areas of linguistics and psychology. At first, little things concern her, a lost word, confusion while doing something common. As her disease progresses readers watch Alice's mind change while she continued to fight to remain as she was.<br /><br />This is not a light read. But it's an important novel and the story of Alice is one that is tragic, beautiful, poignant and honest. The wordsmithing skills of Lisa Genova make the book a pleasure to read as well.
B000001F7R|4.0|I first heard Def Leppard on the radio after a friend told me to listen for them on a local station.  He said, \\"They're called 'Def Leppard'???!!???\\"  Anyway I heard \\"Rocks Off\\" and thought to myself \\"Damn! that's a MONSTER of a main riff! Heavy, lively and catchy...\\"  So I bought the album and wasn't disappointed. There's not a bad song on it, although some aren't as strong as others. I won't review them all, just a couple highlights.  Wasted: Great song, another great main riff    Rocks Off: Already discussed , but still worth another mention.    Answer to the Master:  Classic Hardrock/Metal    Overture: Well done classic hardrock/metal epic    With their debut album \\"On Through the Night\\", Def Leppard showed great promise and potential that, sadly, was lost or never fulfilled.  The music was heavy(for the time period) melodic and had natural, well thought out arrangements( not to mention well done and interesting vocal harmonies - Joe Elliot actually sings well!).      If you're a fan of their later releases, you probably won't appreciate this album. Mutt Lange, you ruined a band that could really have been incredible.

Now, like I said, this works great on a big screen T.V., but on a regular T.V., 92% of the picture is almost reduced in size to a postage stamp (which is quite annoying to watch).<br /><br />What they did with the original DVD was to fill the screen from left to right with the picture at 1.85:1, then it changes only hight wise (top to bottom) during the, \\"BRAINSTORM\\", segments, but what the new DVD does is keep the same hight through out, but changing the right to left portions of the screen during the 2.36:1 parts, and like I said, this would work at the movies, but on an average T.V. screen, it's not so great, as most of the film plays in a box in the middle of the T.V. screen.<br /><br />So, keep the old MGM version if you have it, and leave the new DVD for the big screen people...g the right to left portions of the screen during the 2.36:1 parts, and like I said, this would work at the movies, but on an average T.V. screen, it's not so great, as most of the film plays in a box in the middle of the T.V. screen.

0312360266|1.0|I've read, reread, and love the Twilight Series by Stephenie Meyer. After doing so, I went - like many others - on a young adult fiction vampire craze. I'm from Oklahoma and thought how great it would be to support Oklahoman writer, P.C. Cast.  Unfortunately, these \\"young adult\\" books, marketed to teens, are entirely inappropriate for teenagers. Parents should be aware what is within the pages. The book centers around a highschool student who is marked to become a vampire. The good part ends there.  In the first few chapters, teenage drinking, oral sex, anti-church statements, and disrepect and hostility towards parents are the themes. I closed this book with disgust before finishing. My thoughts: books should come with a rating system like movies have and this book is rated R.

B000WM725C|4.0|In 1978, I was fortunate to receive a copy of a soundboard recording of the Rust Never Sleeps tour at the Los Angeles Forum.  This was an incredible, unedited raw recording of the full show prior to any of the Rust releases.  The tape eventually was destroyed in my tape player but Live Rust was released around that time.  Unfortunately Live Rust is a heavily produced and edited recording so it did not capture the same atmosphere and feel of the Forum recording.    I ran across this release on Amazon and thought that this would come close to the soundboard recording.  I read the reviews and purchased this without giving it much thought.  I received the CD set yesterday and as other reviews have alluded to, this is a bootleg recording but more on that below. The tri-fold, digi-pack sleeve is well designed and actually looks more professional than many official releases. The back artwork even contains a UPC barcode so I can see how on-line stores such as Amazon were deceived into believing that this was an official release.      So where did this recording come from? Another reviewer mentioned that this was the soundtrack off of the Rust Never Sleeps DVD.  Well, that person is essentially correct.  I believe some clever (or not so clever because I assume this is common) bootlegger lifted the audio track from the DVD, maybe remixed it and burned it to a CD.  This is why the audio quality is relatively good.  Both the Live in San Francisco CD and Rust Never Sleep DVD recordings were from the same concert at the Cow Palace on October 22, 1978.      If you own the Rust DVD then you already have the music that is contained on this CD set.  If you don't own the DVD and want the audio CD then you have at least 2 options.  First you can purchase this CD assuming you can still find it.  Second, you can purchase the Rust DVD for less money and if you are technically adept, you can extract the audio tracks from the DVD and burn them onto your own CD.  Had I known what I know now,I would have done the latter.  In any case, I do enjoy the Live in San Francisco CD more than Live Rust because of the unedited versions of Hurricane and Cortez as well as the inclusion of the 2 songs missing from Live Rust.
B001PB0EI6|3.0|This is a review for In Through the Out Door.<br /><br />The only reason people remember this album is because it's Led Zeppelin.  Had it been released by any other band (besides Pink Floyd) people wouldn't be giving it nearly as much attention as they currently are.<br /><br />Yup, this album isn't any good.  Most of these songs feel like they are heavily influenced by the disco scene at the time, but that's not even the biggest problem.  The biggest problem is the feeling you get the band wasn't even interested in making this album because every song sounds tired and strained and it's just a major disappointment.  At the time it was considered a HUGE letdown.<br /><br />Zeppelin's idea of rocking out on this album is making the drum beats go a little bit faster compared to previous albums.  The album DOES have some beautiful ballads, so it's not completely forgettable.  It's just not a very good album, simple as that.  Weak songwriting and an obvious lack of interest on the part of the band members drags the album down a lot.
B00006G8K0|5.0|I'm not a big fan of horror films but I was very impressed with this one. It looks great on DVD, too, and it's tough to beat this price.  You get a very good transfer and an excellent film for under seven bucks!    This is a solid re-telling of the Dracula story with some legitimate thrills provided to the viewer along with pretty photography and sets and a tasteful lack of blood.    Story-wise, they might have embellished some of the action scenes and made Dracula a little more powerful. (I can't see him feeling a regular human being which he did here in the end.) Other than that, it's a well-done movie with no exaggerated characters, nice colors.......one of the better Dracula films ever made, just maybe the best. It's that good!    It also features two of the best classic 'horror\\" actors of all-time: Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. It's highly recommended, particularly for people who might be hesitant to watch a \\"Dracula\\" film. I'll think you'll like this version.
B0018LMZOE|5.0|The Moody Blues were always very good at writing memorable vocal melodies.  In fact, besides the soothingly beautiful dark atmosphere in their music, the catchy vocal melodies are the obvious thing that stands out about their music.    This album is just as good as the rest of the \\"classic 7\\" Moody Blues albums.  If you'd like me to name one song that misses the mark, or happens to be less great than another song... it won't happen, because I believe this entire album is great from beginning to end.  Pick up this version for VERY good sound quality.
031606792X|5.0|This book was an awesome book. It ended in a way that Meyers can expand on the books. I hated to have to stop reading this beautiful story.
B00005UJ96|5.0|\\"Nothing Special\\" is such a misleading song title- the guitar playing in the beginning is VERY VERY special!  Throw in a chugging, nonchalant rhythm with magnificent electric guitar soloing and you know what this song is?  An absolute masterpiece.  Soon really high pitched female vocals come in, and they deliver a great melody.  However I can't help but reflect on the intro- that's some really impressive guitar work!  The chugging acoustic guitar while an electric guitar jams... this is fantastic.<br /><br />\\"The Great Silkie\\" has REALLY beautiful and haunting slow-moving vocals.  This is some really beautiful folk music... well, folk and rock combined.  Soon the slowness goes away as the electric guitar arrives and furiously picks up the pace.  It's strange that so far the guitar playing is authentic and appropriate for any number of jam bands out there.  Never experienced *this* kind of guitar playing with folk music before.<br /><br />\\"The Garden of Jane Delawney\\" contains more haunting vocals with harpsichord and subtle tempo changes.  This song feels totally appropriate.  Delicate vocals are a thing of beauty when executed properly, as they are here.  \\"Lady Margaret\\" is as traditional as folk music can sound both in the vocal melody and the delicate arrangements.  Soon however, once again (which is now becoming a theme) the electric guitar comes in and dazzles me once more.  I can't stress enough how unique it is to have folk music combined with jam material-like electric guitar work.  \\"Glasgerion\\" is one of the weaker moments here.  Speedy, barely memorable/melodic vocals and nothing else about it jumps out to me other than some nifty guitar work near the end.<br /><br />\\"She Moves Through the Fair\\" takes a while to get going due to the somewhat uninteresting vocal melody, but soon a mellow guitar jam comes in and there's something really appealing about it but I can't quite figure out what it is!  \\"Road\\" has male and female vocals trading back and forth overa swift-moving acoustic guitar bit.  Not sure what to think about this song to be honest.  It's certainly good but I'm unsure just how much I enjoy it.  Alright *listens harder* I DO really enjoy it!  Some interesting guitar tricks occur at the end of this song too.  \\"Epitaph\\" is an extremely cheerful song... not!  Hey it's called \\"Epitaph\\" after all.  It's dreary, quiet, vocally powerful, instrumentally beautiful, etc.  \\"Snail's Lament\\" is more male/female vocals (this time singing simultaneously) and the lyrics/atmosphere breathes optimism unless I'm mistaken.<br /><br />This is a pretty strange album.  One way of looking at the music is like this- the music is very pretty, contains the English folk-rock style *exceptionally* well, and is just all-around really pleasant music.  But also, there's a heavy punch to some of these songs, such as \\"Lady Margaret\\", and the guitar playing is quite solid with a hint of blues among all the pretty instrumentation.  The direction of the music can switch gears dramatically in some instances.<br /><br />Sure, the Garden of Jane Delawney sounds like Fairport Convention in some ways, but this album is actually better than most of Fairport Convention's output because of the choice of instruments and how they're played in a way that just feels totally right.  The female lead singer has a pretty voice, and the mystical vibe of the English folk-rock style is implimented nicely here.  Worth owning.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|I grew up watching Speed Racer, the new movie is very good, I liked it very much.
B000009HF2|2.0|It irritates me to *no end* how people are convinced this is supposed to be the ultimate example of a live 70's rock album.  This album is pretty good, but it's most certainly NOT the best live album from a classic rock act.    What's even more annoying is how a select few songs keep getting played on the radio in a sad attempt to actually try and convince us that it's the best example of a 70's live album.  Please.  Go pick up Humble Pie's Rockin' the Fillmore to hear Peter Frampton REALLY explode with some extremely good guitar solos.  It won't feel like an obvious attempt to go commercial which is more than we can say for Frampton Comes Alive.    I understand a lot of people have memories when thinking about this album and the music takes them back to a certain time and place when they first experienced it, and that's all fine and good, but please, time has gone on and revealed exactly what the best live albums from the 70's REALLY are- Made in Japan, the Humble Pie album I mention above, Rory Gallagher's Irish Tour, Thin Lizzy's live album from the late 70's, as well as AC/DC's... these are classics that you're supposed to remember.  Why radio stations don't wanna play THESE incredibly good albums will remain a mystery to me until the end of time.
B001CC7PPI|4.0|Rear Window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1954)<br /><br />Few directors did it as well, and as consistently, as Alfred Hitchcock. And while I often wonder what it is the critics are thinking when they rank Hitchcock's films (Vertigo is better than North by Northwest? On what planet?), I have to admit that they've mostly got it right with Rear Window, which is a masterpiece of casting. It's a masterpiece of direction, too, but then it's a Hitchcock movie. You expect that.<br /><br />John Michael Hayes' adaptation of a story by the now mostly-obscure Cornell Woolrich (and his current obscurity is more of a crime than anything he ever wrote about) is brought to life by the casting of Jimmy Stewart as L. B. Jeffries, the film's main character. How much thought went into that choice? Actually, probably not much, given that in hindsight it makes such perfect sense. You're taking an actor who's well-known for being a good old-fashioned down-homey kind of guy and playing on that typecasting. You even give him a down-homey kind of hobby; he's bored, so he grabs his binoculars and starts spying on his neighbors. That's the kind of thing you expect eighty-year-old ladies to do. Where's the harm? I'm not sure any other actor could have brought that kind of baggage to the table but Jimmy Stewart. I mean, that's inspired casting, that is. And at heart, all the stupidity that follows is Jimmy Stewart trying to do the right thing. Doesn't he always?<br /><br />In fact, it's hard to think of Rear Window as noir, really. It's all just good, clean fun, with death and mayhem. (And really, how many of Jimmy Stewart's movies would have been spiced up by a little death and mayhem?) It's got a fun script, a fine leading actress in Grace Kelly (though honestly one wonders why someone as all-fired hot as Grace Kelly would waste her time on Jimmy Stewart when he's obviously trying to get rid of her), and some fabulous minor characters to inject much-needed humor to lighten things up now and again. There's none of the sense of bleakness that you get from a movie like Ace in the Hole or Sunset Blvd. here. And because of that, given the time in which it was made, it seems a bit out of place. I mean, even Douglas Sirk managed a pretty darned good piece of noir when he turned his mind to it (as did Hitch, actually; he practically invented the genre, where film was concerned, with his original version of The 39 Steps in 1935, and revitalized it briefly over a quarter century later with North by Northwest).<br /><br />Still, for all that, it is a fine piece of moviemaking, to be sure, and definitely stands up to repeated viewing; I think the time I'm basing this review on was my fifth. I like it a bunch. I still don't think it's North by Northwest or Psycho, or even Lifeboat (which I seem to like a whole lot more than most people), but it's one of Hitch's, say, top twenty movies. *** ½bleakness that you get from a movie like Ace in the Hole or Sunset Blvd. here.

B00020HEG6|5.0|The greatest thing about this soundtrack is the pure creativity that fuels the entire thing from start to finish. Williams did good work on the first two films, using all the expected instruments in the expected style for a fantasy film, and of course adding his magic touch to make it, well, magical. Here, he goes beyond what he did for the first two films.     The soundtrack starts off with Hedwig's Theme, which serves as the identity for the Harry Potter series. Anyone would have expected this. Then, in the second track, he does something different, and he writes a Tchaikovsky-esque comedy sequence that in the film, accompanies Aunt Marge's scene. This is a fun cue that for the most part is detached from the rest of the score, but it is hilarious and fits its part perfectly.    The next track, The Knight Bus, starts off with a bassoon solo that is a perfect fit for Stan Shunpike. Then suddenly, the track bursts into wild jazz, which is a perfect fit for the Knight Bus (sorry if I'm starting to sound like  a broken record!). This track recalls a past Williams score, Catch Me If You Can.    The next major track, Double Trouble, contains the new major theme for Prisoner of Azakban, and again, it is something different: it takes Shakespeare lyrics and matches it with music that sounds almost Baroque. Thus, we have the first three major tracks that are Romantic, Jazz, and Baroque.     Then, we get into the heart of the soundtrack. Buckbeak's theme is soaring and gusty and wonderful, and rivals the music Williams wrote for E.T.'s flying scene oh so many years ago. Then, we are introduced to the other major theme of Prisoner of Azakban, a Window to the Past, which is played on some sort of flute or piccolo. It plainly speaks of solitude and love, and is one of the highlights of the score.    I could go on and on about every track, but that would make this review stupidly long. So, I'll just talk about one more track: Quidditch, Third Year. I can't even fathom how much inspiration must have been behind this track. The strings, winds, and brass are all in a flurry in this track. Basically, it is a fugue, with a main motif and a ton of highly complex music to go along with it. It's fun listening to it and trying to wrap your mind around everything that's happening. I'd be prepared to bet that Williams worked harder on the Quidditch scene, then the people in the Visual Effects department, and that's saying something.    Another highlight of the score is the little motif for Wormtail and Sirius Black. Simple but creepy, William employs it whenever Wormtail and/or Sirius are near.    Overall, Prisoner of Azakban is a highly effective score, and chock full of creativty, but also substance. If it has a weakness, it is that it doesn't use many of the great motifs that were used in the first two films, although I think this has much to do with the new director--I honestly can't imagine Voldemort's theme from the first film being used in Alfonso Cuaron's Harry Potter film. I wish this score had won the Oscar, but alas, Williams will have to win his sixth another time. Still, I can give this score a great recommendation.
B001CZVVWI|5.0|This Blu-ray of Rossini's most popular opera is brilliant in every way: imaginative production, exuberant acting, buoyant conducting, and above all, stupendous singing, particularly from star tenor Juan Diego Florez, who steals the show whenever he's on stage (which is a lot of the time). The stagecraft is inventive and always eye-catching--I loved the concept of going from near-monochrome at the beginning to blazing color at the end.  The singing is on a high level all around, and the ensemble work (extremely important in this opera) is pitch-perfect.  Oddly enough, baritone Pietro Spagnoli as Figaro has his weakest moment in 'Largo al factotum' (one of opera's most famous arias), which is a slight disappointment, but he gets stronger as the opera goes on, and his effervescent charm is a delight throughout.  As Bartolo, Bruno Pratico plays up the buffo aspects of his role to terrific effect.  Maria Bayo's sweet, slender voice makes for a beguiling Rosina.  And what more to say of Juan Diego Florez?  His peformance is simply jaw-droppingly sensational here, easily showing why he's the leading bel canto tenor today (and perhaps of all time). His performance alone is reason enough to acquire this disc.    The picture quality of this disc (1080i/60) is vivid and sharp--one of the very best I've seen on this format--and the stereo PCM audio track is full and well-defined.  (I didn't listen to the DTS-MA track.)  Together with Decca's equally sensational Blu-ray of 'Carmen', these make an auspicious hi-def debut for the label.  More, please!
0783226063|5.0|I love this movie, The spice, the Baron, the worms, Paul Atraitis or Usul, Muad'Dib, Arakis, it's all here. What a great movie! This movie moves much faster and gives, not all, but enough of the book to keep the story moving. Plus BONUS we have Sting playing the Bad guy Feyd-Rautha Rabban... how can this movie go wrong? One of my all time favorites from my early years.
B00181JGI2|4.0|I confess to being an extremely late-comer to join the Lebowski fan bandwagon. I didn't see it when originally released in the theatres, and hadn't EVER since until just last year, when a good buddy of mine gave my a copy for an Xmas present (you KNOW you have a good friend when they feel comfortable giving a married father of 6 something like this). Having watched it a couple of times since, I thought I'd add just one small perspective about this very special, but eccentric flick, that particularly caught my attention after viewing it again (while my wife and kids weren't home, of course) last night.<br /><br />This being the 706th review posted to this site, I shall forgoe the usual format of film critique, and comment only on the issue of profanity in movies, as The Big Lebowski, I think, provides an excellent example of why some folks get so worked up over profanity in movies, and usually for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Needless to say, Dude, profanity more than abides in The Big Lebowski. Sometime maybe I'll even try to count the number of times it's used in this flick, but my rough guess is about every 4th word in the movie is profane, with about 75% of that the notorious F-Word.<br /><br />Here's my bottom line: it didn't bother me in this movie, not at all....but you have to reflect on the reasons why, and compare it to other films where it does bother you, to fully appreciate what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />Profanity in movies that bothers me falls into a few general categories:<br />1- Profanity that is out-of-date for the time period being represented. Never ceases to peeve me to hear Medieval knights blithely using the F-Word, including even the hyphenated variations of that theme. This usually stands out as an all-too-obvious attempt (and a weak one at that) by the moviemakers to try to make period movies \\"more accessible\\" to a modern audience. It does the opposite for me, and not just because of the profanity itself, but because it represents such a lack of imagination on the writer/directors part. It's just BAD film-making.<br />2- Profanity that adds nothing to the emotion of the scene, or is spoken by a character in the movie for which it is inappropriate and not believable. Numerous examples of how even the bluest profanity just fits, as in scenes of extreme violence/rage, particularly modern warfare scenes (ie: Platoon), where the words add to the violent emotions the characters are feeling. And the opposite is singularly noticeable, too- when the profanity is completely inappropriate for the scene.....an actor spewing F-Bombs while in a Viet Nam firefight is natural, even necessary.....the same from an actor enjoying a cup of tea in a quiet bookstore is not.<br />3- Repetitive profanity: this one is more of a fine-line, and I'm sure some would argue that The Big Lebowski is one good example of repetitive profanity, and consider it onerous for that. But I'm not so sure- there's a fine art to the spacing of dialogue containing profanity in a film: if it consistently fits the character, the scene, and the emotions trying to be expressed, then it may not be repetitive, no matter how frequent. Lebowski struck me as being just that way: frequent, but not necessarily repetitive, in a distracting sense. I'm sure this might generate some amount of argument (for those who give a sh....t, anyway), but \\"Hoffa\\" was one memorable film for me where I thought that the profanity was repetitive and excessive, and detracted from the movie (even though it WAS appropriate to the characters being portrayed). There are countless other examples, but I'll just leave it at that for now.<br /><br />ANYWAY: pondering this over in my mind last night, after watching Lebowski again, it occurred to me that somewhere up There, George Carlin is smiling. After all, perhaps more than any other entertainer, Carlin made us take stock of just what it IS about profanity that gets us so worked-up, and how silly most of that fuss is, after all. They're just words, Dude, and they were created by all of us regular dudes, too. For crying out loud: I was even renowned in my High School days for being the Dude (even though we didn't recognize the title back then) who could string together the most colorful, profane words in one run-on sentence, without even needing to pause to take a breath.....and now, 36 years later, I am a church-going father of 6, physician, and only prone to use profanity under extreme duress. The point is, it didn't ruin my life: I turned out OK.<br /><br />So I don't know if this helps anyone decide whether to watch The Big Lebowski for the first time or not (if any such human actually exists), but just be aware that it is chock-full of the most blue language, AND you'll still likely laugh your ass off.<br /><br />New sh....t has come to light, Man.eated by all of us regular dudes, too.

0393316041|5.0|Most often when we say that we \\"laughed\\" at this book or this movie, we mean it figuratively: we found it funny, we smiled, and so on.    Not this book. This is the first time in a long while that a book has made me chuckle, snort, and laugh loudly enough for my family to ask what's going on. It's not a humor book, but it is a funny book. Feynman guides the reader through what he probably felt were the most interesting parts of his life, but rather than doing so in a set memoir format (\\"my greatest influence as a child was so-and-so\\") he does it by telling stories. It works wonderfully. His stories, of fixing radios as a kid during the Great Depression, picking the locks of colleagues while working at the Manhattan Project, picking girls up in a bar at New Mexico, are little bits of life told as it was really lived, not as it was remembered. The tone of the book is honest, unpretentious and decidedly cheeky.    And for the same reasons, it has a lot to teach. Feynman doesn't pretend to be an expert on dating, but you'll find dating tips here, as he learned and applied them (often to unexpected, hilarious effect). He doesn't pretend to be an expert on philosophy, but you'll learn about his outlook on life and how you deal with being part of the project that created the most terrifying weapon on Earth. Feynman doesn't tell you about life as it ought to be, he tells you about life as it is- or was it was for him, at any rate. It's a rewarding read.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|I enjoyed this film for its precision. Allen knows exactly what he wants and the actors are on the same wavelength throughout. That, my friends, is relaxing. It is not that he brings a light touch to the set. And (gracias a Dios) cleverness and humor take a second seat in this film to something much more juicy and profound. Makes me think Woody's 'got it' - this is about the art of being with people, humanness, celebration of uniqueness and imperfection. And also about observing, experiencing, participating ... and making films. The Craft.<br /><br />These days it seems that in Woody's hands even a cliche becomes poignant, like a wink from a beautiful passerby. He creates a paradise and then takes it away; after all, this is about life.
0316067601|3.0|Very hard review this, as I am from the UK and my perspective may differ from those of you in the US.<br /><br />This is the story of Marcus Luttrell, a US SEAL, his training and his insertion with three others into a Taliban infested area of Afghanistan to track an al-Qaeda leader.  The mission goes wrong and his team members a killed in a fierce fire-fight and Luttrell only survives because he is given shelter by an Afghan Pashtun tribe who take their oath of hospitality very seriously indeed.<br /><br />SEALs are elite soldiers and have an astonishing level of ability and patriotism.  Generally to the right of the political spectrum, they appear to despise the `liberal lefties' who stop them from doing their job and they see themselves very much as a breed apart.  Initially this was a little hard to take, but then when the author guides us through his training, you start to understand where he is coming from, and then astonishing level of brotherhood these guys have for each-other.<br /><br />This book starts with the author's Texan background and how he was almost `groomed' to become a SEAL, we then go through his training and then the detail of the fateful mission.<br /><br />Surprisingly emotional as well as action packed as Luttrell's team go down with astonishing bravery and the tragic attempted rescue mission.  While the author is MIA, the growing vigil at his family's home, highlights the local and Special Forces community and the deep sense of pride and patriotism they share.<br /><br />3.5 stars
