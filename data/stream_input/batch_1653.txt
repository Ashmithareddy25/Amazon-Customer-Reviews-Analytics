B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cute little game so far if you like the social city builder games. music is a little annoying. shooting on the touch screen kindle fire is a fun recal of hunting in the original game.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|Easy to use and upload/save/share... but limited color spectrum is a bit of a let down. Layering colors still won't replace what a nice umber could do. I don't expect or even desire more options; just give me a nice brown.

1556438850|5.0|There should not be any dispute on the 5 stars. It is worth. The author took the challenge of explaining yoga and he succeeded. There are lot more information you can find within this small book. Oh boy, wealth of information.<br /><br />But something is missing at the core level. Started with a detailed explanation given to Sun salutation & Downward Dog, the author takes the actual asanas section very light. Comparing the care given to the rest of the book, the 'rush' on this section is obvious. A little more concentration on the asanas would take this book to the same level as Light on Yoga.<br /><br />Overall, He joined the yoga readers 'can not miss those books' list.
0525476881|5.0|If you haven't read any of John Green's books you are in for a treat. This was his first and don't be fooled by the 'young adult' tag, his work will touch you no matter how old you are.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Middle book<br />Had to look<br />Just as hot<br />But iffy plot<br /><br />Part two of the three-part series serves mainly to link the opening to the grand (I hope) finale.  Secrets are revealed, even more secrets are withheld, and links with the past keep popping up everywhere for the lead characters.<br /><br />The ending is disappointing in its indecent haste to explain everything and wrap up the loose ends in one chapter.  On the \\"believability\\" scale, it's definitely at the bottom end.  However, the emotion conveyed is visceral and all-consuming, the lead characters still share an unbridled passion for each other, and the writing for these parts is as good as ever.<br /><br />Rated: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 3, 2012

0739321005|1.0|Before ordering this audiobook, be aware that it has been further abridged to remove all references to 'Frank', Obama's acknowledged 'mentor' and 'role model' and 'second father'..Who was Frank? Frank Marshall Davis- Communist, Pedophile, pornographer...with a 600 page FBI FILE..you don't have to believe me; just google or bing it...further proof that Obama is a fake, fraud and liar...sorry to disapoint all you followers of the 'Obamassiah'. This is the man who apologizes to Islam for our First Amendment Rights in our Constitution, and then edits out incriminating evidence from his own works. There are older, unabridged versions available from used dealers.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|What a wonderful little book. The story was enjoyable and the underlying message loud and clear. I liked the way the author cycled through the different characters' experiences. Although some reviewers have said the characters weren't well-developed, I believe that was done on purpose to enable the reader to put him/herself into the story and receive its lessons more fully. I identified with all the characters at one time or another during the course of the book.<br /><br />I will be reflecting on this book's lessons for a long time.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I've read almost all the Jack Reacher novels that Lee Child has written. Many of them I have read more than once.  While this one would not be placed into the favorite category, it is still worth the time and money.

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I always rent before I buy, and this one I will buy.  Reminds me of the old Hammer gothics, with much better acting.  Radclift does a great job getting out of the Harry Potter mold.  It's the best haunted house movie I've seen in a very long time.  It serves up the frights with suspense and without the use of constant blood and gore, which is wonderful.  I have the original Haunting (Julie Harris & Claire Bloom) which is good, and have aways thought if the same screen play were used in a remake it could be truely frightening again, given current special effects.<br /><br />The Woman in Black takes advantage of the current interest in ghost hunting and paranormal programs on TV.  If you aren't interested in the paranormal don't bother seeing this; it isn't a teen slasher movie. Yeah!
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|Perhaps i was just expecting something new, but after listening to it the first time it already felt like i've heard it all before. Its still very pretty and soothing music.

B007RX32TY|4.0|I don't think other reviewers have gone far enough to emphasize the style shift that's present on this album. While it does still very much feel like the classic Chromatic mood of cold atonal melodies and sparse click tracks, the dance pulse of their previous output is stripped away in favor of a peyote-soaked guitar jangle that is at times reminiscent of Neil Young's Deadman soundtrack.<br /><br />Another major element, that other reviewers have not overlooked, is the odd way this album is interrupted by long drone segments that at first seem like interludes but later present themselves as a major element in the album, when coupled with actual literal segments of silence. I get it, I really do, if you are listening to this on vinyl and want that spacious dynamic like an old Pink Floyd record, but for iPod the first thing I plan to do is remove any track number that contains literal silence, or droning emptiness. This stuff is cool for intimate headphone listeners, but for social moments...not so much.<br /><br />In closing, when they actually quit fooling around and drop a beat and vocals in the real songs, it's really gold, but I personally find all the detours to be distracting. In fact, I could handle all the quiet dramatic noir moments collected for a separate listening, like a side project or bonus material, but I'm not in favor of diluting a solid 45 min album with an extra half hour of droning sounds and John-Cage-esque silence; To each their own. For what it's worth, please note that I give this four stars, once I peal away the soundtrack-audition-outakes and just listen to the songs. Even with far less electronics, they can still craft one hell of a creepy tune, and there is more than enough gold to forgive my hang-ups about the track order, etc. Do not skip this due to my whining, because it's a really fantastic and generous collection of material...just clean it up before you throw it in your MP3 shuffle.
0316228532|2.0|I dont know if its fair but Im making a review without finishing the book.  But I guess thats kind of a review in itself!  Simply, I was thoroughly bored and disappointed with the little I read. There was no reason for me to be interested enought to continue.  I expected alot more from Rowling.<br /><br />In my opinion, Potter was in many ways for adults and it touched my life in positive ways.  I wish she wouldve stopped at HP7!

0060873027|2.0|Not very good. It seems like this might make a movie. O wait, it was. \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" Perhaps Preston watched it one night and cobbled this book together. The rule is don't repeat it if you can't do it better than the original.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|It was fun. u til I updated. Good thing I got it for free but still sorely disappointed. I probably won't touch the game now. I hate starting over. Great game however.
0307472841|2.0|I am interested in Scandanavian fiction writed and very much liked the Wallander series. When I saw this book by the author of that series, I expected an excellent result.<br /><br />It started out with a bang, most of the inhabitants of a village are brutally slaughtered. However much of the body of the book examined the political changes in China, its socialist roots being challenged by its growing captalism. While this is interesting and worth discussion, it becomes a overpowering of the main story.<br /><br />It was tedious for long stretches and the translation was poor<br /><br />The resolution of the plot is a stretch and not very satisfying.

B005QUQP76|4.0|The Corsair came like all products with as little fuss as possible. The quality of the mouse was higher than the price of it. Although the only complaint that I would log would be that the button that controls the sensitivity of the mouse is either placed horribly or I trigger it by mistake far too often. It is not a deal breaker only an annoyance that I have to deal with. So far the only way to do so is to set the software settings so that the miss click of said buttons does nothing making the feature redundant. Besides that the mouse seems like a buy for an entry level mouse. A better buy than the entry level ones by Logitech and other companies so far.

0316228532|4.0|The Casual Vacancy opens with the death of Barry Fairbrother, a prominent citizen of the tiny village of Pagford and member of the Pagford Parish Council, and follows by introducing all the various characters of the book (citizens of Pagford) and their reactions to his death. Although I didn't find it boring, I felt as though the first third of the book or so contained so many new characters written from so many different points of view that I felt like the first third of the book was more an introduction than anything, and it was a bit hard at first to keep all the names straight and remember who was who. The action moved very slowly and I found myself wondering, \\"What is going to HAPPEN in this book other than meeting a lot of (albeit very interesting) characters?\\"<br /><br />However, the book's action did pick up and it was well worth the wait. The seat left open by Barry's death (referred to as a \\"casual vacancy\\" by the council's handbook) is coveted by several different members of the community and the story highlights their local politics, attitudes, grudges and desires. We are shown the best and worst sides of all the characters' personalities, and it's hard to decide for certain whether to like or dislike each of them (rare in many books, where there are clear \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" characters). They seem like very real people (some perhaps more petty and shallow than I'd like to believe my circle of acquaintances are), and I think that was the most impressive part of this book. While I was almost, but not quite, bored at the beginning while being introduced to them, by the end of the book I was very invested in each character's fate. I haven't read many other books in which the characters seemed so real and believable. (I wasn't expecting that to be the case, since even though I love the series, I thought the Harry Potter characters could seem a bit flat at times.)<br /><br />The book contains a lot of dark situations (poverty, abuse, rape, addiction, bullying, self harm) which might be triggering for some readers. I thought that J.K. Rowling did an excellent job of describing the thoughts and feelings of the characters involved in bad or difficult situations while also describing the viewpoint of others looking in at the same situation and judging it quite differently.<br /><br />While the book wasn't \\"happy\\" or \\"light\\" by any means, at the end I felt it had made several important statements about poverty and addiction, in particular, and what society should do to help people in less fortunate situations. It ends sadly; I don't feel that's giving too much away since J.K. Rowling said as much in an interview I saw. But I think the ending was strong because of the thought provoking messages that were never explicitly stated, yet obvious: I found myself thinking about my own prejudices, attitudes and fears; the judgments I make about other people; and my attitude toward those with drug addictions and living on welfare. I believe society needs to do much more, not less, to help those who are struggling, and that starts with confronting our own prejudices.<br /><br />Literally all of the action in the book takes place in Pagford, but I think of it as a reflection of what takes place in cities and towns everywhere-and the characters, unlikable and disagreeable as they are at times, reflect the worst in people that must be confronted before positive change can take place.<br /><br />I give it four stars simply because the beginning felt a bit slow, but as I said once the action picked up a bit I could not put it down until I'd finished.elf harm) which might be triggering for some readers.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|The second book in Follett's 20th century trilogy upheld the quality set by \\"Fall of Giants.\\"  The characters are interesting and believable and there is a mountain of good information about the period in this historical fiction.  I am anxious for the concluding volume to appear.  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\" set the bar so high it will be difficult to attain such level.  But I surely would like to see him try.

B000BDJ1OC|2.0|Madonna's Like a Virgin album is an 80s classic.  It was originally 9 tracks, until it was re-released in Europe in 1985 with the song \\"Into the Groove\\" added on making it 10 tracks.  The album was remastered and released in 2001 with the original 9 tracks plus two extended remixes.  I have that version.  It does not include Into the Groove.<br /><br />I purchased this Japanese version because the track listing on the product page states that it has Into the Groove.  I wanted that particular version for my collection, but the one I got is the 11 track 2001 remaster, just in Japanese form (it has the obi strip, and Japanese writing).  I haven't opened it yet, I'm thinking of returning it.  It's a nice item for collectors, but I'm very disappointed that Into the Groove is not on this.  The track listing info needs to be changed to show what is really on here.  It's misleading when you are ordering.  I wouldn't have bothered to order in the first place if I knew the song wasn't on here.  I had looked it up prior to ordering and another site also lists it incorrectly.<br /><br />Before ordering, I also read the previous review here and thought that Into the Groove was included, by the way it was referred to in the review.  With the product description and the review, I thought that the Japanese version had the 10 track album plus the two extended mixes added.  It was confusing.  So, I thought I should write my own review so other customers know exactly what they are getting (and not getting).<br /><br />This is the same 11 tracks as the regular remastered version, so if you are thinking of buying one or the other, the other one is a lot cheaper and the sound quality is fine.  I'd get that one instead.  If you are looking to get Into the Groove, it is NOT on here.  You can find it on the Celebration collection.  But as for the Like a Virgin album, I guess the only one with Into The Groove is the out of print 1985 version.**<br /><br />**After I posted this review, the previous reviewer edited theirs and added this information that I mentioned, making it clear now.<br /><br />I hope this information will help other customers decide if they want this album or not.  This CD is pricey, so I wanted to make sure to inform other fans of the listing error.evious reviewer edited theirs and added this information that I mentioned, making it clear now.<br /><br />I hope this information will help other customers decide if they want this album or not.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great app for killing time. this is better than what you play at D&amp;B's because you actually see coins fall! And the shake feature without setting of the tilt alarm?! its like a dream come true!
B004MPESSY|4.0|First off the movie was pretty brutal from a guy and girl's prospective. The scenes got pretty graphic so if your weak stomached at all you don't want to watch this. The acting was pretty decent nothing was over the top and I could tell everyone got really into their roles as actors.<br /><br />Be ready for rape and murder thats pretty much what this movie is. Revenge is a dish best served with knives and guns. It is a remake and not a bad one not as good as the original but still well done considering they updated the times with it and kept same base storyline. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because as a horror movie fan I wanted all the gore not just some of it but still pleased.<br /><br />And the core of the movie moves along really well no dragging parts it hops right in and keeps steady moving until the end and be ready for an amazing scene at the end the core of the movie and shows some real talent in the female lead. Well that about wraps it up again 4 out of 5 and if your not a horror movie fan pass if your squeamish pass if you love a subtle reminder of grindhouse movies check it out.

B0087HT36U|4.0|Idea is perfect!  Shooting a variety of items at a pyramid of characters,  It's cute and fun! Only complaint is that sometimes it's choppy or freezes for a few seconds.  Also, occasionally you will knock the bottom away and the character won't fall.  Almost there!
B009GENZ12|2.0|It certainly doesn't lack a twist, but to say it's a clever one would be false. It really is entirely social commentary just after the middle of the movie, but not really social commentary that has any basis in reality or even political affiliation...it's a dreamer sentiment that implies adversity is wrong and elitist paths are the only way...that's not really what I thought I was getting into when I started a movie called \\"Tall Man\\" involving a creepy figure and child abductions. It's not to say I was hoping it wouldn't be intelligent, I'm saying it isn't intelligent. I gave two stars for the fact that it was an unpredictable twist, though a silly one.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love all of Rick Riordan's books. I am disappointed that this book crashes the Kindle Fire. I thought I was alone last night with this issue but I see that there have been more people with bad files reporting crashes. I have read numerous books on the Kindle Fire and this is the first one that has crashed my Kindle. I got to around chapter 25 and 4 pages in the application crashed back to the home screen. I contacted Customer Service and was informed that the book would be removed from the Kindle store and the publisher would be contacted to get the issue corrected however it will take at least a week before this happens. Hopefully it will be resolved soon so I can continue reading this wonderful book.
0307592731|2.0|I went in wanting to hear more about her experience about hiking the PCT. I knew full well she had been through some trauma which led her to the hike in the first place. But as I read more and more I found that I really didn't care as much about her pain, that I lacked sympathy for her. I did not want to be cold or callous towards the author's experiences but for whatever reason they were unable to hold me through this book.<br /><br />Additionally, I was not impressed with the writing overall. Plenty of instances of contrived drama - the book suffers from this as it feels like part fictional memoir, part adventure. The combo does not work and I'm disappointed because I wanted to love it.<br /><br />Simply being honest does not make for interesting reading. I do not recommend buying this book
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I plugged it in, and it just works. I've been using them to extend the cord of a Plantronics Gamecom 780 headset, and it works perfectly with no detectable drop in audio quality or data loss. I was slightly worried about the repeater using up too much power, but it did just fine. I'd only imagine that being a problem if you were trying to power something like a usb-powered monitor or something power hungry like that.<br /><br />It was slightly difficult to plug a usb into the connecting end, but once it was in, the physical connection felt very secure and not prone to being yanked out if it gets tripped over.<br /><br />The cord itself feels very thick and durable, but also very stiff. I am glad the manufacturer chose this material over a flimsier plastic.<br /><br />Overall a great product. You will definitely get your money's worth.

B0098VXE50|2.0|The actress/actors did well in acting but the story was boring for some reason - maybe the transitions between acenes were not smooth , or the climax was predictable ....

0525953728|4.0|I really don't understand what the big deal was about this book being available to the consumer.  I read every word and did not find it to be of any great secret to our nation or military.

I thought it was an easy read and I really looked forward to reading it every evening prior to bed.

B000W9399S|4.0|My first book in the series, and I'm hooked. After reading many reviews, I started reading with the caveat that it wasn't one of the strongest of the group so I didn't have super high expectations, but it was fun and engaging and funny and clever...what more would I want? Have already order the next two and am looking forward to continuing this journey.

B002RHGYOA|4.0|Stieg Larsson's mastery of suspense is taken to a new level in this novel. I was almost coaxed into believing that Salander had met her demise but was happily relieved to learn that my conclusion was premature! However I think that his love for detail is somewhat excessive at times, almost to the point of boring.  Who really wants to be taken through an itemized list of a character's supermarket purchases?  That notwithstanding, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am looking forward to my next read.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I've been anxiously awaiting the 2nd book of this trilogy and all I can say is when is book 3 coming out??? My gosh my need to know what's going to happen is giving me anxiety as book 1 & 2 did!  I re-read book 1 right before book 2 was released (glad I did that)!  There was no disappointment here for sure!  Book 2 is as good if not better  than book 1.  Sylvia Day is a master at writing erotic scenes and there are a lot of them in the 2nd book.  I had pre-ordered this book so had it on my Kindle first thing Tuesday morning and finished it in 24 hours.<br /><br />Here's the best thing about these books....there's actually a good story line and it's well written.  I've read a number of Sylvia Day's books (not the short ones though) and I've enjoyed them all but these are the best of her work in my opinion.  There are a lot of frustrating moments throughout which only makes you want to read on and on...<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you can get beyond the premise of child abuse and you enjoy reading really HOT and SIZZLING novels.  There are some great write ups already that go into the story itself so I won't bother.<br /><br />I'm very surprised to see that after only one day of being released there's almost 200 reviews already!  You've all been waiting but you must be speed readers as well!  I'd love to hear from you if you have other authors you'd recommend if you've enjoyed these.  I'm always looking for a great romance story with lots of sizzle!
B0079R8IYW|4.0|This cover is exactly as advertised and does a good job of protecting my Kindle Fire. If there were one thing I could improve upon, it would be the back latch that allows the cover to become a bookstand. It could be a little better at holding the Kindle in the bookstand position.
B008IYOEZM|5.0|missed season 6 and found out amazon had  the entire season  at a great price if you are hooked on this show
B002KSPKRS|1.0|It was working great for 7 months. Used it sparingly like once every other week. It turns on, but no sound from the wireless headphones. I plugged in wired headphones in the front and there is sound from that. I'll update everyone here on how the RMA process goes.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase of this DVD set. It came in great condition, as promised and in a timely manner. The DVD's are in great shape, not one scratch. I loved re-watching the first season of OUAT to catch myself up before season 2 started and I found myself getting wrapped up in the show once again. Great bonus features too. I am pleased all around with this product.
B004LROUW2|1.0|I share the thoughts of the review by Chris Fiorillo word-for-word, and am only creating this review to give this the most enthusiastic 1 star imaginable. It is contrived nonsense
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I ordered this product by mistake since I have only a regular dvd player not a blu-ray and they would not play on the regular dvd.  Amazon charged me almost $50.00 for a \\"restocking fee\\"!  I exchanged it for the regular dvd set and am enjoying it immensely.  Word to the wise - Watch what you order!
B00992CF6W|5.0|love minecraft i have it on apple amazon and computer all full version  works on ios4.3 and up for apple and works on kindle fire love mc love mc love  it
B00846REIS|5.0|I love it and I'm half way through the second book.  I pre-ordered the third.  I just hope that it has a happy ending. Like some of my other favorites Fifty shades, and On Dublin Street. Sylvia Day did a great job to keep your interest. You can't put it down.  Great job Ms. Day
B008EZVNO0|4.0|I've never disliked a Van release....afterall if there are any true popular musical genius' left The Man leads the pack.<br />He channels music. It writes him ....his stuff from Irish, gospel, R&B, skiffle, country, and blues are all the real deal. Organic.<br />Yet, as musical forms,they're replicates ...(of which he lives, breathes and performs fantastically...making them his own). But those templates have already existed.. don't constitute his genius label. That comes from a musical form that is otherworldy, one that no one else could write. Its a musical gene: Astral Weeks and all of the career long thread of work that stem from that stone cold masterwork.<br />Once I allowed myself to embrace AW it was lifechanging.Moving in ways I absolutely didn't understand. Still dont. I've cried, tranced and pranced on AW. I'm most connected to my better self after listening to AW.<br />How does this pertain to B2Sing you rightfully ask? Cause U can't comment on art without your preferences framing it in some way.<br />SO: I approach every Van release seeking some similar form of dynamic..lyrically and musically. He goes there most every album: 'Behind the Ritual' (and others) on the last LP, 'Beauty of the Days Gone By', Healing Game, 'Ancient Highway' etc. It's my VanHigh du jour!<br />I was hoping after the Astral Weeks tour, he might be leaning towards that kind of songwriting.<br />Couldn't be further from the truth!<br />As strong as Born to Sing is, I'm dissappointed that there's none of that trademark Van here. No 'slippin and slidin in the slipstream'. No 'home on high'. No 'leaves tumblin'. No healing.<br />Unlike many (most) of his releases where numerous musical forms are used, this is very singular in its musical expression (jazz-blues, downtempo), and lyrical voice (capitalist greed and his need for isolation).<br />So its perhaps ironically, it's his most cohesive and unified release in form...since, well<br />(sans his country LP) Astral Weeks!<br />There are many Van stylings to enjoy (another element of his genius). The Van I seek doesn't dwell on the evil music business, the pain of stardom, or social ills.<br />The Van I always seek is the Van that sings of his successes at trandscending all that, and in the process, creates the same exalting experience for us.<br />The Man can transport!<br />Not to be found here.<br />On it's own terms tho, is this a fine Van release? No doubt!<br />Unparalleled musicianship and as always recorded beautifully. Great to hear the horns again. Van's obviously invested emotionally here too (no, not always the case!) and in great voice...(I think his vocals are miked differently...very rich in timbre and intimate sounding). And I always like extended Van songs...some cool 'outros' here too! ( btw,at first I thought, : 'this is Van's 'Time Out of Mind' with it's incessant downbeats and brooding. Needs some death pondering tho for that methinks, which I'd prefer frankly than the ills of capitalism).<br />So for me?: The same music w/some love-loveloss, or 'drinkin' wine in the alley' type musings, upbeating a couple tracks, and a little backup singing (love female backup singers w/Vans voice!) might 5 star this for me...cause it SOUNDS great.<br />As it is it's another fine Van album....that I'm really enjoying!. (Hello!, it's a Van the Man release!).<br />Cheers
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Waited two years for this book to be published, but it was worth the wait. I feel like I know these characters personally.
B0068THAGY|5.0|It seemed a little like the movie Goonies with a little extra terrestrial spin.  I would say if that's your genre then this is your film.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think pinterest is the most awesome way to be inspired, and I hope they never take the boards down.  the creators are pure genius.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I give this 4 stars really only because I am a huge Lee Child/Jack Reacher Fan.  The book was drawn out, what to much time was spent in a car and it just didnt have a nice flow to it.  It seemed that the \\"bad guys\\" were really never developed like Child has done in previous books.  The end of the book was great true kick a$$ Reacher style.  I hope in his next book he gives it a little more effort and Reacher finally gets to Virginia.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I feel like this book left so many unanswered questions. I don't like how her books just seem to get good, then there over. I also didn't like how she redescribed everything, like it was the first book. Where she worked, who people were, it seemed like wasted time.<br /><br />I love the story of Gideon and Eva! Its raw. Emotional. Caring. It just felt like this book took a bit to get off the ground. The going got good, and she cut it off too quick.<br /><br />I wish the next book wasn't 2.5 months away!<br /><br />Overall, I still can't get enough of it.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This was a very good movie for all ages. It has a nice conservation message to it. My two year old granddaughter loved it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought it would be easy to pick a favorite from the trilogy, but I can not.  The second book was very enthralling and I finished it in record time.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I bought this for my son, so I don't have much to say in terms of quality etc. All I know is I got a great price compared to others around.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was great! I loved the way Riordan portrayed the characters and how he keeps things new and exciting. I was a wreck at the end though. Not giving out any spoilers but if you are affected as I am by a very strong connection to book characters as though they are real people, I suggest going somewhere private about 3 chapters before the end. That's all I'm going to say. Also idiots who say Annabeth dies, that's not true. Just setting the record straight.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its great! its kind of slow at times but I think its a fun game to pass time. sweet deal!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Honestly, I enjoyed \\"Fall of Giants\\" just a little bit more than this, but still loved \\"Winter of the World\\".... and can't wait for the third book to come out! I found it really hard to put the book down, and at the same time didn't want it to end. I would highly recommend both books to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is a master at painting the relationships of characters a world apart from each other. Our familiarity with the history only adds to the personalities of the characters. I am thankful that retirement allows me to read until the wee hours of the morning as I could not put the book down. Can hardly wait until the next installment.
0425263908|4.0|During the first part I'm thinking I love this!  But during the last half I calmed down and it felt more average.<br /><br />The reason to read this: if you're in the mood for a lot of explicit erotic sex.  This has similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey.  The big difference is pain.  In Fifty the guy needed to cause pain.  In Bared he does not, he just needs lots of sex.  He does not want emotional connection.  Gideon (in Bared) has the following in common with the guy in Fifty.  He is a billionaire at age 28.  He is so handsome that all women want him and they can't stop looking at him.  The best part is he is totally focused on and obsessively wants only one woman Eva.  He has her followed and he obtains information about her.  For example, he owns the building where she lives so he can get information from her lease agreement.  It may be stalking, but it's not bad because she likes him.<br /><br />From the moment Gideon sees Eva, it's like glue.  He has to have her no matter what.  He pursues relentlessly.  One of my favorite scenes was after they'd been together a while, a supermodel walks in the room.  \\"She shot me (Eva) a smirk, then unleashed a dazzling supermodel smile on Gideon and held out her hand. \\"Tatiana Cherlin.\\"  He shook her hand.  \\"Eva's boyfriend.\\"\\"  This kind of desire with no interest in anyone else is such a winner.  It's found in many of the best romance novels.<br /><br />There is not much character development.  All characters are beautiful and most are wealthy.  The three main characters suffered sexual abuse and/or other trauma in their childhoods.  We learn about Eva's abuse in this book.  I expect we will learn about Gideon's and Cary's abuse in the sequels listed below.  Cary is Eva's male roommate and best friend.  They met in group therapy.  Cary is bisexual.<br /><br />The main conflicts are Eva's emotional insecurities which cause her to run off and leave Gideon several times.  She fears he won't love her enough.  She wants him to open up to her about his past which he won't do.  She's jealous of gorgeous women who get his attention.  He needs to follow and reassure her.  One thing that struck me odd was Eva being the initiator for sex early and often.  It made her a nymphomaniac of sorts.  For some reason that was not fun for me.  The result was they both lusted for each other and nothing else ever happened.  No conversations.  No getting to know, admire, or like each other.  Some neat things happened early in the book, but once they got together, it was mostly about lust and sex for the rest of the book.  That's ok for erotic romance.  Its just that I was hoping for a little more.  I liked it enough to preorder the sequel.<br /><br />There are a lot of intense explicit sex scenes.  Many were very good, but I became tired of some of them after a while.  A few times as I was eager for more story, I got sex instead.  It's vanilla sex except for some rear door finger activity.  Then there is one brief group sex scene: 2 men and 2 women.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Narrative mode: 1st person Eva.  Story length: 334 pages.

0439023521|4.0|Do you like romance? Violence? Drama? If so, the Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins is the book for you. Between the love triangles, the food shortages, and the games itself, this book will leave you hanging on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The setting and background of this book catches your attention and really contributes to the plot. As you read the book you will see something, very different then anything you have ever seen or heard of. The capital and the districts are located in North America, demolished during a war. Its split up in 13 parts; District 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13, an abolished district, and lastly the capital. The abolishing of district 13, caused the Reaping and led up to the Hunger Games. The reaping sends two people from each district to the games. The Hunger Games are a one to four week process where everyone fights to the death. The reaping is held to remind the districts to never rebel against the Capital again. Each district specializes in something. All these districts give their specialized item to the capital. The Capital, brimming with money and supplied with everything they need from every districts, doesn't participate in the Hunger Games. As you read this series you will see what is to come of the Capital and how the games affect the whole nation and all the characters as a whole.<br /><br />The Hunger Games has quite a list of characters. The Hunger Games characters, spanning from small parts to larger parts, greatly influences the story. The primary character in this book is Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old living in District 12 of Panem. Katniss, brown haired, brown-eyed girl, seems very general. But she's not. She can hunt better than anyone in district 12, along with her fellow hunter, Gale. Gale Hawthorn is one of the strong male parts in the Hunger Games. Along with being the person who hunts with Katniss, he is her best friend, her supporter, like a cousin to her. They both hunt for one reason. To support their family. Katniss father was killed in a mine explosion along with Gale's father. That leaves their family with very little. Gale's family is made up of his mother, Hazelle, and his three younger siblings, Posy, Rory, and Vick. Katniss's family is much smaller, made up of Prim and her Mother. Prim is her 11-year-old sister. It is her first year in the reaping. She only has one slip in the glass bowl, but consequently got picked. Katniss, terrified for her sister, offers to be a tribute. We are introduced to Peeta Mellark, the male tribute. Peeta, the youngest of the four bakers sons and a strong and kind-hearted boy, confesses his love to Katniss during the games. Throughout the book you see Peeta and Katniss's character developing and creating entertainment that will make you love this book.<br /><br />Overall I think was a very good book. She used vocab that was fairly simple that could get boring at points, but still kept you on the edge of your chair. The setting was very creative, and the plot of the story though very disturbing, was highly entertaining. The end of the book was a real cliffhanger, which will almost force you to have to read the second. As a whole I would give this book a 4.5 out of 5 only because the vocab was not very educational, but the book itself is highly enjoyable.
B006G2124E|4.0|I love the book so I thought I would watch the movie as well.  The book has a better ending but I believe the movie stayed true to the book enough that I love it as well.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't believe how good this book is!! I can't wait until December to get the third!!! I love Gideon and Eva!!!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|New Girl starring the adorable Zooey Deschanel is the perfect show! There hasn't been many funny comedies in the last 5, maybe even 10 years but I fell head-over-heels in love with this show over a year ago. This show is well-written and well-acted. The storylines are fresh and I think my favorite episode from Season 1 is \\"The Story of 50\\". I was never really taken with Zooey as a movie actress until I started watching New Girl. Zooey is more engaging as a t.v. actress because she gets to let loose more and her character, Jess is an oddball with a heart of gold! I highly recommend it, enjoy!
B008G12ERC|5.0|It still amazes me that people do not know who MUSE is.  By leaps and bounds, the best band out today.  They have so much to offer and so much versatility.  I travel out of the country just to see them.  I get that everyone does not have the same taste in music, but they have a song for every opinion in any music genre...they are that good.<br />With that being said, they continue to metamorphasize and progress in the right direction always remembering their roots (unlike Radiohead).  2nd Law is amazing and will keep me running when my body says stop...literally.  Buy it and don't look back.  Buy all of their albums and rock out.  I just wish I could have had this before they were done making it...I know, I know...impossible you say.  My favorite band...
B003YL4LYI|2.0|AFFC was long but this was excruciatingly so. A few decent chapters (Theon, Barristan, Davos) but I couldn‘t get into the others. Even Tyrion, who I absolutely loved in the other books was relegated to a sad transient who was stuck on his father‘s last words. This character thinning might be the worst part of the book. The story just never gained enough traction when compared to the first three, and maybe that is my mistake in comparing them to those books.  The bar may be set too high, but that was his doing. It‘s a shame that he seems to have lost his drive/care about the series.  The next book, which I will borrow from a friend, better be ridiculously good.  Right now I would rather get more Dunk & Egg stories as that period in ASOIAF really intrigues me.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I havent played yet but I'm downloading now. so excited heard it was great. I love to play mystery games with my bff. we both really enjoy them and when I can buy them they are wonderful!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This  is an excellent book.  Ken Follett is an outstanding writer, and  I must admit I liked this book in the series better than the last, \\"World Without End.\\"  I am anxiously awaiting the conclusion.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|It seems strait up 80's style Action movies are on the comeback! And Battle ship has something of the 80's feel of Huge Action and Guns, with the new Special effects of Now!<br /><br />A sit back and enjoy action movie!! Siskel & Ebert would give it two thumbs down! (a must see action movie!)  =D
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a fun time waster.  It takes a lot of practice but the missions can be completed.  Good for times when you don't want get too involved in a game waiting to do something more important.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is an excellent storyteller. And this storry from the second world war is very interesting. It can be recommended
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good all round gripping read.  Did it get a little \\"too\\" unrealistic towards the end? Sure.  But by that point i was already captivated.<br />It's interesting the way the author makes you like & dislike certain characters and then flips it around towards the end...trouble was the authur had done such a good job of getting me to like Amy right from the start that i had a hard time disliking her towards the end.<br />A good read!
B005LAJ17M|4.0|Really enjoyed the show and thought that the actors/actresses were great.  I found the development in one or two of the episodes a little slow, but did they ever ramp it up towards the end!<br /><br />Well done and will be looking for season 2!

B005LLSZNM|5.0|Bought the HD version which allows me to stream it pretty much everywhere i am in full HD providing my internet is sufficient and when it isn't i get it in SD which is fine too . I'm loving Prime and Amazon video more and more and at this rate i'll be deleting my accounts with the other video providers sooner rather than later .
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This long awaited chapter 2 of the Fall Of Giants was worth the wait. Although some of the scenarios can be seen coming, it was none the less, a well written sequel. The characters were familiar and kept their presence in the foreground as the younger characters managed to make their mark on this literary world. Mr Follett and his characters remind me of some of the books written on Amercan history by John Jakes. Build on a well liked familiar family and continue into the next chapter of the family and saga. He has found a winning combinatiion of history, drama, love, loss and pathos.  Hiow long till the next book?
B008JAGZDE|5.0|Movie was good, funny.  I know that it was worrying what might happen, but it wasn't bad.  It had many really funny scenes.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Ok so this morning I was playing fine, feeding my dragons and stuff.  I came back home from school and started the app. All my stuff was gone and I was back at level 1. I will uninstall in a few days if not fixed. it had taken me months and I had actually spent some money on the app. please help somehow
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I love the character \\"Jack Reacher.\\" His knowledge, expertise, and commitment to the problem in each story endears him to the reader.  I like seeing problems from his viewpoint and listening to his thinking as he finds a solution.  Certainly his military training and West Point education serve him well as he travels and is engaged in the well developed plot of each story.

B006OOHYIC|1.0|Whatever you do, do not update this game. I was almost finished with all perfects and then lost all progress when it updated. I like the game but now feel like I completely wasted my time.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was well done and followed the book as well as a movie can, in the limited amount of time it has. The actors made the story line belivable.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|You know that sign that's in public bathrooms demanding all employees must was their hands?  \\"Contagion\\" is like the movie version, only the lesson learned will stick with you at a lot longer.<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\" begins on Day 2 as Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Hong Kong speaks affectionately over the phone to a man who is not her husband, her wedding ring clearly visible in the shot.  That indiscretion will embroil her family in a worldwide pandemic when she brings a plague home with her.  It spreads from her to her son and from there to the world.  Matt Damon plays her long-suffering husband Mitch, trying to protect his daughter as the world falls apart.<br /><br />That human story tries to anchor the global events as the virus spirals out of control.  Governments are at first too slow to recognize the threat and then too slow to respond as the contagion outpaces laws, politics, and civility.  It's not long before looting, murder, and mass outages wrack all the major population centers.<br /><br />Throughout the film we follow the stories of individual scientists doing their level best to stem the insidious tide.  Some will rise to the occasion, others selfishly protect their loved ones, and still others simply die trying. Paralleling the plague of the body is the plague of the mind, embodied by Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) as a popular countercultural blogger proposing fictional cures , and his actions prove that disinformation can be more deadly than the virus itself.<br /><br />Despite the personal stories of the scientists and Emhoff, \\"Contagion\\" is oddly bloodless.  The interspersed newscasts never quite bring home the visceral horror of a world gone mad.  There's so much time hopping between geographies that we never stay anchored with one story long enough to really care about the characters.<br /><br />Still, \\"Contagion\\" makes up for its lack of narrative with Steven Soderbergh's excellent cinematography. The bare, haunting score accentuates the camera's lingering moments on hands and surfaces where the invisible virus lurks.  Every sniffle, every handshake, takes on a new grim significance.  By the end of the film we get to see what happened in Day 1, but by then we already know what's coming.<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\" is as much as a public service announcement as it is an entertaining film.  The fact that it manages to be both is still an achievement.  And remember kids, always sneeze into your elbow, always wash your hands, and never sleep with strangers.s lingering moments on hands and surfaces where the invisible virus lurks.

0307895475|5.0|I am a huge fan of strategy guides.  My guide books are a collection unto themselves.  My only regret is that this did not come in a hardcover edition.  I would love to see guidebooks released pre-tabbed.  I end up with yellow stickies all over mine but I guess that's half the fun!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|It was fun to watch but it seemed like a very made up story line. Special effects were outstanding. Given that I have only one ear that works I found sound variations difficult to deal with.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This app does exactly what you need: a basic use calculator. It boasts a full screen display, making it easy to use, and easy to see.  It is also a very stable app on my Fire HD, with no crashing. That's great when you are working thru calculations you don't want to lose in midstream!  Plain and simple...perfect.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a great value of the game for free.  I would like to have a few options for tile and backgrounds if not too much trouble.  I know the one that can be purchased would have more options. but a couple for the free version would be nice.  Also, sometimes the tiles are very small and hard to see.  Large tile option would be good for the visually impaired.  Thank you
B0058YPL66|5.0|When I first started watching, I was worried that this may be some really corny, made for kids only, type series. In later episodes I have found myself completely drawn in and love the show! The character growth and development is amazing. I love learning about Rumpelstiltskin and watching how he had his hands in everyone's business. His character is quite intriguing and so is the whole show. I am adding this to the list of my favorite TV series. I don't really have many of those because I don't watch TV that much unless it really catches my interest.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great time killer. very addictive. I would highly recommend this game.just a fun way to pass time. and its free.
B007THA4FI|1.0|As an adult, I read all the Harry potter books and enjoyed all seven of them.<br /><br />This entire book is boring.  If I would have borrowed it from a library instead of purchasing it, I probably would have quit reading it and returned it.  Since I purchased this book, I read it to the end hoping it would improve.  I wish I would have waited a week and read the reviews and just waited for the book from the library instead of wasting my money purchasing this.  With the Harry Potter books, as soon as I finished one I would get the next one in the series immediately and couldn't put the books down.<br /><br />Rowlings should have done a sequal to the Harry Potter books instead.<br /><br />My advice to people who are huge Harry Potter fans is not to waste your money on this book.  If you insist on reading it, borrow it from a friend or your local library.
0151003084|5.0|This is adorable. I read it to everyone. My 7 year old son says it's his new favorite book. We aren't some creepy goth family... We just appreciate the more morbid side of things sometimes.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|There are plenty of long winded reviews for this record, so I will keep it short and sweet.<br />This album is simply amazing. I liked Zeitgeist, but LOVE Oceania.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Having been a 5th grade teacher for 14 years, I highly recommend this book as a MUST read for that grade level in particular and for All of junior high grades. As an adult who no longer teaches but interacts with the general public on a daily basis (who doesn't?), I additionally recommend this book for ANY reader of ANY age. It is outstanding in it's scope of various perspectives of those among us who live and try to thrive with abnormalities and anomalies of different sorts.<br />It touches on all areas of bullying, acceptance and awareness. FANTASTIC!<br />Jill Browne

The best book in the series was the first one and City of Lost Souls, I think. :) They're all great though! I'm so excited for the movie and I'm just waiting for the last one! Which won't be out until 2014 :\
B000TERDJS|4.0|Only a few songs but they were free. Can't complain too much for free things. Helpful studying tool and does't take up much space.
0316228532|1.0|I only read the first 10 pages of this book.  I was totally disappointed.  It is full of foul language which was really offensive.  I don't know anyone who actually uses that kind of language. I truly believe any author worth reading should have a good enough grasp of the language that they can express themselves without using foul words!!!!  A book considered 'adult' does not have to be full of offensive language to make it 'interesting'.  Also it seemed to be a very wordy, slow moving story. I deleted it from my kindle fire!  If I could give it a negative amount of stars I would.
B006O6EOII|3.0|The doll came with all her parts.. But her leg was broken :( she was full of details as all the dolls have. My daughter chose to keep the broken doll. So I do not have a return to sender review.

B000FCKC4C|3.0|This book will more than likely project your current emotions into your opinion of the book. I was skeptical and wasn't expecting much. The unique feature of the kindle edition is the highlighted notes. There are about 6-7 interesting interpretations of how the world works, you may agree or disagree with them but they are none the less interesting. Overall the story is character defining and and difficult for our protagonist with a typical ending in store. Is it interesting? Yes. Is it informative? That depends on the reader. Is it life changingly informing? Well I can only speak for myself and don't like to project my opinions on others merely inform them. There are lessons you will pick up on, but for me it felt a little flat, but at least it is not nearly as fundamentally flawed as the Secret.<br /><br />Oh. its quite short so is still worth the read.
B005VT42BS|5.0|AFter doing port scans and using ping/etc for the past 20 years, I can safely say this is the best app I've ever run across for doing scans and a whole lot more! Get it immediately!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've enjoyed all the Reacher books, but this one seemed a little slower than most.  In addition, the storyline seemed quite convoluted.  A decent read, but not as compelling of a page-turner as previous installments.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is the only app that does this across Android and iOS. I love this app! Incredibly useful and efficient!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was a great quick read.  The book was interesting, funny  and emotional.  Didn't expect to go from laughing to tears (like REAL tears) so much as the story unfolded.  I was pleasantly surpised by the author portaying teens and young adults with responsible behavior, all the while keeping with real emotions, real thoughts for the age of the characters and the circumstances surrounding the events.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I can only echo what others have said.  Not Microsoft Office but so far it has accessed. all my office files with no problems on my kindle fire.  Spread.sheets are hard to work on even with a stylus.  Everything is readable though.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I have to say, I really liked this movie. I was very happy with this movie. My whole family really enjoyed it. Even though it received terrible reviews it is so worth seeing. I wish I would of saw it on the big screen.Overall a great movie for all.

B005UBNL0A|5.0|Man, i really love this thing! i was bored of using my old rusted laptop with a 1.60GHz Intel Centrino Duo, because i did not have a desktop PC i decided to build one (Because i sold my old Desktop about two years ago) i chose this processor because it was a little bit cheap and it has a new architecture... but before i bought it i started to read bad reviews about it... i was dissapointed because they said that the Phenom II X4 965 was better on some benchmarks but<br />i couldn´t back off then. Now that im using it i paired it with a MSI Radeon HD6670 and whooaa now my games run so good! im proud of this processor! the only<br />way that would not make me buy one of these would be if i had a Phenom X4 9XX CPU but if you have, let's say an Athlon II X2 this thing is worth the bucks.<br />and if you are not pleased with the speed you can Overclock The heck out of it just with a simple multiplier change (i heard that yoo can get 4.6Ghz on the stock cooler!)... i havent oc'd it yet because i want to test it first some time on the stocks but anyway i dont need more power.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Exactally like mine craft pocket edition survivakpl, except with better graphics, more items, quests, and more. It is worth buying instead of getting the demo.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|This is a good action film.  It follows the exact same pattern<br />as the first and so is a good sequel.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|This book was well written review of the 2nd world war from all aspects.  Look forward with anticipation to reading the finalbook in the trigolgy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow! I could not put this book down! Easily the most interesting of the three books! (Of course, you have to read book one for this one to make sense)! I highly reccommend the 50 Shades Trilogy!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Snow White is a tough movie to retell to modern audiences.  Sometimes a movie can be completely ruined by trying to take it in a new direction.  This one turned out pretty good, for the most part.<br /><br />It is far darker and sinister than any other version; there are parts that may give small children nightmares.  As a parent, I would be careful in showing this movie to kids younger than 10-12 years unless they are accustomed to scenes with black magic and violent combat.  The graphic scenes stop short of being gory, keeping the detailed effects of combat just out of the frame, but some of the scenes with magic being used are creepy.<br /><br />The story was fantastic, giving the classic Snow White tale a fresh perspective with a couple of imaginative twists.  Chris Hemsworth (the huntsman) gives a good performance, falling short in a few areas (it was too easy to imagine Thor playing the part).  Kristen Stewart is just plain awful; she's just not a good actress and there are some scenes that are so poorly acted that I had take a star off based on her performance alone.  Fortunately, Charlize Theron is ridiculously good; she steals the show whenever she's on the screen--it's hard to take your eyes off her.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoy dark fantasy / fairy-tales then this movie is a good fit for you.  It's nothing like the original children's tale except for a few areas (like dwarves) but even those are shown in a very different light.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great ending to the trilogy. Not as awesome as the second book, but STILL it's a 'must read'!! Glad I bought it!
B0079R9SOG|2.0|I like the over all system with the belt holder but the B-Grip HS+ hand strap is very aggravating to attach to the tripod adapter in the camera because the thumb screw is to short. You have to push so hard to compress the rubber enough to start the threaded 1/4-20 metal thumb screw. And yes I had all the pieces in perfect alignment. They could redesign the screw to make the threads longer and the thumb tightening wing of the screw shorter so it would still be flush with the bottom of the system. I'm hoping I  can talk them in to doing this so I don't have to send it back. I'd wait to purchase for the next version.
B001NLKT60|3.0|I found this book to be very hard to follow - too many characters, and too much fluff (taking a long time to get to the point). Although, I kept reading the book because it does keep you interested in wanting to find out what is going to happen. As with the first book, I struggled to get through it. Some parts of the book went much faster than other parts.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Loved it. So suspenseful and really gets you emotionally attached to the characters like you feel what they go through. All in all amazing, one of my new favorites! Definately recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This was a great read. i gave it 4 /5 because I found it hard to follow at times. When quotes  were used sometimes I didn‘t know who was talking. the first book was almost identical to 50 Shades of Grey, but this book held it‘s own. Can‘t wait for the next one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|OMG-Ness OMG-Ness!!!! WOW!!! THIS BOOK WAS GOOD. I promise you I felt everything they were feeling! Full of emotion, I was happy, sad and I even cried, my heart was pounding I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I tried to savior the book and read a chapter a day :-0 did't work. I can't wait for the next book. Then on the other hand I don't want it to be over :-(<br />I'm a VERY HAPPY READER!!!!!!!!!!
0439023513|5.0|The book arrived just in time, in a perfect condition. Vey good book enjoyed reading couldn't let it out of my hands!!! I'm sad it's over
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved Reflected in You, it was such a step up from Bared to You! For some reason, I felt like BTY was a hot mess the first time around. But since I read it a few months back and I read a TON of books, I read it again the day before this came out. I liked it much better the second time around and this one was much cleaner (well, cleaner writing, you know know I mean!) and less like Fifty Shades. Obviously, there is still some connection between the two series, but this book set it apart for me. I became much more connected to both characters and can't wait to read the third book. I prefer Gideon over Christian, aside from his name, ick! Although there is still some ridiculous aspect to the prim and proper way he speaks as a 28-year-old, it's much less annoying than Christian's over the top way of speaking. Overall, well done!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've never been one for \\"romance novels\\" which is what I assumed I was about to read....but WOW was I extremely wrong! This is such an easy read and the story takes off imediately. Which held my interest from the get go. Never have i read anything close to the raw human nature thats in this book. Its truely spellbinding!!! Bring on books 2 and 3!!!!
0316228532|4.0|...who has a built-in audience with a set of expectations.  She was writing for a very different set of readers in this book.  I haven't re-read the Potter series or listened to the audiobooks for a while, so I was interested to see how her strengths (description, plot) and weaknesses (wordiness, love of adverbs) as an author translated.  From what I'd read of the book pre-publication, I didn't expect any magic or sly allusion to Harry's world.<br />The characters are very well-drawn and understandable, but not likable for the most part.  At first, I didn't get why Rowling only highlighted the negative aspects of the townsfolk of Pagford, who are mostly people who don't kick puppies or steal from the church collection plate.  It took me too long to realize we were meeting these people in a time of crisis (maybe it was me; maybe it was the writing).<br />What happens when you remove the keystone from an arch?  The novel is about how Barry Fairbrother's death causes the collapse of lives throughout the village, even for people who didn't know him (six degrees of Barry).  Heck, even I missed him, as he was the only character depicted with more positive than negative traits.  He bridged the divide between the various parts of the village (right and wrong side of the tracks, old guard and newcomers, teens and grownups, etc.).  Not everyone is able to survive the collapse.  If some of the anecdotes about Barry's interaction with the rest of the characters had come in the first third of the book instead of the last, it would have made for a richer read (and an easier way to remember which name -- Gavin?  Stuart? -- went with which plot line).<br />All that being said, I liked it and may re-read it in time.  The book seemed to me to be a mix of the movie \\"[[ASIN:B000VK99Z6 Hot Fuzz]]\\" with Eliot's [[ASIN:0141196890 Middlemarch (Penguin Hardback Classics)]].  If not as much fun as the first or as melodramatic as the second, Rowling has created a sharp character study of howflawed people make a flawed community.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|boy this book has me on my toes i want to read more of it they need to make more of them wow
B008L1VZS6|5.0|Many of you, gentle readers, are familiar with the sad background of this \\"melodramma giocoso\\"; in the space of 8 months, Verdi lost both his infant children and his wife to illness and death. Combined with a lackluster performance by two of his principal singers, who sang in muted tones to preserve their voices, and a libretto which Verdi styles the \\"least bad\\" of those offered to him, the opera was a flop! It had three more performances in the 19th century. A change in public taste away from this form of opera in favor of the dramatic tragedy almost certainly was a contributing factor.<br /><br />But yet ...<br /><br />This recording is the first chance we have had to see and hear this opera and judge it on its own merits. Phillips issued a CD version years ago as part of their offering of all the early Verdi operas, which had gleaned scant attention in over 100 years. As evidenced by the five star rating above, I think that the folks at the Teatro Regio di Parma did a bang up job! While it is certainly not of the quality of Verdi's most successful works, it does very well at being what it is, namely an energetic and tuneful romantic comedy.<br /><br />It is certainly well sung and well staged. Guido Loconsolo, whom I had not heard before, brings a warm, rich baritone to the lead role of Belfiore. Anna Caterina Antonacci, with whom I am familiar, does a first rate job as the Marchesa, who is Belfiore's squeeze. The role of Edoardo is sung by Ivan Magri, also previously unheard by me. It is Verdi's only leggiero role, and Magii's sweet voice brings it off very well indeed. I had some initial concerns about his top notes, but once he warmed up, he had all the range and \\"ping\\" anyone would wish for. Alessandra Marienelli does a similar fine job on Edoardo's squeeze, Giulietta. Although listed as a mezzo part, my sense of her voice is one of a much lighter range.<br /><br />The chorus and orchestra under the baton of the talented Donato Renzetti do extremely well.<br/><br />The plot is similar to a number of 19th century romantic comedies: the ladies, who are promised to men they are uninterested in want to hook up with the male leads and the machinations connected with those efforts combine with Belfiore's necessary impersonation of the king to produce some genuinely funny moments.<br /><br />Staging is refreshingly traditional with none of the deplorable trend to regietheatre which seems to dominate many houses these days, and not just in Europe. But it is in no way a stodgy performance. At the risk of seeming trite, to me it sparkles with energy and drive, never losing either balance or focus.<br /><br />The quality of the disc is impeccable; it is produced from an HD master, with crisp vibrant picture and detailed sound in the DTS mode. It is the second in a planned release of all of Verdi's operas in celebration of the bicentennial of the Maestro's birth in 1813. I was guardedly optimistic when I got the disc, because I was unfamiliar with the C Major label, so this old Verdi fan was delighted with both the quality of the performance and of the disc. Bravi!! One other note: C Major has issued (in Europe only as of this writing)a low cost 94 minute disc of excerpts from all of its planned Verdi releases under the name \\"Tutti Verdi\\". It is on its way here and when I get it, I will post a review, if I can find a place to do so.<br /><br />Extras include and introduction to the opera, including some factual material dealing with its composition. More importantly to me, there are trailers for I Lombardi, Nabucco, Ernani and I Due Foscari, all of which got me fired up about the potential of this series. Parma was, at one time if memory serves, called \\"il bocca di lupo\\" (the wolf's mouth\\") because the Parmigiani were a very demanding audience and were merciless to substandard performances by singers. Their enthusiastic reaction mirrors my own.<br /><br />One final note: if you come to  this disc expecting Rigoletto, you will be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you approach it as a step in the development of the greatest of the Italian opera composers, you will, I hope, enjoy it as much as I did. Bravi!! Tutti Bravii!!!

0765322889|1.0|Read the review titled \\"I got your sardonic reserve for you right here\\" by \\"A Reader (USA)\\", he is 100% spot on.  I have never in my life had such a difficult time reading a book.  At times, I had to look-up multiple words and found myself re-reading way too many sentences trying to figure out what the author was trying to say.  I had college textbooks that had better flow than Gardens of the Moon.<br /><br />I tried to like it, I really did, but quit after 350 pages.  Book one of Erikson's new series was sitting in a book store the other day, I read the first page, was completely lost in the language, and closed it.  That sealed the deal, I will never pick up Gardens of the Moon or any other Erikson book again.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, it was kind of interesting, but was all over the place.  The biggest weakness is the complete lack of character development.  Stuff happens to the characters and I just didn't care.  Another reviewer said it best, it would make a good video game storyline, but makes for bad reading.

B00957T6X6|5.0|After watching the first season of Game of Thrones on Blue Ray, I promptly purchased the books as a 4 book set (e-books) and bought the 5th e-book separately.  I was 87th on the waiting list at the library for the one measly e-copy of Game of Thrones.  I was 137th on the waiting list for the one e-copy of Clash of Kings.  The waiting list for physical books was similar.  So I bit the bullet with no regrets.<br /><br />This was one of the most wonderful and fascinating pieces of fiction I have ever read. Thoroughly enjoyable, I will read it all again while I wait for the 2nd season of the Game of Thrones to come out on Blue Ray in March and for George R. R. Martin to get his butt in gear and finish the next 2 installments.  He has created a lifetime of characters and plot lines.<br /><br />And I will also acquire all of the physical books for my personal library.  Yes they are that good.  I love a good series.  This one kept me up at night.  As Ursula Le Guin said in her review of the books, I too \\"read my eyes out.\\"
0307341577|3.0|I read this because I really really liked the author's book Gone Girl..I am glad I read that first as I probably wouldn't have read Gone Girl if I had read Dark Places first. It was somewhat entertaining..but seemed trashy or something I didn't get into any of the characters..just ok.

B000001DQG|1.0|It seems like only yesterday when everybody was waiting with excitement for this follow-up to Elton John's classic and mega-successful double album, &#34;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.&#34; What a shock it was, then, to so many of us when &#34;Caribou&#34; finally showed up and reared its ugly head in record store bins. Good God, where do I begin to say how bad this is?<br /><br />To be fair, &#34;Ticking&#34; and &#34;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me&#34; are indeed as haunting and affecting as many of the reviews here describe. &#34;Ticking&#34; is powerful as a prescient examination of what would sadly become a pathological social trend in a couple of decades. Elton's stark piano adds passion and chilling flourishes to one of Bernie Taupin's most sustained lyrics. Unfortunately, the narrative is marred by a racial slur which is parsed as objective detail but instead seems horrible and gratuitous in context. Well, let's see now. A polite word for &#34;black man&#34; is extended by wordsmith Taupin, but an offensive euphemism for an Asian which was awful then and is awful today is apparently deemed acceptable(?).<br /><br />The rest of these so-called songs, on the other hand, are so uniformly godawful and lacking in wit or concept that they truly have no reason whatsoever for being written, aside from to meet the obligation of Elton's recording contract. &#34;Stinker?&#34; &#34;Solar Prestige A Gammon?&#34; &#34;I've Seen The Saucers?&#34; These, from the men who wrote &#34;Indian Sunset,&#34; &#34;Holiday Inn,&#34; or &#34;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters?&#34;<br /><br />Packaged with what had to be the worst jacket art of the decade, the result is the dessicated pit of Elton John's recording career, and the creative bottom feeder of these &#34;classic years&#34; releases on Rocket too.<br /><br />I gave this a single star for the two excellent songs, and for including some nice bonus tracks, including the awesome &#34;Pinball Wizard&#34; cover from the &#34;Tommy&#34; movie, &#34;Cold Highway,&#34; &#34;Step Into Christmas,&#34; and &#34;Sick City.&#34;34; movie, &#34;Cold Highway,&#34; &#34;Step Into Christmas,&#34; and &#34;Sick City.&#34;

0439023521|1.0|I loved these books as did my husband, but I think 12 years old is too young. Children killing children isn't a good thing for our children to read, in my opinion. Many children are exposed to too much violence at ages where they aren't able to separate it from the real world. Could this potentially happen in our country/world? Would they ever have to kill another child? I think a better age would be 14+. It would be 5-stars for adults, but I made it 1-star because it is inappropriate for 12 year olds IMO.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absoultely loved everything about fifty shades. I am in love with the fact that this novel seduced me with every turn of a page.  This is one of the best love stories I have ever read! Hats off to E.L. James!!!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|coin dozer should be number one and because I think that this is the best app in Connecticut.it is just plain cool.
0316228532|1.0|Just finished this book. My advice to all would be dont buy it!!! If Amazon would take it back I would send it immediatly back.<br />What a huge dissapointment,, I have read X rated books with less foul language. I dont think you can go 2 pages without profanity..and I mean an overbundance of really,really bad language.<br />Boring and not much of a story. the plot was drug out to the end. What little plot there was !!<br /><br /> anyway,,, terrible, terriable book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final book of the \\"Hunger Game\\" series ends with an upbeat note of success. It has some unforeseen twists and turns that heightens the suspense of the outcome, but overall the book continues the theme started with the \\"Hunger Games\\" that the people must ultimately be in control of their destinies - and not some far away Government. If you've devoted time to read the first two books, you certainly want to read the last...

B005S0HNU2|4.0|What can I say? This box set becomes addictive. I really like all the characters and how I get pulled into the storylines. I'd like to see a bit more character development of some of the knights, especially Gawain who isn't in this series as much as I'd like him to be. Bring on the next series please!

B007SSDS24|1.0|The Darkest Hour is a movie that should be left in the Dark. It's story line is Dead. The special effects were the worst. The only thing I can see good about this movie was the ending. I can say save your money and don't rent or buy this movie.[[ASIN:B007SSDS24 The Darkest Hour]]
B005LLSNNE|5.0|SOA is one of the best shows ever! Action packed along with a love story that isn't sappy! I really wasn't interested on watching it until my husband told me to watch just one episode and now I'm hooked! If you're into action with a lot of surprises and drama, this show is for you!
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Here you have a master piece for a magical progressive composer. I only missed out the english subtitles, but the rest is just fine.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 contain so much more detail on characters mentioned in book one.  It's not just the sex keeping you hanging on, but the relationships with all of the characters.  Much better ending than with book one.
B0091REZMW|3.0|quests are too short. no real challenge. its a good time filler if you want something to kill some time.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is just one of several books I've read lately on special operations.  This ranks up there as one of the better books on this subject and should be appreciated by anyone who has been associated with these troops, some of the best in the military services.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Ideas about class warfare, reality TV, and the terrible power a controlling, dictatorial government can wield over the masses collide in a future North America, where global climate change has taken its toll. This series is a must for teenagers and adults alike!

B0028MBKVG|5.0|As a long time runner, every other person I ran into told me I needed to read this book.  Finally, after over a year of stubbornly resisting (because I assumed it was mainly an argument for barefoot running), I ordered it on my Kindle.  I couldn't put it down.  What an awesome story.  The storyline was well done, the cast of characters well-developed and well-placed, and most importantly for me, the book got me excited about running simply for the sake of running.  After years of intense training and workouts, the spark hasn't always been there to get out and run solely for the fun of it.  After reading this book, I eagerly put on my shoes, ran without a plan or a watch, and subsequently ran for hours in the hills with a smile on my face.  It was wonderful.  Furthermore, while the book is not about barefoot running, the way the argument is presented is very compelling.<br /><br />From the perspective of someone that loves running and also loves a good story, I highly recommend this book.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works very well and is a necessity for browsing web pages on my cell phone and opening files on my 2 year old android phone.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This story hooked me in early and had me looking forward to being in the Shantaram world each and every day.  It is one of the rare books that left me sad when finished because I was no longer able to be in that special world any longer.  The author did a good job of making characters interesting such that I felt like I knew and understood each of them along with their place in the larger story.  Well done.<br /><br />Only criticism is that the author gets over-dramatic at times with too much flowery language about big ideas like love, life, and meaning.  I like these topics and I appreciate his attempts to put them into words, but he often goes on and on about these things without actually hitting the mark.<br /><br />But the book is excellent overall and I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I passed over this book title countless times but eventually succumbed to peer pressure.  SHAME ON ME!!!  Okay first of all...WTF?  Is this crap for real?  Any sane person, male or female, would've turned on their heel at the sight of his torture palace.  But let's just say they're desperate...let's just say...how can they possibly get upset when he...gasp...tortures you! What did you think the room was for dumba$$??  Second...we are supposed to believe that little miss is supposed to be his saving grace?  He puts a stop to it all?  RIGHT!!!  He didn't even like \\"vanilla\\" before you but now he only wants that?  \\"That thang must sang\\"!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best app I use for daily Bible reading.  The plans are great. Try the Proverbs and Psalms plan. Keeps me in the word and it can read outloud if you are driving.
B008PE9GSA|3.0|The music is very typical ZZ Top Sound. They are truley a great band. But Billy Gibbons sounds old. Don't get me wrong, the music is rockin' but you can hear the aged voice. I hope they keep rockin' for years to come. I was always amazed how three guys can make there music sound like a 6 or 8 piece band. If you are truley a ZZ Top fan, you will like most of the songs.
B008J34466|4.0|GREAT CD - LOVED IT - SHE HAVE A WONDERFUL VOICE AND I AM GLAD THAT I PURCHASED IT !!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game was very creative. it contained great puzzles. hidden objects and logic.  I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who loves logic games and puzzles.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie about young teens trying to find hidden pirate treasure to save their homes.  The \\"Truffle Shuffle\\" comes from this movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really useful when you want to know exactly how much life you have left and the little battery picture at the top of the kindle just isnt accurate enough.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I can't say enough about how much I love this DVD. I discovered it less than a month before my wedding. I was so frustrated because I wasn't reaching my weight loss goals before the big day. I didn't have a lot of weight to lose, just wanted to lose a couple inches off my waist. After the workout I had lost and inch and a half and my wedding dress looked awesome!!!!!!!! Actually had to do last minute alterations a day before the wedding because I had lost so much weight. It wasn't just my waist, I lost inches throughout my entire body, arms (no more arm fat), back, chest, legs. I look so much stronger and fit! Oh and it significantly reduced cellulite!<br /><br />The DVD doesn't offer clear instructions on how to use the 3 workouts. Another review suggested 10 days of each level. I did 7 days of level 1, 7 days of level 2, and the rest level 3. I wouldn't use weights over 3 lbs, the arm exercises are difficult.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out that I've shied away from DVD workouts that include jumping and lunges because I have bad knees. Jillian really explains proper form, my knees haven't bothered me once during her workouts. She doesn't always explain proper form before the exercise, just keep listening, she will (some instances she didn't explain until your second time doing the workout). This DVD has chanced my life, can't wait to purchase more of her videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1589795474|4.0|I had read this book about 15-20 years ago. At that time, the authors articulated many of the concepts and life style that I had naturley adopted. I was able to pass on some of the phiosophic consepts to my son & daughter. I re-ordered the book to review it and pass it on to my 3 grand sons.<br />I agree with findings & conclusions from this book. it is really about \\"common sense\\" and self disapline.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I love the Spartacus saga and have watched them all repeatedly. Vengeance is by far my favorite. I love how they brought the prequil and the 1st season together. There are about 5 plot twists in every episode, and you can't go wrong with lots of sex and violence. This is the guilty indulgence season where everything you wanted to see happen, happens.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the book.. Read all three in less then a week.. I could not put the book down it was really good!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put my kindle down, i needed more and more.... i soo can not wait till book 4 comes out..... i hope really soon...:)

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft COMPLETELY blows Block Story out of the water! Minecraft's controls are so simple my 4 year old nephew could do it! Block Story? That's a whole nother story...the game is soo complex and it takes so much time out of my life to get out of the water! Minecraft for Kindle Fire is AMAZING! I almist forgot what Blick Stiry was!

B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. its a must see. People shouldn't compare it to the avengers since they're two totally different movies but the dark knight rises in my opinion was amazing. The plot was good, the cast was brilliant, and everything about this movie is just well thought out and genius.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Excellent game with really great graphics. The mystery was intriguing and the hidden object scenes were really well designed. I can't wait for the sequel!
1598561634|5.0|I'm Happy with my BHS. I am surprised how clear are the font, the vowel points are very legible. I recommed this Item for any student. The most important thing, this bible shows Gods name the  tetragrammaton almost 7000 times, Thank you very much!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love this game...I couldn't stop playing it! I actually wish it would've lasted longer but that was my fault like I said I could not stop...wanted to know what was going to happen
0345803485|5.0|I am not ashamed to inhale books like this.  I inhaled Twilight. There, I said it.  And, I did the same with this series.  Some books are good for the brain.....and some books are good for other places.<br /><br />I was actually hesitant to read this series because of all the bad reviews and word-of-mouth reviews that focuses on the 'dirtiness' of it.  After all, I'm a girl who like a good story. So, the question was....was it a good story?  The answer--in abundance.<br /><br />The plot (yes, there is one):  Ana Steele is a senior in college and is coerced into interviewing Christian Grey, a beautiful bachelor billionaire.  What's not to love about this guy?  Sparks fly right away but then....okay, so what makes this different from every other typical romance saga?  Well, Christian has some, um, issues.  Sexual issues with domination which, surprisingly, doesn't freak out the virginal Ana.  She rather enjoys those issues.<br /><br />I read this book like I was getting paid by the letter and I was booking for overtime.  I loved it.  Everything about it.  Book snobs can keep to Charles Dickens but if you like a good story, you got one here.  I found the plot and characters to be highly addictive.  I totally read all 500+ pages in one day and wanted to go to a 24-hour bookstore to get the next installment.  A book drug or druglike book--so addictive.  A guilty pleasure and I'm fine with the addiction.<br /><br />I, too, rather enjoy issues like that.
0385344333|3.0|I admit that I read Reacher's stories for the hand-to-hand combat, the fistfights where he's outnumbered, and the strategy when he goes up against impossible odds with only a few bullets. I just didn't get enough of that to come away satisfied. In addition Reacher, who admits to aging, seemed almost surly. Still, I'll read the next book. I want to know if he gets to Virginia and finds that woman.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've enjoyed Follett's books since I read Pillars of the Earth for the first time, and I had been looking forward to his release of 'Winter' for some time, and was not disappointed.  Can't wait for the conclusion of the trilogy!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Obviously for the price it isn't going to be perfect, I needed a cheaper case to protect my Kindle and not feel or look cheap. That's exactly what I got and I'm happy with it.
B008PE9GSA|1.0|I really wanted to like this cd. The fact that it had been a considerable long time since their last cd (which wasn't that good either)one would think Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill, and Frank Beard would had come up with something original besides recycled old riffs from songs from their past. This album(CD) will sink fast from the charts and be a reminder to ZZ Top Fans that regardless of their once musical prowess in the past ZZ Top now has done nothing but disrepect their fans.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love playing this game especially when I don't get wifi and I'm bored out of my mind. I recommend this game to everyone who is up for a challenge
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is by far one of my faves!!  Reflected in You did not disappoint!!  Great story line and steamy love scenes!!  I could not put it down....I loved it and am counting down to Entwined in You!!
B003XQRZ7E|3.0|This is supposed to be a super group project, but it has its problems. It takes 5 people who are supposed to be amazing, but they don't seem to all be working together on all the songs. The keyboardist can barely be heard, the bass player is unimpressive on most of it, the drums are pretty good, the guitar is good, and the vocals are good. Note, no one was amazing. Many of the songs sounded like some people weren't even involved in the writing of the music at all and their parts end up sounding like a bit of nothing. These songs for the most part don't have any depth.<br /><br />I wouldn't have even noticed this band except they are supposed to be similar to Led Zeppelin. What a joke. Led Zeppelin had 4 amazing band members, and each song was distinct, and everyone contributed to every song that they played in. The only similarity I can see is that Led Zeppelin played some blues songs (not the majority of their songs were blues, btw) and this band played blues songs (the majority of the songs were blues. But even that similarity is weak since Led Zeppelin's blues songs had more depth and memorability.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|beyond met my expectations... it was so emotional....a roller coaster..so sad its over...until December! starting it over again and again!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is hours of fun.. I highly regimens this game to anyone but especially the fans of this arcade game.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Love, loved this movie! Rob Pattinson exceeded my expectations to say the least. Was exciting how they build up his role then he gets knocked down then back up. He was amazing in his role and nailed his character. Made me feel many emotions. Uma Thurman, Kristin Scott Thomas, Chrisina Ricci, Colm Meaney all a superb job in their roles. Was hoping to see this movie in theaters when it first hit the US but was not going to travel 2000 miles. I was disappointed it never made it to closer to my New England. So, waited til the dvd released and now it is mine to watch whenever, in the comforts of my home. Again, Rob did a stellar performance!!! A+++ :)
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Enjoyed read in one day I now want to read all the books charlie read    I also want to date sam.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Whilst not divulging any real secrets, I can see why the US Government wanted to stop this book from being published.  It gives a good first hand account of the mission that located and killed Osama Bin Laden and of the many decisions<br /> that had to be made by the team carrying out the mission.  I thoroughly enjoyed this read and anyone who is an avid reader of military history will also enjoy the book.  Well written, pulling no punches and sometimes graphic in its content it transported me to every moment - I could not put it down!
B0054SMID0|5.0|I was shocked by the ending, I didn't see it coming and I'm usually really good about that!!! I love it when a defense attorney chooses ethics over money...if only the real world worked that way!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This season kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I could not wait to start the next episode.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I was waiting for this book for 2 months and it didn't disappoint. Better than the first and one of the first books that I've ever cried in. Not enough stars on Amazon to rate this book and now can't wait for the 3rd instalment.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its a great game. its challenging but everying gets a little repetitive. fun but it could be a little bit better
B003L77G38|5.0|Fringe is an extremely well-written and well-casted television show. The actors' ability to play two completely different characters is impressive and the complexity of the both the individual stories within each episode and overall throughout the entire series are extraordinarily well thought out.
031620157X|3.0|I'm sure Chris Colfer does a lot of things well - I understand he's an award-winning actor, for example, and a screen writer. But this book just doesn't hold up well in the company of other books in the genre.<br /><br />The genre of fairy tales told as real life has grown up. And other entrants (such as Enchantment by Orson Scott Card, or Wicked by Gregory Maguire) take the stories seriously, fleshing out characters and showing the complexities of relationships and decision making even in the midst of fairytale lands and magic powers. In their hands, the stories get deeper and we get glimpses into the motivations of the characters, there is less black and white, and good vs. bad, and more varying players trying to do their best in contentious times.<br /><br />Mr. Colfer takes this book in just the opposite direction, dumbing down real life in order to make it as broad and two- dimensional as a cartoon.<br /><br />Here's just one example. The main characters, Alex and Conner, realize they must go to Charming Land to get the glass slipper. On the way, Conner complains that the trip to the stream is taking much longer than it should. They must be lost or misdirected. He claims he's seen the same boulder several times already. In some books, this would create an opportunity for the brother and sister to interact and discover deeper strengths and weaknesses. Not in this book. They walk a couple more hours and reach the stream. Apparently they just mastered \\"the journey that took an annoyingly long time.\\"<br /><br />When they get to the stream, they encounter the obligatory stream troll who challenges them to solve a riddle or lose their heads. Nothing wrong with that. It's a nice trope you can build into something. Again, not here. You might expect the kids to try to run away. No Alex. She wants to stay and risk her life solving a riddle because the next bridge is miles away. That's the level of thinking in this book. I'm choosing to risk my life because a walk to thenext bridge could take me a good half hour.<br /><br />When Conner discovers the odds in the riddle game, he does leave. In fact, he runs away and leaves Alex alone on the bridge. Are you kidding me! He leaves his sister on the bridge to face death at the hands of troll.<br /><br />He decides instead to face the stream and attempt to ford it alone. Another opportunity for a lesson. He wades to the deepest part of stream. We're waiting for the river croc, or the water horse, or the stream serpent, to smite him for his foolish attempt to dodge life's fearsome obstacles, or to punish him for leaving his sister. But instead, he wades trough water as deep as his waist... and comes up the bank on the other side. Apparently having just bested \\"the uncomfortably cold stream.\\"<br /><br />And the book goes on and on just like this. In Mr. Colfer's hands, the scariest elements of fairy tales are reduced below the level of annoyance. This is one long trek with few bumps and fewer opportunities to grow, to learn about oneself or one's mates, or to grow closer to them.<br /><br />If you have a young one you'd like to expose to fairy tales that are sanitized and have safety guards, this could be a good book for you. Otherwise, go read Wicked or Enchantment. They'll take you deeper and stay with you longer.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|I recently discovered this band and i love every song it grows on you slowly till you love it i!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004H83IM8|3.0|Bought the three disc set.  Austin #1 was very good: clever, innovative, funny.  Austin #2 was average.  Austin #3 was so bad, I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of it.  It's a damn shame that after Myers did such a good job on #1, he just jogged on #2, and fell apart on #3.  Why do people with talent do that?  I assume easy money?  Success went to head?
B008XG1X18|3.0|worked great on my fire for over a month. Then they did an automatic update and now it freezes all the time and does a force close which is very frustrating.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the story! I would recommend getting the three books at the same time. Once I finished the first book I was eager to star the next one! I am reading all of them again!!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I absolutely love the whole series!! If you're a real fan of Game of Thrones, there is not much negativity about this one. 5 Stars!
B008HK3S9K|4.0|The Timbuk2 Ballistic Envelope Sleeve Case for the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD comes in solid colors or patterns. I chose the Lola Floral/Mulberry pattern because it has the appearance of a stylish wallet or fashionable ladies small handbag for evening wear.<br /><br />This slim, full-padded sleeve is made of high-density foam with super seam construction so it does not unravel. It s airport security friendly because you can leave your Kindle Fire in this sleeve when going through security checkpoints. Its lining also protects your screen from scratching and marring.<br /><br />Other color/design options include: plaid indie with ballistic black; ballistic nylon black, gunmetal, rev red; ballistic nylon algae green with sorbet green; texture grey, ballistic nylon cold blue with canvas tusk grey; and a canvas mahogany brown with tusk grey.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire fits snugly into this sleeve and there is room to tuck in your stylus so it doesn't get misplaced so all you have to search for is those darned reading glasses.

B000L3CHC0|5.0|I was surprised with the watch. Seriously, after all these reviews I've read here I was a bit afraid, because I first ordered it and after read the reviews; pretty dumb, but after I opened the package I let out a big *whoooosh* and felt relieved that it was as I hoped it to be, one nice sturdy watch with guarantee and all, nicely packed. Perfect gift if you ask me, I don't know what watch did others get, but mine was the one I ordered. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something sporty looking, not too flashy but not too idle either.
1592537251|5.0|Amazon recommended this book after I had purchased sketch notebooks.  They got it right!  It is my best art book purchase in years, and I have multitudes of books.  It give pages of examples by expert sketchers, has helpful hints, and is a delight to see.  And one of the most useful features is that each artist lists his materials.  This is not a how-to book, although if you have some proficiency, you will learn from it.  Best of all are enchanting sketches from around the world and lots of them.  A sketch workshop leader called this \\"the bible\\" of references.

B001NVIZ3E|5.0|The Robin Hood story has been badly distorted by liberals.  They claim that the poor were robbing the rich, which they consider moral.<br /><br />This story is based on the original stories, in which the King,his minions, and Bishops were robbing and terrorizing the poor and defenseless. Robin Hood gathered a large group of people who opposed the King. Another nice touch was they were armed and willing to use the weapons against the authorities.<br /><br />On the superficial side, it was a good story of bravado, fighting, and a love story.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|It's a fun game. It's addicting and fast paced.  You always want to beat the clock and isn't that what it's all about.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|It's been a few decades since I was transfixed by Van the Man doing Caravan in The Last Waltz.  I did relaxing exercises through my first pregnancy with Common One as the soundtrack.  I was thrilled to discover The Healing Game a decade after its release.  I saw Van perform in the Astral Weeks tour a few years ago.  I have puzzled over Keep It Simple, finally determining that it's OK to just basically hate a Van Morrison album.<br /><br />What is clear:  Van Morrison is not accessible to his fans.  He doesn't do a lot of interviews (probably a good thing since he is a terrible interview).  But he is a great singer and songwriter and a talented musician.  And if he is all about the music, then all we really need to do is listen.<br /><br />Born to Sing is a really wonderful album.  Morrison has always surrounded himself with the best musicians.  This record often has the feel of a bunch of guys just sitting around playing music on a Sunday afternoon.  It doesn't try too hard.  The lyrics reveal some angst (\\"I'm trying to get away from people, that are trying to drive me mad\\") but the music just flows.  Morrison is famous for covering lots of genres.  Born to Sing is mostly jazz with a soupcon of blues.  It's easy to listen to (not at all the same as Easy Listening).  Morrison on sax has never sounded better.<br /><br />This record is never bombastic.  At 67, Van Morrison has settled down a bit.  However, the lyrics reveal his concern about the dim economic picture in Ireland and elsewhere, particularly on If in Money We Trust and End of the Rainbow.  The final song Educating Archie is a scathing indictment of how the media shapes people's minds. To my mind, the lyrics on this album are collectively some of Van's best ever.  He has not let go of the mystical connection (My Pagan Heart) but sometimes finds it hard to reconcile with reality (Mystic of the East).  Although he is not physically accessible, this music is a tremendous window into what's on Van's mind at themoment.<br /><br />I did approach this album with some trepidation after my negative experience with Keep It Simple.  Born to Sing is a keeper.  It adds a lot to my understanding of Van Morrison as a musician and as a human being.  Highly recommended.
B000HAB4KS|3.0|Contradicting themes that are underdeveloped.  Interesting story about CGI technology though.  The usage of CGI is clever, creating a hyper-reality
B005ZUR724|1.0|I thought this game would be pretty good after looking at some photos and reading some reviews so I got it (although I did see reviews that said &quot;It doesn't download &quot; but that never happened to me) so when I got it I tried over and over to try to download it but it wouldn't work so my advice to u is DO NOT GET THIS GAME
0345803493|5.0|After the way that book I finished, I would have been very distressed had I not known that there is a book II. And book II is every bit as good as its forerunner. DO NOT make the mistake reading these book out of sequence!!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|This is not a great film and its certainly not for everyone. But its a well made \\"B\\" film. The script has a well developed sense of absurdity and irony. The only thing that comes to mind to compare to is the original Starship Troopers. Its only fault is that its a bit too long. But I think I say that about every B movie.<br /><br />We get nazis on the moon planning their revenge on the earth. But the politics on the earth are more interesting.<br /><br />Everyone involved looks likes they had a blast making the thing. Its always the case that energy and fun can raise things up beyond whats possible with a limited budget. I've given it four stars within its genre and four stars for fun.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I bought this item on a local reseller based on the recomendation of other users. It costed me USD 17 compared to the > 150.- on the QNAP page.<br />It is a great deal. Hope this review help others.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|Why would anyone buy these shoes?????  They look like something my grandmother would buy at a discount store.  There are lots of great looking shoes out there, skip these.
B008C40218|5.0|Another great album from the most consistent Indie band around! Probably the best album of theirs since Spokes and Definitely the best since Convict Pool.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|It's not one of Lee Childs best. It made me feel that Reacher was getting to be an old man and not up to his usual skills in the first half of the book, the last half was better and Reacher,s former self came out. The plot was not up to Child,s usual skills.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|Loved last years and got it again for my nephew Star Wars and Legos everyday what more to say. 24 days of Lego fun
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought the story was go  good that after the first book I had to read  the second and third to find out what happened to the lead people.  All the rough and tumble sex scenes in the book got  a bit<br />tedious after a  while.  Some of it surely could have been deleted, and the book  still would have been a  good read.<br />Eleanor Rogers
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|Loved the music from the film so I naturally thought this would be great too and I am not disappointed. I have taken it to school and play it while my students are silently reading, working out solutions to maths problems and doing research that requires concentration. They all like the music and if I forget to put it on they request that I do so. I have found it has a calming and soothing effect on all of us. The only downside is that I think some of the compositions from the movie have been left off the CD. However, what has been included makes for very pleasurable listening.
B002BY77CW|1.0|I could not even get past the first chapter. I thought it was very poorly written, and I found it more suitable for a younger more impressionable mind.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Received the package much quicker than anticipated. Bravo! Have really enjoyed the film. Loved the music and the acting. What a great idea to have the characters in the film the same ages as the characters in the book. While it is very modern in its 'feel' it is also very true to the book (especially when you consider the length of the book that had to be condensed into a 2 hour film). I have read the book many times - it is my favorite- the girls were just as I had imagined them to be, while Kiera Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen were just perfect as Lizzie and Darcy.  I think Joe Wright is a different sort of director - as I watched the movie I was continually aware that some scenes reminded me of art works by Rembrandt, Vermeer etc and the colours of modern artists like Picasso. I was very impressed with the extra features on the DVD and enjoyed the directors commentary. A great feel good movie with wit and charm.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|This is a wonderful version of the Classic with great effects. The only problem was that the DVD was in the case, but it was not secured and was rattling around when I received it. Other than than, fine.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|I've been a big fan of Garbage since I bought their first album back in 1995, and was happy to hear they were finally going to release a new album when I saw the news on their facebook page. I kept putting off the purchase of this album because I wanted the physical CD for the best quality, and then decide if I want to buy the LP later. My first listen through of this album was mixed, but I felt the same way with Bleed Like Me and I like that album a lot more after a few times through.<br /><br />I still think their earlier albums were better overall, and I have every B-side from the self titled and Version 2.0 era, but this one holds up well. I'll edit this review after a few more times through it and seeing them live in the near future.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It's a page turner for sure but dark all the way. My three stars relate, not to the quality, which was high, but to the fact that it was hard for me to enjoy.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|As unfortunate as her life was led, it made for a pretty good book. She really digs deep to remember and express what she went through so people can understand what a CREEP he was.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my father, he loves The Matrix series but has never been able to buy the movies<br />When I saw this I knew I had to buy it<br />I just received it today, the box had a lot of wear and so did the individual inner folders, like a lot of wear<br />Whoever had the collection before was either a smoker or it was housed in a smoking environment, 'cause it stinks of it<br />but I give it a four because the discs are clean and have not one scratch, a bit of dust but nothing of concern
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the story,was very exciting. Wish there was more imaginative tales like this out there. Going to keep looking for more from this author.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great small thin case! it fits snug to the kindle and made of soft yet tough material! it holds wonderfully and protects the device as advertised. It doesn't add any bulk to the kindle so I can still fit it in my pocket! The band holds well so that the flap covering the screen wont slide! Great product!
014241011X|5.0|Okay, I purchased the book and the film for my niece. So she can have mom or dad read her the book and watch the dvd when she wants. Damn, Im becoming a give you a book person...since theres a dvd involved I'm not that bad yet.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I re-read Bared to You before this book and admit I liked Bared to You better the second time.  I think I was fresh off 50 shades the first time I read Bared to You and thought it was too similar to 50 shades.<br /><br />This 2nd book changed my mind.  These characters are completely different and I loved seeing their development in Reflected in You.<br /><br />There are many frustrating moments when you want to scream at both Eva and Gideon but that is what makes a book good!<br /><br />Can't wait for the 3rd book!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Wow...what a great selection of Hendrix songs.  My favorite is \\"Foxy Lady.\\"  This song brings me back to my high school years.  Yes, I'm nearly 50.  I've been playing the tracks over and over and I can't say there is a bad song on the disk.  If you like some good guitar cords, this disk is for you.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun to play. It is just like playing at the carnival or fair. it works great and have had no problems with it so far!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Overall, the books lacked plot and could have easily been condensed into one book.  The end of the series should have put closure on the story and instead, within a few pages created a happily ever after few of the couple.  I read all three to see if the story ever developed and was disappointed.
0345803493|5.0|Absolutely wonderful ...WOW is the best way to describe. This book did not disappoint in any way! I will probably read again soon.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Can't wait for the next book to come out. i could not put my kindle down once I started reading.
0393325172|1.0|Unlike a lot of readers, I found the first 100 or so pages of this book so boring and vague that I just quit reading it.  To me, it wasn't a case of a lousy plot or a boring subject matter, it was the way O'Brian writes.  Far far too much nautical jargon from another era which turned me off.  Yeah, give me some jargon to set the atmosphere, but ye gods, how much do I need?  It's hard enough to keep all the sails and lines straight -- now I gotta figure out all the arcanities of the English of the times.  It's just more than I wish to take on in a book that I read for recreation.  A book that leads to a whole series.  If you don't like the way the author is writing, there's little sense, it seems to me, to plow ahead because you know the book probably will not improve, according to your liking. In other words, it's not that it's a lousy book -- probably far from it -- it's just that I don't feel like doing the work.  I'll stick to hornblower and a couple of other sea-scribes (that would include Nicholas Monserrat) and I'll leave Patrick O'Brian to his many legions of fans.  I won't be missed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cool game to ocuppy ur time don't have to wait long periods to build or collect overall not a bad game
0061726834|4.0|I know what your thinking.. Love, A disease?<br />You gotta be kidding me! I said the same thing. But after reading this book it was one of those reads that helps you capture love and it's meaning. Not only what everyone sees love to be but a friendship too. I liked the book. However the ending makes me kinda wary on readin the next book. But it's got 4 1/2 stars so I might go for it! This book will be made into a movie so it's a reason to read it also.<br />I also recommend reading Divergent by Veronica Roth. If you liked the Hunger games you will fall in love with this book. Personally I would pick Divergent over Hunger games and Delirium any day. But they were all good books, Hope my oppinion helps.
1608871045|3.0|This book is well-crafted. It has a lot of interesting features (post-its, pull out maps, etc.), but it's cheesey because it's written from Batman's perspective. I thought it was going to have notes from Christopher Nolan, or insights from the cast, or comments from the special effects guys, etc. Since Bruce/Batman is the narrator, it detracts from learning ABOUT the movie - it's more like a mini-movie with Bruce sharing a back story. Some nice features, but not what I thought it would be...<br /><br />Update: I purchased: The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy by Jody Duncan Jesser, Janine Pourroy, Michael Caine and Christopher Nolan (Jul 20, 2012).<br /><br />It has much more of what I was looking for. However, buyer be warned. Much of it is just the text of the \\"behind the scenes\\" mini-movies from Batman Begins and I assume, the Dark Knight. There is additional info, and it's a great book, but if you went through the 8 or so \\"extras\\" on the DVD, you got some of the info in \\"The Art and Making...\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find it very easy to use and its a great tool to have I love it. must download it.
0802798225|5.0|I loved this story. I got a glimpse into two peoples lives that were totally different from eachother but just had that connection. I applauded how in the end those that are from two different worlds and and far from perfect can still find love and that special someone who will always love and stand by eachother. The thing this book really showed was that every one is unique and is truly strong. A person doesn't need to fit in like Brittany tried to do they just need to be themselves and everything will work out right. I highly recommend you read this book. It just might teach you a thing or two about how two different worlds can and will collide.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book had me abandoning my job, my friends, and family. It consumed me from the first page to the very end!!!! It had it all. It had suspense, love , friendship, romance, total hotness,  and GIDEON CROSS!!!!!! I didn't think I could ever like a book as much as Bared To You , but this one is my new favorite!!!! Sylvia Day is a Master!!!!! I don't think 10 more books with Gideon and Eva would be enough ! December can not come fast enough!!!!! I  wished away the summer to get to read more of Gideon and Eva's story , now I'm going to wish away the next few months to ring in the new year with Mr. Gideon Cross.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So, I heard about 50 Shades of Grey from a good friend months ago and was a little skeptical before digging into this trilogy. All I knew before reading it was that there is a sexy, rich man and a plain Jane who fall in love and have a a lot of sex. When I started reading it, I kept thinking \\"OH MY GOODNESS? Is this really happening?\\" and was interested in what would happen next. I got hooked from the start of this book and didn't put it down until I had to download the 2nd and 3rd books from Amazon to my Kindle. I'm all about the love stories, and the steamy scenes with Christian and Anastasia just make the story even more addictive. Sure, the author uses the same phrases over and over again, but It's all around a good story. Either you love it or hate it, and if you love it... then read the 2nd and 3rd books too! I think it only get better which each book that follow. It's not your typical boy meets girl love story, and that's what I like about it. I read books to get away from reality, and this certainly does that! Who could say no to an attractive, rich man with a wounded past who is a master of his universe? I certainly can't, and that's why I loved it!

B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is an awesome game I have been waiting for it!!!it is very fun.I think everyone. should. get it
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I went into this book expecting nothing.<br />I thought the cover was lame.<br />It cost, what? 2.99?<br />It looked to be the same plot as every other fantasy book.<br /><br />At any rate, I did not expect anything special.<br /><br />All I can say is FREAKING WOW. This book turned out to be one of the books I have ever read.<br />Blood Song has excellent characters, vast storytelling and is fast-paced.<br />One thing I really noticed was the lack of \\"Fluff\\" and yet incredible richness of detail.<br /><br />Example:<br />In one chapter, our \\"hero\\" must travel out into the woods. Ok good, this is going to be great, something cool is going to happen, I just know it! And it does, the action happens it's awesome and then POOF! They are back where they came from. There is no gabbing on endlessly about how the trees looked on the way back and how the ground was damp, or dry, or had leaves on it. They just are back.<br />At first, this was a bit jarring which I accredit mostly to the fact that almost no other author does this (at least not that I have read). In addition, the kindle formatting was somewhat horrible. Where there should be a section break or something there was one skipped line. That's it. Reading it on the kindle you could barely tell there was a line skipped at all. It wound up looking like one sentence they were in the wood and the next they just were not. It was better if I read on the kindle app for PC.<br /><br />I hope Anthony Ryan continues to write at this caliber and ends up making millions. If he can do that, then he absolutely deserves it. I spread the word wherever I can.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I ordered the movie got it home and it worked just fine. Anyone that loves the Fast movies should get this!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|As a major fan of Follet's fat family sagas (starting with \\"Pillars of the Earth\\")and shorter thriller-tomes (beginning with \\"Eye of the Needle\\"), I had great expectations for WoW.  Since I finished within 3 days, I should have more praise to heap on der Needlemeister.  And -- while ambitious in it's scope and told from multiple, international perspectives -- I found most of the characters stereotypically flat -- and can recall few of them with any real clarity after only a week of \\"curing.\\" Notwithstanding some measure of disappointment (engendered -- no doubt -- by the long-anticipated release), I look forward to book three.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow just Wow...I really disliked Gideon alot in this book but then with his million shades of craziness I would swoon over him...{sigh} And there were times I wanted to strangle Eva with all of her issues. What a Roller Coaster ride. I can not wait for Entwined With You too see how these two survive each other. This is a MUST READ!!!!! I will stop here for I dont want to spoil for anyone...So Wow just Wow!!!!!!!
B005OP7162|5.0|Excellent.  Best dram on T.V. so far for new season 2012!  Highly recommend it.  Can't wait for the new season to start.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys make classical pieces modern and modern pieces classical, either way there's a lot to enjoy, music that makes you smile, laugh, cry and relax all bundled together on one album.<br /><br />I too came to love the Piano Guys on youtube, mainly because of the Cello Wars video which as a bit of a star wars nerd I instantly loved.  But more than the fancy gimmicks in their videos there is also a real sense of comraderie and a true love of music that makes people want to listen.<br /><br />My favourite song (although it's so hard to pick a favourite from all the awesome) would have to be Peponi, everytime I listen to it, it makes me happy.<br /><br />This CD works wonderfully as both background music and as the centerpiece of attention.  It is such a great compilation of truly talented musicians doing what they love.<br /><br />And with Christmas coming up this would make a wonderful gift ;)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The entire trilogy is great.  Couldn't wait for book two and am now reading it slowly because I don't want it to end.  Bought book two the day it came out and will do the same for book three.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case is amazing! I did the water test and no water was found in the case! This case is definitely a great buy!

Will Katniss and Peeta help each other? Who will win the Hunger Games? Your answers await you in The Hunger Games.
0547366205|5.0|My 9 month old daughter loves this book. We've had it a couple of weeks and have read it to her every night. I decided to write this review after I recited the entire book to my work colleague - my enthusiasm apparently knows no bounds.<br /><br />The story is lovely and is just the right length for a young child and the illustrations hold my daughter's attention - in fact, she tries to lift the babies off the page.<br /><br />But.... the best part about this book, for us, is that the pages are the right size and just the right thickness that our daughter has started turning them by herself (we bought the board book version). In fact, she is turning them in time to our voice, because there are just the right number of words per page too. This has been such fun for us as new(ish) parents and she's now started turning the pages in her other books. I would love this book forever, just for that alone, but it really is a lovely, simple, children's story and perfect for bedtime.
B00973DDN2|4.0|Couple of filler songs but that's okay, the prizes in this album are worth the wait. Not every song is a stunner, but a couple do stand out.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love my case. It's so easy to stand and protects my new HD kindle fire just fine. I only wish it had the magnet to make it \\"go to sleep\\".

Its light, pretty and a decent price.

B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Was gripping right to the end.Lee Child writes excellent Reacher thrillers I will always purchase his books through amazon kindle
B00607EWYC|4.0|Just finished Tinkers after my college-aged son gave me his copy.  He loved it.  Since I like to annotate my non-first-edition Hardcover books, I bought the Kindle version.  My son recently decided to move away from technical coursework to follow his passion to pursue Lit and write fiction and poetry.  One of his favorite \\"things\\" about writing is playing with \\"Point of View\\" (POV) and not being constrained by typical things like time, place, tense, person, etc.  Boy, this book was up his creek.  We're in debate on this book as we speak, so maybe he will change my mind about things and/or, as I often do, I will reread the book and my assessments will change.  My view having just concluded the reading:<br />Some BEAUTIFUL prose.<br />Some pretentious/unnecessary prose.<br />Some excellent, descriptive words (I used the dictionary a lot, which I love).<br />Some misused words, probably in overdone efforts to be eclectic (author didn't check the dictionary?) -- a peeve of mine.<br />A few cases of redundancy in descriptions (editor?) -- why describe light coming through trees or slats in three different similes over the course of two pages?<br />GREAT STORY!  Intricate play with POV, time, place, first- second-, third-person changes...emulates the mindsets of the characters and puts the reader inside their heads. Author's writing approach or method keeps the reader on their toes and forces one to just let the story flow and see where it takes you.  I can see why some people grow impatient with it.<br />I liked the horologist-technical and Borealis-mystical metaphorical sidelines (like my son, I am a technical and artistic type), but also understand why some readers might think these sidelines were overdone.<br />Frankly, there are a few parts of the story/text I didn't understand or get...have to reread.  Maybe my son got 'em and will explain them to me.<br />The ending was abrupt (my son says, \\"Think about it, Mom, it was purposeful\\") and though I think I get why it had to end this way, I felt that the author lost an opportunity to involve the reader earlier in what may have been a monumental interaction between two very critical characters that begins in the last words of the book and then the book suddenly ends.<br />I frankly don't think the book deserved the Pulitzer for 2010 relative to other books I read from that year.  However, I did not read the two finalists, so perhaps this book was the best of the three; is this an indictment on the selection committee?  Seems to me the Pulitzer needs to reward inventiveness, technical proficiency, effectiveness, promise, and achievement in the winner...was this the best book of the year? I think not.<br />I do believe this was a great debut novel, shows great promise, and continues a tradition of imaginative and unorthodox storytelling begun by the author's mentors and antecedents.<br />In the end, this was a fascinating and interesting story, told in a clever and oddly insightful way, at some times magical, even lyrical, at sometimes tightly detailed and pragmatic. In fact, I found these latter stretches very descriptive and valuable to the course of the story, I think the author needed more of these.  On the other hand if the author's intent was to tell the story through the mind's eye of one of the characters (when all of the characters seemed to be addled by some major burden, affliction, or sadness), then perhaps an expository style was not in the recipe.<br />What I missed most was a lack of emotion. Given the tragedies endured, I never got misty, I never got angry, I never felt regret.  I give five stars to fiction books that tell stories in all kinds of ways -- I am willing to \\"go with it\\" as they say -- as long as the author does his/her homework and grabs me with emotional punch. Thus the four stars.ad to end this way, I felt that the author lost an opportunity to involve the reader earlier in what may have been a monumental interaction between two very critical characters that begins in the last words of the book and then the book suddenly ends.<br />I frankly don't think the book deserved the Pulitzer for 2010 relative to other books I read from that year.

On the other hand if the author's intent was to tell the story through the mind's eye of one of the characters (when all of the characters seemed to be addled by some major burden, affliction, or sadness), then perhaps an expository style was not in the recipe.<br />What I missed most was a lack of emotion. Given the tragedies endured, I never got misty, I never got angry, I never felt regret.  I give five stars to fiction books that tell stories in all kinds of ways -- I am willing to \\"go with it\\" as they say -- as long as the author does his/her homework and grabs me with emotional punch. Thus the four stars.
B007ZLKKZM|4.0|As a Beatles nerd, I loved the interviews with people who were close to George (Eric Clapton, Paul, Ringo, the Monty Python guys, etc.) and the footage of his life and concerts. You learn about that brutal attack he survived, his religious beliefs, his battle with cancer, his thoughts on drug addiction--it's all here. I especially like parts of the film that describes how he wrote certain songs. Check it out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely Love the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy. It catches your attention and keep you wanting more. Highly recommend!!!!
B008FC4WA4|3.0|This short read almost felt like it ended before it really got started and just as it was getting good too-it's a great, typically quirky Hornbyish concept for a story, with funny and believable characters. Maybe it could be the first chapter of another cracking Nick novel...
0525953728|4.0|Having lived near the Navy Air Station in Pensacola, Fl, I am familiar with some of the training these amazing people have to go through just to be pilots and officers, this book gives an inside look at some of the training and missions that only the best of the best live everyday for the safety of our country and the people in it. These people give up a \\" normal \\" life for complete strangers (us) and their lives after they retire will for ever be anything but normal.<br />Mark Owen gives us a small look into their every day life, a life always on the job.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|Olympus took a while to make this, but they got it right. The attachment ring is metal. It is much flatter than the aftermarket tri-fold cover (47mm v. 56mm overall thickness in place). The plastic shutters have more precision and all four parts close reliably every time! And the price is reasonable too. Go Olympus!
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I love this app.... its so cool but it force closes everytime I turn around. I'm going to keep it for now and hope that improves. 'After recent update no problems :) love it♥
B008KMHFJY|5.0|This book was totally worth it. I couldn't put it down. Great characters, real situations....loved it through and through. Loved the dynamics between the characters. Just wish the ending was a bit more extended.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Like I said for book 2, it has too many sexual parts and too many alike. I found myself skimming those part the last half of book 2 n in book 3. Other than that it was a great story line and wish there was another book to follow.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is really good for school days. I can check the weather so I know what to wear. I really absolutely love it. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT. U wont regret it.
B005XN0SGU|5.0|I've tried multiple comic reading apps (Comixology, ACV, Comicat, etc) possibly all of them.  Comixology is fine for reading comics bought through their service but doesn't do much for you if you have comics through other services. ACV was my go to for a long time but I began running into issues with the random pages in CBR files. Comicat was good but I wanted to try something else.  That's when I found Comic Reader Mobi.  It's a pricey app, but its text zoom feature is awesome and was really nice when I used it on larger devices. It was my exclusive comic app on my Kindle Fire initially, but I was finding myself using the manual select zoom feature a lot to read smaller text that the text zoom couldn't handle.<br /><br />Enter Perfect Viewer.  I quickly fell in love with this reader.  In its basest functionality it works just as well as ACV or Comicat. It shined elsewhere however.  Interface is this reader's hook.  Each area of the screen has a specific function. Want to fit the page to width? Hit the upper left corner.  Want to skip to the next file? Hit the lower right. Need the menu? Tap the vented of the screen.  I rarely find myself pressing somehwere I didn't want. The spacing and areas of function are just that intuitive.<br /><br />It also has some nice options and functions that other apps either don't have or just don't do as well.  This app is packed with features and likely has more options than most.  This may seem daunting to a User that mist wants a simple reader, but don't tarry. These features are most certainly optional, though they surely enhance one's experience. I'm sure they were intended for advanced or more confident users.<br /><br />Lastly, I'd like to bring up a point that really bothered me when I initially started reading digital comics.  Sizing. Most apps just don't do it right. It is a pain in the ass having to go into the menus to resize.  Sure most readers let you pinch to zoom but sometimes I just want to get the page as large as possible and maximize what is on screen.  I mean let's face it. Not all pages read the same and landscape fit to height isn't always going to be the ideal method. The corner functions that let you fit to width or height on the fly is something I'd never think of as a necessity, but I feel like I'd miss it upon swig hint to another app.<br /><br />For the smaller tablets, and definitely on phones, this is likely THE best option.  It easily is a contender on larger tablets as well, but it really shines on smaller devices due to its functionality in resizing pages.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Everyone should see Les Miz, but not everyone can afford to go to London.  This may be the best recording of a live musical performance ever.  Hope you have good headphones or a good sound system on your TV.  I used an 80 inch LCD at my office and the performers almost jumped off the screen. My only reservation is that Nick Jonas does not have a big enough voice for the part of Marius. The reunion of the original 1985 cast with the 25th anniversary cast(s) at the end will bring tears to your eyes. If you love this performance, be sure to get the 10th anniversary performance, which is in many ways even better.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|this barely works don't waste you time.it rodents even rings don't waste you time on this junk and the people say that it work good luck
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Sad to say that it is unusual to find a recording of an actual performance of great musical theater.  Typically, musicals are turned into movies with \\"bankabe\\" movie stars, who can't sing as well as the original cast.  This Phantom has amazing set design and wonderful singing performances. Hope you can find the opportunity to listen on good headphones or a good home theater system. The British know how to put on a great live show!
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day an account off History ones you start you can not stop reading it.  I Started with the intent of reading a couple of chapters on the first night three o'clock in the morning later and have the book gone, well it did not last long.  Start reading it and see what happens
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Overall fun game.  I like the humor of the game and the power ups.  Unlocking the additional jetpacks and other items seem way too expensive to acquire with the in game coins.  I would probably play the game more if it was a bit easier to get the other items.  Right now they're a little too far out of reach.  But that's really my only negative to a quite fun game. Definitely worth picking up.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|pretty good free app.  great time killer.  good fun for the whole family.  looking forward to future updates and game upgrades.
B007TMON8M|5.0|I can't believe how much time I put into this game. It's so much fun to figure out the puzzles and I really like the fact that you have to put your \\"physics thinking cap\\" on to solve the problem.  What a great way to engage a kid that's interested in science to want to learn more.  Great job!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I can't write enough good words about this album. Stumbled across them while looking for something new and they've been a brilliant find. The album is on repeat in my car, at work and on my phone.<br /><br />Kinda Mumford & Sons-esque sans the banjo, but catchier and more upbeat. Just the kind of music I was after coming into summer (southern hemisphere).<br /><br />Get it.
B0087HT36U|4.0|There's a reason why Angry Birds is fun, and this game captures it.  New gameplay elements make it different enough to provide a novel experience.  I enjoyed playing it.  It's unfortunate that other reviews marked this game so low -- it doesn't deserve it.

B008FSCNTK|1.0|This album is absolute garbage. Just awful. I have been a huge fan of Ms. Krall for a long time. However, two stinker albums in a row and one worse than the other has finally closed me out. I have been suckered twice - but never again.

1451696205|5.0|I read this book when I was 16 and it changed my world. Being a major introvert, I grew up never being able to fit in. Reading this book changed all that. It made me feel less alone, which was something I desperately needed. I was on the verge of suicide and wanting to end the constant loneliness that I was enduring. Until the day my English teacher loaned me this book. I stayed up all night reading it. By dawn I was on the last page and crying my eyes out. My heart broke open somehow and I had the epiphany I needed to start living again. If Charlie could put himself out there and be brave, so could I. This book helped me find the courage I never even knew I had. It helped me find my own group of friends, people who would help me grow and learn to love life again. I'm not sure if that ever would have happened if I hadn't read The Perks of Being a Wallflower. This book is a beautiful inspiration to my life and I find myself reading it over and over again. I'm in college now, but this is still my favorite book. The reason this book became so popular (it was constantly having to be replaced in my high school's library from being stolen so much) is because of how powerful it truly is. It tells the painful story of how agonizing adolescence really can be. And how being an introvert isn't necessarily all bad, but if you get out of your head once in awhile, the results might just end up changing your life. Because in the end, I swear we can all be infinite.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Outstanding, riveting, entertaining book.  Holds your attention from start to finish.  Narrative is compelling, painting a picture of a devilish world as it could be after some devastating event which destroyed the world as we know it today.  The characters and their emotions seem real.  My only complaint is that the ending seemed a bit lame, but, then, this book is only the first of a series.  I can't wait to read the next volume.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I saw this movie because like most women on this planet, I like to see sexy men onscreen and fantasize about them. I saw this movie twice in theaters and there was only one reason: Channing Tatum. Without him, this movie wouldn't have even mattered. The plot was horrible, but what was even worse was the actress playing Channing's love interest. Her acting was so horrible that it honestly ruined the majority of the movie for me. Her phony laugh and amateur dialogue literally made me cringe. I really wish they would have chosen someone else. Other than that, Channing's sexiness definitely makes up for it all.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I have a brand new HDTV w/3D I don't watch a lot of tv or movies, but this looked only so-so in the Blu-ray version. It was in HD but their were parts were things pixelated and smeared.<br /><br />The menu structure just to _play_ the damn movie was also annoying.<br /><br />Movie:<br />AWESOME.<br />Seriously, all the main Avengers (Not Hawkeye) were top shelf.<br />Witty one liners that actually were.<br />Action scenes that killed it.<br />Character development.<br />Plausible plot.<br />Excellent casting.
B008BM9L72|2.0|As an ex-pat Brit with scant access to books in English, I bought the 50 Shades trilogy to fill a yawning gap in my English-language reading list.  It satisfied this low key requirement, but in every other respect it was disappointing.  Each book is essentially two books tacked together, both equally unbelievable - a man/woman story plus a series of erotic interludes.  The two main characters are both unbelievable - starting form an abused infancy, the man has achieved a very high level of business success, with few of the disorders which could be expected from his infancy abuse - and who owns nearly all the A-list toys such as a helicopter, private jet, several cars and apartments - not as a crusty 60 year-old but all at the age of 27; whereas the woman has reached the end of university with zero sexual experience and little other experience.  Probably my age, but I found the erotic bits very uninteresting, and the other story much too 'happy ending' orientated.  I hope no one takes it seriously, especially young people - or else they will be seriously disappointed with reality.  Passing through London Airport I was not surprised to see the trilogy as 1, 2 and 3 in the best-selling list - so a lot of money has been made, but how much damage has been done?
0316228532|1.0|I was excited to hear Rowling was writing again and eagerly ordered this book at my local library. Before I picked it up, I started reading some reviews and thought, 'oh no, this doesn't sound like something I'd like'. Sure enough, I started the book and read the first few chapters and then I knew I would NOT be finishing this book. Instead, I skipped throughout the book reading portions of it and now will be returning it to the library.<br /><br />I'm not one for reading 'downer' books and this certainly fits that bill. It's dark, dreary, depressing and the language was so jarring and off-putting that I had to put it down.<br /><br />Maybe she's said why she wanted to write a book like this. But I hope she's got it out of her system and will try again to captivate us with some inspiring fiction.
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|Some Jews delayed their departure from Germany in the pre-WW2 period, and some never had the chance - either way they were trapped in a very hostile environment.  This is one such story - how a young woman lived through several near-disasters, and finally ended up in a very safe situation - which again became unsafe when the Nazis were defeated.  Tension is ever-present, and occasional humour or unintended irony.  It was an interesting read for me.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love this game...fun and can definitely be challenging.  I think it is appropriate for kids and adults. I am enjoying clearing the levels with all gnomes collected.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book began mundane, but morphed into spine-tingling mental gymnastics.  My head got its exercise trying to figure out who, then wait--what, then who, then what, where, when, and why.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a good game to play when you are bored. I can play it all day. Anyone can play it because it is so easy.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Firstly, I found the grammar and the writing in general to be poor, not to mention the slow pace and lack of story line. I cant understand why this book is so popular, if adult fiction interests you, there are loads of free stories online- there is no need to pay for something this RUBBISH!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Very God story plot really added to my enjoyment of the game am looking forword to the next game. would love to find more of this type game.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Fast, good read. I saw nothing to the charges that anything damaging was revealed, except that the author is not a fan of bureaucratic dithering, nor Obama, in particular. Nothing Earth-shattering here; just an interesting glimpse into the ground-level execution of a remarkably historic mission. Worth the price, in my opinion.
0743529030|5.0|I found the CD to be better than the book in that it was done in such a way as to be as if he was holding a lecture with interviews included.<br /><br />To be able to hear the tone of voice and dialogue gave it a much more real life experience.<br /><br />I thoughly enjoyed the audio book.
B00004CXID|4.0|So what could be more exciting than a shoot-out with the law, stealing money and evading the law with those very same ill-gotten gains?  Well vampires of course.  So grab a Peter Cushing archetype, get some holy water balloons and saddle up for a ride.  This is From Dusk Til Dawn.<br /><br />They look like spoilers?  Is that what they looked like? They were vampires!<br /><br />With the combination of Robert Rodriquez's (El mariachi, Desperado, Spy Kids 1 through 4 and Machete) camera techinique and direction, along with Quentin Tarantino's (Reservoir Dogs, True Romance, Pulp Fiction, Natural Born Killers and Jackie Brown) writing From Dusk Til Dawn is born. Based on an idea created by KNB EFX guru Robert Kurtzman (Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn, The Hidden, Phantasm II, Day of the Dead, Bride of Re-Animator, Misery and The People Under the Stairs) an action movie was scrolled up with a vampire element, dropped in Tarantino's lap to create the screenplay for it.  Our film starts off with a crappy little liquor store intro and the clerk (John Hawkes of The Perfect Storm, Identity, Me and You and Everyone We Know and American Gangster) a Texas Ranger (Michael Parks of Night Cries, Rainbow, The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover, Bullfighter, Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Kill Bill: Vol.2 and Planet Terror) gab about the nefarious Gecko brothers that robbed a bank killed several cops a few civilians and took a woman hostage.  The ranger looks annoyed and heads off to use the bathroom; we pan to Seth (George Clooney of E.R., One Fine Day, Batman and Robin, Ocean's Eleven and Up in the Air) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Desperado, Four Rooms and Planet Terror) Gecko are holding a couple of twenty somethings hostage to keep quiet.  A substantial gunfight later the girls ran out of the liquor store as it is engulfed in flames with the Geckos arguing as they leave to Mexico.<br /><br />Laying low and ditching their 71' Cuda the two crooks nab a family in a Winnebago to sneak over the border of Texas thus avoiding roadblocks and police and Federales' entanglement.  Pastor Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel of Thelma & Louise, Reservoir Dogs, The Piano, Cop Land and Red Dragon) with daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis of Kalifornia, Romeo Is Bleeding, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and Natural Born Killers) son Scott (Ernest Liu of The Westing Game, Unhappily Ever After, Once and Again and Unscripted) reluctantly go along with the plan, sneak them across the border and to a bar called the Titty Twister.  Classy right?  After a few rounds with the kids and Geckos, they start to notice people and things aren't quite what they think they are.  Enjoying the floor show by Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek of Desperado, Fled, Fools Rush In, The Faculty, Dogma and Wild Wild West) The Geckos get into another altercation with the bar's locals, some gunplay and blood starts flying and so does the illusion of the dancing girls.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|After reading the first book in this trilogy I was excited to read this one, but found this one not as good as the first. In the first half of the book. It took a long time for me to connect to the characters, but once I did I couldn't but it down.  However, I did learn a few things about history that I didn't know, particularly about the Spanish Civil War and the way the Russians treated the Germans as they marched to Berlin.  I'd recommend this book to lovers of historical fiction but don't consider it a \\"must read.\\"

0316228532|4.0|I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slow start.  The editors should have  prevented this, especially for such a high profile writer.<br /><br />That being said, I really liked the book.  Having skimmed the reviews, I really think some reviewers are unaccustomed to the specific literary genre Rowling used.  Casual Vacancy reminds me of works by writers like Anne Tyler, Maeve Binchy, and Rosamund Pilcher.  They, too, explored the minds of rather ordinary people and their relationships.  Anyone unaccustomed to this genre may find reading such a book somewhat unsettling.  Readers often are forced to see elements of themselves in story characters with whom they may not want to identify.  This can be somewhat unnerving if you are not used to it.  I suspect that is what brought about some of the angriest reviews.  If you are looking for something self-affirming this is not a genre for you. If you are looking for self awareness and incite, you are more likely to appreciate what Rowling was trying to do. I remember years ago reading The Shell Seekers by Rosamund Piltcher and finding elements of myself in a character I found  quite unappealing.It was disturbing. The author intended to  disturb. None of us is perfect and it helps to be aware of that as we slog through our daily lives and impact others.
B003KGBISY|3.0|Greetings fellow amazonians I picked this up for our japanese themed night me and the boys were having. First we went to kamikaze which is a local hibachi place that served up some great streak and onions (mongo had to wait in the car we didn't want another incident like we had with the indian food). Then it was off to sumo wrestling (you know those inflatable kind that you bounce off each other with) where we had a round robin tournament. I won both of my matches and eugene beat mongo so it was eugene went up against me in the final and I took him down (since mongo can't walk very well he would just stumble and fall each time). Once we made it back to the trailer I put in the movie. First eugene complained that it wasn't \\"the best japaneses film\\" because it wasn't akira. Then mongo was angry because he hadn't eaten and lost all his sumo matches. I tried to shut them both up by telling them that this was the reason all other japanese films were made (and I handed mongo a box of cheerios to eat during the movie). Both of these knuckleheads complained during the movie. Eugene complained that there wasn't enough animation in the film and mongo was angry because he can't read. I had to finally wait for both of them to fall asleep to rewatch the movie, but since it is so long a fell asleep on the couch during the middle of it and now I have a stiff neck. Arigatou amazon
B008QE9VJI|4.0|I'm not sure the filmmakers intended for this to become THE Movie of the Century, so with that in mind, it is great for what it's meant to be:  a fresh and entertaining take on a most unusual \\"soap opera\\" from the past.  I faithfully rented many episodes of the original Dark Shadows (on VHS) as a late teen from a local video store, so when this came to the theaters another friend and I couldn't wait to get our seats!  To be able to watch the story unfold in less than 2 hours as opposed to over 1200 episodes is a great boon!  Who has time for soap operas anymore?  And just what is a \\"local video store\\" anyway? The movie certainly respins the yarn with plenty of Burton flair and creativity.  The 70's theme raised the quirky and hilarious factors up several notches.  I loved Alice Cooper's appearance as well - I was a huge fan of his as a teen.  Probably unusual in the late 80's for a 16-year-old to love Alice Cooper and an old vampire soap opera.  Also unusual - I'm one of the few Johnny Depp fans that doesn't always or automatically appreciate Burton's work (particularly his animated offerings).  I will admit Burton takes on formidable masterpieces and somehow manages to improve upon them.  He not only keeps the soul of the story intact but also deftly deepens and accentuates it.  I absolutely adore Burton's Sweeney Todd (I'd give 6 Stars for that one!) and applaud Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sleepy Hollow, and Alice in Wonderland.  Now Dark Shadows can be added to the list of the duo's thumbs up retellings of exceptional classics.  Despite its PG-13 rating, I find it inappropriate for young teens, but very appropriate for a night of lighthearted, albeit somewhat dark, laughs.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  The 3D wasn't so great because it was the red/blue style glasses, but it was interesting to see it in a different format.  The red/blue shifts the colors a bit, so it doesn't like as vibrant as the original movie, but it's tolerable.  I guess that's all you can really expect for $10.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|I was gifted the first book, \\"Bared to You\\". I read the editorial reviews & comments. Some reviewers claimed it was better than the Fifty Shades of Grey series. Yes, there were plenty of hot sex scenes but I found myself scanning through many of them from boredom. Also, it seemed to me all of the characters were \\"fifty shades f*****up\\". There is no comparing the two books. The main two characters kept coming and going, breaking-up and making-up, hot and cold, angry and then calm. It was very frustrating for me to read. The book was like riding an emotional roller coaster page after page after page. That was the jest of it. After reading the first book, I thought that the action had to be in the second book so I bought it. But I was bored more with second book. I guess I was expecting a different type of drama. I don't think that I will buy the third installment.

Couples dance in a courtyard. Men struggle in a courtyard celebration.  Years later this man travels by train to the West. One man is ordered to leave a cow. Another man objects to this, but he also leaves. We see people walking with their baggage. [Believable?] A man visits a house. \\"Cash or cattle?\\" A train stops and travelers get off from a flatbed rail car. [This was during the worst economic depression of the 19th century.] There is a conflict in the street. Rich men talk about the danger from paupers. Juries won't convict. They hired fifty gunmen to invade Johnson County (Wyoming), kill the marshal, and 125 of the settlers. The Governor, Congressmen, and US President are in their pocket. [Are things different today?] \\"Everything can be done.\\"<br /><br />Marshal Averell tells them to stay out of his county. Men gamble on a cockfight in a tavern. Averell tells of the death list of the Cattlemen's Association. Later Kate is happy to see him. There is a small village with settlers (who speak a Slavic language). People roller-skate on a wooden floor. [Believable?] We see many scenes that pad out this story. Averell advises Kate to leave the state before the war. The Stockgrower's Association offers a bounty of $50 for each dead man. Nate asks Kate to quit her business. Averell reads the names on the death list. We see men dragging cut timber. Averell warns the people about the planned murders of 125 men. A train carries the gunmen and their horses to Johnson County. [They were told they were hired to enforce arrest warrants.] Men attack Kate, Averell rescues her. He warns her of worse events to come. \\"I'll miss you.\\" Citizens call on Averell for help. The gunmen surround a cabin and shoot at the inhabitants, who shoot back. A fire wagon is pushed against the cabin, Nate writes a farewell note. He is shot dead when he leaves the cabin.<br /><br />The men of the town gather to discuss the situation. The Cattlemen want to steal the lands and cattle of the small ranchers and homesteaders. [A modern form of feudalism, like eminent domain.] The citizens must organize to defend themselves. Armed, they ride out to attack the terrorist gunmen of the Cattlemen's Association. Averell recommends an attack using wooden shields on wheels. There is more shooting, wounded men fall. The terrorists are surrounded. But the US Cavalry rides to their rescue! [This violates US law by using the military to enforce civil law.] Later there is an attack on Ella and Jim, Ella die. Jim reminisces years later. [In history the lynching of \\"Cattle Kate\\" occurred in the beginning.]<br /><br />The value of this movie is its story about the infamous Johnson County War, the big corporations against the small ranchers and farmers. This event inspired many of the Western films of the 1930s and 1940s. A big rancher, who was in cahoots with the crooked mayor and sheriff, tried to steal the lands of ordinary citizens (until they could unite against their oppressors). This movie is overlong, it needed a better a better scriptwriter. It is not accurate in small details (except the murder of Nate Champion). The actions of the hired gunmen were far worse than shown in this movie. Asa Mercer was a journalist and eyewitness who wrote \\"The Banditti of the Plains\\". There is another book by a historian about \\"The Johnson County War\\".

B0051T47NQ|4.0|Although meant to be scary (and there were a few parts), I've put this on my fun party movie shelf. You and your guests will have a great time laughing, and it doesn't matter if the party gets too loud to hear thanks to the wonderful subtitles. I was also impressed with the scenery. Thanks to the beautiful footage, I've put the movie location on my 'bucket list' of places to visit. The actors did a good job, not too over the top yet not too subtle (we are talking about big hairy trolls here). Overall I thought it was a cute 'lost footage' film that was a lot of fun. I'll probably watch it a few more times to concentrate on the lovely mountain locations.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I liked this game on iOS and when it came to Android I jumped on it.  Sadly it is not Jelly Bean 4.1.1 compatible.  All in all though it's your basic knock'em down game.  Enjoyable when your needing a quick time waster.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I can't believe how these headphones sound for the price I bought them for. Nice and clear sound and great clear bass. I like drums and bass heavy songs but I want clear undistorted bass and these provide that in spades. Excellent product and I would recommend these to anyone looking for a great budget headphone that competes with the more expensive brands.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|absolutely love this game! bring on the updates! &lt;3 ubisoft has really been hitting homeruns lately - im happy to see them step it up.
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|I saw the Band of Joy play at the Greek Theater in L.A. about two months after this show was filmed.  Very similar show and just as great.  I've watched the DVD several times, and find myself wanting to watch it again and again.  This seemed like a real band, in which all of the members really expressed themselves.  I wish Robert Plant had kept the Band of Joy together because they were onto something really good.  Overall, the feeling is very warm and positive, as this DVD illustrates.
B0092W2GSG|5.0|Another great offering by Tucson based band Calexico.  Despite other reviews I have read, this album is not a huge departure from previous albums. Algiers tones down some of the desert noir made famous on albums such as 'feast of wire' and 'black light' in favor of more accessible songs similar to the offerings from 'carried to dust'.  But don't worry the borderlands are not far from this album with trumpets still crooning and with at least two songs in spanish the Calexico you have grown to love is firmly represented on this piece.  However a new set of singles come out of this album that will go down as some of the best song writing of Calexico's career.  Good work guys!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I'm a HUGE Supernatural fan. The seasons come with hours of bonus features and thinks for you to geek out on. If you are a true fan, you need to buy these. I have all of the seasons and I watch them regularly. You won't be disappointed.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I loved this movie in theaters and, right up front, the quality of the picture and sound on this home release are top notch. If you enjoyed Avengers then don't hesitate to pick up this great combo pack. I was very excited to see that Marvel was putting out this four disc version of the release. I get very frustrated having to choose which version of a film I'm going to buy or have to purchase it multiple times to get the formats I'd like. With this all-inclusive package I get everything. I can watch the Blu Ray in the livin groom, the DVD in the bedroom, the digital copy on the go, and I have the 3D Blu Ray if I ever find myself motivated to invest in a 3D TV (unlikely, but nice to have the option). I'm also looking forward to downloading the included digital soundtrack.<br /><br />The only real negative I can point to, and this won't matter to some people and doesn't make me regret my purchase in any way, is the underwhelming selection of bonus features on this release.  As has been mentioned in other reviews here, perhaps I've been spoiled by the likes of the LOTR Blu Ray package, with its hours of behind the scenes footage and featurettes, but I wasn't impressed with what the Avengers Blu Ray had to offer.<br /><br />The Joss Whedon commentary is interesting and somewhat insightful, but the two featurettes (\\"Assembling the Ultimate Team\\" & \\"A Visual Journey\\") were quite short and light on details in terms of the production.  Even the gag-reel seemed canned and was quite short.  I've yet to try out the second-screen option so I'll have to see if that adds anything significant.<br /><br />Even having said that, just having this all-inclusive packaging of a great film makes up for almost any shortcomings.

B009329ZF2|5.0|This is a movie that many will say is unimaginable and has too much violence but I find it great for a mindless diversion from all the gutter politics the politicians are putting on the airways, I often think of Tom Clancy's \\"Debt of Honor\\" where the entire top of government is destroyed and a honest man gets to rebuild the government from the top down. But this is an interesting movie and many times I have wondered how aliens would think of us.

0316098337|3.0|If you are a guy, I strongly suggest not reading it unless you are extremely sick minded, just to let you know, this book is seriously screwed up. But if you are a lady, you will probably find this book more entertaining.

B000A7DVR2|4.0|As an avid movie goer and author of, [[ASIN:B008WBPZVI Ephemeral's Beautiful Nightmare]] I love off beat movies like Fargo and Barton Fink but no movie has grown on me more than The Coen Brothers, The Big Low., I just found out recently there is an entire F-ing religion based on the Dude called Dudism. [[ASIN:1453649948 The Dude De Ching]]  Do you know how crazy that is, \\"All I want is a rug.\\" \\"You're not Mr. Lebowski, I'm just the Dude.\\" John Goodman at his best.<br /><br />I have to admit, I also love the movie, O Brother where art thou, and Fargo, and... the list goes on. O.K., intolerable Cruelty. I love it.<br /><br />Anyway, good stuff. Hey Dude! I do not write reviews to be helpful in any other way but to say how much I enjoyed the product. I guess if you loved these movies then you might like these too:<br /><br />Wonder Boys<br />Adaptation<br />Shawshank Redemption<br />Amelie<br />The Fight Club<br />Choclat<br /><br />I guess that's what I am doing here.<br /><br />Old movies I love:<br /><br />A Phladelphia Story (Cary Grant)<br />Casablanca
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun, easy, yet challenging if you want it to be,  and oh so addicting!  Five stars from me,  no question.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time and I read lots of books.  Once I started reading it,  I couldn't put it down,  I just needed to know what happed next.  I have read all three books and will read them over and over.  I find something new each time I read them.  Very, very good reading.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|This is currently my favorite band.  This music makes me happy!  And I am not a usual country music fan, but let's face it, right now country artists have the best lyrics in contemporary music.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|With his typical straight-forwardness and lack of sentimentality (but, at the same time, real gentleness and humanity), Hitchens illuminates his experience approaching death.  And it was oddly right and reinforcing that the book was incomplete upon his death and that loose ends and remnants made up the last bits.
B008I3QZKU|2.0|This is the first CD I've ever preordered on Amazon.  Since then, I've received about an email a day titled \\"New and Similar to Battle Born.\\"  This is annoy enough in itself, but coupled with the fact that now that I have the CD there isn't a single song I like on it (which is weird considering I've liked most every song on the other Killers CDs), it's so much worse.  I don't want to listen to this CD and I definitely won't order anything new and similar to it.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I know Arnold doesn't need my endorsement but he has it none the less. He has a life that's hard to top and thus a great autobiography. It appears that people are basing their judgement of his book solely on their personal feelings about Arnold. I have no idea why someone would even read the autobiography of a man they did not like. Certainly he's not perfect but when my generation out grew Superman he was the closest flesh and blood equivalent. Sure he has a huge ego but that is part of his larger-than-life charm. Ego is not always a bad thing, especially when you can back it up and his success speaks volumes. Would you want anything less from an action hero and super bodybuilder?
0316228532|2.0|Alas, I WANT to like this.  I am not put off by the language or adult content.  I am getting tired of having to thumb back through the book to remind myself who, exactly, several characters are - I am getting some of them mixed up with each other.  I find myself wishing for a character list at the front of the book (like you get in some big fat old Russian novels ;-) ).  I am on page 143 and so far have found not one single character I can give a hoot about - not one seems sympathetic or to have redeeming qualities that would make me want to keep reading to see what happens to them.  Sigh.  Page 143 and I think I am done.  :-(<br /><br />I do look forward to J.K. Rowling's NEXT book, as I do like her style of writing.  Now that she has gotten her \\"must write as different a book from Harry Potter as possible\\" out of her system, I bet her next book is great! :-)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm really pleased with both the quality of this game and also the content. For it to be only $.99, I got to play for hours! I can't wait for the sequel!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  hard to put it down.  looking forward to the next one.  graphics are great and didn't have any problems or glitches.
B005LAIHPE|2.0|It was great to see the wonderful old battleship, \\"Missouri\\" and some of the fine old Navy personnel that may have been (I think) among the crew on her.  Of course, I'm also assuming that the battleship was really THE battleship and not just a clever computer-graphics creation.<br /><br />Anyway, the rest of the movie is terribly simple-minded twaddle, whose \\"stars\\" are more like amateurs in a YouTube video. The plot is a joke, and the character development is even a bigger joke.  The special effects?  Meh, it's 2012, and so everybody's got good special effects.  But without a plausible plot, it's just an exercise in computer software.  Bottom line: this movie is really just another one of those pizza-and-beer movies, best seen after you've already had quite a bit of beer so that your brain won't be expecting very much of anything.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|The relationship between the characters was great. The general way in which it was filmed was excellent. Was it scary, for me, not till the credits popped up on my screen and started to roll at scary spends and sounds started emitting from my tv. ThAt was scary.<br /><br />And I wasn't Not scared because there weren't monsters or special effects in it. I've been scared and immensely disturbed by that tv show, A Haunting, one to many times and it plays out along similar lines to this movie, it's just truEr stories. It's... they make the scenes too predictable. I watched it late at night with my bedroom light off so I could get the full effect, but I didn't. The story moves too slow and it's, well, frankly, it's wacky. I believe in the supernatural. I believe such things are possible. They're acting was even believable, but the timing, i don't know. I spent the entire movie unphased.<br /><br />It makes you ask questions, gets people talking in a good way and for some, obviously in a bad way. But like somebody who I don't know said, any publicity is good publicity. Makes you wonder about things, and why certain things happened. What if certain things were done differently. What if Micah listened to his girlfriend? What if they'd gone to the hotel? Why did she do this or that? What's with the cross and why.. The questions are endless.<br /><br />I watched it to watch it, not to anticipate every scary moment, and even though I did this, I was not scared and I'm the easily frightened kind. You May be frightened, I don't know.<br /><br />The plot is good, open to interpretation to a certain point, pretty good acting, a good looking cast with reality involved. Katie is a real, healthy woman. Not a model, real, and I respect them for that.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|What a story!  I thought the characters were extremely well developed.  Dell was stalwart throughout all the tribulations of his family.  Definitely an interesting look at rural Canada, as well as the strange things people do.  I would recommend this book.

0689854684|5.0|When selecting books for children, both boys and girls, I almost always choose \\"traditional\\" childrens stories. They're always appropriate. Also, I have to admit, I haven't read a lot of the more modern children's books.
B009G8GRX6|1.0|I am a huge Muse fan but for me this new album is extremely disappointing. I listened once and that's enough. Super boring. Whatever happened to rock and roll? I am so sick of the 80s electronica revival. I know artists need to grow, explore, and evolve. But for me, the results of this exploration are bland and unremarkable.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love all the drama and action. Makes me wan to go buy a Harley and join. Love jacks. He is awesome.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book gives new meaning to up and down. I, like many other readers, seem to have a love/hate relationship with Gideon Cross and Eva. It was great to pick up this book and have it start immediately where book 1 left off. That so rarely happens with books in a series and it was a welcome change. This book is no different that Gideon is an over-bearing and controlling dominant that shows all his emotion through sex and he cannot keep his hands off Eva. Eva is still literally head over heels for Gideon and sometimes cannot physically or emotionally understand her true feelings for him. They both realize that their physical connection isn't healthy, but they just can't seem to get enough. The love scenes in this book are hot, hot, HOT!!!!<br /><br />Both of these characters have unspeakable pasts and are struggling to learn to trust one another and deal with their own demons, let alone the demons of the other. To call them each a victim doesn't seem to give their history justice. Eva's step-brother is introduced again in book 2 and her past comes full circle with nightmares and horrible consequences. Gideon chases his own past and cannot control his nighttime terrors.<br /><br />Eva's best friend and roommate Cary is also self-destructive and his past is no better than the past of Gideon and Eva. He has a major conflict in this book that will stun and affect everyone in his life.<br /><br />Will they learn to trust one another...will their relationship, as screwed up as it is, be able to stand the test of time???<br /><br />Overall I was so pleased with this book and like most other readers I read it is a day because I couldn't stop. I have already pre-ordered 'Entwined to You\\" that is due out 12/31. I just can't wait to see how it all comes together in the end...
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Ms Reichs' writing is wonderful as always. I am always anxiously waiting for the next book to finally be available.
0345803485|1.0|I was bamboozled by the sexy cover photo and popularity of this book.<br /><br />1.  Four words: this book is terrible.  Two chapters in and I could not wait for Ana and Christian to just do it already and save us the trouble of having to read the same thing over and over.  I stopped at page 40 but only because I wanted to give it a bit more time to see if it would pick up.  I should've stopped at page 5.  How is it that there are two more books?!<br /><br />2.  I get that it's written for teenage girls and can overlook the repetitive lines, shallow dialogue, blandly naive banter, frenetic energy, British lapses/bad writing, and self-questioning thoughts going through Ana's head as I would imagine this is what it's like to be in the mind of a 15 year old girl.  However, the saddest thing is that the female protagonist does not ultimately represent strength of character, conviction, grace, nor intelligence.  She is dull, not witty, conveniently pretty, predictably desired by her peers, cheap, common, and accessible.  What an unsatisfying role model for young girls/women today.  Unfortunately, the popularity of this book shows that we are going backwards to a time when women need to be told what to do and should blush at the presence of powerful, rich, and famous men in order to have any self worth.  Between Ana and Bella Swan, there is going to be a generation of women with Daddy/older men issues.  If I have a daughter, I would never let her read this book -- and not because of the boring-core porn.<br /><br />3.  Christian Grey makes me laugh and cringe at the same time.  What a poser.  There is nothing alluring about him except his name.<br /><br />4.  I skipped ahead to the porny parts.  I have never tried BDSM but if it's as uninspiring as it this book makes it out to be, I think I'll pass.  It barely qualifies as erotica because it's not erotic.<br /><br />Save your time and money.  This book is not for you if you are over 15 and/or have half a brain.
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much, it's nice to have an accurate account of the subject that has been blown out of porportion!  Mr. Owen is setting the record of events straight!  I would like to see our Administration do the same!!!!
B008EDFAL4|5.0|A classic album from what I suppose were Dylan's middle period. What makes it a classic? Collaborating with George Harrison is enough for me! ...add to that a song about John Lennon (Went to See the Gypsy), a song about the day that he got his honorary degree (Day of the Locusts), a fine experiment with jazz singing style (If Dogs Run Free), and don't forget that this is one of the albums made when he had stopped smoking and his voice is smooth as honey on a warm summer day.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|It seems possible that Bob Dylan will gain new fans with this album. Roll on John, the last track, is a highly accessible tribute to John Lennon, mixing-in some lines closely associated with John both as a solo artist and as one of the Beatles. The tune too, and Bob's rendering of it on piano are reminiscent of John's style. The track before that, Tempest, about the sinking of the Titanic, also has easy appeal through its theme and a tune that reflects the triumph of \\"All the lords and ladies heading for the eternal shore\\". The tune of course also serves to counterpoint the tragedy of those who \\"drowned upon the staircase of brass and polished gold\\" and the \\"dead bodies floating in the double bottomed hull\\".<br /><br />Now you've got a taste for it, start the CD from the beginning and enjoy Duquesne Whistle, with its distinctive old-style intro and an absolutely first rate shuffle arrangement that clearly the musicians themselves found a lot of fun. Continue to Soon After Midnight, a gentle ballad with some truly beautiful words, and some that might puzzle at first (\\"I've been down on the killing floors\\" and \\"I'll drag his corpse through the mud\\"). Explanation (maybe): Bob's in the Deep South; New Orleans, perhaps, or Atlanta? Both these tunes pass the old grey whistle test - i.e. are catchy enough for the old chap on the door to be heard whistling them.<br /><br />While we're picking out the pretty tunes, let's try the descending scale of Long and Wasted Years. As ever, though, beware of the pretty tune. Behind this one is as bleak a picture of failed marriage as was ever put in song.<br /><br />There are two twelve bar blues songs on the album, Narrow Way and Early Roman Kings. The key to Early Roman Kings is not Romulus and his 8th to 6th Century BCE successors, but a 1960's New York City gang. The words of Narrow Way remind me of From a Buick 6 on the Highway 61 Revisited album; Bob seems to have hit on another junkyard angel. The words at first seem inconsequential - not a lot more than something to fit the music - but then they coalesce and do after all have meaning.<br /><br />Scarlet Town again has a very full and interesting instrumental backing, even including an instrumental break, which most of the songs here do not. The words describe a place that certainly isn't heaven, \\"The streets have names that you can't pronounce. Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce\\", but it doesn't seem to be Hell either, just another wretched place here on earth. This is the song in which the lyric police have found lines that owe something to the 19th Century 'Fireside' poet John Greenleaf Whittier. I have no argument with that; it adds to the richness of Bob's work and the experience of not only listening to it but following-up the many leads to other music and literature. (In amongst the Lennon quotes in Roll on John, by the way, is some William Blake.)<br /><br />I have left Pay in Blood and Tin Angel until last. In Pay in Blood, Bob has come to bury, not to praise:-<br /><br />\\"How I made it back home, nobody knows<br />Or how I survived so many blows.<br />I've been through hell, what good did it do?<br />You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?<br />I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse,<br />Show me your moral virtues first.\\"<br /><br />Those are mighty tough words, and yet \\"I pay in blood, but it's not my own\\" and more than a few other lines are surely Christian New Testament references (with a renewed visit to Bob's earlier theme - in Foot of Pride - of the uncertain or mixed parentage of Jesus). It's deep, very deep.<br /><br />And so, as a total verbal and musical experience, is Tin Angel. Again Bob is dredging the depths of human experience; this time betrayal in love, confrontation, murder and suicide. When the curtain falls, all on the stage lie dead.<br /><br />I won't go down the road of comparison with other Bob Dylan albums. All are different, and in my view he never yet made a bad one (Yes, really!). Tempest stands on its own, and it most certainly does stand, not fall. Some may be easier to get in to, but, as I have written, there is much here that will be attractive to those who have not previously been touched by Dylan. There is also an absolute feast for those of us who have already travelled a very long way with him.tands on its own, and it most certainly does stand, not fall.

B0085TKAW6|5.0|As always Ken Follett's books makes great reading. Winter of the World is a great novel with real history the way people experienced life starting from 1933 the time of the great depression and war that followed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was so excited when this book was coming out. I waited till Midnight to buy it on the release date. I waited two months for this book to come out and when it did, I couldn't put it down. I ended up finishing it in less than two days. I have to say that it was well worth the wait. Reflected in You was full of surprises and it kept me wondering and waiting for what's going to happen next. I actually can't wait for the next book to this series. I'm just sad that I have to wait a couple more months for the next one. Waiting impatiently again. Haha
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Not much to say about this case then It is not strong enough. It took no more than a week and just one drop from just sitting on the leaving room and it chipped from one of the corners. now it just doesn't look good, but it can't be put on water since the inside is exposed.<br />The case does feel cheap hard plastic, but nothing like the otterbox. Don't waste your money on this.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|Wow...I expected that ending and at the same time was totally and utterly unprepared for it. Did anyone else shed tears and feel numb by the last page? I'm extremely depressed right now and I need something happy to focus on. However, I currently have access to the sequel of this book and despite my shocked brain, I will begin to read Pandemonium now...after a short break...*sigh*<br /><br />Think AMONG THE HIDDEN mixed with THE UGLIES Series and you get this...I like it ^.^ (even tho its depressing but i guess its more realistic that way 0.0)
0385738773|2.0|Wow, how disappointing.  Granted I found the series just average anyway, with the first being the most interesting, but this one just completely fell flat for me.  Still, I'll put my usual disclaimer here, don't bother reading this one unless you've read the others.  This series is meant to be read in order.<br /><br />Having defeated the trails by Maze and the barren land known as the Scorch, Thomas and the other survivors are taken to WICKED headquarters.  There, they are presented with the opportunity to regain the memories taken from them, but Thomas is suspicious.  He hatches a daring plan to escape, but with all the variables that are presented by WICKED, he's never sure he's doing what he's supposed to do, or what they have planned for him.  And as the disease known as The Flare keeps spreading, will they even have enough time to come up with a cure.<br /><br />I didn't really have any compassion for Thomas at all in this book.  Nothing he did was logical or made any sort of regular sense.  It's like he was just doing things to keep the plot moving without rhyme or reason.  And everyone else kind of fell into the backdrop as a result.  Characters that were such a big part of the first two novels barely got any time in this one and I think it really lost something because of that.  The only other character that really had any time in the book was Brenda, and even she wasn't the character that we were familiar with from the previous book.  It might as well have been another person.<br /><br />The plot also didn't have much of a point.  The ending was a cop out in my opinion, but I won't say anything further than that as not to spoil it for anyone.  And the variables and trials made no sense whatsoever even after the end of the novel where you would expect it to be explained.  It's almost like Dashner didn't think that part out and had to throw something together to at least make an ending.  And it doesn't work.  There is a lot of violence in this book too, and while some of it is appropriate, some of it just seemed meaningless, like filler.  If I have to summarize everything about this book, it just didn't provide satisfying answers.<br /><br />Not a good ending to the series and as a result not a series I would particularly recommend.  There are better dystopians out there.<br /><br />The Death Cure<br />Copyright 2011<br />324 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B008FSCNTK|1.0|I was waiting for this C.D., but after hearing it, oh my God it doesn't reminds me Diana Krall, is the idea of her husband ?????, if this is so, maybe he's trying to convert her in an frustrated singer like he is, my advice to Diana Krall: Get dressed, and sing and play the piano as you accustomed me to do, Bye.
0316228532|5.0|As someone who appreciates literature, Rowling amazes me with her talent. Once you put it out of your mind that this is not the wizarding world of Harry Potter, you can appreciate the stunning images of real life invoked from her syntax.<br /><br />The small rural town of Pagford is brought to life from the perspective of the town's pscyhe and each individual add their flavor through their individual dilemas, biases, and hatreds.<br /><br />She writes real life. Don't let the mature content of this novel distract you from Rowling's masterful command of language.
B005V2S7FW|3.0|well it works. I have last pass for my computer and laptop so it made sense that I would get it for my kindle. I must have not been paying attention because all I got was a free trial or something . now every time I try to use it it tells me that I need a premium account. so now if I want to use it I have to pay $12 a year.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|After reading other reviews, I decided to give the lifeproof case a try.  At first I wasn't sure about it.  Texting and all felt totally different but...hang in there, cause it really does get easier as you go.  It's so worth it to me knowing my iPhone is safe now if I drop it or it gets wet.  (I do not plan on taking it underwater, why chance it).  lol  Otherwise, I do love my case.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This was my second read of Nelson DeMille's Plum Island.  Several years had transpired and I hadn't been<br />unusually impressed with the story line or the characters the first time.  However, I was eager to find<br />something to read and I thought I might give Plum Island a second look. I'm very glad I did as the book<br />was much more entertaining the second time through.  Mr. DeMille has given me a wise cracking hero<br />who made me laugh aloud with his sarcasm, provide intelligence with his crime solving abilities and<br />was genuine and human.  Most of DeMille's book are entertaining and well crafted.  He is one of the<br />authors I follow when he comes out with a new book.  I'd recommend this book to any mystery fan.
B008XG1X18|5.0|was so happy to finally have an app that made pinterest actually functional on both my phone and kindle fire. a few bugs on occasion, but such an improvement over trying to surf the full desktop site on a mobile device. I'm really enjoying it!
B000FC1KBG|4.0|I read Secrets of The Baby Whisperer when my first baby was 5 months old, and I was at a loss on what to do with her sporadic 20 minute naps, and only being able to get her to sleep by nursing.<br /><br />My cousin, who had 3 girls under the age of 3 (got pregnant with twins when her first was 6 months old!), recommended this book to me as it was her saviour.<br /><br />I took the quiz and discovered that my baby was a 'Textbook' baby with a bit of 'Spirit'; and once I started practising the methods used by Tracy to get babies to sleep, and broke the habit of nursing to sleep, my baby was napping regularly, for 30mins to 2 hours, and didn't need to fall asleep while on the breast.<br /><br />I didn't use all of the chart tools, or needed to use some of the information, but just adapted the book to my needs and it worked like a charm.<br /><br />I now recommend this book to all of my friends with babies, or who are moms-to-be.
B008J34466|5.0|I have been a fan of Pink since she had hot-pink hair, but this is by far her best album.<br /><br />Normally there's one or two songs where I'll wrinkle my nose and say \\"I love her, but this one's not my favorite.\\"<br /><br />Not on this album. They're all so good in their own unique ways. I like that she's collaborating with other artists (Nate Ruess from \\"fun.\\" and Eminem.)<br /><br />Some of the hottest tracks are.<br />\\"Are We All We Are\\"<br />\\"Try\\", \\"True Love\\" and a really touching melody \\"Beam Me Up\\"<br /><br />Also, if you can get your hands on the deluxe version, the 4 bonus songs are REALLY worth it. I love them.<br /><br />A agree with Entertainment Weekly when they say \\"P!nk may be the best lyricist in pop music.\\"
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I can't for the next book, and they get married. And the person who hurt Gideon is revealed and get dealt with. I hope Cary finds love.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is dealing with the power of love between two people .  The many shades show how many mood swings of both male and female.  Usually it's always the woman, but in the case, it's both male and female.<br /><br />The female is so indecisvie as to what she wants.  I'm glad that she is not be as submissive as he wants her to be.  Oh, the power of a woman.<br /><br />I'm glad they are falling in love with each other and not just sexual partners.<br /><br />I have not finished reading it but I'm almost there.  So far so good.  They pleasure each other in ways that are new and exciting.  It keeps the relationship exciting.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|When I first listened to the CD I was surprised at the different sounds... after a week I loved almost every song. He did a good job...I'm still sad Whip Appeal didn't make the album. Go Frank :)
0525952926|4.0|I can't say it is as good as Pillars of the Earth or World Without End.  It definitely helps to read Fall of the Giants first in order to understand the characters.  Nevertheless, this is an excellent book that keeps your attention.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Very good reading.  Ties in those characters you didn't read about in the 4th book, Feast of Crows.  Must reading for anyone reading \\"The Game of Thrones\\" series
B006ZZANG0|5.0|I heard Rufus Wainwright on CBS morning news. Loved his sound...hunted it down on Amazon and I've been listening to it ever since. The lyrics are the kind that keep on repeating in my mind. Love it!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|provides a twist on the general jewel matching model. the structure provides a simple progression that is more than just screen after screen.
1589795474|5.0|I'd put this book in my must read financial category along with [[ASIN:1612930298 Think and Grow Rich]]. These are some of the 1st books on wealth that I ever read. The Millionaire Next Door is a great and practical read for those aspiring to earn (or keep) great fortunes. Along with finance, I suggest also adding the following books to your \\"must read\\" list: [[ASIN:0985923202 something like God: Six Weeks to Spirituality]] and [[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]]. This way, once you make your fortune, you can actually enjoy it as opposed to just \\"waiting to be happy\\" with your wealth. :)
B000R4SMCW|4.0|How can you miss with Anthony Hopkins playing a devious wife murderer with the \\"almost\\" perfect-crime.  No collection of DVDs should be without this one.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a non-military 40 yr old patriotic male, who holds the utmost high respect for our troops, I found this book to be very enjoyable and I couldn't stop reading it. I was captivated to all of the other details given about the life of a SEAL and other missions he went on, as well as the politics that are involved. We can all have our own opinion for sure.. but I know I have no place to debate with anyone who has been on so many unspeakable missions for the freedom of this country. The sacrifices made, giving up the \\"American dream life\\", family time that will never be reclaimed.. all I can say is THANK YOU for your service, and your account of what happened that day that UBL was finally found! Highly recommend this book, it was a great one!
B009EAO38C|5.0|Nelson, Schmidt and the rest of the Piano Guys are a match made in heaven.  Each song is amazing and creative in it's own way.  Check our their amazing videos on Youtube!

B007W7P5L8|5.0|it works great but would be even better if it had a spot to hold stylus and if the stand could be vertical as well as horizontal but it is still great I can set it on the nightstand and watch greys anatomy which is one of my favorite shows and I bought a boom speaker so it is even louder
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|when I lived in Europe the gypsy's came through the villages with carnival vans and they always had this game. I loved it.
B0094ZJK4O|5.0|I rarely buy music anymore.  Richie is one of the few artists (bon jovi as well) where I can count on quality melodic music.  He's a supremely talented musician and one of the best singers around.  Very soulful player and singer.  This CD doesn't disappoint.  There are 4 or 5 stellar tracks on this one.  Not a bad song on the CD.  Definitely worth checking out.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What tangled webs we weave!!!! I can not wait for the third book!!!! I am totally.in.love with this series!!! Sylvia just has a way with telling such great stories!!
B001CTDH76|5.0|I like the writing and the acting a lot. If you're willing to suspend belief in reality and just go with the core premise of the show, then it's great, enjoyable, and a great buy for so many episodes. I got hooked on the show last season and (because netflix doesn't yet offer it) I bought this to catch up. I also bought season two (loved it) and am currently waiting on season three.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|I thought the first 2 books were very good but this one got a bit silly and i lost interest a bit im sorry to say, but you have have to read to find out what happens in the end and its worth it just for that.Was a satisfactory ending.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have to say that I like pinterest better on a Pc, but this is nice too! its easy to navigate and its nice to be able to use this app when I'm on the go.
0525953728|5.0|This is a great story. Hard to believe it isn't fiction. Now that I've read it I'm passing it on to my best friend to enjoy: Former Air Force Combat Controller who may recognize some of the localities and participants.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The only thing I don't get is why in creative mode there's obsidian but there's no lava<br />But in general its cool
0385344333|4.0|Enjoyed the book and added it my collection of Lee Child.  Only comment being that Reacher is getting to be somewhat predictable. There always seems to be a female involved, usually law enforcement, who likely as not does not survive to the final or  otherwise continue any relationship with Jack. I'll keep buying the series and am waiting to see what occurs if and when Reacher gets to Virginia.

0802136834|5.0|Note: You don't have to be a fan of Tudor history (it helps!) but it isn't a must.<br /><br />Alison Weir weaves such a studied, intricate not to mention fascinating tale that sucks you in so well you frequently forget it's nonfiction. She lays out facts with precision and accuracy however without sounding like a blustering lecturer or making this feel like a textbook for that 16th century history course you hated in college.<br /><br />It's so well researched right away you feel comfortable enough to take everything at face value because as a reader, you quickly begin to trust the author. Times, places and people --each of Henry's wives, not to mention his children, included -- are given the benefit of rich, detailed descriptions that put you in the moment. This constantly remains on the top of my 'most recommended' lists and has been given several re-readings over the years (a thing I'm not often wont to do) and continues to be one of the best books I have ever read, of any kind, right up there with classic greats like The Grapes of Wrath and Pride & Prejudice.<br /><br />It is a love story, a fairytale, a battle narrative and a tragedy all in one, told in such a way that the the historical figures discussed seem more like larger-than-life characters than actual people. It can be daunting work, for any author, to undertake the task of writing a biography and not many can pull it off, but Ms Weir does and with such captivating, ingenious precision that it becomes less of a biography and more of a page-turning thriller.<br /><br />I've been fascinated by Tudor history since I was about 11 when I picked up a copy of a young adult fiction book about Mary Tudor called \\"Mary, Bloody Mary\\" (Carolyn Meyer) at my local library and I've been hooked ever since so I'm pretty well versed in the story of Henry and his wives but that never, in any way, diminishes how perfectly she puts things together. You might know how their stories end but reading it from this perspective leaves you awestruck.ves you awestruck.
B003IDMUJA|5.0|This book is inspiring, in that it has the ability not only to plant the seed of Afro-optimism, but to show that there is indeed fertile ground for that seed to grow. There is hope for this continent beyond the machinations of politicians and the self-fulfilling cycle of humanitarian-aid, and the ingenuity of Africa needs only the right support to become self-sustaining. I would urge both the optimists and pessimists amongst us to read this book, because it has the potential to change attitudes and, perhaps, lives.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun. easy to play for all ages. would recommend to everyone. cool graphics like a real carnival game with real coins.
B009GEAPYW|2.0|Just to let you folks who are renting & not buying know, this is a cartoon and you should be aware it is poorly illustrated in my opinion.
B00174TKGI|5.0|WOW what a show!! A violent and very real story.  Washington/Crowe are amazing. I especially appreciated the interviews in the 2nd disc.  Extra-ordinary mature entertainment!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting, quick, and rivoting read. Informative on the training and type of work that our military performs in their role of protecting our country and trying to wipe out the terrorist threat that is so prevalent. Recommend this book. I learned allot by reading it and am proud of the work of the Navy Seals.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This is a 10m (33 ft) active USB 2.0 cable. It uses current from your computer's USB bus to power a small amplifier housed in the female socket, which boosts your data signal to adequate levels and thus permits a long cable that would otherwise resist the signal electrically to the point of incurring data loss.<br /><br />Pros<br />* Price: USB 2.0 must be a mature technology when high-quality products such as this are so inexpensive<br />* Quality: I'm impressed with the quality -- it is nicely shielded and well-made<br />* Signal strength: the amplifier gives the appropriate boost to avoid any issues with transmission speed or errors<br />* Compatibility: Works fine with Windows XP, Windows 7 and as many devices as I have tested it on (HP printer, Brother printer, Canon camera, flash drives, external hard drive)<br /><br />Cons<br />I have not discovered any flaws or issues that constitute a con.<br /><br />Other thoughts<br />I own one, and gave a second as a gift and set that one up for operating a printer located across a room.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not really been a fan of Stephen King's novels; even though I am from Maine and in fact attended a lecture by the author while I was a graduate student at UMaine-Orono.  Probably because I graduated from high school in 1962 and remember where I was when JFK was shot, the novel called to me.  King uses perfect, credible dialect for a Maine teacher, includes settings which are familiar to me and loved his wonderful believable 1960's dialect and he wraps all this around several credible scenarios that are poingnet and have the ability to engage the reader in the time travels of Jake Epping.  I have not finished the book and don't know whether Jake is successful in stopping Oswald or bringing Sadie back to Maine 40 + years later; however, I am enjoying the ride!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I finished this book in less than a day because I couldn't put it down! Gideon and Eva's relationship is such an emotional rollercoaster that sometimes you can't guess from one chapter to the next how things will be between them. Yes, they do get a bit frustrating, especially Eva at times, with how they react to situations but when you put yourself in their shoes, you have to ask what you would be thinking in the same situation. The ending was intense. I would still take Gideon Cross over Christian Grey any day. I love Eva's friend Cary.  He is such a brilliant secondary character and I love his relationship with Eva.  Would love to see him get his own book. Can't wait for the third book!
B008RYN44U|1.0|Ugh. I've been a huge fan since '95 and was a total Gwenabee, but sadly, I found it difficult to get through the entire album. It is DEFINITELY NOT ska what-so-ever. Too slow, lame lyrics. :(<br /><br />I've waited for it seems like eons for a terrible record. I am truly sad, at least I'll always have Beacon Street<br /><br />Save your money.
0553801473|5.0|Another huge and kick ass volume to A Song of Ice and Fire.  All the missing parts to IV and then some.  The only thing I regret about reading these books is that I didn't start reading them years from now so I wouldn't have to endure these ridiculously cruel cliffhangers over the course of years.  Write faster Martin!!!
B008NAFU9A|4.0|I chose the rating of 4 stars because this book is worth it. Based to the teenage readers it is very well thought out and descriptive with no going off course of the subject matter.
0525953728|5.0|I have no idea what all the controversy is about this book.  Nothing top secret was revealed.  The author goes out of his way to explain why he wrote the book and why he found it necessary to tell the true story.  It is just a factual account of what these brave men and women go through all the time.  Practice, deployment.  Practice, deployment. Practice, deployment, a few days to spend with family.  This author just happened to be selected to go into Pakistan and kill OBL.  It is a job that 99% of all Americans could not do and I believe that these men and women are the be held up as heroes/heroines for the work that they do allllll the time, over and over and over and we do not even know they are doing it.<br /><br />A very, very exciting read and still some say that it gives away our secrets.  It not only doesn't give away anything that would even be remotely secret, it tells a truthful story about what actually happened out in the desert.  Everyone who has any interest in what the real world is like and what we have become as a nation, should give this a read.  Extraordinary book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game. only one I am playing right now! highly recommend this game to anyone who has found thimselfs pumping quarters into these machinesat the arcade
B008B9JTLI|3.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br /><br />That's Foley's (Samuel L. Jackson) new monto, \\"Nothing changes unless you make it change.\\" He should know. He's spent the last 25 years in prison for killing his partner and best friend,<br />Up until that moment he was one of the best grifters around. He had business savvy and knew how to work a con the smart way.<br />Now that he's finally getting out, Foley is determined to change.<br />But there's a problem. Ethan (Luke Kirby) the son of his former partner wants to be a grifter, he wants to learn from the best and he won't take \\"no\\" for an answer.<br />He's got a mark, his boss Xavier (Tom Wilkinson) and claims with Foley's help they can take him for eight million.<br />Foley has met a young woman Iris (Ruth Negga) and feels he's got a real chance of leaving his old life behind. Ethan won't give up and finally get's his way, when he forces Iris into the mix.<br />The Samaritan is an OK movie, that could have been a great movie. It has two major things going for it. First, Samuel L. Jackson - the way he rolls his eyes, that road-weary persona, that determination not to go back to jail but a necessary convincing flip-flop when they include the woman he loves. Second, The Samaritan is a good con movie. You constantly find yourself trying to figure out who is conning who, or if anyone can be trusted at all.<br />The downside is the film tries to balance too many themes in 90 minutes, worth a look but forgettable.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|When I received this case it felt really cheap, i am used to an otterbox so i figured i just wasn't used to the difference. by that night the case had already cracked across the front screen and the back. Also i could not use any of my volume buttons. Within less than a week the case already had 5 huge cracks in it, i had only dropped the case one time and that was on carpet. I called the lifeproof company and they said that they had at least 4 cases reported with the same serial number that THIS CASE WAS A FAKE! I sent the case badk and am waiting for my refund. Wether it was real or not it shouldn't have been that easy to break. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it very helpful to be able to see how much power you have while you play. Thank so much it really have us a lot
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This book is a great start to one more epic story.  Puts WW1 in a whole new light. Characters are developed with the expected style and details that makes them come alive.  Also makes you want to track the history through in the rest of the books yet to come.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I recieved this book on October 1 2012 because I had preordered it and I sat down and started reading it and couldnt put the book down and finished it that day. I have already preordered the third book and will be waiting for it in December. I would recommend this book to everyone to read. The love scenes is very hot and steamy
0316228532|1.0|I love Harry Potter, and have been delighted with the Potter Universe, the characters, the environments, and the story.  Somehow this story is just not interesting to me.  I read thru the \\"see inside for a quick peek\\" ... it still does not call me.  I don't doubt that JK Rowling had put together great prose and great observations, but I just can't read through it without falling asleep. I guess I'm just not  that interested in provincial English country life or something like that.<br /><br />10/10/2012 update: I stopped by the bookstore and tried to read it again. I'm struck by the fact that JKR used so many curse words. I thought that the whole point of great authors is that they are wordsmiths - able to deliver the emotional content/descriptions without swearing and vulgar. Swearing and cursing are really signs of people who are incapable of speaking.  If this is JKR's INTENT on showing us provincial English country life - that is a SAD STATE of affairs.  So now the English people are so SUBSTANDARD they can't even carry on a conversation without swear words?<br /><br />Adults can express themselves fully without swearing, cursing, or being vulgar.  Just because you are writing an adult story, doesn't mean you have to stoop to the level of the characters to tell the story!  Definitely NOT classic material, and not a classic fiction work.  I really expected more from JK.

B0067AC5KA|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is like Jason Bourne, James Bond and Kevin Mitnick all rolled into one....absotlutely stellar and incindiary read....I will admit some gramatical errors and the primarily European names of places and names of some of the characters is a bit much to get used to at first but after that no complaints...def keeps you on your toes.  Will admit was a bit squemish in some parts of the first book but still well worth the read...very highly reccomended to anyone who likes this genre of books....again 5stars all the way
0307200477|1.0|This is a great book for my soon-to-be newborn.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />The actual product was ripped. There is a descriptive box that holds the book and it was already torn up.

044661758X|5.0|The Concrete Blonde is a surprisingly touching thriller, a police procedural, in which Harry Bosch has to deal with the aftermath of his killing of the Dollmaker murderer. The detective is now on trial and the whole world seems to be conspiring against him as his motives are questioned. During the trial he receives poetic notes from someone who leads him to another dead body and to more sadness. Will justice be meted out? Read the book to find out, this is a good one.

I listened to this on a high-end system running a tubed preamp, top DAC/CD player, McIntosh amplification, and Magnepan planar speakers with a Velodyne sub. I got CHILLS it sounded so great! Some of the standout tracks include 'Live', 'Flow', 'Brilliant', 'Hello', and 'Satellite'.  There are also several good slower tempo songs that make things interesting.  There is not one 'filler' song on this release.  All in all, excellent songcraft, and I truly hope we have not heard the last of the great Ultravox! 4.5 to 5 stars is my verdict.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE AT THE MOVIES AND NOW AT HOME,I LIKE HOW THEY HAD SOME OF THE TOP MARVEL SUPER HEROES IN ONE FILM BUT MY FAVORITE WAS THE HULK CAUSE WHEN HE GRAB THOR'S BROTHER LOKI & JUST PUT SOMETHING ON THAT BOY MANN\\"HULK SMASH\\"
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This is a good game to pick up when you have a few minutes to spare. The action is turn based, so there's no problem picking it back up after an interruption. The puzzles start out easy, but quickly become much harder. If you think one spider is difficult to outwit, just wait until there two or three! Feedback on how efficient your solution was is given via a star system. One star for poor, two for okay and three for good. You can also score better than 3 stars for very efficient solutions and earn coins that can be used to unlock hints for levels you just cannot solve. I had some problems with the game freezing my 1st gen Fire when I first downloaded it, but turning the Fire off and back on solved the problem. I haven't had any freezing problems since. I highly recommend this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play this all the time.  It's really easy in the beginning, but as you get further along the challenge gets way harder.  I enjoy this game very much.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A moving and very beautiful story on the humanity, bravery, and kindness in all of us.  I wish this had been around and required when I was in middle school. Those years are so often marked by unkindess from others, to others, and to oneself. This book makes a great argument for a little more kindness from all of us.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|I like how they give u a chance to get free credits without downloading any apps that's realy nice but if they take that off I just wont play it anymore
B002APU580|5.0|Great price. Great movie. Great cast. Needed a little extra to go over the $25 min and this was perfect.
B008B11RLQ|2.0|I purchased the new Elvis collection  Elvis 20 Original Albums<br />I received the package which is a nice box with 20 CD's in cardboard sleeves of the original albums as originally sold. Unfortunately the CD's aren't what they say they are.<br />More than half of the CD's have more songs on them then the original records and then there are some that don't have songs that they are supposed to have<br />This is not what I wanted and not what I received.<br />If you want Cd's that are copy's of the original records don't buy this set
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I highly recommend this book, I didn't see any indication of \\"Top Secret\\" information. It helps you to understand the sacrifice our troops and there family's go through.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I read when I can and its not very often but i could not put this book down! They story instantly hooks u in, and u can wait to see what happens! The only down side is I want more of the story! I will read everything from EL JAMES! Thank you to her from giving us women this story
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this APP! I was worried because of what I had heard, but it works fabulously on my Kindle Fire! So much better than pinterest mobile.
1423140605|5.0|I love Rick Riordan's books, and can't wait to read this one.  Bought it on Kindle and am having issues with it crashing.  Urgh.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|i have been waiting for 2 days and it still has not downloaded...... it makes me made cuz things usually load in a few mins. or even seconds
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great job! I loved this movie and could not wait for it to come out on blur-ray to add to my collection. Ordered early but received it a week after release, but that's ok. I was on the road anyway, so it was waiting for me when I got home!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|had fun playing this. had no problems downloading would love more games like this...good graphics and a bit challenging ...
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I loved the book it was amazing... had a great story line and i particularly enjoyed the flashbacks he had throughout the story telling about the past . I recommend this book to anyone who enjoy the maze runner.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The lots u can buy to expand need to be cheeper and just coin so I don't have to buy cash that outrageous love the game great game though
B0084I9QI2|4.0|I have been waiting for over 10 years for the Bad tour to be release on dvd and finally it is here. I was please with the quality but at the same time wish it could have been a little better, you could clearly tell that this was a VHS from 25 years back. The standout performances was Human Nature, Man In the Mirror, Billen Jean, Rock With You, and Another Part Of Me. Several fans for years requested that the London show should be the Bad tour Offical dvd, i kind of wish now that the estate would have picked the Kansas city show instead because the clips i've seen of that show is HD. I am greatful neither the lease. I am so glad that Mj estate chose the 2nd leg over the Victory tour inspired 1st leg of the bad tour.<br /><br />As for the bsides and the remixs<br /><br />\\"Dont be Messing Around\\" (Sounds so old to me, but its okay 2/5 stars)<br /><br />\\"Im so Blue\\" ( My fav bside from the album after Fly away, it sounds like an Aaliyah track, perfect vocals and nice subject matter 5/5 stars)<br /><br />''Song Groove\\" ( The song is okay, hard to understand what Jackson is saying, he sings throught grinding teeth on this track 1/5 stars)<br /><br />''Free'' ( Another ballad from the album i like it 3/5 stars)<br /><br />''Price of Fame'' (5/5 reminds me of Leave me alone, Tabiold Junkie, Scream with a mix of Billen jean CLASSIC MIKE)<br /><br />overall i give the album 4/5 stars (:
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I installed this in an old Pentium D (775) I rebuilt as a Windows 7 MediaCenter / CableCard DVR. With this cooler, I'm was able to record two shows and watch a third and the core temp never went above 42C.  With the stock fan and heat sink, the processor was hitting 60C+ and the noise was unbearable. At idle the stock cooler was about 37C, and now it is about 25C.<br /><br />The fan itself is almost silent; however, since I put it in a small 2 external bay tower you can hear the air flowing due to the tight spacing. Flow through the heat sink itself does not contribute much noise. In a better case, this noise would go away. Still in a quiet room, I can't hear it if I'm more than 10-feet away and it is not any more audible than my power supply fan.<br /><br />Installation was easy, but it does require the motherboard to be removed. Instructions are at best adequate, but if you've installed a heat sink and fan before you should be able to figure it out. All the necessary mounting hardware was included. Thermal paste was included, but I used a different paste just because I had it. Stock probably would have been fine.<br /><br />It barely fit in my small case, but I new that it would be tight. Measure before you buy.
1451627289|5.0|I've read 90% of what S.K. has written. The Stand is my favorite. I wasn't expecting much when I started this one, what caught my attention was a review that said this wasn't his usual ghosts and horror book. I wanted to see what he would be like away from his comfort zone. I'll spare you the blow by blow that is already well done by so many previous reviews and just tell you that if you are even considering reading this book, do yourself a favor and do it. You will not be disappointed. It's in my top 5 S.K. book list now.
B008FPZQRO|5.0|I have listened to this album hundreds, maybe thousands of times.  Had the vinyl when it was first issued and this is my 3rd. or 4th. time purchasing it on CD.  I wanted the 5.1 mix is why I bought this set.  And the price, WOW.  The Surround Sound mix is a great addition along with a few tracks not available anywhere else that I know of.  I have all the albums and the Manticore Box Set.  But after listening to all 3 disc, I have a question.  It sounds to me like disc one is the alt. Tarkus and disc 2 is the original album.  It seems to be a bit faster in tempo and a few other little slight differences.  Not that that is a bad thing.  But I thought after listening to disc two, that I didn't hear any difference from the remaster that I bought few years ago, other than the bonus tracks, but then disc one does sound different.  Anyone else notice this or it just me?<br />I don't know why every rags on side two of this album. I always liked it.  And also \\"Are You Ready Eddy\\" get's a lot of flak, but I like all of it.  Deep Purple's \\"Fireball\\" gets a bad rap too, another one I really like a great deal.  Even 'tho I have a few other versions, still glad I bought this.  Great music from when the band was really at a creative peak.  They had just released \\"Pictures At An Exhibition\\" prior to this in the UK if I remember right.  Had to get that as an import way back when.  'Tho it was released here in the US later.  They were on a high, and then their next album would be \\"Trilogy, another great album.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|With all the different choices in sounds, anyone can use this to help them relax and fall asleep. You can combine sounds to get the perfect tones and melodies just for you.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I expected a silly game that I would play every so often. what I received was an addicting fun game that I find myself playing seversl times a day! alot of fun with solid graphics and fun sound effects. thanks game circus and amazon!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved the puzzles - not too hard, not too easy. Graphics were very lifelike. Particularly liked the .ap I. the journal as a reference if you're not sure what to pushed next.
0812992784|5.0|Only Salman Rushdie could have written this and I'm so glad he did. It reads like a novel, a spy memoir, a bearing of the soul. Highly recommend.
B00846REIS|5.0|I Love this book. The character development is great. I hope we get to learn more about Gideon's family.I just wish the 3rd book was available.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love playing the game, very innovative and requires a lot of thought.  But latest update wiped out all my progress!  was almost done and now have to start all over!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am still reading the book, but  so far it is excellent.  I watched the movie and the book explains things that happened in the movie.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Oh why did I have to read it so fast!  I didn't want it to end.  Now it's going to be like another 2 years (Dear God/person of manages such things) hopefully no longer than that.  Ken Follett just writes about what I want to read about...
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Pretty good movie, this is one the sequel will probably be better. Bluray extras or okay. Villain plot kind of weak.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is really great for finding ideas for crafting, recipes for any kind of meal and d.i.y. projects! You can find just about anything you could ever need in just one spot!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is just like playing it on the computer. It is easy to move the cards around and my Galaxy s2 has a big enough screen so that all the hands show at once without the cards being way too small.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is a variety of easy-to-difficult puzzles, which can keep me entertained for hours. There are several sets of play levels, and definitely worth the price!
B008LZHA3G|4.0|certainly not his best but an enjoyable cd. a little on the dark side but a lot of dylan's songs are.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Sure, it's great. It crushes Block Story. Does it deserve all this credit? No! Is it worth 6.99? Yes and no. Yes if you like Minecraft, I personally love and own it on computer and Xbox 360, it's mostly worth the $30 (computer), $15 (Xbox 360), or $7 (handheld), but be sure you want it for the price.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My new favorite writer - nuff said  Hope to see many more books from this talented young writer.  You can't put her stuff down.
B005VKMB42|5.0|Birdy is so good! I'm a big fan I guess, a big bird. I made a pun. You know what's better than a pun? This album. Buy this album and don't make a pun.<br /><br />Also, check out Birdy covering The A Team on youtube. Amazing stuff.
B0012DW6W4|5.0|Seriously, one of my all time favorite movies!!! Great acting, great story, beautiful scenery... LOVE it!!!!!!! A classic, must watch!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|This was an excellent \\"racy\\" novel. If you read 50 Shades,you will like this 10x better! I read this book in less than 24 hours. I can't wait to find out what happens with Eva and Gideon in the next novel.
B00457X7XQ|2.0|The crazy rich Islamic terrorist, the super smart crippled russian hacker, the super smart AND super fit American security expert, the beautiful women (every single one of them).<br /><br />Please....
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I was waiting for this book for months, what a let down! In no way does it compare to the 1st book!!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Read it in a day! could not put the book down. I can't wait for the 3rd novel. Since I got my Kindle last year I seem to eat my books up at an unbelievable speed, they don't even last me 24 hours :(<br />Longer novels please!!!!! What am I saying, I'd probably wouldn't go to sleep, LOL.<br />I love the Gideon and Eva story, love 50 shades too, but the Eva and Gideon story is gripping, once you are hooked into it you won't want to let go. I would love this story to be turned into a movie!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was a lot of fun.  It wasn't too short, the music was great, loved the storyline,  and it worked just fine on my kindle.  An awesome deal at $0.99.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid. One of my favorite disney movies.<br />Very happy with it. It even arrived earlier than expected.<br />It was great watching it with my daughters who now love the<br />movie too!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it a fun game buy do not tell you wife she will take it over and not give it back
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a good game! It's a time waster!!:) ;)  This is a good game I recremend it to people
0345528581|5.0|I just got this book yesterday and stayed up past midnight reading it. Wonderful complete guide to body weight exercises. I can't wait to work out today!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|It's a good game that holds interest. Challenging but enjoyable. Hours of play time. I like it. The music is better then most. It  has good graphics.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great insight into the workings of the Navy Seals.  Dramatic dialog regarding the actual Bin Landen mission and aftermath.  Even though PLAN A did not work--the PLAN B certainly resulted in success.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I first heard this group on tour with the Zac Brown Band a couple of years ago and I knew then that I would LOVE them!! I was SO excited to get this CD! It did not disappoint. Very catchy tunes!! My favorite is probably \\"Six Ways to Sunday\\". Something about their sound reminds me a little of The Black Crowes. You know how there's usually a few songs on a CD that you skip over to get to the \\"good\\" songs...well, there aren't ANY of those on here! They're ALL good!!! I've listened to it several times and I'm not tired of it yet :)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read the sample along with 3 or 4 others and this one grabbed my attention instantly. after a few chapters it becomes impossible to put down. the mystery of the Pines keeps the story moving and it was completely entertaining.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|first book on my new kindle fire. Kept my feet to the fire (ha ha) learning to get those pages turned fast enough!
B003F5NSTW|5.0|This book was compelling, raw and such a good read. Brings up a lot of questions about nature vs nurture. Highly recommended.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app went on a trip and put location in and instant weather. Have watched weather in lots of places as have lots of family
B009G8GRX6|5.0|From the first minute of its opening track 'Supremacy' Muse's new album engages, thrills and reminds. There are many familar sounds and still it all sounds fresh and unique. For me, someone who is more of a consumer than a reviewer, it feels important to encourage people who love music. Listen to this album and you wull forget your daily woes and worries. Embark on a wild ride with Muse and you will be rewarded generously. Utterly stimulating and entertaining music. Bravo Muse!<br /><br />Fav tracks:<br /><br />1. Supremacy<br />2. Madness<br />3. Panic Station<br />4. The 2nd Law - Unsustainable<br />5. Big Freeze<br /><br />9/10
B003EV6DBW|5.0|When I received my Blu-Ray copy of this season of Doctor Who, I couldn't wait to start watching this DVD. It was worth the wait. The HD quality even on my PS3 was fantastic. The only downside to these DVD is I know they will end..... and then I can start on Season 6!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you are reading this review I am sure you know by now what this movie is about, so I won't go into detail about the plot. First thing I want to talk about is the Aspect ratio. Alot of people seem to be upset that it does not have the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. Me personally I would rather have the screen filled, I don't see the point of spending a thousand dollars on a big screen TV only to have the picture shrunk. Having it fill up the entire screen also makes the 3D more enjoyable, the black bars seem to be very distracting when you are trying to watch a 3D film, so for me this is a positive.<br /><br />  Secondly, the 3D was awesome, especially toward the end of the movie when the battle takes place. The 3D gives this movie so much dimension. It is hard to believe this movie was a conversion, they did a fantastic job.<br /><br />  Third is the action in this movie. There's never a dull moment. From the opening scene to the end this movie is filled with none stop action. My favorite scene is the fight between Iron Man and Thor. They did a wonderful job filming that scene.<br /><br />  Fourth is the comedy. This movie had alot more funny moments than I expected. Hulk was my favorite. I think he even out did Tony Stark in this. The scene with him and Loki was great, \\"Puny God\\"! Also when he punches during the battle at the end, priceless!<br /><br />  Fifth is the CGI. The VFX department took very good care of this film. They did a spectacular job on the hulk. This is three best looking hulk out of all the films. I think this us why Hulk seemed to become a fan favorite, because he looks great, and also had alot of funny parts in the movie. The Hulk really makes this movie worth watching.<br /><br />  Last is the bonus features. Alot of people have complained about this also, but I was happy with everything. There are deleted scenes, features, commentary, digital copy, soundtrack, second screen. I though they did a good job with the bonus features, and I am satisfied.<br /><br />  Overall, this is a must have, must see movie. Action/Superhero movies don't get no bigger our no better than this. Kudos to Joss Whedon, Disney, Marvel, and everyone else who worked hard to put this movie together. Can't wait for Phase 2! AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!ures, and I am satisfied.<br /><br />  Overall, this is a must have, must see movie. Action/Superhero movies don't get no bigger our no better than this.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a huge Pinterest fan and when I seen that the Kindle Fire had a Pinterest app I was super excited. It is everything I could imagine its convenient and fast easy to browse and you can easily re pin items. hands down my favorite app on my fire :)
B001O1O71C|5.0|I read this because my son was reading it in school.Little did i know that I would think about it so often.<br />the tragedy of it all is unbearable.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app.  It is easy to read and easy to use.  The decent size font is a pleasure to read and the display of the last calculation keep me on track.  Thanks guys for a quick and easy app.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed the whole series, but the final book was really different in my opinion.  I think I wanted her to be more happy she was alive. There was an underlying current in the 3rd book that I can't put my finger on, but it wasn't in the first two books. I loved the whole story, and it was impossible to read only one in the series. Go ahead and read Mockingjay, because you need to see how it ends, but to me it just wasn't as enjoyable
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Lets me know all the things I need to know and I always know how much time I have to play on my Kindle.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|OK, I am reading this trilogy out of curiosity and can see that behind all the soft porn there is a story being told. I confess to having a strange sense of humour and what keeps going through my mind is how this book (and the first one) could totally be fuel for \\"comedy company\\" (an Aus comedy show of the 90's?) type send up, with everyone \\"cocking their head\\" and \\"biting their lip\\" and \\"squirming\\" at every \\"Lascivious\\" smile.  I think there is an over usage of the same descriptions for the way the characters behave. The use of a dictionary and Thesaurus by the author is recommended.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I \\"laughed out loud\\" and felt like I was on her show (although she did not ask me questions, which is fine - it's a book).  It was a funny rant or a funny stream of thought.  If you are looking for a story, this might not be your book - but if you are a fan of Ellen and appreciate her wit and humor, you'll be glad you bought this one.
0525953728|5.0|My only complaint is i wish it were a series of novels instead of a book!  This is the most riveting book i have ever read.  It went fast even though i  read everthing twice so i didnt miss anything!  Awesome read, you wont be disappointed.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Beautiful movie for all.  As a small child, my mother took me to see an older version of \\"The Secret Garden\\", and it always stayed in my mind, \\"memory keeper\\".  The 1993 relesase version is even better, and this is an excellent movie for children; however, it is the perfect \\"FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT\\", as I can assure anyone that adults will enjoy viewing this with their children.  In my opinion, other than possibly for a young \\"bachelor\\", there should not be a single person that would not fall in love with all of the characters in this story, perfectly performed by this version's group of actors.  It definitely gets a 5-Star Rating!![[ASIN:B002GIBVV6 The Secret Garden]]
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is a lot of fun.  My son and I both like it.  Really fast paced and more challenging than it looks.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|P!nk's latest album is simply amazing!  Having been a long time fan of her and her music, I am impressed by P!nk's ability on \\"The Truth About Love\\" to perfectly blend her big arena hits with her gut wrenching soul stirring songs. I highly recommend it!
0684857219|4.0|Its a good book overall, but I expected more coming from Arnold himself. The whole idea should it have been to teach you how to become a good body builder. Give a man a fish an he will eat that night, teach the man how to fish and he will eat evey night!!!!
B008J34466|5.0|This album is really amazing.  Pink's writing on this album is very high quality and steady throughout all her songs.  The continuing theme of love can suck but I wouldn't have it any other way continues from beginning to end.  If you've ever liked a Pink song then you will love something on this album and most likely the entire thing.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Forceclose, not responding,  forceclose. I get better results on my phone. This app needs a big fix. Would have loved to be able to use on my Kindle Fire.
B004LROUW2|3.0|I like the writing style, the characters are interesting, the fantasy is very creative.  I wish the author would have added more explaination for the fantasy.  I'm Ok with it not being 100% understandable, but this was about 10%.  I also did alot of scanning.  Too much detail, and just too long.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I was so happy when I got it and so far everything has worked great but the UV ink :(. I spent a lot of money on this for being an amazing toy and one of the neat bonus features being the UV reactive ink. I've been trying to get the pen to work, dipping it in warm tap water like it says and nothing, I need a replacement and being in America trying to get the replacement from the UK is time and cost expensive. I love everything else just really wish my UV ink would work!
1451648537|4.0|Deadbeat dad.  Robber baron.  Psychotic boss.  Job's life sucked!  He just didn't get it.  The measure of a life is not a rich vs. poor axis but a creative vs. destructive axis.  And on that measure, Jobs was a bozo.  He blew it.  Little more than a corporate pseudo-hippy control freak who peddled a special brand of consumerism.<br /><br />But we're not reviewing his life, we're reviewing this book!  And it's a good one.  Isaacson has Jobs' ability to narrow out the crap and stick to the interesting stuff.  He gets the inside scoop on the ipod, the iPad, the iPhone, the mac, Gates v. Jobs, Jobs v. Sculley, Jobs v. Google, Jobs v. Apple and much more.  It's a fascinating peek behind the scenes of a deeply flawed man whose aesthetic sense helped to shape the culture in interesting ways.  Isaacson swallows the koolaid a bit.  For instance, iTunes is a very flawed program that is slow, coutnerintuitive and has wiped out my address book when I get a new phone.  But Isaacson takes Jobs' word for it that the program is just swell.  More importantly, Isaacson deals with the shut down of American factories, and their replacement by Chinese slave labor, only glancingly.  That said, he never shies from pointing out Jobs' Reality Distortion Field (i.e. lying) or pointing out Jobs' other flaws.  Great book that gives you a rich  portrait of a multifaceted modern man.
B0090EKRKU|2.0|I was very disappointed with this movie.  It was depressing, boring, and a thinly veiled political statement.  It was complaining about big business, and corporations making money.  I do not think that this is a good lesson to teach kids.  I personally do not think that there is anything wrong with giving your kids the desire to succeed.  I care about the environment, but this was really too much!
B005P06AAO|5.0|Excited when the dvd arrived in the mail, was so ready to sit down and watch it without commercial interuptions! Reading the other reviews of people that are not exactly pleased with their purchase, all i have to say is the cover on the dvd wasn't \\"poor quality\\".  It looked like a regular dvd cover printed for that exact purpose.  And while some said the back sides of the dvd's themselves were pink, which prompted the \\"its a copy\\"; the one's i recieved were also pink, but most need to realize its because the front of the dvds are pink. the color kinda shows through the dvd. No more ranting, my purchase was exactly what i thought it would be, and i cant wait to watch the show over and over and over again!
B007XH6BPG|5.0|What a great album! All the great things you would expect from these two. This is a highly melodic work, nothing boring here. Outstanding track after track, this has become a staple in my playlist. I was just amazed at how great they sound vocally. I thought maybe there age might start to show, but now way, they sound fresh, professional and intelligent. Lots of hooks and great melodies. You won't be disappointed.
0385536828|3.0|\\"Sweet Tooth\\" by Ian McEwan is NOT a Cold War Spy Thriller, as some of the hype might aver, but it IS a well-written trip back in time to the 1970s to tell the story of naïve, gullible and immature, Serena Frome, who finds herself reading novels for the MI5 (sort of the English version of the CIA). The entire plot is summed up in the first sentence HOWEVER I still had no idea how it was going to end and I love it when I'm surprised by an ending!<br /><br />The novel is wonderfully evocative of the early 1970s from the way women accepted their second-class status in the work place, to the way people whispered the word \\"cancer\\" as if it was a shameful and careless thing to have contracted. I didn't live in London at this time, but I have a hunch that McEwan describes that gritty ethos perfectly.<br /><br />Serena is a dilettante of the first order, and she is a voracious, if shallow, reader of popular fiction (I could relate!) who, through an older lover, finds herself inside the MI5 with a task to find and fund writers who are anti-communist/pro-capitalist at a time when Stalinist Russia is in full swing. She is directed toward a writer named T. H. Healy and promptly falls in love with him (Serena falls in love with just about every man she meets in the novel.) But she doesn't tell him who she works for.<br /><br />A fair percentage of the novel is Serena giving synopses of some of Healy's short stories and a novella that is curiously similar to Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\".  There is nothing especially \\"thrilling\\" about any of this, but it was a fairly interesting read; the briefly described short stories were fun in that \\"story within a story\\" way, and the ending is genius.<br /><br />If you are looking for a real cold war thriller I highly recommend Tom Rob Smith's trilogy starting with \\"Child 44\\".

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This is a cogent and coherent capture of what we currently know about how children can achieve their potential and how we can help that to happen.  It's a good read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I have no complaints about the story of the book at all. I was completely lost in the story and enjoyed it from cover to cover!<br /><br />Where I have a problem has less to do with the book itself as it does with the sloppy job done in converting it to an electronic version. I noticed several typos in the Kindle version where letters are left out of words forcing the reader to stop and decipher what is actually being said in the book. This is annoying, because this story is intense. Any time I come upon one of these typos they take away from my enjoyment of the book itself. Amazon, please correct this so other readers don't have to deal with it. Thanks!
B0098VVMPO|2.0|The main character is weak. He does not play the role of the original Spartacus to a satisfactory level. He looks fragile and week physically and his emotional demeanor makes him appear frail and his candor only attributes to this. He lacks the presence, mostly in his eyes. Other characters do well in their continued roles.<br />I only watched the first two episodes. It wasn't worth paying for. The new lead character is wack...
B008I34ZFW|5.0|\\"Iron Sky\\" was a partially crowd-sourced independent movie.  Pretty much a B movie by definition.  But it was better than movies with far bigger budgets.<br /><br />In 2018, a folksy, female President of the United States is planning her re-election campaign.  She's got that \\"hot librarian\\" thing going on, but she's not a reflection of any real politician, especially not one from Alaska.  As part of her campaign, she pushes to put an American back on the Moon.  And her astronauts stumble across an eighty year old secret; Nazis have been living on the dark side of the moon since the end of WWII.  The Nazis think that the astronauts are scouts for an invasion of the Moon, and prepare their counter-attack (spoiling attack, actually, but counter-attack is close enough).<br /><br />And the results are darkly hilarious.  The UN, the space race, the arms race, gender and race issues, propaganda, marketing, and conspiracy theories are all lampooned in this brilliant sci-fi comedy.  I particularly enjoy the part where the advertising executive acts out the famous scene from \\"Downfall\\" with her staff.  The American President, who in no way was a representation of a former mayor of Wasila, AK, was brilliant, delivering subtle and sublime barbs to the foibles of the American political system.  And the Moon Nazis themselves were brilliantly played stereotypes from WWII films from yesteryear.  The mad scientist (well, mad engineer) and his daughter pushed the humor right over the top.<br /><br />Amazing film and big fun!<br /><br />Edward M. Van Court

B008673ZAQ|3.0|I loved Bared to You, so I was highly anticipating Reflected in You. There were things I loved about this story, unfortunately the things that frustrated me far outweighed those.<br /><br />We pick up the Eva and Gideon's intense story right where we left off in Bared to You. They've got past some of the Corinne drama, are seeing a therapist jointly due to their abusive pasts, and settled in for the long haul. Or so we think. From the get go we have possessive and controlling behavior on both sides. They both seem to thrive on it. Eva and Gideon are not confident in each other unless they've pushed the other one to make some over-the-top gesture to control, and consume one another. But let's face it, we/I sort of love this, to a certain extent.<br /><br />I can't complain about 50% of the book because it was HOT and wonderful. Ms. Day really knows how to write some steam, and boy does she excel at getting you hot and bothered. And I'm not just talking about the spice. It's the push and pull between Eva and Gideon and their overwhelming desire for one another. I have many delicious quotes and scenes highlighted in my Kindle that are sure to make anyone's toes curl! Here's a sample:<br /><br />I found myself pinned to the hallway wall by six feet, two inches of hard, hot male. \\"You know what happens when you run, angel.\\" Gideon nipped my lower lip with his teeth and then soothed the sting with the caress of his tongue. \\"I catch you.\\"<br /><br />I would've been fine with this situation had Gideon been more forthcoming. Didn't we all finish Bared to You thinking we're going to get answers about his past and behavior in this one? I know I did. Eva freely trusted and shared her past with him. I don't know why he felt the need to hold back so much. Instead we get pages and pages of frustration, and behavior that infuriates with no explanation! Not even at the 80% mark were there answers! I was about to pull my hair out! Add to that is Corinne! Gideon knows what Corinne does to Eva:<br /><br />Gideon: \\"I thought I understood your feelings for Corinne, and, frankly, I thought you just weren't dealing with it well. But I had no clue. I was a self-centered idiot.\\" Eva: \\"I'm not dealing with it well. I hate her effing (substitution) guts. I can't think about her without feeling violent. \\" Gideon: \\"I get it now. I didn't before.\\"<br /><br />He GETS it because Eva turns the table on him with jealousy and he gets a taste of his own medicine. But does this stop the Corinne issue? NO!!!!!!!!! All we get is: \\"Trust me Eva.\\" When all I wanted to do was SHANK him at this point! Okay, okay, I'll calm down.....this is fiction after all. So basically I was frustrated for about 40-50% of this book. I can take 20-30% of frustration, I expect it. We must have some hurdle to overcome. But when the frustration and confusion are for almost half of the book, I start getting ticked. I feel like the author is jacking me around. If Eva was enlightened, given a little clue, a breadcrumb, just a little bit before we hit the the 94% mark, I would've been happy. We still didn't even get the full story until almost the last pages!!! In my opinion, this was completely unnecessary! Yes, I know, I am seriously ranty and harpy in this review. Sorry. I finished this story last night and was totally worked up, and woke up even more worked up, and went through the day in a foul mood because I COULDN'T GET THIS STORY OUT OF MY HEAD! This review is the result of that aggravation, I had to vent somewhere. You are my collateral damage.<br /><br />I will say, I'm dying for the next installment and probably will pick it up the day it comes out. Is that all kinds of crazy? Maybe......probably. Maybe this is a testament of what a great job Ms. Day did in writing this story. Or maybe she's just an evil genius, and I'm like a moth to the flame.<br /><br />Thank you to Penguin Group and Netgalley for allowing me to read this.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|Dear Night Circus,<br /><br />I had heard such great things about you. Yes, some people had compared you to insubstantial wedding cake, and apparently not all my Goodreads pals were 100% enamored with you, but I had a good feeling. Circuses (no clowns needed)! Victorian setting! Magic and discussions of magical systems! Love triangles! What's not to love?<br /><br />I liked some parts. The world building was good and the imagery was lovely, though overpowering. But all the descriptions of clothes felt like they came from the same FIT thesis portfolio. And don't get me started on how all the women wore their hair piled on top of their heads. I mean, really? Not just the same hairdo...the same words to describe it too. It was tough to take.<br /><br />So, Night Circus, you brought me some sweet moments and some decent magical feats, but overall I feel cheated. With a little stronger characterization and real conflict, this would have been a winner.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Disappointed

B0058YPL66|5.0|Some of ABC's best ratings of 2011 came in a surprise seasonal package. Its premise revolved around something most shows haven't tackled but viewers everywhere are enthralled with, and finally, it has made its way into my living room.<br /><br />Once upon a time is where each story begins... but not every ending is happily ever after. Some cannot be altered by the perfect fit of a glass slipper or true love's kiss. Sometimes, the memories are stripped away leaving everyone who deserves a happy end lost to everyone they once loved. Every story has a beginning and Emma's is one bad memory after another. Abandoned as an infant by the side of the road, Emma (Jennifer Morrison) grew up in the foster care system never feeling loved or wanted. In the twenty plus years since then, she has learned to let no one in and relied solely on herself. On her 28th birthday, Emma is doing what she does best, catching the bad guys. She boasts two specials skills, one is being able to tell when someone is lying and the other is finding people. Today she is using the latter skill in her job as a bounty hunter while young Henry Mills (Jared Gilmore) has finally found Emma - his mother. Ten years ago Emma gave up a child for adoption, a son who landed in the sleepy town of Storybrooke and the son of Mayor Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla). Emma's trip to return Henry to his mother baffles her almost as much as the tale Henry spins.<br /><br />Henry's story is one that only fairy-tales are made of; he claims that every person living in Storybrooke is really one from the book of fairy tales his teacher Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) gave him. None of them know who they are or where they came from and are being held captive by a spell created by the evil queen, Regina. Emma's destiny is to break the curse as the daughter of Snow White - whom Henry claims is his teacher, Mary Margaret, and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas). The fate of everyone rests on Emma's shoulders but first she must come up against not only Regina but also her cohorts... and what is the mysterious Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) about?<br /><br />Already home to my favorite (or one of them - depends on what day of the week you ask me) shows, Castle, ABC was 2-for-2 in the 2011 television season when it came to finding new shows to be entertained by. The only thing overruling viewer's curiosity about this delight of a show is the credibility of some characters - we are constantly on our guard with each one though through it all that speaks of a fabulous cast, which this show has. Every actor puts his or her best into their roles and each evil look or kind gesture is always made clear through their expressions of acting because, well... they are that good. Also included in the recurring cast list is Meghan Ory, Raphael Sbarge, Anastasia Griffith ('Royal Pains'), David Anders, Emilie de Ravin, Jessy Schram and Eion Bailey ('Covert Affairs') as a mysterious stranger in addition to a host of others. What is perhaps so great about these characters (and they are fabulous!) is that it is left up to us to find out who they are. Unlike most shows, in `Once,' writer's don't hand out information readily - we are instead asked to uncover the good, and the bad of each person.<br /><br />For a show that I expected to love (so, I am a lover of sappy stories - you aren't just now figuring that out, are ya'!?) I was shocked that I was more enamored with the \\"real world\\" than the fairy-tale. Though pretty to look at, from a scenic perspective, none of the costumes or make-up appeals to our vision of authentic to the fairy-tale world. Similarly save for the outdoor scenes, the settings are modern and really, too \\"big.\\" Those transitions between fairy-tale and real world are usually well timed but for a girl who was expecting to find the fantasy elements of the show more interesting, I was surprised at how caught up in the modern counterparts I was. Just as I was hooked, the show backspaced to storybook land whichsometimes upset the intensity of a scene but is after all, the best way to keep suspense - and the viewer, on top of things.<br /><br />Regardless of petty complaints, this show was very whimsical in its own fashion. It's really quite clever in the ways it introduces and compacts so many fairy-tales into one story and world. No matter what you may think of it, your initial perspective of it may be turned upside down. It strengthens the further it investigates each character and it features every genre you could possible want; mystery, drama, comedy, romance, fantasy, all in a package that effortlessly cumulates together forming a beautiful if not sometimes transparent story. If there was only one thing I would wish television did different, it'd be the song-and-dance it puts its lovers - or would-be lovers through. I \\"get\\" the need for complications and incentive but this particular scenario is running amuck with such stories so please give Snow/Mary Margaret and Charming/David more than a tragedy and stolen glances. Believe me, I will still watch, as would the hundreds of fans. The more happiness, characters are given even in strife, the happier fans will be. Or maybe I am just speaking for myself but... from experience, I seriously doubt it. The good guys need some victories as happily ever after can never be snatched from beloved characters and the sooner writer's realize that, the better off they will be.<br /><br />© Copyright 2011-2012 Dreaming Under the Same Moon / Scribbles, Scripts and Suchsometimes upset the intensity of a scene but is after all, the best way to keep suspense - and the viewer, on top of things.<br /><br />Regardless of petty complaints, this show was very whimsical in its own fashion.

B0063B2BNE|5.0|I love Bones but this season was way too short!!! I can not wait to see what happens next! Just hate buying the episodes individually because it costs so much more...
B005LAJ212|4.0|Writing characters that viewers will actually want to invite into their home on a weekly basis is a tricky business; ideally, they are imperfect but strive for self improvement. There is an oh-so-fine line between creating characters who are a little bit naughty and characters to root for - to laugh with and applaud for. Revenge took a stab at perfecting the former though even in its prism of enchanting darkness, I am not sure we should blindly buy into this scenario.<br /><br />Childhood memories are sunny days on the beach for Amanda Clarke. Hers was one anyone may envy. But that was before her father's former business associates ruined him... before every one of his friends turned against David Clarke (James Tupper). Now, close to twenty years later, Amanda has disappeared... in her place steps Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp). Wealthy beyond her years, Emily has a trust fund and is the \\"new girl\\" summering at the Hamptons. Renting the elaborate summer home of the recently separated Lydia Davis (Amber Vallenta), Emily falls in love with the home and despite Lydia's claim she won't let her ex sell, her life is ruined when she is caught having an affair with Conrad Grayson (Henry Czerny), one of Hampton's most powerful families. Married for 25 years to his wife, Victoria (Madeline Stowe), Conrad is a successful businessman whose wife finds power and prestige more important than the ruination of her own dreams.<br /><br />Returning home after last summer's tragic accident, Daniel Grayson (Joshua Bowman) has made himself a promise to never drink again. His mother expects her beloved son to keep to this \\"agreement\\" while his father wants him to go into the family investment business. It isn't until Daniel meets Emily that everything changes. Her influence on Daniel is one of the best things that ever happened to him but Victoria is suspicious of the newcomer and keeps a close watch on her son's new fling. What no one knows is that Emily is that forgotten little girl, Amanda... and she is out for revenge on everyone who wronged her father. The one snag in her otherwise perfect plan is Jack (Nick Wechsler)... the boy she once loved.<br /><br />Wow. That was my reaction after watching an entire six-block of episodes of this first season of ABC's latest, soapy nighttime drama in one sitting. My mother and I were glued to the television and did not intend to watch more than two episodes but - much to our shock - we continued to hit \\"play\\" after the credits rolled on each episode. The writing is clever as each plot twists and thickens prompting us to discuss where the show was going multiple times though that doesn't mean this show is for everyone. From a story-telling perspective, this could have been brilliant, and in fact, in more outlets than one, it is. Based off of - or perhaps I should say \\"inspired by\\" - and loosely at that, the Dumas classic tale of revenge, 'The Count of Monte Cristo,' this Mike Kelley created show had so much going for it.<br /><br />The first five to eight episodes are structured nearly exactly alike. They all pick a victim for Emily to target and along with her trusty red Sharpie marker, she \\"ruins\\" those responsible for her father's demise. After a \\"poisoned\\" childhood, it wasn't until she came of age that truth was revealed and she discovered that her father left her a legacy of wealth, and a box filled with truth. The hatred she feels for the family festers and makes her into a person even she begins to question. As a result, the characters actions - particularly those of Emily since she is the heroine, constantly let us down though glimpses remind us they are human even behind their cool demeanors (to say nothing of their soft-spoken words and sweet smiles that are really just hiding sinister tricks!). There are times when I love Emily and Daniel to death but I detest what they ultimately did to Daniel and furthermore their season two plans for him. There is one moment when we think Emily is about to forget everything and actually live her life but her vendetta has gone too far by then. Likewise, an old friend in Nolan is likable - sometimes. Now there are \\"rumors\\" about Nolan and Emily together as a couple though I much prefer them as friends - Emily has a lot of things she needs to set right, some even about her own self, but Nolan is not the romantic match for her. They are better as friends and he is the voice of reason keeping her from reaching insanity.<br /><br />To be honest, I will say that I found this show fantastically good. It is not morally decent and in that way, I was let down by it multiple times BUT judging only the mystery, this can hold its own and then some. If you are looking for a narrative that gives its audience warm, fuzzy characters, you'd best look elsewhere but in all other respects, this is a well executed show (especially its beginning). The cast likewise is fabulous and the actress cast as the young Amanda is a perfect choice. I have two people to thank (blame?) for my interest in this show (well... other than ABC's promo) and they are my aunt and friend. For me, the show was worth seeing because I like a good mystery but I didn't watch it blind to the misguided themes. I cannot recommend it easily because some Christian's will likely not appreciate the subject material but if you don't mind wading through the whole revenge plot, you might find it entertaining. In the end, there is no promise Emily will learn anything - and that is, unarguably a depressing prospect.<br /><br />© Copyright 2011-2012 Dreaming Under the Same Moon / Scribbles, Scripts and Suchet everything and actually live her life but her vendetta has gone too far by then.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is such a page turner its ridiculous. I got it just to have something to read in between classes and next thing i know its over and im starting the next one. I would recommend this  to everyone! Even if you saw the movie you will still get engulfed in the story. Although it is way more graffic than the movie so parents beware... but then again what isnt these days. If i didnt already see the movie i would have given it all 5 stars.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games so much that I couldn't wait to read the next book, Catching Fire.  This second book was equally as good as the first book.  I am now reading the last book, Mockingjay, in the trilogy.  All the books in the trilogy are fasinating reads!
B0078JPCJK|4.0|This is a great show. I wish there were more of it. I love the period dress and beautifully decorated homes. The only thing I din't like was when 2 men were kissing even if for a brief moment.That happened at the beginning somewhere and was irrelavent to the show and plain awful.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's odd that I can win more often with a random deal then with a winning one.  It's a great way to pass the time in a waiting area.  The ads at the start of every game is slightly annoying, but it's a free game.
034580404X|5.0|Love this book  it was my first book I read and it got me reading what a great book ! I have reread this a few time while in-between books and I alway get more out of it
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is a tremendous followup to The Girl with  the Dragon Tattoo and seems to be a little faster paced from the onset. It builds to a breath taking climax and then makes the reader immediately turn around and order the Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. I cannot recommend it too highly but it is almost manditory to read this series in order to get the maximum benefit.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Love this CD or download rather, It's awesome. I like all the songs, and it is so convienient to listen to on my phone anywhere and anytime. The price was good too.

0545128285|4.0|I just ordered this book and had a great time reading it. It's so much fun and gives you an idea of what they were reading in the Deathly Hallows. JK Rowling rocks and has a real way with storytelling. I highly suggest this to fans of the series.
0738711500|5.0|I've only recently become interested in tarot again, mostly for the purposes of research for the novels I'm writing, and I couldn't have been more happy than to stumble across this product. Not only does it have a fantastically illustrated deck, but the book that comes with it is a very easy read while still being informative. The explanations of the cards along with how they interact with each other make for a good way for a beginner (like myself) to learn to do a reading for myself and others. The included mat with a step-by-step and explanation of the Celtic Cross Spread was also very helpful. All in all, this is a great buy and well worth the price, especially considering the deck by itself is typically sold for $17.95. If someone ever asks me for a recommendation for beginners or even seasoned readers, this is the deck I'll point them to. Plus, it came very quickly and I was excited to receive it earlier than I'd originally believed it would arrive.

So I finally got my favorite movie after all this time and it got here earlier than I expected. I couldn't be more pleased with Amazon or this order. I can't wait to get home and watch it! If you ever need a movie you can't find in stores, I highly recommend coming to Amazon, chances are they have it.
0439023513|3.0|The first two books of the Hunger Games were fantastic.  This book was just good, which is a let down when compared to the first two.  This book was much slower than the first two and a little darker.
1577314808|5.0|Whether you're going thru bad situations, hard times or whatever, this book fits right in your hands as you glimpse what Eckhart Tolle is writing about. He give very good heart, real in-depth pointers what you need to know in order to live your life peacefully and great. Life's too fast and short people. We all have our daily battles or obstacles that follow around us everyday. That's why its important to have trust, faith, and a bit of prayer.<br /><br />Hope to God that once you finish this book, you'll experience a whole new you aside.<br /><br />His other book [[ASIN:0452289963 A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)]], is brilliant too.<br /><br />I think this book is similar to Neale Walsch's Conversations with God 3 volume series dealing with the same questions and answers that everybody face.
0439023491|5.0|This 2nd book of the Hunger Games was just as good as the first.  This book is fast moving and kept you glued to it.  I am not a big reader but this book definitely kept me into the story from the first page to the last.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have the first quell game and was overjoyed to find that they came out with another.  This is a real \\"thinking persons\\" puzzle game my favorite type.  Hope there will be a next one even harder!
B008H6GH8I|5.0|The Resident Evil CG movies (this and Degeneration) are so well crafted. They're true to the Resident Evil formula, have very interesting plots, and actually intense action. The visuals and acting are all great, and the quality of CG is superb. Everything is extraordinarily detailed, with only some odd parts that come off looking a little out of place. There is some bad humor thrown in there, but overall, the movie is really worth the watch especially for RE fans.<br /><br />It also offers some of the most interesting back story to the RE saga. After beating RE6 and Revelations and then watching this, a lot makes sense now that the game doesn't bother to explain. Such as how the C-Virus actually has its origin from Las Plagas and not so much Oroborus.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great plot. Good grammar and high level of english. Accurate historical events. Depth of details and care to bring knowledge to the reader. I can't wait to read the final opus.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I never thought the story would be this good!!! It might be crazy roller coaster ride but I freaking love it!!!!! I love the passion, the impulsiveness, and what is to be expected of young love drama!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Maybe Child needs a new hero... I hope not.  but he's getting bored with the action and a disconnect is developing between the action and the explanation of the action.  the scene in the car went on too long. Reality became stretched.  the scenes between the FBI woman and Reacher were as good as anything Child has ever written.<br />Artists usually have an attic full of unfinished paintings.  As soon as they see what the finished painting will look like, they lose interest.  I think Child lost interest about half way through the book.
B0054SMID0|4.0|I saw trailers and thought it might be good.  But it was lackluster at the box office and I thought well maybe not.<br /><br />Well, it is loaded and I do mean loaded with great actors.  And even those not great did a great job (which means the director was good).<br /><br />Okay, not a 5 star all time great movie.  But definitively better than 3 stars.  Pretty decent story, good production, excellent cast all the way around to the most minor character.  Good direction.  Something wasn't never good enough for 5 stars.  But solid, solid 4 stars and quite entertaining.<br /><br />Give it a viewing.  Don't expect greatness, but expect excellence and you won't be displeased.
0525953728|5.0|[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]<br /><br />THIS BOOK WAS SO MUCH MORE, I LOVED IT !! IT IS A BOOK THAT YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN BECAUSE IT IS SO-O-O INTERESTING. IT MADE YOU FEEL YOU WERE THERE IN THE MOMENT WITH THEM, AND UNDERSTANDING ALL OF IT. AND LET ME TELL YOU - I AM ON HIS TEAM !!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Great Book, reminds me of, and worthy to be compared with Shadow of the Torturer, Enders Game, Starship Trooper, Game of Thrones and Bernard Cornwell's Saxon series.  Once you get started, it's very difficult to put down. Heck I even read it on breaks at work.  It keeps moving up levels and the main character develops.  I haven't read as good a book in a long time. Although I'm only 2/3rd of the way through, I am really happy I got it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|entertaining for hours... kills class time... easy to procrastinate very nice game... 10/10 would play almost all day. three more words
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I don't get the low marks other reviewers are giving this CD. But, music is like beauty and it's all in the ear of the listener. For me, Ms. Krall has given us a collection of music that she sings with great control and nuance. Jazz music is not always about the wail, sometimes it's all about the quiet and the pauses. I enjoy this CD because there are no vocal acrobatics, it's lyrics delivered with introspection and a shot of whiskey. This is for those days when you want lovely music and pathos delivered with a whisper, not a scream.
B000065NOS|5.0|This is a classic movie with excellent star roles. Ben Stiller at his finest. Dumb models are brought to a new level!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I think the author could have rested on her laurels after her unprecedented success with Harry Potter.  However, instead my take is she felt called to action to point out this problem of the \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots\\".  For more than half way through the book I was thinking it was mediocre at best.  But by the time I finished it, I came to realize it was a bold, brilliant way to get us to think about the \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots\\" and how inside people's minds, daily thoughts and hearts they are all the same no matter which side of the tracks they live on.  Granted all of the people in this book were messed up, alhough Krystal and Kay did try to help others.  My guess is since the author has achieved unprecedented success, she has met people in high positions she would not have otherwise met and she has been unimpressed or even disappointed.  I think Rowling's bottom line is there are \\"have not\\" kids out there dealing with real problems such as drug addict parents and some of the people who appear to the be pillars of their towns, schools, etc. are not helping them because they fill their days with all of the nonsense/shortcomings we saw in the book.  Yes, I bet the next book will deal with more social issues.  And yes she will probably offend some people again as she attempts to influence them to action.  I think it is her way of giving back after all of her success.
0307744434|5.0|I found this lovely book to be a beautiful peek into whimsy, love, and beauty. I hope to read more stories like this in the future; in fact as soon and as often as the universe provides them.
0307592731|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was pretty fascinating to be taken on Cheryl Strayed's journey with her. There is a real honesty about the way she relates her experiences that made it very relatable overall even if the exact circumstances seem foreign to the reader. The start of the book was actually very emotional for me, and nothing after quite rose to that level. But I didn't mind that, really. Overall the book was nicely paced and neatly sidestepped becoming repetitive while relating what must have been, at times, a somewhat monotonous journey.
B0091XRL86|4.0|Another great movie by Aardman Animations. If you are a fan of the Wallace and Gromit movies you are sure to love this wacky adventure as well. With the explosion of high tech animation, many feel that stop motion animation is a relic of the past. I feel it is an art-form that stands the test of time. My nine year old is just getting to the age where he starting to understand the humor beyond the slap-stick. This movie is a fun romp that pokes fun of our insecurities; teaches us that our friends can be our greatest allies and that they can help steer us back on course when we have gone astray.
B0027WNRIG|5.0|I seen Def Leppard twice years ago when they come on the scene and what a show it was. The Pyromania (Deluxe Edition) was like going back in time to enjoy and bring back good memories from the past. If you're a Leppard fan this is a must have for your collection.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|I really liked this game till I got to the church scene with the trapdoor and the candles. It then locked up and no matter what I did it would not let me do anything. really aggravated. when you pay money you expect a game to work. I want a refund.
B007HPO3CC|5.0|This is the best TV series since Rome was made on HBO. The commentaries are great and the behind the scenes allows you to see what was put into the making of this breathtaking show with the perfect cast!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This was a really good movie. It surpassed the fairy tale of old. I enjoyed it. The evil queen was a great experience.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series was by far the raciest I've ever read but it was also the best. It was well written, intriguing, suspenseful and very entertaining. It left me wanting another to read!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this to dock my iPod nano 6th Generation to a Kicker iK501 speaker dock.  It does support playing and charging the iPod while in its case.<br />Unfortunately the main reason I bought it was due to a \\"requirement\\" of the nano.  This nano has a radio that only works if the earphones are plugged in (they act as the antenna).  The earphone plug is located on the bottom of the nano next to the docking pins so it was not possible to plug in the earphones while the nano was docked.  The CableJive raises the nano high enough so that the earphones can be plugged in while it is docked.<br />Unfortunately it looks like Apple refuses to recognize the radio if the nano is docked, period.  Other than that I am very pleased with the product.  The nano is very small and raising it up makes it easier to see and operate.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|its a good game! makes you think. no permissions if this is the first time you play this game I recommended it's a puzzle games with 1 or more water drops to pick up small ball's lying around the area you goal is to pickup all of them in certain amount of moves some times it's easy some times it's not it is a great game. I just don't want to do it again update reset all levels :-( still 4★

Come on Ms. Harkness....is there anything we can do to support you for it to come faster?
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Fantasy films have always held an interest for me. This rendition of the \\"Snow White\\" story was really wonderful. The computer generated imagery enhanced the story and the performances by the actors were convincing. A worthwhile addition to my DVD collection and warrants a replay time and time again. I would certainly recommend this film for the imaginative more than a fairy tale viewer. Good fun.
1933952806|5.0|This book is great in my opinion. There is so much going on with the Nikon D7000, you have so much ability with this camera and \\"Mastering the Nikon D7000\\" unlocks the camera so you are able utilize all of its features.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|The new Pink album is amazing... i just love Pink and how her music is like its for her, she is just giving the public a chance to understand her.  This is like one of the only albums I have ever bought and I would definitely buy it again. I would have to say my fave tracks are \\"Here comes the Weekend\\" \\"Walk Of Shame\\" and \\"Slut like You.\\" I bought the mp3 album about a week ago and I have listened to these 3 tracks at least 30 times each. :) LOVE LOVE LOVE this album!!!!!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Our book club has been eagerly awaiting this second of the trilogy and we were not disapointed!  Now we have to wait another year or so for the third book!  What a prolific, gifted writer we have in Ken Follett.
0316228532|1.0|Casual Vacancy is one of the few books I ever threw in the garbage. I read 70 pages of dull, negative, poorly placed foul language before it hit the garbage can. I would not classify \\"Adult\\" because of the foul language that was forced or better yet deliberately placed so this book would seem Adult. Definitely not an up lifting feel good book or a book I would recommend to anyone.  J Rowling has ruined her reputation and certainly we adults will never again buy our wee ones a Rowling book. What was Rowling thinking when she was writing this book????
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Arnold was my inspiration during the 80's when I was bodybuilding.  He continues to be my inspiration to this day.  His sexual blunders don't bother me in the least.  I was hoping he'd run for president and he would have my vote were the law for citizenship status and running for president to be changed.<br />Arnold has accomplished a lot in his life and he deserved to brag, and I would too had I accomplished as much.  He is a self made man, and one of a kind.  Read the book and write an honest review. I did.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Worth a couple of bucks. It keeps you engaged in the story line and I found it refreshing compared to most app games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't stop! I must read on to the next book. This will be a set of books that I could read over and over. Titillating, exciting and arousing. I hope to pull out of my shy box and explore a little more. Thanks for such an incredible book that perks my inner goddess.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|***Spoiler***<br /><br />quality style of writing in book 3 with a good deal of action combined with the usual plot twists to keep things interesting. I just am legitimately mad some of my favorite characters are dead. Hope there will be more new likable characters in book 4.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|The Pines follows a Secret Service agent involved in a traffic accident who finds himself in a deeper and deeper mystery. His attempts to return to the reality he knew seems doomed until he discovers the startling reality that shocks the reader. I was left numb by this elegant tale of suspense.
B003OWVI0W|3.0|As a record label, what do you do when one of your boldest artists has just recorded several days of some of the most innovative, forward-looking music of his career? In making this 1972 double LP, Columbia decided to junk all but the last day, which some band members called the weakest, and then mix it with studio sessions recorded months earlier by a different lineup, additionally cutting and splicing everything up. Miles Davis fans have often had mixed feelings about the Frankenstein monster that is LIVE-EVIL, and the release of [[ASIN:B000AP2Z6C The Cellar Door Sessions 1970]] boxset was greeted with applause by those who wanted to hear the recording session in its entirety, and free of Teo Macero's studio editing.<br /><br />I'd have to join the chorus that proclaims LIVE-EVIL a weak album. As interesting as some of its moments are, it feels like a patchwork in a way that BREW, though it used its fair share of splicing, never did. There's some interesting use of new technology here, such as Davis' use of wah-wah pedal with his trumpet and Chick Corea's expanded electric piano timbres. Airto Moreira contributes Brazilian percussion and whistles, which gives a whole new variety to Miles' sound. Nonetheless, things just don't grow into a larger convincing whole. The one big exception is the track \\"What I Say\\", the only performance from these sessions provided in its entirety and without studio trickery. This is easily one of the greatest tracks on a Miles Davis release, and the solos within from Davis, John McLaughlin and Jack Dejohnette here are awesome achievements.<br /><br />LIVE-EVIL might be enjoyable listening if you are saving your pennies for the The Cellar Door sessions boxset, but it is quite flawed and I'm still scratching my head wondering what Columbia was thinking.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|One of my favorite albums. A great band with a unique sound. I would highly recommend this for people who appreciate fine music. A nice change from the boring everyday so called rock.
0545128285|5.0|It's pretty cool how this book is related to the Harry Potter series. It's like we are living in the wondrous world of Hogwarts.<br /><br />I bought it new so the price was pretty good compared to any other bookstore's retail prices.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
0525953728|5.0|Obama killed UBL about as much as he helped build your business. UBL was taken down by a team of professional Navy SEAL Operators with intel from a career intelligence officer who'd been doggedly searching for him for a decade. This book takes you through several operations so you understand the tactics, skills and dedication of the men tasked with the job who, make no mistake: built this. We owe them a debt of thanks not only for this, but the back to back to back deployments for years, that have kept our nation safe after 9/11.<br /><br />The book also offered some indirect insight into the Benghazi debacle, in that these men die hard and not at the hands of spontaneous rioters. Nothing less than a pre planned ambush, assault, and/or artillery, from a determined and well equipped enemy, could have been what they bravely and skillfully faced as they attempted to rescue Ambassador Stevens and paid the ultimate price.  It is a base slander of their, courage, intelligence, skill and sacrifice to say otherwise.<br /><br />We are fortunate indeed that such men of courage and honor keep the watch in distant lands so our families can live and work in freedom and sleep safe in their beds at night. They deserve our recognition, gratitude, long and happy lives in peace, and I wish that for every single one of them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Sections One and Two kept me glued to the pages and coming back for more. But the end of this novel just fizzled and I felt disappointed at the resolution (or lack therof) of the issues. All the heroes of the story just gave up/gave in, going against their character shown throughout the book. Too bad, as there could have been dozens of other, more exciting and more believeable outcomes.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game awesome, I have played all of the Oregon trail games.  please keep them coming, a I wii keep playing them.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the best 3d blu-ray I've seen. I expected nothing less from a record breaking summer blockbuster.<br />It shipped fast, the other disks work great and I purchased when it was only $19.99.<br /><br />What has two thumbs and is Winning? this guy.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Could not put down this book. very well written. this is truly a great series and cant wait to see what Suzanne Collins comes up with next.
190776111X|1.0|I read constantly and am no stranger to very edgy erotica but this book was just ridiculous. This is only the second review I've written but I was so mislead by the other reviews that I thought I should write. Greta has no problem following a strange dirty man into a filthy attic to please him with her mouth but balks at construction workers catcalling wondering if they thought that would get them anywhere with women. Well, it only took Dirty Bill telling her to follow him for her to do so. I understand submissives wanting to please a dominant but that's not what was going on in this book. There were hot scenes but most of it was just stupid.
B000FC146C|4.0|I never watched the series and always wondered what all the fuss was about.  The book is very entertaining and I recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting read that is set in Australia. The book is well written and most enjoyable. I also bought the audio book so I could keep the book moving while in the car.
B001AQR39O|5.0|Another amazing season of this very awesome show and i loved watching every single episode on this dvd set. the storylines of the episodes and the performances from the cast are very spot on. been meaning to buy the seasons three and four box set since i missed those last two seasons, been watching this show on dvd since i don't get showtime.
078322947X|5.0|This film is an excellent thriller and film noire with a pervasive sense of desperation against impossible odds.  The story setting is Nicaragua (two men refer to Managua), but the jungle filming was in the Dominican Republic.  The whole sense of the film appeals to danger, violence, and the male persona.  The musical score by Tangerine Dream grabs hold and will not let go.  William Friedkin did a wonderful job of building tension in showing the background of each man on the run. Three of the four protagonists sought easy illegal gains in deals that went wrong; the fourth is a terrorist.  They come from New Jersey, Paris, the Caribbean, and Israel.  Their paths cross after escaping to this poverty-stricken 3rd world backwater.  Now they lunge at the chance to make $10,000 fast; but they are doubling down and betting with their lives.  This is the devil's bargain and there is hell to pay. The first bad deal put them in purgatory in the jungle, now they risk total obliteration. The name Sorcerer seems appropriate to the foreboding difficulty of transporting nitroglycerin across 200 miles of jungle.  Also, one truck has a radiator grill that looks like teeth similar to a malevolent Mayan stone carving that they pass along a mountain road.  This is one of my favorite films.  Great to watch on a friday night with some good buddies and a few beers.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|I ordered a \\"new\\" 2 disc special edition dvd of the mist and what I got was a dvd with a huge gash through the bar code by a knife or box cutter that was then covered by a new bar code sticker, this is far from new and it pretty much left me high and dry with a gift I am ashamed to give due to it's damaged state. The description could have made it clear that this is what you were getting, a dvd in a damaged case. Buyer Beware
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am usually not one to write a review of a book, but after reading this book twice, I felt compelled to do so. I love the Crossfire novels. They are so hot!!!! This book along with Bared to You was very well written. I love that it is written in first person, because it has drawn me into the book as though I was Eva and Gideon was my man. Whatever she felt, I felt- her pleasure, her pain, her anxiety and desperation, I felt it. That is what makes Sylvia Day the extremely good author that she is. When she writes, its like she writes you in the book. I loved this book and I will buy any and all books that she writes.
B008CJ0JTI|4.0|The good - the movie looks terrific. It's like watching it again for the first time. I was please to see Criterion pick this up and they did not let me down with the image quality. And despite what another reviewer has commented, this does have subtitles.<br /><br />The bad - unfortuantely there are not many special features on this disc. I have been a huge fan of the movie for the last decade-plus and was hoping for some great extras, but there wasn't much and what was included was not anything mind blowing. This is why it's getting a 4/5 from me instead of a 5.<br /><br />The fun - the one feature it does have (which was only available on laserdisc before this) is the alternate ending. I have been wondering about this for years, and my expectations were realized beyond my wildest dreams when the alternate ending revealed that it was, in fact, a dream the entire time! haha, not really...<br /><br />Worth the $20-25 if you're a fan of the film!
B0043X1FL8|5.0|I have loved this movie since childhood, and rewatching it reminded me of why. I have used this movie in the classroom to talk about types of intelligence. I am amazed at how relevant the story is to life today, and the performancces are mind-blowing!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This was a good read with interesting characters and many plot twists and turns.  Her descriptions of France added to the appeal.  I will probably read more of this authors books.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It may not have been the \\"greatest\\" book I have read but it was very difficult to pause reading it. Due to the multiple parallel stories it does not feel too long, actually I would have preferred it even longer - it was over all too sudden! I enjoyed part 1 (Fall of Giants) even more because it brought me new insights to that time period (WW1) while I was way more familiar with the WW2 time period. I look forward to part 3!
0740748475|5.0|This mammoth three book set is everything you'd expect from something calling itself \\"complete\\". The books showcase every strip and have interesting additional info from Mr. Watterson (I loved reading about his career leading to the creation of the strip). They are solid books that will be a good addition to any library.

B0087DFIYA|5.0|Loved the movie myself. It was sort of like they took Gibsons \\"porter\\" from the movie Payback & threw him in this crazy Mexican Prison.<br /><br />No spoilers other then the above & boy im real curious now if 'prisons' like the one portrayed here actualy exist, not that i'd want to find out firsthand ;>)<br /><br />Great Movie in my opinion.<br /><br />LOVED the 1st payback, hated the 2nd 'so called original' one released not long ago. Loved Get the Gringo & hope they dont ruin it in 10 years by doing what they did with payback & release another version that turns a 5 star movie in to a 1 or 2 star movie.<br /><br />But, do yourself a favor, watch Get The Gringo & see if YOU liked it. I sure did!
B008BM9L72|5.0|This just thrilled me and its one of those books which are hard to put down.  Quite entertaining, well written, loved it and looking forward to reading more books from the same author.

0525953728|5.0|When I got started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  More people should write and tell the REAL truth about such incidents.  We only know what the Government wants us to know, which isn't always true and factual.  I totally enjoyed NO EASY DAY and would highly recommend it.

B000BF0D9M|5.0|I just discovered Jesse Cook and all I can say is, \\"Wow!\\" As a writer I'm constantly on the lookout for writing music, music that inspires me and helps me to get in a mood that optimizes my creativity. This CD has quickly risen to the top of my list of \\"must haves\\" flowing out of my speakers. It's romantic, melodic, and inspirational.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I absolutely love this game. It let me train my brain and teach to thing several steps in advance. Most of levels I passed without any problems, but there are few levels which took me couple days to figured out.<br />Down side: after today's update I have lost all my previously passed levels regardless the note at the beginning of the update installation. The note stayed that all my data will be safe. Apparently not. Now I have to start from the very first level again. Too bad! I certainly<br />not expected it.

B007VTVGFQ|3.0|A fan of Fiona's from the beginning, I love her unpredictability and passion and respect that she marches to the beat of a different drummer. That said, I'm a bit disappointed in this effort. The genius on display in songs like \\"Every Single Night\\", \\"Regret\\" and \\"Hot Knife\\" which combine her unique lyrical sensibility with memorable melodies are too often forsaken for the theatrics and clever rhythmic structures of most of the album, especially on pieces such as \\"Jonathan\\", \\"Left Alone\\" and \\"Periphery\\" which are largely weak on melody even as they make a deep impression lyrically. They seem a little half-realized to me. Minimalism is fine, whether it's the song or the production but I do miss Jon Brion's touch.<br />While \\"When The Pawn...\\" is still the apex of Fiona's work for me and I don't expect her to continue in that vein, this disc did challenge me and for that I'm grateful. If you're willing to shell out the extra bucks for the deluxe version, the handwritten lyrics and drawings within the replica of a student journal is gorgeous and gives insight into the making of the album and Fiona's art. A couple of postcards, a fold-out poster of the cover and a nifty DVD of five live performances is also included.<br />Please just bring the melodies next time around, Ms. Apple!
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|This was really a disappointment. After less than half an hour i was ready to turn it off, but instead i chose to see the painful rest of this movie. The acting is mediocre, the characters are not convincing. There wasn't real dialogue, just cheap oneliners and 'jokes'. The storyline was bad, the scenes didn't really have some glue between them, they just jumped from the one cliche to the other... Again, an idea of a movie these days becomes a reality just by focusing on special effects. This reality is sad but 'special effects' are not a movie, just a nice additive to a movie, if it fits in the context.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game overall. easy yo beat some levels others are really hsrd. I like it though. play everyday to get points
B008M721MS|3.0|the main problem is that i cant add my gf because she isnt getting my requests  and im not getting hers  other than that it looks good  but im not sure cause im still trying to figure out this problem
1400069289|5.0|Charles Duhigg does a really great job at explaining the science behind habits. It is an easy read and goes in depth into the research that Duhigg did to arrive at his conclusion of the Cue, Routine, Reward loop. I highly recommend it for anyone who's looking to learn more about their habits and change the way they live life.
B0062ABRDQ|4.0|Great film. It was recommended by a professor and I was thoroughly glad to spend the time watching it. Even though centered around a smoke shop there is so much more going on that this could be a film shown in classes for a number of reasons.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|if you enjoyed the first book in the trilogy, you will love this second book!  Can't wait to read the next chapter.
030758836X|4.0|Entertaining, deviously plotted thriller whipsaws your perspective on the main characters from chapter to chapter until you're thoroughly baffled. It's difficult to discuss this novel without giving away important plot developments, so let it suffice for me to say it's fiendishly engrossing and stylishly written, it turns the genre on end, and its ending is unexpected and highly atypical.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is a great Jack Reacher story.  I have liked all of them, but the last couple seemed a little like quick and dirty.  This one however was much better.  The story was intricate, lots of good character development.  Well crafted.
0060873175|1.0|Hard to tell who's principally responsible for this unprofessional waste of an excellent story idea. The publisher says Crichton completed about a third of the book before he died four years ago, and Preston finished using Crichton's notes and outline. But the final product is so amateurish and unentertaining it should be embarrassing to both of them, including the long-buried Crichton.<br /><br />I thought the plot's premise was so ingenious that in the beginning I forced myself past the huge gaps the authors left in setting the story up. Okay, so they were anxious to get to the meat of the story; I can understand that.  But the rest of the book is just cause to revoke their writer's licenses. The caricatures, er, characters, are one-dimensional and their interactions and conversations lamely wooden. And at least one character is so cartoonishly stupid and inept I almost put the book down forever. (Given Crichton's evisceration in \\"Next\\" of a certain critic of \\"State of Fear,\\" I wonder if the buffoonish Danny Minot character is meant to be an attack on someone else who pissed him off.)<br /><br />The plot plods along and never misses an obvious twist - most of which, fortunately for barely literate readers, are telegraphed well in advance - until it reaches its clich&eacute;d finale. I very much regret there's not a thrill in the book, and any suspense is perfunctory at best. I'm sorry that the man who brought us many tense and provocative books like \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" and \\"Airframe\\" will be remembered by this ghastly effort.
B00881VLCE|5.0|So addicting! Great way to pass time. A variety of puzzles available for free, but some have to be paid for at $0.99 each. Also like the fact that you can choose how many pieces and whether to rotate or not. Wish you could change background color and music.

The book is accessible to any educated audience, as engaging as Gladwell-like pop-science books, while still being deeply informative even to social science experts.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This book started with a premise filled with potential. What if the husband of a missing woman really DIDN'T have anything to do with her disappearance? This could have been a first notch thriller ripe with commentary about our blood thirsty appetites for 24-hour televised gore. Instead, it skimmed the surfaces of pop culture (why wasn't the Nancy Grace-like character developed more?), left WAY too many details either dangling or utterly implausible, and gave us two main characters we cared nothing about. There are so many better psychological thrillers out there more worthy of a reader's time. Instead of this shallow book, try a new author I just discovered. Try \\"The Fixer\\" by T.E. Woods. You'll see how satisfying a twisted, mind-bending crime novel can be.[[ASIN:B0084EYSMK The Fixer (A Mort Grant Novel)]]

B002GHIPYI|5.0|Before I used turtle beaches for my PC gaming. But since I always have guest over, I can never seem to get to use my turtle beaches for gaming. So I bought a spare headphones which happens to be these Superlux. First off, I am very very please by how it feels on my head, the ear piece covers my entire ear completely something my turtle beaches connect compare in comfort. When I first started using it, I totally forgot that I was even wearing it on my head, its actually surprising light. So I'ma go ahead and list all the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros: Large room for ears<br />Price<br />Sound<br />Comfort<br /><br />Cons: Only one I found, it's semi-open so you can hear other people around you with these on, but it doesn't really bug me.<br /><br />Also the red trimming on the headphones are allot darker in person. Overall, I think these are a great buy for the quality and value it has.

0316228532|2.0|I picked it up on the reputation of J.K. Rowlings previous books. I will not be picking the next one. This is a very depressing book. There is no plot, it is just s character study of a small town and not one of the characters are likeable. Halfway through the book I was thinking, \\"okay, I get it\\" and hoping that something would happen but it never does.  Don't waste your money on this book. It is not clever or entertaining.

B008FSCNTK|1.0|Diana Krall has stated in interviews that the selections on this \\"concept\\" album have nothing to do with jazz or with the \\"swing\\" associated with Sinatra--which is representative of a tradition, or lineage, emanating from the \\"black\\" music of Louis and Bessie Smith along with its symbiotic relation with the blues and a distinguished \\"Songbook\\" composed by by Berlin, Kern, Gershwin, Arlen, Ellington, Rodgers, Porter.  Instead, her purpose from the beginning was to produce an album (and subsequent world tour) representing the vaudeville, or burlesque, tradition of the \\"roaring 20s,\\" along with songs by the favorites of her parents and grand parents: in short, the music of vaudeville and burlesque, a \\"white\\" tradition associated with the show-hall performers of the \\"roaring\\" 1920's, the era of the flappers,  and a \\"jazz\\" age which pronounced impresario Paul Whiteman as the \\"King of Jazz.\\"<br /><br />The result is an \\"alternative\\" program of songs that, for the most part, have vanished from public memory (the first track--\\"We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye,\\" which was recorded by Sinatra, is the closest to a \\"standard\\").  As stated in my original review, the tunes frequently come alive--with sincere and unguarded melodramatic emotion, with theatrical and spirited flare--in their original versions from the '20s and '30s.  No one who has this albums should pass up the opportunity to hear the original \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" as performed by Ted Lewis (and slightly later by legendary, tragic torch singer Helen Morgan).  Another \\"must\\" is Georgie Jessel's original recording of \\"When the Curtain Comes Down,\\" who makes clear the song's function as a \\"show opener\\"! By contrast, the Krall version--which employs the narrative voice of Elvis Costello--treats the song as a morose, funereal closer, implying that no one on the present recording has taken the trouble to listen to the lyrics of the song.<br /><br />Listen to the Boswell Sisters' recording of \\"We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye\\" (and catch their breath-taking \\"Everybody Wants My Baby\\" while you're at it).  Then there are plaintive, affecting originals by Ruth Etting (played by Doris Day in \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\") and Jimmy Rogers, Gene Austin, Frank Crumit, Annette Hanshaw.  In each case, the original version is barely \\"hinted at\\" in Krall's low-register, unemotional, breathy delivery, which is simply unsuited to capture of the spirited originals.  Although the last century's most prolific, versatile and influential singer, Bing Crosby, is represented several times, Krall passes by the jazz-singing Crosby who was inspired by Louis Armstrong (\\"Shine,\\" \\"St. Louis Blues,\\" \\"Stardust\\") in favor of the melodramatic, more vaudeville-style Crosby of the late '20s and early '30s.  The problem again is that she can't begin to approach the near-operatic intensity and vocal artistry of Crosby's original performances, which he could effectively project even before sensitive microphones.<br /><br />In short, there's an important vein of American music that Krall has opened up on \\"Glad Rag Doll,\\" but a musician of her \\"cool jazz\\" stylistic qualities--pleasant and sultry vocals (rarely moving above middle C) and finely honed but stylized piano improvisations (she has yet to demonstrate she can sustain musical interest beyond two choruses of a tune)--is the least likely to approximate the spirit, passion and theatrical strengths of the original performers of vaudeville music.  Contrary to the hype of the producer-promoters of this album, it does not begin to recreate the energy off the age of the flappers, the roaring '20s, the \\"Jazz Age.\\"  Rather than revisit the music of the Great Gatsby BEFORE the party, the listener is invited to the tragic \\"aftermath\\" of Jay Gatsby's party, leading to his death and desolate funeral.<br /><br />Initially, I was seduced by the \\"concept\\" and gave the album a lonely (at the time) 5 stars.  But my feelings, along with circumstances surrounding the album, have changed.  From the beginning the album was: 1. panned by Krall fans, who found the music not only a totally different path for the popular jazz vocalist but dreary, dull and monotonous experience; 2. loudly hyped by rich promoters as an unqualified artistic success.  Soon, the big money won, with the album appearing in one publication after another (this week, the cover story of \\"Down Beat\\" magazine, the bible of the jazz world.  What we're witnessing with \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" is NOT a democratic, \\"middle-out\\" success but a \\"top-down\\" triumph that's been orchestrated by the \\"smart corporate money,\\" tin-eared, opportunistic and relentless producers accustomed to putting their materialistic might behind a Taylor Swift or Justin Timberlake.  Certainly such promotion is better devoted to Krall than teen-pop but why not the best Diana Krall, the one growing out of the black jazz tradition of Nat Cole?  Or why the scandalously overlooked Roberta Gambarini (the new millennium's Ella)?  Even some of Sinatra's best albums with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra are out of print.  Why not preserve this cultural hallmark of the previous century rather than \\"force\\" this album of inferior music down consumers' throats.<br /><br />Previously, I was seduced by the concept Diana was honoring in \\"Glad Rag Doll.\\"  After listening to the album, observing the marketing tactics behind its \\"apparent\\" success, and re-discovering the musical tradition that the present weak representation claims it is paying tribute to, I must expose the same \\"Emperor's New Clothes,\\" that initially had me fooled.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />Frank Sinatra was the first artist to grasp the significance and potential of the new long-playing 33 rpm vinyl record format.  Despite the rise of Ole Blue to \\"matinee idol,\\" or \\"Elvis stature\\" in the 1940s, he still trailed by good measure the prolific Bing Crosby, who excelled in every genre of popular music--melodramatic movie music, Hawaiian melodies, Irish favorites, Broadway tunes, heated jazz (with scatting and whistling) and, of course, country-western.  It seemed there was no \\"fencing in\\" this seminal voice of American popular song.<br /><br />In the early 1950s, however, Sinatra seized the long-playing format and, together with orchestrator Nelson Riddle, released a series of  artistically whole \\"concept\\" albums, each unified by a central theme, each composed of \\"old\\"songs from the '20s and '30s, each organized as a \\"narrative\\" capable of holding the listener's attention for the twelve songs--all ballads, or all swing tunes, or all songs about subjects normally considered inappropriate for popular entertainment.  Sinatra sang about loneliness, loss and aging--while taking on the persona of the character in the song and making you believe every word.<br /><br />The commercial and artistic success of the \\"concept albums\\" raised Sinatra in public esteem, leading many to proclaim Ole Blue not only the best jazz singer but the most compelling and poetic voice of the 20th century--the \\"master storyteller,\\" a nuanced interpreter of ballads, who slowed them down to \\"undanceable\\" tempos and conveyed their very essence with his legendary \\"breathless phrasing.\\"<br /><br />Diana Krall may not possess the vocal talent of Frank Sinatra, but in \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" she is, like Sinatra, taking a similar bold, conservative direction by mining the tunes of the past.  Moreover, she's centered the songs around a unifying theme, or a \\"narrative\\" and \\"persona\\"--that of a New Orleans \\"sporting house\\" lady, whose success depends on singing in a sultry, undeniably pleasing manner but with limited  opportunities for emotional engagement with this material (admittedly, our attention is necessarily directed to her pianistic skills as much as her voice}.  On the cover of the album she's dressed in black silk stockings and garters, and filmed on a couch or next to the parlor piano (perhaps meant to evoke the ragtime melodies of Jelly Roll Morton, the most colorful of all New Orleans Sportin' House pianists).<br /><br />It's a daring concept (as were the Sinatra-Riddle albums, which ignored contemporary fluff in favor of songs from forgotten shows, revues, and movies). For Sinatra the approach not only worked but sparked one of the most storied comebacks in entertainment history. Perhaps \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" will enjoy some of the same success.  Still, much of the material seems at odds with Krall's strengths as a versatile jazz musician. The songs have a pre-Louis Armstrong mechanical beat and dispassionate elocution that does a disservice to the creativity of 1920s musicians such as Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Earl \\"Fatha\\" Hines and even Jelly Roll. Without swing, what's left is the dramatic interest of the featured performer's persona as a Sportin' House lady and the songs she's required to sing for patrons' pleasure. Or is that the point? Her persona is that of a victim, forced to perform for the pleasure of clientele who are too jaded to reward songs of heartfelt emotion.<br /><br />Diana Krall has not as yet followed Nat Cole's (or Carmen McRae's) example of converting her image from \\"singer-pianist\\" (in Nat's case, one of the 3-4 best jazz pianists alive!) to a \\"stand-alone\\" singer (even the credits unfailingly bill her as responsible for \\"vocal and piano\\" for each selection).  Her voice hovers around middle C, often remaining comfortably beneath the note.  Even when piano is replaced by various guitars and \\"period piece\\" instruments, her elocution too often is overshadowed by accompaniment that occupies the foreground, requiring the listener to strain to catch all the words. The infectious personification of the opening lyrics--\\"The chair and then the sofa /  broke right down and cried /  the curtains started waving for him to come inside\\"--embraced whole-heartedly and sung with unapologetic openness and clarity by Crosby/Clooney or the Boswell Sisters--is reduced to a throwaway line in Krall's desultory approach, which appears to be aiming for an ironic displacement between sentimental lyrics and her low-key delivery of them. The result could be seen as a hip modernization of these \\"ancient\\" sentiments--or could easily lead to a sense of accumulative, enervating dreariness and monotony.<br /><br />Albums (along with CD players) are continuing to slide in sales, and a piano-playing singer with a Julie London-like voice, however gifted, is arguably forced to try something different to attract and hold the public's attention.  Maybe Diana will score with a growing number of Sportin' House patrons who purchase the album and choose to revisit it frequently.  If so, she can be a \\"glad doll,\\" but credit must be given to her producers as much as her vocal and pianistic skills.jazz (with scatting and whistling) and, of course, country-western.

0385737955|3.0|What would happen if you woke up in a dark, metal box with no memory to speak of? The only thing you do remember is your first name. Welcome to Thomas' predicament. When the lift's doors open, Thomas steps into an unknown place called \\"the Glade,\\" whose massive stone walls close at night to keep the beasties at bay. He's stuck in a giant labyrinth with no way out and surrounded by boys who are just like him--lacking a memory, adults or a foreseeable solution. All they know is that every 30 days a boy is delivered to the Glade and they need to find a way out. Then one day, everything changes. A girl is sent up in the lift with a shocking message that sets to destroy the safe haven they've created in the Glade. Suddenly, all of their lives hinge on Thomas and the dark memories buried deep within his mind. Will they all survive to find their way back home?<br /><br />I'm a total sucker for dystopias. Give me an impossible situation in a grave setting with characters fighting for their lives and I'll eat it right up. It's been my experience, however, that when a book like this is super hyped up, it rarely meets my expectations. Unfortunately, such was the case with The Maze Runner. And I'm not even saying the book was bad, it was quite good in fact, but I feel like it could have been so much more. Overall, I loved the premise--the unsolvable maze, the Lord of the Flies-esque society and the high impact ending. Ohmygosh the ending! But man, why did Thomas have to be so annoying? And what was with the deal with him and his inevitable connection with the girl, Teresa? Aren't dystopias supposed to have a clear anti-establishment message, because I totally didn't get much of one here. There were just too many questions and not nearly enough answers.<br /><br />So let's start with the bad. I think my biggest problem was how drawn out this book was. Dashner could've cut out about 100 pages and it would've been so much less redundant. Thomas just asked the same questions over and over again. Look, I get it. He's the newb and wants to be in the know, but like Thomas, I became frustrated because I wasn't given enough information. And speaking of Thomas, he was an awfully cranky chap, not all that likable for our main character. I found him to be rather one note and that, for me, is a huge bummer. My biggest issue was with the pacing though. It's all wrong. We hit the ground running in the beginning but then it draws to a lull throughout much of the middle. I feel like Dashner didn't stress the direness of their situation until the last quarter of the book which is crucial in an action-based dystopia.<br /><br />But even with the drawbacks The Maze Runner's pros outnumber the cons. I won't give away the ending (it's best left to be read), but man, it's a fiery one! Dashner totally nailed it. And though Thomas and I will never quite be BFF's there are several characters who I wouldn't hesitate to hang with. First, there's Gally. Okay, not so pleasant but I do admire his tenacity. He has his reasons for being distrustful and you do come to find out why. The veritable leader of the gang, Newt, is sharp as a tack and super reasonable. It's easy to see why he's chosen to be the head honcho. And there's Chuck. Oh, Chuckie. He's the \\"Piggy\\" of our crew (re: Lord of the Flies)-- aloof, kind of a nerd and 100% loveable. Now we come to, who I think is the star of the show. Minho is a \\"runner,\\" one of the few who goes out and explores the maze by day, mapping all of its secrets. He's the sarcastic, witty and adventurous friend that you always wanted. Crush alert: I'm smitten. It's characters like him that charmed their way into my heart throughout this story.<br /><br />All in all, Dashner has done a decent job of puzzling not only the characters but the reader as well. Never once did I have an inkling of who was doing this to the boys and why. I was left guessing to the very end. Oh and what an end! It comes out of left field and pummels you (in a good way) with surprise. The only thing more surprising than the ending was the fact that it didn't quite reach the level that I thought it would or could. I was expecting something more, a deeper message that just wasn't there. The Maze Runner didn't satiate me in the way that other dystopias have. Be that as it may, it is an engaging read that's enjoyable enough to bring me back for book #2.<br /><br />Food for Thought: If you set aside my nitpicking, The Maze Runner really is a quick and entertaining read. And though it didn't live up to its amazing potential, I liked it enough to want to continue on with the series. It's a great introductory to the dystopian genre for those who don't want to think too hard but still love an exciting journey.<br /><br />Rating: ★★★½d way) with surprise.

B00846REIS|2.0|This is the first time I've written a book review, and I read about two novels a month.  Like my title says, I should've just read 50 Shades again, because it was the exact same thing!  Plus, it was so unrealistic...couples therapy after knowing each other for two weeks?  I also found Ana in 50 a stronger woman than Eva.  But, as the others put, it has the same story line, same characters, etc.  Only thing better in this book is the author didn't constantly use the same words ie \\"murmur\\" frown\\" etc.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Note:  Comparing this movie to the TV serial is really difficult to do since the series had more time to develop the entire Barnabas storyline.  As one of those devoted DARK SHADOWS fanatics who rushed home from school and work to watch the show, Jonathan Frid and Lara Parker are the only Barnabas and Angelique I can fully accept..and none of the subsequent remakes will ever surpass the original.<br />With that in mind, how does Tim Burton's film stand on its own merits?  One flaw is the tone of the movie - is it a comedy or a straight-on horror flick---or is it both?  Johnny Depp starts off rather foppish and then tries being more sinister and aggressive without any real transitional event to support this change.  Bella Heathcote is a rather passive love interest; Michelle Pfeiffer is quite good as the Collins matriarch, even when she's using a shotgun against the evil Angelique; Burton unwisely restrains Jackie Earle Haley in his role as Willie, a role that would have been more effective had Willie been more uncontrolled; Eva Green chews up the scenery relentlessly but almost becomes comical; Helena Bonham Carter, Jonny Lee Miller and Chloe Jane Moritz are adequate, but their characters seem under-developed.  Burton's visuals are expectedly stunning.  While Danny Elfman's score has its moments, shame on the producers decision not to use the series' haunting theme, especially since both Burton and Depp claimed to be such faithful devotees.  The film's final battle between Depp and Green is an over-the-top CGI slugfest and its final scene between Depp and Heathcote is oh-so TWILIGHTish.  Also the cameos of series regulars Frid, Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott and David Selby occur so quickly, there easy  to overlook...surely they deserved a bigger moment?  But I have gone back on my word not to compare???  Sorry, just had to include my feelings on those two pet peeves.<br />I was entertained by Burton's film, but ultimately, it's a hollow victory.  Unlike the series, this DARK SHADOWS will never be as endearing or enduring.is DARK SHADOWS will never be as endearing or enduring.

B007704HO6|5.0|I love how straight forward and honestly this story is told. He is very open about his problems and the choices he made in life.  The kindness and love he extends to a scraggly starving street cat reveals even to himself the good that is still in his heart and soul. His love and caring for this cat and the trust the cat gives back makes a very extraordinary story. James amd Bob are a wonderful pair. Look them up on youtube. I will reread this often.

0553582461|1.0|I was rather excited with the beginning of this series, very much enjoyed the story line, the characters- Robin Hobb is able to create an interesting world. As the characters grew up through the series, they never seemed actually to grow up. Relationships turned hokie and awkward. Tears flowed. And it seemed the author herself grew bored with the story, had a deadline to meet. The 2nd half of this book becomes a muddled mess. Had I not read the previous 8 books, I certainly would have given this up. A lot of opportunity was lost here. In particular, some of the female characters were strong, intelligent, interesting, as opposed to the main male characters, Fitz and the love-sick Fool, who increasingly become self-indulgent twits as the story plods on through 9 books. It's too bad. There was promise at the beginning. If you wish to read good fantasy that does not head south, I would suggest any of Martha Wells' books. Or Ender's Shadow. Or the classic Dune. Or Hunger Games {trilogy, not the movie.}

B008NW67E0|3.0|I saw the Mumfords at Off Broadway in St. Louis for 12 dollars(a buck less than the download of this album) way back when and that was an energetic, entertaining show.  I liked most of their album but there was a certain sameness to it all.<br /><br />Babel continues in this sameness pattern.  Some hoedowns, some pretty, lyrical pretension with stilted love poetics, and then those dreadful stretches of slowww moving self-conscious plucking as in Lovers' Eyes.<br /><br />Yes, they have played it safe with a 'if it ain't broke why fix it' musical sentiment with this album and it has them losing considerable luster as there are no songs of the strength of the few songs that sparkled on their first album.<br /><br />This band suffered from too much seriousness on their first album and this continues on Babel.  Hopefully they have enough creative mo jo moving forward that will allow for a more expansiveness and creative sound on their next album.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It took me two long days to read it,i was literally reading while driving,wishing a red light will last longer,that kind of page turning addicted was this book to me.<br /><br />I liked the fact that it's not like Fifty at all,it didn't remind me of Grey or Ana, and i loved that, i liked this series more than Fifty.<br /><br />Best part is,after the end you'll find yourself reading all over again, and saying \\"ahhh now i understand\\"
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I was sad that it had so many limitations.  You can't delete a comment if you would like.  It has way too many ads, you can't check photos as easily and the layout just didn't do it for me.  Although I am not sure I am not burning out on Facebook.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|I am glad I only paid $20 for this otherwise I would have been angry at the discovery that Disney/Marvel severely crippled your ability to watch special features.<br /><br />For starters, the 90 minute special feature Building the Marvel Cinematic Universe is missing. I don't know what Disney was thinking when they decided the only way you can have all the special features was if you buy it from a certain store. That is just wrong on their part to do such a thing.<br /><br />Secondly, I hate how you can't access certain features unless you download the Marvel Second Experience App. Even after downloading the app, it still wouldn't work.<br /><br />This is a great example where design took priority over functionality and practicality and its the consumer that suffers in the end. I am extremely disappointed.<br /><br />As an added insult to injury, when I downloaded the movie from iTunes with my digital download code, it wouldn't include any of the iTunes Extras.<br /><br />I also don't like the packaging of the movie either. The cover makes me dizzy and while you can tear it off there is nothing behind it so it becomes an ugly yellow box. I also don't like how the discs are placed on top of each other rather than receive their own slot.<br /><br />I also am upset that the 30 minutes of deleted Captain America scenes from The Avengers was not included either.<br /><br />The only thing that is keeping me from giving this review anything less than 3 stars is that the 3D is good and for $20 instead of $30, it was totally worth it. But had I bought this when the price had shot up to $37, I would be demanding my money back. Too much money for such major design flaw on Disney's part.

Her message is: live NOW, live intensely; it's not always fun (blisters, divorce, hunger) but the rewards are enormous!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very good first hand and first person account of the raid on bin Ladens compound. Contrary to popular belief, no military secrets were revealed in this book and nothing was stated that was classified. You could find the same type of information in a Tom Clancy novel.

034580404X|5.0|I heard bits and pieces here and there about the Fifty Shades books. One night, a friend's girlfriend asked me if I read it and I said no. I asked her what it was about. She smiled coyly and said, \\"Oh, just get it and read it. Trust me.\\" Well, the next day at work, someone had book one laying in the employee lounge. I read the back, and I was intrigued. I came home and looked it up. I didn't know there were three of them, but I found the trilogy for a great price.<br /><br />I paid roughly $27 for the three of them, and that included shipping. That is a great deal, because I know a friend of mine purchased them at Kmart and paid $15 for each book individually. The price itself was good.<br /><br />I couldn't put these books down! I don't like bondage and domination involved in sex, but the parts of the book that included these were short and if you can overlook them, the books are VERY entertaining! I had a hard time putting these books down! I LOVED them, and now that I am finished reading them, I am disappointed that the series is over. I enjoyed the epilogue written from Christian's point of view. One other reader said she would have liked to have read Christian's point of view from other parts as well. I have to say, I agree!<br /><br />I usually read books and then pass them onto my mother, who passes them onto other friends after she reads them. However, I chose to keep the Fifty Shades Trilogy, because I know I will be reading them again. This is by far one of the most intriguing stories I have ever read! I loved it! I was moved to tears by the end of the first book, and I felt compelled to start the second book right away to see what happened next. The end of the second book was so sweet, I was again in tears. The third book kept me guessing all the way through it, which I loved.<br /><br />At first, you see Christian as very complex and even a bit arrogant. And Ana is just a young naive girl who, though very much in love, does put her foot down when it it'snecessary. And when Christian is explored a bit deeper, and you learn about his 'damaged' side, you can't help but sympathize with him, and you find yourself rooting for him and Ana to stay together. My heart literally broke for Christian and Ana in some places, because this is a book that really does draw you in, and you find yourself intrigued to find out what happens next.<br /><br />If anyone says that there is no story-line, then they didn't read all three books. Book One was a bit slow compared to Book Two and Three, but still kept me intrigued.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these books! It takes me a lot to want to read a book again, but these are three I know I will be re-reading again and again!

After a Rickhanger at the end of The Son of Neptune, The continuation of Percy and his friends as they travel on a quest to stop the wicked and evil earth goddess Gaea from awakening and rising to full unstoppable power. No spoilers in this review. I am a huge fan of Rick Riordan and try to get my hand on mostly every teen book about mythology that he writes. Ever since 7th grade actually. PJ fans will love this book as I already do 110 pages into the book. The characters are so interesting to listen to and each point of view is gold in itself that I don't see how anyone could really hate or strongly dislike this immensly humerous and great novel. Most writers don't have the charm that Riordan will put on you when you read one of his books. Even though the Hardcover versions are expensive at a regular store amazon has it for a great low price as they do with other stuff mostly. Of course any person who is reading this review and has not read The PJ series or The Lost Hero or The Son of Neptune should immediately shut their devices off and go read thee amazing books that will keep you up way into the late ours of the night. So hope everyone if doing great and feel free to explore my other reviews I've written just for you. Bye!

0307951529|2.0|Unfortunately, Mr. Guillebeau takes a beautiful idea and fails to execute it.  I find it difficult to critique this project because the idea is so good, and it's marketed well.  But ultimately it doesn't deliver - it's largely fluff.  Even the stories/case studies lack an interesting and in depth critique which alone would make this book useful.<br /><br />The only person I'd recommend this book to is someone who knows absolutely nothing about starting a business and is unwilling to get on the web to do some basic research.  For anyone else, they will get very little from this book because it doesn't contain much.<br /><br />Mr. Guillebeau will suggest ideas that would help businesses but they will be so vague and generalized that (a) they're not interesting/innovative and (b) they're not usable.  They're platitudes like \\"deliver great results\\" and \\"communicate with your clients\\".<br /><br />So turn yourself somewhere else.  I'd suggest the 4 Hour Workweek not only because it's infinitely superior to this book, but it contains bucketloads of resources to get you started.

B00007G207|3.0|Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (Giuseppe Tornatore, 2002, 174')<br /><br />Seen as an example of \\"nostalgic postmodernism\\", the film intertwines sentimentality with comedy, and nostalgia with pragmaticism. It explores issues of youth, coming of age, and reflections (in adulthood) about the past. The imagery in each scene can be said to reflect Salvatore's idealised memories about his childhood. Cinema Paradiso is also a celebration of films; as a projectionist, young Salvatore (aka Tot&ograve;) develops the passion for films that shapes his life path in adulthood.<br /><br />The film exists in multiple versions. It was originally released in Italy at 155 minutes, but poor box office performance in its native country led to its being shortened to 123 minutes for international release; it was an instant success. This international version won the Special Jury Prize at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and the 1989 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. In 2002, the director's cut 173-minute version was released (known in the US as Cinema Paradiso: The New Version), which comes with a love story reactivated for one evening.<br /><br />In Rome during the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita gets word that someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore has not been back to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. Salvatore flashes back to his childhood: Alfredo was the projectionist at the local \\"Cinema Paradiso\\", and ultimately served as a wise father figure to his young friend who only wishes the best to see him succeed, even if it means breaking his heart in the process. It then ends with Salvatore returning to Rome and viewing the film reel that Alfredo left for him, tears in his eyes.<br /><br />To a reviewer, the film, in its long version, is unsatisfactory, as it reassesses the original story's weights and identities of Alfredo, Tot&ograve; and Elena, which still shine through. The mood is far more bittersweet, as Salvatore sees Alfredo as both the source of great love in his life and of great loss. This complication would not have been necessary, as obviously the 123 minute version was prizeworthy, consistent, and certainly long enough, with plenty of good camera work to judge by.<br /><br />192us - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (Giuseppe Tornatore, 2002, 174') -Unnecessary mess-up - 4/10/2012his life and of great loss.

I watched and listened to the music assuming I know nothing about The Ring. The drama is in the music itself. If you don't know the plot (a summary is given in the pamphlet accompanying the disc) you will be imagining things that may be happening. It may be a totally different story than the one Wagner created, but it will captivate you during the 80 minutes this compilation lasts. You will probably recognize some of the music as it has been used in movies, commercials, etc.<br />For those that know the plots and the music, you will go through the whole cycle in 80 minutes. It does not replace the complete cycle with voices, productions and everything that an opera encompass, but it does a very good job at letting us enjoy the music and the drama it represents.<br />The Blu-ray surround sound is just perfect, in particular for those like me who listen to it in full volume.  The camera work adds to the enjoyment of the music. Looking at the players while listening to the music makes you feel you are really there.<br />I strongly recommend this Blu-ray to those who already know The Ring and in particular to those who don't know it or are hesitant to try Wagner.

B008G12ERC|1.0|I've been a Muse fan since Showbiz, but my criticism is not based on The 2nd Law not sounding like their early albums. Muse's new album is highly self-indulgent, and it crosses the line into the ridiculous and the absurd. I love experimentation, but this album just smashes incompatible influences together (such as Skrillex and Queen) which consequently sacrifices the album's coherency.<br /><br />Hopefully their next one will be better.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I was expecting this album to be good... but to be honest... it's not good... it's amazing! If you are thinking about buying this, then do it! You won't regret it!

The way J.K knows to describe all the thoughts that go through all of us and at the same time does not stop us from judging others..she is an amazing writer. A lot of small sentences are so condense with so much of the human truth. i loved the book, i really did. bravo!
B0092SPYQG|5.0|Papa Roach is back with their new CD The Connection. The whole CD rocks from start to finish with great songs, great song writing and pure emotion and pain in these songs. This is the best Papa Roach CD to date and possibly ever. Songs like still swingin, give me back my life, not that beautiful, as far as I remember are some of the stand out songs but all songs are great plus the deluxe CD comes with two bonus songs what's<br />left of me and 9th life which are great songs too. This is definitely a must buy, one of the best CDs of 2012
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great read cannot wait for the last of the series.  Enjoying the characters.  Descendent  of original characters bring back storyline of first book, which I also loved and recommended it to several people.
0316228532|3.0|When Barry Fairweather dies it opens up a casual vacancy on the city council.  A casual vacancy is defined as a situation in which an unexpected opening occurs on a political board, as in the case of a death or disqualification.  Mr. Fairweather's death throws the town of Pagford into turmoil to say the least.  The town has been divided for many years over the issue of \\"The Fields\\" and under which jurisdiction they should reside.  Do the residents of The Fields reside in Pagford and use their resources or do they belong to the neighboring, larger town of Yarvil?  Currently the populace of The Fields is made up of low income, government dependent residence so many in Pagford would like to see them sent to Yarvil, Barry Fairweather is a popular resident of Pagford and he came from The Fields and he has made many good argument about why the people of Pagford need to take care of the people of The Fields.  The death of Barry Fairweather heralds a change in the weather for the anti-Fields clan and they are eager to fill his seat with a candidate sympathetic to their cause.<br /><br />Initially, I had a problem with keeping all the characters straight and which side of the issue they fell.  Then, I realized it didn't really matter.  The book wasn't really about that.  The book was about all these people struggling to survive in this little town.  There was the married Indian doctor in love with another man and her bullied daughter.  The desperate housewife that finds sexual gratification in much younger men.  There are also the children of the town who do some really crazy things to escape the pressures of their parents.  Plus, all the other characters floundering in the wake of Barry Fairweather's death.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed in this book.  I don't know what I was really expecting, but this wasn't really it.  There were a few times when I felt like putting it down in favor of something more exciting, but I knew if I did I probably wouldn't pick it up again.  So I stuck it out and the ending did make up for the less than thrilling beginning and middle.  I know a lot of us were secretly hoping for a few flashes of the Harry Potter world and there are definitely NONE of those.  This was a very realistic book and it was dark and depressing...it was sad.  I can't take anything away from JK Rowling's writing talent though.  It was wonderfully written, despite the fact that I didn't particularly care for the story itself.

B009EAO38C|5.0|I've been following the Piano Guys for a while and have essentially collected all these songs as singles. These guys put passion into their work. Their songs, though derived from other songs, feel unique and fresh, even surpassing the originals in many ways. For example, Code Name Vivaldi (based off the theme for the Bourne movies) is little more than a soundtrack if taken from the movie, but the Piano Guys turn it into a song worth listening to from beginning to end. The first song, Titanium/Pavane, instantly made its way into my top five of their songs (can't narrow it down any more than that), and may just go higher the more I listen to it. Although I recommend watching their Youtube videos before buying to see if you would rather buy one or two singles or the whole album, I believe everyone who had bothered going so far as to read this review will find at least a couple songs on this album that they will adore.

B008673ZAQ|1.0|What am I missing here? I know that women love to save the bad boy and our mothering instincts take precedence over all other emotions, but this is so wrong.  Are there really that many readers who find attempted rape of a sexual abuse victim appealing? (Yes, Gideon is trying to rape her even if he is asleep.) I don't care how many times a man says he loves you; it's not love if an entire relationship has a foundation of secrets and lies.<br /><br />The airplane scene is NOT erotic. Eva wants him to physically hurt her which makes it even more disturbing. It's saying the only way she can feel love is through pain. For anyone who thinks I'm just being a prude, I assure you I am not. I loved Fifty Shades and Gabriel's Infernal/Rapture. I've been known to drop F-bombs in the wrong situations, but I found myself cringing at the overuse of the word, particularly from Eva. And the only thing this couple does together is have sex. At least in Fifty Shades, Christian took Ana on dates/holidays/his boat, etc. When Gideon and Eva are together, if they're not having sex, Gideon is working.  Period. Further, his possessiveness of Eva is manic. I could see him hurting her out of jealously and rage. How is this erotic?<br /><br />As for Gideon's possible sexual encounter with Corrine, is the author hinting that he is schizophrenic or suffering from borderline personality disorder, because it sounds like he suffers from blackouts. Neither can cured by just loving someone, regardless of what anyone thinks.  If Gideon is suffering from a serious mental condition, it seems so wrong to me to nurture this couple as if they are perfect for each other, particularly when both diseases require years of therapy and medication to bring under control.<br /><br />I really liked the first book and was anxious to read this one, but I stopped halfway through on this one and, most likely, won't finish it. This couple is so dysfunctional and damaged, it's like watching a slow moving car wreck. I won't be reading the third book.

B007O4XX9K|4.0|Joe Walsh's Analog Man is a nice comeback from this great artist.  It's not his best work, but it's pretty darned good.  Some of the cuts feature Jeff Lynne playing most of the instruments and these are generally weaker than the cuts with more of a band playing.  Of the Lynne cuts (which remind me of his Zoom album), the best is the title cut.<br /><br />My favorite songs here are Lucky That Way and Band Played On, both of which feature the tasteful drumming of Ringo Starr, and the former features Kenny Passareli and Joe Vitalli from walsh's \\"Smoker You Get...\\" time period band.  These songs have a much more organic feel to them.  His introspective songs, Family and One Day at a Time, are also quite nice.<br /><br />Funk 50 is Joe's nod to his James Gang days and their hit Funk 49.  It's nice, but it would have been better if he had his old friends Fox and Peters come by to help.<br /><br />All in all it's a nice little comeback from Joe.  It's always good to hear from him.  Life's Been Good.  3 1/2 stars, recommended.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I have seen most of Christopher Nolan's films and liked them and I have been a Batman fan since the Early 80's. I understand many people liked this film, please do not jump all over me, this is just my opinion. I was so excited for this movie in the theater at midnight as it was about to start and by the end of the film I was only frustrated and angry. After having led up to this film so well, I feel Christopher Nolan had just lost interest in the Batman character and was obligated to make this film. So much of it was like Nolan was trying to entertain himself while compromising the Batman character all along. Here's my issues:<br /><br />1.) Too much focus on Bane who was uninteresting and not enough Batman screen time.<br /><br />2.) No Background on Catwoman. Just appears, and then retreats with Batman at the end. Why should we care about this character?<br /><br />3.) The Character of Batman would never A.) Give up Crime fighting for 8 years (even if he had to stop petty crimes. It is who he is!) or B.) Retire from being Batman. Not in the characters nature.<br /><br />4.) I hate the whole time you think you are learning about Bane, then it turns out you don't know much about him, but you do know the entire story of Talia who is in the film for a whole 10 minutes.<br /><br />5.) No payback. Batman never really overcomes his villains. They whup the hell out of him and he still gets pummeled at the end landing one or two lucky shots. Batman should have done better against Bane in the first fight, even though he hadn't been crime fighting for a while, his instincts, past training should have helped him out more. Bane was practically invincible. Nolan's method was all Shock value for the first fight and that equals lazy filmmaking. It was disrespectful to the Batman character. Made him look like a loser.<br /><br />6.) Batman had absolutely no detective skills in the whole series. This series did a poor job of showing Bruce's intelligence. All brawn and no brains. Untrue to the character of Batman. He is a scientist/genius/detective before a fighter.<br /><br />7.) Ridiculous death for Bane. So anti-climatic. Disrespectful to the character.<br /><br />8.) Bruce received no training in the prison that would make him come back and beat Bane. Also, back injuries do not heal that fast.<br /><br />9.) Bane tells Bruce to experience \\"The Hell\\" he grew up in. The prison was actually pretty nice, with a few helpful and friendly inmates.<br /><br />10.) Cheesy Cliche ending. I did not think Nolan was capable of such a predictable ending.<br /><br />11.) John Blake Character was great until the cheesy Robin comment. Why even Bother? Then Robin is going to be Batman? Confusing.<br /><br />I could go on, but ultimately I just felt Nolan took too many liberties with the characters. Even If I tried to view this as a Nolan film first, it was just a poorly written messy story will no sense of flow or direction. The first Christopher Nolan film I haven't liked...it's too bad it had to be a Batman film too.<br /><br />UPDATE: Judging by some of the comments I think some people have the impression that I didn't understand the film...let me clarify. I think, many people like myself understand what Nolan was trying to do, they just don't like it. It's not that I didn't understand the movie...it's that I understood it and was unhappy with it's direction. I don't want a \\"Nolan Universe\\" Batman. I want Batman...a representation of the character I have grown up with. Batman has always changed and evolved, and I like that about the character, but I DO NOT like when some pompous director comes along and changes the core elements of one of my favorite characters.<br /><br />ALSO for the many comments claiming I should read \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" by Frank Miller...Not only have I read it but I have a collector's edition hardcover version of it. There is no comparison here. Frank Miller wrote a great story which is also a stand alone book not to be considered cannon in Batman's history. It is an alternate take on Batman. Read the comments from Miller himself who has done this often with comic characters. Miller can take liberties because he wrote a great story. Nolan did not, so his liberties have become flaws and a lazy script because he could not close up that trilogy in a proper way without Heath Ledger's Joker.
076115678X|5.0|After many years of struggling with my hair and coming to the conclusion that it was never going to do exactly what I wanted it to do (to be pin-straight), I gave up. I decided to just care for the hair that I have now and love it as it is. To do this properly I needed a guide, something that would lead me in the right direction and help me get the best curls possible.<br /><br />I found out about this book while googling curly hair care methods. I was so happy that there was a book dedicated solely to maintaining and caring for curls! So I had to have it.<br /><br />I'm glad to say that this book has changed my way of thinking about hair. By following the methods and tips in this book, my hair has grown longer, healthier, and I swear, it's happier! I highly recommend this book to all girls with curly hair, you will love it.

And the ipad just recently got an update to add more games. I guess this is why I couldn't find it on Google play; they know this game is some s**** for android. Come harder popcap.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Ranks up there with Dune, Hyperion, and Foundation.  Rich stories with well-developed characters and engrossing plots. The ending felt rushed though. Would've love to learn more about Bernard and read about his perspective as he faces his fate.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The beginning of the book describing the training for the SEAL program was great.  Description of the raid on OBL's compound made you feel like you were there.  I also liked that the author is giving a significant portion of the proceeds to help families of our fallen heroes.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|For the last 5 books or so of the Reacher series, I have said at the end of reading 'that's it - I'm done'. Then I always come back with hope that Reacher will have found his spark again. But it hasn't happened in this novel.<br />It's long, drawn out, and flat feeling. Reacher just doesn't feel like himself!<br />And everytime Child wrote a description of Reacher's size and looks, or had him reach and touch the ceiling - all I could think was - Tom Cruise??? Really???
B004FPZ2G8|5.0|This book, on first round, didn't blow me away. Unlike other Austen's, it wasn't full of young and overwhelming love. However, the more I pondered it and reread it, the more I enjoyed its honesty. The main storyline moves slowly but surely and I found myself invested in each decision made, willing the characters to bend to my will. Definitely one of the most hopeful and satisfying endings and well worth reading.
B002RSDW80|5.0|This item arrived quickly and it was in great shape! I can't wait to watch it! It's my favorite movie!
B0041KXOVC|1.0|This movie was not made for US DVD players.  It is in Italian and not compatable with American players.  This is frustrating, as it is not disclosed in the product offering.  Buyer Beware!
B000SL1NQ6|4.0|The quality of the video was excellent.  It would have been better if the subtitles would have been in english, but it was possible to follow the story without them.  I had seen the video in VCR format quite some time ago and the quality of the DVD was much better.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Reading this book and finding all these different hooks from my childhood was a real pleasure. It inspired me to buy a Zork anthology and the new Pac Man game, as well as to watch the King of Kong movie. For that I am quite grateful.<br /><br />However, I didn't enjoy the writing at all! The character interactions were cringe-inducing, the pacing was sluggish at times, and then things just happen because hey the book's gotta end somewhere! And the chatlog romancing... Make it stop!<br /><br />All in all, parts of the book were a pain to read, but the whole thing was short enough that it didn't matter all that much. It's a good way to get in the mood for some eighties-inspired entertainment, just don't expect it to read like a classic!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I purchased the Kindle version of this book after reading an article in Newsweek about the author, character Reacher, & a coming movie starring Tom Cruise as Reacher. The article made it sound pretty good so I ordered it. It was pretty good. It is not particularly well written, but it keeps your interest, there is a lot of action, suspense, romance...It is a good quick read. I would recommend it, & will purchase another volume when I need a good quick read.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I love this Austen novel, it is wriggling its way into the number one spot. Emma is SO easy to relate to and yet her misinterpretations and \\"kind intentions\\" illustrate faux pas we all make! Each character one meets is so well-rounded one feels they could step out of the page into my everyday life! The story is enjoyable from start to finish, a wonderful book!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I liked it, Kristen Stuart is just not my favorite actress. She will always be Bella.  Charlize Theron alone is worth the watch, she does an awesome job
B0098VXE50|3.0|I did not see the movie in the theater-thank goodness!  I watched the DVD at home and was very disappointed.  The special effects were amazing.  The acting by Charlize Theron was fabulous as well as Chris Hemsworth. The seven dwarfs were fabulous! I was very disappointed with Kristen Stewart-she was mediocre.  She seemed robotic or not at ease with the role. I am not sure she was the right actor for the role.<br />I would not recommend the movie except for the special  effects.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was my 3rd time reading this book...still as good as the 1st!  I will probably read it again...and again!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Differs from movie in many ways, but has similar message.  It is geat to visit with friends from the movie in different adventures, as well as learning about other areas of Oz.

B0070XFNDE|4.0|Prisoner of Heaven is a fascinating book, one of three dark novels set in 1950's Barcelona by the Carlos Ruiz Zafon.  I say dark, but it is more of a fascinating voyage through a mysterious spooky side of Barcelona.  The characters, who are in all three of his novels, are dark, yet very colorful.  Well written, although more fantasy than reality, it never seems unrealistic.  Conversations are believable, and situations can be imagined even though they are sheer lunacy.  I haven't finished the book yet, but I guarantee that I will be entertained every time I pick it up.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy espionage and movies that deal with CIA.  You do have to pay close attention or you'll miss things. It is a movie that I will have to see again so I can see what I missed the first time. I don't mind seeing it again I truly enjoyed Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Blood Song has a nice story line flow and Anthony Ryan's writing style keeps you turning the pages. The main character development is superb and the supporting cast is well balanced. One of the most intriguing aspects of the book is that after reading it, one is not sure where the antagonist will next appear. I really enjoyed reading this book and cannot wait to read Ryan's next book.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|I truly love this book and her products I just wish the videos would actually show up instead of it saying my device doesn't support them =(
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I have to say that I'm very happy to find out that this movie is one of the very few Motion Pictures that support the \\"appropriate\\" aspect ratio that most people (if not all) would like to enjoy in their movies.<br /><br />WHY SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS ASPECT RATIO?:<br />For those of us who already hate the so called \\"black bars\\" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, the Aspect Ratio of 2.40:1 on 3D Home viewing brings back those horrible \\"Black Bars\\" and with that TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage.<br /><br />Usually I don't mind those \\"black bars\\" on 2D viewing, maybe because we are all used to it by now, plus it doesn't take anything away...BUT ON 3D viewing this is the complete opposite.<br /><br />SO WHAT'S THE \\"APPROPRIATE\\" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?<br />Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like WRATH OF THE TITANS, and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.77:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of the FULL SCREEN of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.<br /><br />With that said, This movie fortunately does support that type of Aspect Ratio which makes it completely worth the extra few dollars on the 3D Bluray version.<br /><br />Even with an enormous TV set you wouldn't want to watch a 3D movie with the black bars because...the bigger the TV, the bigger the \\"black bars\\".<br /><br />ABOUT THE MOVIE IN GENERAL:<br />I did LOVE this movie when I went to see it in IMAX 3D, I think it had a good use of the technology.<br /><br />STORY:<br />This is certainly the BEST comic to film translation, and yes, I did like Batman the Dark Knight Rises, but not as much as this one.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS:<br />The special effects although not groundbreaking they were certainly eye-candy, and what really makes it stand out from the pack is how well the director and his team were able to put everything together and make it look Amazing all around...AND EVEN BETTER IN BLURAY 3D AND ITS AMAZING 1.78:1 ASPECT RATIO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE ENTIRE SCREEN.<br /><br />ABOUT THE 3D EFFECT:<br />Although the movie was not originally shot in 3D, IT DISPLAYED GREAT IN THEATERS AND IT DOES AS WELL FOR 3D HOME VIEWING!<br /><br />If you have a 3D TV and a 3D BluRay player, this movie will certainly make you proud of that investment...I know it did for me.
0486424510|5.0|The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins is a 'must read' for anyone who has ever enjoyed a mystery novel. Not only is it a very enjoyable and well written work but it's the first of the genre.

B008O9V24W|2.0|I kind of expected a lot from this album. Their last album had so much energy and originality, I couldn't stop listening to it. This album is much slower and the lyrics aren't nearly as inventive or insightful. Very Ramones without the punch. The lead guitar literally grates on my nerves. It sounds like a completely different band. I understand that music and a bands sound evolve over time, but I feel like this was a step backwards for them. I honestly hate giving this review to what I thought was a talented up and coming band, but it is what it is.

When I found out JK Rowling was publishing an adult book, I pre ordered it the moment Amazon let me.  I recieved it the other day literally jumping up and down for several minutes before I hurried ot my room to begin reading it.<br />50 pages later, I wish I would have just stuck with Harry Potter...<br />I read the jacket and while it didn't seem to be anything I would have read if it didn't have Queen Rowling's name on it, I still decided to try it with the thought of 'this was the woman who made over a billion people wonder if a man was good or bad for seven whole books, who had character develupment for every character, who brought tears to my eyes with several lines in the last book \\"Will you stay with me?\\"  'Always.\\" *tear*' This will be an AMAZING book!<br />The very first chapter had me absolutley rivited.  Then it fell completely flat.  Theres no one likeable, theres no one whom you can relate to, theres no one you're rooting for, I'm 50 pages in and have NO idea who's the antaganist I'm supposed to be rooting for because everyone is just horrible, I'm not even sure of the plot yet, it's slow, boring, and if it wasnt't for the fact it was JK Rowling I'd hand it off to a charity and not give it a second thought.<br />Also, I'm in the army. I hear the F Bomb on a daily basis but come on, Jo.  One whole sentence and you feel the need to use every single variation of the word why again?  Not even Infantry curses that much. Also, I REALLY don't wanna care to read a teenagers sexual fantasies and how he mastribates to the new girl.  I heard theres rape and sex and drugs and whathave you and I'm not only Army but I'm a HUGE! SVU fan so I hear about rape on a weekly basis so that wouldn't phase me if I ever get around to finishing the book but sex and drugs and rape and abuse doesn't make it an adult book, it just means you're desperate for some edginess and she has WAY to much talent to resort to that which got me so dissapointed.<br />Jo, you're one of my favorite writers bar none.  I'm extremley interested in whatever you write because of how talented you are.  But stop trying so hard to scream 'I can do more then childrens books!'  We know you can.  Deathly Hallows is NOT! a childrens book, and it was far more adult and mature then this.  I look forward to your next book with htopes you learned from your fans reviews.
1423140605|5.0|In some ways, Riordan's style is nothing like JK Rowlings':  Riodan's writing is neat, punchy, slang-y -- right out of the minds & mouths of young folks becoming adults, who sound so like today's Middle School & High School students.  Yes, of course, they're sometimes a bit \\"too\\" clever -- the verbal skills all of us wish we'd had at that age.  But Riordan, at his best, really brings us into the minds & hearts of these young adults.  And to balance their perhaps too-good talking, he's right-on when it comes to teen intensity in dating with all its embarassing uncertainties and exciting possibilities, as well as in the beauty, diversity, and all-importance of teen friendships.  We do feel Riordan's world shaped by the Greek & Roman Gods, but we stay closer than Rowlings to our \\"this-world\\".<br /><br />Rowlings, on the other hand, has a lot of long words in beautiful long sentences.  She takes us out of our world and into one entirely different, though one we wish were close-by & available.  We feel her magical world less through the eyes of Harry, Ron & Hermione, than through the mind of a master story-teller.<br /><br />Yet Riordan & Rowlings, especially in this most recent Riordan tale, have much in common.  R&R draw us into a new world that comes alive for us, and they fill it with young folks we care about deeply, people who are likeable, even admirable without being \\"too good\\".  Percy & Harry -- both with green eyes & messy black hair -- are splendid characters, and they're backed up by many others just as good.  R&R both take us on journeys which are wonderful swashbuckling tales.  We love knowing more & more about the people, we enjoy seeing new facets of their worlds, and we can't wait to find out what happens next.<br /><br />In this book, we see Riordan at his best, with two exceptions (which I'll discuss later).  He takes us on a roller-coaster adventure, with ups & downs & sudden twists.  In between, he gives us time to breathe and to better know the people in his delightful world, people we come to love.  Leo and Annabeth shine.  Here, like no other Riordan book, they become so real.  Hazel and Frank, while taking a back seat, also shine.  Riordan writes cameos -- glimpses of characters from the past that don't just explain or fill in gaps.  They bring the present more alive.  And Riordan does this with writing that often touches the heart.<br /><br />My main disappointments here were in the first half or so.  It seemed Riordan lost his Percy-touch!  We got a not-quite real live person.  This is also sadly true of Piper and Jason.  They weren't bad; but they weren't fully there.  Frankly, I missed them.  I was glad when Riordan, later in the book, found his way back to them.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed Riodan's not-at-all perfect, but still-powerful Gods, who can't keep their Roman & Greek lives separate.  Their confusion and the pain they inflict on their world and on these young people -- well, it rings sadly true.  I'm a psychotherapist and a grandfather.  Riordan writes a tale I see in my office and in our own world.  And as Riordan shows, we adults, we \\"Gods\\" -- who have brought our children into this world, a world we've helped make -- we do need our demigods to save us.  And if they're going to save themselves, they need us too.  The evil giants, after all, can only be killed when Gods & demigods work together.  And the evil threatening our world can only be pushed back (sadly not destroyed forever), if all demigods and all Gods come together as one.<br /><br />Rings true for me.<br /><br />Buy the book & read it!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have a love/ hate relationship with this app. It is very User friendly and the menus are clean and easy to use. However it seems like every time I get my Pin On it crashes and fails. Hopefully it is fixed soon because I enjoy being able to use Pintrest on my Kindle Fire.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a simple game that you can pick up and play when you have a few minutes to spend.  Basically, you are trying to go as far as you can down a side-scrolling 2D area, using different vechicles and power-ups.  There are different challenges to earn to keep things intresting, and you can play for a long time without getting tired of the game.  I have it on Ipad and it translates well to the galaxy S3 screen, and loads faster as well.  The graphics and sound are top notch, and I would say it's one of the better games on Android for sure!

034580404X|5.0|This book has exceeded my expectations. I'm was also very pleased at the price I had gotten it for. I am now rereading Fifty Shades for the second time and it is equally as anticpating as the first time around was. Overall fantastic !
0451228375|5.0|Great read that kept me up many nights.  Towards the end I got to bed at 8 thinking it would be an early night, and 6 hours later I am still reading!  I have not been much of a reader, less than 10 books in the last 10+ years, but the last 2 books by Ken Follett have brought me back.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very interesting story line! It isn't just a romance novel but a very interesting back story that keeps anyone interested in reading all three in the trilogy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I had downloaded a different app. for my weather, but. after I downloaded AccuWeather I realized that this was the one for me and rely on it during storms and a lot of the weather we have had in the last few months. The other app. was deleted. thanks for your great service.
B009CPES4I|2.0|As exotic as this movie was with all the great actors.....it cinched in my mind... this is a place I definitely will not add to MY bucket list......Just too damn drab and a horrific mass of poverty driven humanity. !!!!!
B0060D0R2C|5.0|This movie is another great Denzel classic. Also starring Paula Patton, this movie is both suspenseful & gripping. The picture quality of this movie through Amazon Prime is only about 3.5 stars. I was disappointed that they offer the HD version for rent but not for purchase.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|This was an excellent read the first time I read it several years ago.  I enjoyed it just as much this time!
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was brilliant!  If you get this, please take the time to watch the special features and especially the commentary while the movie is going.  It harkens back to an older era of film making and it is pure genius.  However, if you loved this movie, you're going to love the book even better.  I bought the audio book with Paul Ansdell as narrator and rapidly discovered it was similar, but very different from the movie.  The movie cannot do justic to the exquisite writting of Susan Hill and her descriptions of things that just are not in the movie.  So, get both and be prepared for a fantastic journey!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three of the books, and my husband loves them now too!  I read a lot of negative reviews, and it's a good thing i didn't listen to them. These books did a lot for my marriage of 10 yrs!
B0031RS2CM|5.0|In Carry On Jeeves Wodehouse sends up the English aristocracy of the 20th century like no other writer.<br />  And the butler,Jeeves, stands alone as a calm voice of reason among a bunch of idiots led superbly by Bertie Wooster.<br />  Berties friends are always in trouble because of financial problems or usually because of their lack of ability to handle the strong women of the English upper Class.<br />  Hilarious at times as the stories from the English countryside & the Big Apple keep up the standard of Wodehouse writings that never fail to amaze, never fail to entertain.<br />  It always needs the remarkable Jeeves to solve Bertie & his friends problems that ensure a<br />surprise ending to the many short stories in the book.<br />  It may not be the best of Wodehouse but it certainly is right up there with them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have truly enjoyed reading the Hunger Games series of books.  It's reading that you definitely don't want to put down.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie!  Watched it twice.  My only complaint is that there was some tiling and the movie froze briefly two or three times during veiwing.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|I am a fan of the movie so I my be biased. I love this soundtrack! It's got an awesome, unique vibe. I have heard it described as Techno or synth, that is not a genre of music I particularly listen to, despite my wide range of musical tastes. To me, it sounds more 80's modern rock especially the track \\"Real Hero\\". If you loved the movie, you will probably love this sountrack. There are also soundbites from the movie at the end of the disc.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I have tried it twice already, my wife wanted me to wait until next spring to buy it because the weather is getting cold in here but i couldnt wait. My little princess loves it, she is very happy when we are riding it. It changes the way i use the pedals as my legs need to be a little more open than usual but its fine. I'm not going down a mountain or racing when i ride wity my baby so its fine. She is 18 months old and she seems very comfortable.<br />I totally recommend the product!!
0525953728|4.0|I have read several USN SEAL books in my time and I really enjoyed reading this one. Mark Owen is no Tom Clancy so the English professor's out there will pick apart the writting (see some of the reviews), but most of the readers out there will enjoy the book for what it is, the only first hand account written on the raid to kill/capture UBL. It was nice to read a SEAL book that didn't spend the first 100 pages describing BUD/S. In my humble opinion he didn't go overboard on the SEAL cheerleading like so many other SEAL books I've read. The book is about his career as a SEAL; however, he talks up the Team over and over again in the book. I don't agree with reviews that say he is all about himself. I liked that he talked about mistakes he made in training. It showed that, while SEAL members are good, they are still human.<br /><br />The conversations he describes in the book that took place between him and his teammates about the President did not offend me and were blown way out of proportion by many of the other reviewers. One could certainly argue that he should have kept those to himself since some of the men involved in the conversations are still in uniform, but I honestly don't think it was that big of a deal. With regard to the conversation about Biden, I can't blame them. Who doesn't think Biden is an idiot? Some were critical of the conversation in which he describes the team commenting that they just made their CO an Admiral. I would agree they probably did. Success at this level will make a guys career and I'm sure their boss got a promotion. They sure don't hand out stars for failed missions.<br /><br />He did make a couple of small technical errors such as describing F-16's with \\"30mm cannons.\\" Errors like this are annoying because the correct information can be found in short order by a simple internet search. Overall though the book was a good read. Don't let some of the negative reviews dissuade you from buying and reading this book.
B00002DE0S|5.0|Krystian Zimmermann's recording of Chopin's two piano concertos is beautiful and very excellent. Polish Festival Orchestra plays good, but sometimes they used glissando - and it is no very good thing. But anyway, wonderful cd and wonderful artists. I recommend!
B006H5120E|4.0|Would have loved to have the DVD but received a region 1 DVD not compatible to New Zealand being region 4. Amazon very good in the error but I assume Titanic is not available for Region 4 yet. Shame, as I paid the US price.<br />Cheers.
B004F1F32A|1.0|Dialogue is impossibly bad and the story feels like it was built according to a checklist of what a bunch of marketing jerks think a \\"blockbuster\\" contains.  Watch at your own risk.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I was skeptical it was going to disappoint by the artwork and<br />trailer. What made this movie so great was the story and the<br />animation. The new Robin is a bit odd, not because Robin is a<br />female, but just the physique and personality. They portrayed<br />Batman to be old and kind of overweight but he still kicked butt.<br />If you enjoy batman, this is worth the rent. However, I don't<br />think it was spectacular or worthy of a purchase to own though.<br />Have to say I am interested if they make a PART 2...
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|this book was absolutly amazing! i didnt wanna put it down. i loved every aspect of it. jacob and emma surpised me and just whe i thought i had it figured out. it changed amd surprised me again
0887307280|5.0|E-Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber is one of the best books ever written on small business ownership.  However, Michael Gerber is no longer involved with the \\"reimagined\\" version of his company, now known as EMyth.  It is currently run by a small cult-based group in Ashland, Oregon (EBE / Theohumanity) led by Daniel Stacy Barron.
B0084IHVGG|4.0|Adult humor and great vocals make Aristocats one of my favorite Disney movies.  The characters are timeless and the setting is Paris.  I personally don't think this is a video for young children because it will not hold their attention. For older children and adults who love Paris and cats, this is a winner!
B003QSMCKO|2.0|It sucked!!!! Tt froze every few seconds and this rental was a rip off. I will never rent another movie from amazon again.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Canada is well written and intriguing. The incident occurring late in the book was not plausible from anyone's perspective least of all the protagonist's. other than that, a good read.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I wanted to watch this movie despite what negative reviewers said. I was even going to look past the cons and try to appreciate the pros. It started out interesting and then towards the end I couldn't stay interested. I wouldn't say it is a terrible terrible movie, it just didn't do the Snow white tale any justice. Not really worth a rental in my opinion. It's like hollywood just wanted to make a movie with the snow white title for recognition and then cast a few well known actors to make it worth your time. Then failed to deliver a great movie. Acting was a bit forced and weak. Well thats my opinion, don't get hurt.
B007THA4FI|1.0|As fabulous as a writer as J.K. Rowling is, this book is simply not for me. The \\"f\\" bombs and sexual content (which were unnecessary to the plot ( as usual) , had me walking away. Thankfully , I used the Amazon Kndle option of reading the sample before I purchased the book. This is one Rowling book that will never be part of my library. For those of you who enjoy a good book without the junk I hope this review helps.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|I love and own all Discworld books. I bought most of them in England because they come out there first. Just went to Portugal and saw a new book. I am waiting for the new book to be available on Amazon. Obviously they are good because the price never goes down.

B000ME5B30|4.0|I watched this movie as part of an assignment for a class I'm taking. The movie was about global warming and was informative about it's causes and solutions. If you care about the environment then this movie is for you.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Although a little different and not standards, (as was \\"Girl in the other room\\") this is also a great cd. Love the several blues type songs... and, as with all her cds, it depends what mood YOU happen to be in when listening to her different music. If you're a Diana fan, do yourself a favor and get the Deluxe c/d, it is worth the extra tracks.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Although the medical & scientific information is not startlingly new, it's written in an easy to understand format for the average non medical person.  Lots of good scientific information and data that easily explains why Americans are getting fatter, and what we can do about changing the situation for a healthier future.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.[[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]]
B009K0P1VE|5.0|I must say I was surprise with the first season ending and then with everyone getting their memory back, etc.  One of the best things about this show is that the pacing is just right.  For other shows it wouldn't be until the last season that you would get this much of a shift in the plot.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I adored this book and devoured it in less than 48 hours. Can not wait for the next one to come out.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is simple but addictive!  The screens get more challenging as you play, and it's hard to put down once you get started!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved it!!!  Keeps you on the edge<br />of your seat, wanting more!!! Look forward to more books from this author!!!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The animation. was very good. It kept my interest. I was able to find the hidden objects without much difficultly, yet I did use the hint a few times. For the price it is a good find and I will play the next chapter. overall at least four stars.
B001EC0OMM|2.0|I love those 3 stars.  Wow, what a cast.<br /><br />All they needed was a plot.  My wife and I watched loyally for almost an hour, waiting for some substance or anything actually funny.  It never happened.  We walked out (turned it off).<br /><br />Perhaps films like this had more cultural context in their own time.  But I am old enough to appreciate value in a classic setting.  I just didn't see it.<br /><br />Very disappointed...not serious and not funny. I couldn't have cared less about those characters, beautiful though the stars certainly were.  All 3 of them were badly miscast in those fluff roles.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book was great. I read the series, and this was only second to the first book. I wish there was more.

B002E01MHY|5.0|Some people may look at the cover and title of this film and expect it to be an 80s slasher film with a high body count, but this particular film is a little different.  It doesn't have a high body count, but the kills linger on the graphic and gory details.  The film has a psycho who talks and quacks like a duck. I thought this is different and original compared to other 80s slasher films.  In between the kills the film basically switches between a detective trying to solve the case, a nymphomaniac who sleeps with and gets fondled by strangers, and another girl who escaped from the killer.  The kills in the film are much nastier and have more impact than what you would find in a FRIDAY THE 13th film, and some may find them disturbing.  There's also a lot of nudity and some of it is very explicit.  In one scene Alexandra Colli, the one who plays the nyphomaniac, has a stranger fondle her underneath a table with his feet, and she also has another nude scene which is full frontal and explicit.  Zora Kerova, another really good looking woman, has a really good nude scene as well.  The film is also very well directed, and it's main soundtrack is a very 80s style music score that I thought was very catchy.  However, I think some people may find the film to be a little boring at times.  It doesn't have the misty and windy atmosphere that you would find in some of Fulci's other films, and some people might think that it gets a little too talky at times for a slasher film.  The entire movie has a nice 80s grindhouse feel; and I think it's one of Fulci's best films, but not everyone will like it.<br /><br />The DVD quality is great and there's a good interview with Zora Kerova.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|graphics and sounds are awesome.  this could easily eat up a bunch of time.<br /><br />very fluid and lots of action.

1451662432|2.0|I'm not going to review Arnold the man (as I'm actually a fan of his), but the book itself. Like others have stated, the writing style, which may have very well been written and edited by a ghost writer, seems to play into a pretentious code of ambiguity that so many celebrities favor. Like some others have noted, Arnold seems to only reveal certain parts of the whole story, the bits and pieces that serve to enhance his image. In a way this is what the reader should expect as they get into the first 100 pages, as Arnold the man is a charming, incredibly ambitious and very smart man. His list of accomplishments are stoic, but as a reader I want to know what the true intentions of these desires are, which the author never really relates too. Yes, we know you married Maria (he only admits to one affair during the marriage even though he has acknowledged in interviews to \\"not always behaving perfectly\\" during their relationship when pressed. He does talk about the affair with Bridget Nielsen during the filming of Red Sonja, but these are facts the public already knows about. In fact, had Arnold never been caught cheating with the maid, I guarantee he would have left that out of his book (which he admitted he started writing years ago and delayed it because of the affair). So are you getting an averagely entertaining autobiography from a charismatic man in Hollywood, sports, and politics? Yes. But is this account conveniently dishonest? Absolutely. My feeling is this is damage control.

B0019HQIGS|5.0|The live concert released in 2008 featured three separate performances: the first was an acoustic set by Mayer alone, the second was with the John Mayer Trio, and the third with Mayer's regular touring band.<br /><br />Musicians<br />All sets:<br />John Mayer - lead vocals, guitar<br /><br />John Mayer Trio set:<br />Steve Jordan - drums, backing vocals,<br />Pino Palladino - bass<br /><br />John Mayer band set:<br />David Ryan Harris - guitar, tambourine, backing vocals<br />Robbie McIntosh - guitar, slide guitar, backing vocals<br />David LaBruyere - bass<br />J.J. Johnson - drums<br />Tim Bradshaw - keyboards, lap steel guitar, backing vocals<br />Bob Reynolds - tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone<br />Brad Mason - trumpet, flugelhorn<br /><br />The three concerts indicate that Mayer doesn't want to be categorized, as all three concerts vary greatly. I found the acoustic set as being typical Mayer, great musicianship (technical) but not a lot of imagination. He seems bored at times but delivers what the audience expects.<br /><br />I enjoyed the \\"Trio Set\\" the most as this is where he is accompanied by session drummer Steve Jordan and my favorite bass player Pino Palladino. This is an aggressive forceful performance. There is a lot of energy being spent in this set. Awwwwsome.<br /><br />Act three which includes the whole band is what you would expect as a Mayer fan with a lot of familiar material.<br /><br />All in all it was money well spent. I enjoyed this concert DVD as it portrays how effortlessly Mayer can move from one genre of music to the next.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a masterful chronicle of the events leading up to WWII.  The characters and families from the first book in the Century trilogy continues.  The drama is played out on several continents.  The heartbreaking march of events wreaks havoc in these characters lives, personalities we have come to love and sometimes despise.  It's all there, and yet, across the backdrop of catastrophic events, there is the personal story.  The intertwined stories reinforced the toll these decades really took on the comon man.  I have read a lifetime of stories dealing with the effects of the Nazi regime.  This book made me understand the dystopian hell Hitler really plunged his people into.<br /><br />Follett's intricate tracing of events leading up to Germany's fatal embrace of this madman, as well as his interpretation of modern communism tell of painstakingly meticulous research.  Combined with a sensitive personal thread makes for a great novel.  I loved it.  I can hardly wait to see his interpretation of the cold war, the turbulent sixties, the civil rights issues, the Vietnam war and glasnost.

B0012GMYUU|5.0|Jeff Beck evolves a little bit every time he releases new material. He is never content on being stuck in a groove. He is most content jumping all over the place, like on this CD from jazzy riffs to heavy electronica. He still has the problem with his band mates trying to keep up with him even when he is playing in musical uncharted waters.<br /><br />Personnel includes:<br />Jeff Beck (guitar), Imogean Heap (vocals), Jennifer Batten (guitar), Randy Hope-Taylor (bass), Steve Alexander (drums) & Aiden Love (programming).<br /><br />Beck is truly an innovator, flawlessly creating, leaving nothing to criticize. His interaction with Imogean Heap on the cut \\"Rollin' and Tumblin' is classic. It is like he is trying to communicate with her through his guitar work, amazing.<br /><br />This is Beck at his purist and most creative, forever experimenting. The man can put a note out there, bend it and ride it to eternity.<br /><br />I have listened to Jeff Beck all my life and have come to the conclusion that there will just never be another Jeff, not in my lifetime.<br /><br />This one is a keeper, decades of cutting edge music climaxing on one CD. As I said before, \\"flawless\\".<br /><br />For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Jeff Beck's \\"You Had It Coming\\" on You Tube.
B009329ZF2|4.0|The first 45 mins are slow, but well worth sitting through to get to the action. Once again however, Hollywood forces profanity into a PG-13 movie. As with Transformers and other action movies, profanity is assumed to be what audiences want; it is not.

B002OR18HQ|5.0|Released in 2009,we get to see this true legend at his best. Fogerty returns to show us all over again why he has long been considered one of our greatest American singer-songwriters. It's hard to imagine that it has been 37 years since he last played the Hall.<br /><br />John Said \\" Tonight is a celebration of my music and my personal revival. And when I walk off this stage tonight it will be with a happy heart\\". And that is the way all in attendance felt when the concert was over.<br /><br />There was a stellar line up of musicians that each seemed to enjoy the night as much as John did. So much positive energy, and then there were two special guests Shane & Tyler Fogerty (both on lead electric guitars & both are John's sons.) You can tell their Dad was proud and vice versa.<br /><br />All the Fogarty and CCR gems were played that night to great reviews. John seems so down to earth but underneath the laid back exterior beats the heart of a perfectionist. And it shows. I highly recommend this DVD concert.

B008Y1YFNU|5.0|This CD covers a lot of the sounds from Papa Roach and even including newer elements. They threw a few wubwubs (dubstep/techno sounds) in it, which was cool. I wish it had more heavy hitters like they've done in the past (Last Resort/Hollywood Whore) it has quite a few poppy songs, while some are pretty good, some could have been left out, in my opinion. I will say Jacoby's vocals on this CD are really amazing. Also, it was cool to hear a few short solo's on this album.<br /><br />Best songs:<br />Silence Is The Enemy<br />Won't Let Up<br />Still Swingin<br />Leader of The Broken Hearts
B006OOHYIC|1.0|This game was awesome. I was having a great time playing it and was almost all the way through it.

0805095535|2.0|You've always liked Paul Auster's writing. OK, sometimes it's a little too self-consciously 'good writing' but that's forgivable, right? And some of his autobiographical work has been pretty powerful, you think. So when you see that he's come out with a memoir, and then, like a stroke of fate, on your next visit to the library, there it sits on the new book shelf, why your path is clear. Pay up your fines, and check out Auster's latest. The first few pages seem to be a kind of intro, written in the second person, as if he means to imply that his own experience is somehow universal. By page 10 it's getting irritating and surely it won't continue like that? So you skip ahead a few pages and then more pages. And it does continue. 'No, Paul,' you want to scream, 'that wasn't sexy young me cavorting cutely with Paris whores, that was sexy young you.' And Paul, you beg, please don't accuse ME of nostalgia for 'the ring of old telephones, the clacking of typewriters, milk in bottles, baseball without designated hitters, vinyl records,' etc, etc. That can't even be YOUR real list because it's the very embodiment of that whole tired cliche. And speaking of tired cliches, you think . . . but wait, aren't your yous getting confused? Never mind. One more unfinished book back to the library. So glad you didn't spend money on it!

B005BW0VI8|5.0|Imelda May is an excellent and very soulful singer an she is backed by a great rockabilly band. If you like Brian Setzer, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, or The Cherry Poppin' Daddies, now you can hear a gutsy woman fronting a band in the same style.<br /><br />My favorite song is Mr. Boom Boom.  \\"make me wanna, make me wanna\\"....but she never says what Mr. Boom Boom is going to make her want to do... she leaves that to your imagination, but her emotional singing gives you some hints.<br /><br />In addition, if you like Brian Setzer's guitar playing, you'll like the guitarist in this band: he manages to sound like an entire horn section by himself. Meanwhile, the bassist is slapping away on the doghouse like it's nobody's business.<br /><br />I listen to this all the time in my car and the music just revs me up!
0525953728|4.0|I bought the book to see how much distortion was reported between the actual event and White House reporting. I found the author very humble. The book was well written and reaffirmed my belief that everything coming from the News Media is either biased or mischaracterized. It also confirms my belief that the current administration wants to bring charges against the author due to exposing some distortions put out by the White House.
B007T99ENE|4.0|Ian McEwan's \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is part spy novel but more a love story and a tale of deception and half truths. It's also, more subtly, a book about the power, role and importance of fiction. Set in the 1970s, with frequent musical and political references to the UK at that time, Serena Frome is a beautiful, Cambridge-educated daughter of an Anglican bishop with a taste for unsuitable romances. From an early affair with a man who turns out to be homosexual, to an affair with an older lecturer she moves on to a surprise job at MI5 where she had a crush on one of her bosses, again and awkward, repressed and unattractive individual before encountering talented author Tom Haley as part of her job with whom she once again falls in love. Few of these men are what they seem, and neither for that matter is Serena when she has to hide her job from Haley.<br /><br />If the term spy novel conjures up images of international espionage and derring do in your mind, you might be disappointed. This is very soft Cold War cultural espionage and the spy element goes little further than a covert operation that allows people to not be as they seem. It's probably a lot closer to the truth than the more fantastical MI6-based novels though to be fair. However, it's probably better to think of this more as a love story with dark twists.<br /><br />McEwan usually hits his stories at a run and presents a major event early in the piece that signals things going wrong, often with quite a grand disclosure. \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is much slower to get going. Having said that, there were many who were disappointed with his last novel \\"Solar\\" and while I didn't share that criticism, this is more conventionally what you might think of from McEwan. It might not rank amongst his exceptional mid career oeuvre of \\"Black Dogs\\", \\"Enduring Love\\", and \\"Atonement\\" but the exquisite ending ensures that this is something like a return to McEwan at his best.<br /><br />Like his contemporary, Martin Amis's recent \\"Lionel Asbo\\", there's a sense that McEwan is having more fun with his writing now. There's more than a hint of the young McEwan in Tom Haley. Like the young McEwan, Haley is known for his macabre short stories and also like McEwan tells of a Haley having to give a talk after Martin Amis has brought the house down before him. There is also a lot of in jokes about the whole literary prize idea and in particular the then new Booker prize. In \\"Sweet Tooth\\" the idea is that MI5 promote a writer who expounds views that are suitably anti-communist, leading one character to observe that one day MI5 will be in charge of the prize as of course Stella Rimington, was, albeit after her MI5 career was over. It's a throwaway line but indicates a writer having some fun. McEwan also gently promotes the new universities, which of course was where he honed his craft, in contrast to the old world order of the Oxbridge set.<br /><br />It's a book that is best not judged until the very end. If you'd asked me two thirds of the way through the book what I thought, I'd have responded that it was good, but perhaps not his best. But having read the critical final chapter, it's a book that will leave you smiling and thinking \\"you clever, clever man, Mr McEwan\\". All the threads are brought together superbly and poignantly.<br /><br />Just perhaps there's an element of cliché of the beautiful girl falling for the struggling writer, and there's one small element concerning security and Serena's lack of cover story that doesn't quite ring true - she tells her flat mates, believably, that she is a civil servant and then has Haley, to whom she tells a different story, visiting the flat exposing a risk of exposure that Serena doesn't even see coming. However, in all other respects this is a another hugely enjoyable outing for McEwan and one that probably reveals more than literary prize bodies are comfortable with about the whole publishing process. As long as you don't equate spy with action, then this is definitely worth a read.<br /><br />4.5 stars

B008FSCNTK|1.0|I never thought this women had talent.  She has been singing since I was a little girl and I thought she was stiff, stale, could not sing, or play very well.  Still feel the same way. She had no career until she married Elvis Costello and they sexed her up and tried to make this old women sexy.  She looks terrible on the cover, Beyonce she is not.  That right there tells you that the music stinks.  My husband is a fan so I had to listen to these bad songs in the car.  One bad song after another.  There is no richness to her voice and it has no depth.  Angela Bofill, Phylis Hymen, Patty Austin, those are real jazz singers.<br />Not one song could I say would make me want to purchase this CD.  I have heard so much local talent who  most likely will  remain in the clubs and sing for small crowds.  What a shame that it is so hard to break into the music business.  We are missing out on some wonderful voices while this no talent whispers that terrible monotone voice over the airways.  By the way , my husband has already thrown this one away.  If he doesn't like it, there is no hope.
0061692042|4.0|Richard Ford's \\"Canada\\" opens with one of the best opening lines that I've read in a long time: \\"First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later. The robbery is the most important part\\". The story is narrated by the younger twin whose name we will discover but which Ford keeps back for 12 chapters, adding to the sense of unease that characterises this sweeping story set mostly in 1950s. The opening lines are wholly accurate in that they explain the structure of the book, but potentially misleading if this leads you to expect excitement and action. Ford's lyrical language is slow and he comes at things from an oblique angle. It's unsettling and thought provoking.<br /><br />The first part of the book concerns the bank robbery and the clear themes are those of boundaries. In fact, boundaries abound. There's the line crossed by good people who do bad things, moral boundaries, physical boundaries and the boundaries of coming of age. The last of these is particularly subtle. The narrator's older twin, a girl named Berner, appears much older than her sibling who is more naiive. At the time of events, they are 15 and Berner shows more adult understanding than her more child-like brother. In part, this is a coming of age story of the narrator. Even their father's name \\"Bev\\" seems to span boundaries. The story begins in Great Falls, Montana but their parents have to cross a state line to commit their robbery. But these are not hardened criminals. The robbery is a desperate measure that neither seem to understand the ramifications that may arise.<br /><br />The second part of the book is the more difficult, with the narrator whisked away by a family friend to Canada before the authorities can find him. Once in Saskatchewan, he encounters a strange world of deserted towns and an enigmatic hotelier, Arthur Remlinger, who has a mysterious past that will once more disrupt the young boy's life. And of course the promised murders. Here, what concerns Ford is \\"things that seem alike but are different\\", particularly in the Canadian life and the boy's US upbringing. In some ways it seems a shift change from the first part, towards a slower pace of story telling and if you were to not enjoy this book the chances are that it is the rambling pace and repetition of this element of the book. However, the rhythms of the language seem to evoke the vast areas of emptiness of the land. It would not be stretching things to liken Ford to Steinbeck's writing. It's about crossing lines that you cannot go back from.<br /><br />The much shorter third part brings things up to the present day. In some ways the first of these two chapters is irritating in that it he rather blatantly explains the themes of the book which are all too evident to most readers which seemed a little on the patronizing side. In the second chapter we learn more about the older sister whose life has been almost more fascinating that the one that has been narrated. However, it rounds the book off nicely.<br /><br />Ford is one of those rare writers who is able to capture the vastness of the North American landscape in his style and who can convey the fragility of life and apparently random events that change lives forever. I enjoyed the first part far more than the second part and it's frustratingly hard to get much of a glimpse of the characters in the book. The conceit of narrating things through the eyes of a young boy, who seems younger than his 15 years, and who doesn't always see things clearly means that questions remain unanswered. Twins is always a fascinating subject matter but beyond the issues of boundaries which indeed are crossed at one point, we don't get much of a sense of the twin relationship.<br /><br />It may not be my favourite Ford novel, but he's always a powerful writer and this is an unsettling and beautifully drawn book that feels as vast and epic as the landscape in which events play out. You need a love of words to get the most out of this though as language wins the fight over plot development every time.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book elaborated on an argument that I thought I already knew a lot about, but actually didn't: how \\"dependent\\" our diets have become on carbohydrates and how negatively carbs directly affect our weight and resulting health. As a member of a family in which several members have developed diabetes in the last few years, I was recommended this book as a way to better understand the disease and how it develops. What I got was a blatant and convincing warning about the effects of carbohydrates on weight and health and how eliminating them from my diet can also help me lose weight and avoid developing the disease myself.<br />In comparison to other books on weight loss, I felt like some of my beliefs about diet and exercise had definitely been turned upside down by Taubes arguments. For this reason, I would recommend reading it with an open mind because it does challenge the ideas behind low-fat diets and exercise for weight loss - concepts we have come to take as golden rules in the weight-loss effort. The book is very well written - though I had to read the chapter on cell function twice to really \\"get it\\". I found the arguments against sugar and other simple carbs so convincing that they create an immediate urgency to begin reducing carb intake in our diets.<br />Taubes does a good job of slowing bringing the author to an understanding of how our bodies process simple sugars in comparison to fats, and this helps him to be non-confrontational in his message (you never have the feeling he is saying \\"you idiots, stop eating sugar and getting fat!\\"). Though he incorporates more qualitative data (stories and historical anecdotes) than quantitative data (strict stats) in his arguments, he is thorough and also practical in his recommendations.<br />All in all, I found the diet he suggests (in the appendix) to be somewhat difficult to implement in everyday life - especially if you are someone who eats out in restaurants or is invited to social functions a lot. HOWEVER, ifnothing else, Taubes made me much more aware of the significant role that carbohydrates had in my own diet, which has made me start to avoid refined sugars as much as practically possible. Also, I find that his tips can be well incorporated into the Weight Watchers plan, which made it an even more of valuable read for me.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Eva and Gideon profess their willingness to work for their relationship, but they can't overcome their jealousy and insecurity.  He returns her apartment key; she returns his ring.  They use their exes against each other. Her nightmares return. He turns cold.  Where will it end?  In a breakup, of course!  Time for the Post-Breakup Makeover!  (Not that I've ever done that.)  These two use sex as a communication tool, but they need to use their words instead.  The admittedly sizzling sex conveys the obsessive, addictive, seductive nature of their bond, but doesn't do much for their trust issues.<br />And for those of you who don't like when she calls him \\"ace\\", check out the dedication page and take a peek at Lt. Eve Dallas and Roarke's series.

0792839749|5.0|This is a true adventure into the imagination. Pure and simple. It's uncategorical, a fuel burning oracle. For those who've reviewed this film as if they're looking for some kind of truth of life, or life-changing event from a film...grow up, and stop poohing on others' dreams. Movies aren't supposed to give you the answers to the universe; you're supposed to figure that out for yourself. Stop being so lazy. Movies are supposed to be pure escapism. They're intended to entertain you and feed the imagination so that, if you ever do grow up, you don't forget to stop and smell the flowers along your journey, and maybe take a little time to daydream--and that's what Chitty does, with imagination, kooky characters, and song all interposed in one wizardly keen daydream.<br />  I don't know what the Amazon description means by \\"flawed but solid family fare\\" as they didn't go into detail about what 'flaws' are held within the film. I found it truly entertaining and extrememly light-hearted fun for kids of any age, and I thumb my nose at anyone so 'old' that they think this is not good film-making. It's exactly what films are supposed to be for. It had an uplifting storyline about a poor inventor realizing his dreams, but who never loses site of the fact that the kids are the most important thing in his world. The songs were wonderful, except for Truly's song about Professsor Potts--and that only because I've never been fond of that high-pitched opera type singing, still, it didn't make me sick.<br /> And, whenever I get a little upset, I now find myself humming the theme song, or picture Dick Van Dyke doing the 'Old Bamboo' or even sing a little of Grandpa's 'Capitol P.O.S.H. Posh' and go for a walk, \\"Port out, starboard home!\\"  and I instantly feel better.<br /><br />  Buy it. Watch it with the kids, or alone. Take off your adult hat and set it aside for a bit. Try remember what it's like to daydream. You'll see what I mean.

0316223239|1.0|I will be honest and objective in saying that I have no opinion as to the plot or conclusion of this novel. I only read into the first chapter, and knew that I could not continue reading. Believe me, that doesn't often happen. I'm usually very tough on myself; if I start a book, I will finish it, but not this time.<br /><br />The issue with this book, and the problem I had, is that the entire thing is narrated in the voice of a young child, and not a very well-spoken child, at that. Just reading the first chapter felt so tedious that I couldn't complete it.<br /><br />I don't mean to take away from the author's artistic liberty, nor am I claiming the book is bad, but I rated it one star because I, too, am a writer. As a writer, I understand that one of the most significant key factors in writing a novel is to write in a manner that pulls your reader in, as opposed to making the reader aware that they are reading; simply stringing together words on a page. That is why there are certain rules to abide by when writing a novel. For example: many publishers and readers aren't even fans of accents, or regional dialect, in a book. It's frowned upon because it pulls the reader out of the book and into a place where they're having to think about what they are reading, and the intent of the author's spelling, word choice, etc.<br /><br />Having said that, anytime an author decides to write their novel from the perspective of, or narrated by, a child, they are running the very likely risk that many of their readers will find the actual reading process too daunting. And if not daunting, they may simply dislike it, because they were so busy dredging through the horrid writing style that they never bonded to the characters. For me, I couldn't begin to sink into 'The Room.' I was so aware that I was reading, so far removed from the story because I was busy deciphering the Author's writing, that I found it annoying.

B007L96SI6|5.0|Haley Reinhart has the most amazing voice.  It's not so much the vocal pyrotechnics (which she can do fine), but the shadings, the subtleties, and the ease behind everything.  Her tone goes from rock to jazz to blues to pop and back, smooth as silk and rich as butter.<br /><br />And the songs are great, too.  I confess I don't care for the two 70s-influenced tracks (I'm not a disco fan, or a 1970s easy-listening fan), but the rest is just magic.  I would call it 1950s or early 1960s-influenced pop -- pop with blues and rock & rock structures and sounds.  I've only listened to it a couple times so far, but \\"Free\\" has become my new earworm, and for once I don't mind having an earworm because the song is so good!  (Most earworms get that way because they're endlessly repetitive, so they get stuck in your head;  \\"Free,\\" by contrast, is a well-written song, with actual melody, harmony, and structure.)<br /><br />In the era of autotune, thank heavens for singers like Adele and Haley Reinhart who can actually SING!

It also seemed like there was little build up and follow through to dramatic events.<br /><br />The rock star ex situation seemed to end before it really began. And the fact that Gideon completely iced out Eva was so confusing. It was hard to want to keep reading when Eva was jumping around \\"getting answers\\" when really nothing was answered.<br /><br />I'll order the next book because I do like this story and want to know how it ends. However, I hope the 3rd book is closer to the feel of the 1st book
B00348K1I6|3.0|It does not follow what the book says. I was disappointed. Leaves the viewer with the wrong idea of what his life really was like.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent book, can't wait to read the third installment. It's steamy,intriguing and leaves you on the edge of your seat.
0525953728|5.0|I thought the book was well put together,and I believe it to be a true account.I don't think the Seal who wrote the book gave out any information that was compromising to our Government.This book is one you will not put down,because you just have to know what comes next.It gives you an insight into  what a seal is and the sacrifices he makes for our country.I really liked the book and will recommend buying it from Amazon like I did,for a fast delivery right to your door.I am well pleased with every purchase I make from Amazon,its the place to do your shopping.
B0092YO8C6|5.0|This is a fun, upbeat album. It has all my favorites from the show and is great to listen to in the car or dance around to at home. Ross Lynch does a great job.
0547572298|5.0|Just and incredible piece of science fiction, let me rephrase that, incredible fiction, period. PKD's writing is light years above nearly all the science fiction writers before or since him.  A very psychologically complex story and highly original.  Hollywood owes this guy millions, nearly every GOOD science fiction movie produced over the years has directly used PKD's books or stolen parts from them.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|After reading the first book of the trilogy and waiting for the sequel, I must say that I am disappointed in it. The writing and the character development is lacking and it failed to hold my interest. It seemed to me that the author has lost his fire and is only out for a paycheck.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Interesting, exciting, sad, scary, disturbing; all those emotions and more.  Such an easy and fast read.  Thank you for sharing a bit of your military life story particularly with fellow Americans.  Those of us who are not in the military have to read this book if for no other reason than as a reminder of the all the brave, Americans who fight everyday so we can live in this wonderful country.  I cannot imagine the life you describe. I have to say I was worried about the details disclosed however I suppose those details may already be known by all - Best of luck to you in your retirement/civilian life...
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Amazing book and so descriptive better the second time around reading it. i recommend everyone should read this book. teens, adults
B0083EW97W|5.0|I have enjoyed all of John's albums and this one is great as well! It's definitely a different feel and direction, but the songwriting and musical talent is still there! Have a listen!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I still love this series. It's impossible to put these books down. More characters and an outstanding plot. Again, be aware that some subject matter isn't appropriate for young folks.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Beautiful voice. Beautitful music. All of the songs on the album are flawless. Music for a rainy day or a Sunday dinner.
B00008CMR6|5.0|John Wayne was never fully given great credit for doing great work and this is another of the great ones.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|lots of fun. good time. to short though. couple times had to use hint. makes me think of a couple games. puzzles sometimes didnt make much sense.
B000PFFSKM|5.0|I made the same MISTAKE that Erin made. I had the original version of this on CD.  Then replaced it with the Re-masterd version. I don't like listening to the re-mastered version. The extra songs suck. They added a song in the middle, not a good one, changing the continuity of the disc and pulled Teacher out of the middle of the album and put it at the end as a bonus track, but a different version. They screwed the whole thing up. The re-mastered version may sound superior, but it doesn't flow like the original. I would rather have the original
B008673ZAQ|5.0|We once again meet up with Eva and Gideon in the second book of the Crossfire Trilogy. Eva and Gideon are still struggling to figure out their intense relationship. At times their relationship is steamy hot and appears to be moving in a forward and healthy way. Then just as suddenly the distance between the two is cold as ice, leaving Eva struggling to figure out the man with so many secrets whom is so deeply damaged inside yet consumes her heart and desires like an addiction.<br /><br />Stuck in the emotional upheaval, Eva tries to focus on establishing herself as an individual, separate from her tumultuous relationship with Gideon and her bisexual best friend and roommate Cary, by cultivating new friends and relationships in New York. When Shawna invites her to a concert, Eva finds it to perfect opportunity to make a new girlfriend. But Eva's past is haunting her and Gideon is there to witness the climax of when the past meets the present.<br /><br />The constant emotional back and forth and secrets, paired with explosive sex scenes, highlights the character development we see in this second novel and proves without a doubt that Sylvia Day has created a trilogy worthy of reading. A violent attack on someone Eva loves, the reappearance of ex's, and the truth behind some of Gideon's past is revealed adding greater depth and complexity to both the plot and characters. Day leaves both Eva and the reader guessing what will happen next and if Gideon and Eva's relationship can survive. Readers will not be disappointed by Reflected in You, only sorry that they will have to wait until the concluding and final novel in the Crossfire series, Entwined with You, is released December 31, 2012.<br /><br />The ebook edition of Reflected in You is currently available, but the paperback will not be released until October 23, 2012.<br /><br />Baseballvalbooks.wordpress.com
B001JIHGO0|5.0|Horror, Vampires, Frankenstein's Monster, Werewolves, heroes, religious hypocrisy, humor, sparks of love, heart break, life goes on. Any movie that can give me all of that and have the story feel completed in the way that it should at the end, has to be a 5 Star!
