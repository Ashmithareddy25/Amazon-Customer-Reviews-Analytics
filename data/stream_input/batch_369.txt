B000005GYI|5.0|First recorded (Cancao do Sal) by Elis Regina in 1965, Milton Nascimento became widely known and acclaimed two years later when he landed no less than three songs (Travessia, which finished second, Morro Velho and Maria Minha Fe) at the finals of one the music festivals that were then at their peak; and with this (double) 1972 album, his fourth, achieved even wider recognition as the true genius he is. That was, coincidentally, a particularly rich year in Brazilian music, with over a dozen memorable albums being released - suffice to say that it was the year Jobim's Aguas de Marco came out, heralding \\"the promise of life\\" -, but Clube da Esquina stood out. <br />For together with Milton it showcased his \\"band of brothers\\", a group of extraordinarily talented Minas Gerais musicians and songwriters who used to gather as what was nicknamed \\"the street corner club\\", Clube da Esquina, plus new colleagues and partners from Rio such as lyricist Ronaldo Bastos, who contributes six songs to this album, among them classics-to-be Cais, O Trem Azul and Nada Sera Como Antes. On top of that, it introduced audiences to Lo Borges, who shares the spotlight with Milton, and would later in that very same year release his first solo album, recently reissued in CD. The music is an entrancing blend of rich and elaborate harmony, melody and instrumentation. Milton's Gaia's-gift-to-mankind voice shines throughout it, clear and beautiful. The lyrics - well, you have to be fluent in Portuguese to really appreciate them. In a five-point scale, this CD deserves a solid ten.<br /> (Note: some reviewers have likened this album to The Beatles' Revolver, Sgt. Peppers' and/or White Album. The comparison is not absurd: Milton, Lo et al. were no strangers to pop, as evidenced for instance by the guitar work in this CD and, more prominently, in Lo's abovementioned debut album; yet, their music soared far above and beyond that idiom. And all were critical of the more faddish - and invasive - elements of it: consider that, on his previous LP, Milton recorded Para Lennon &amp; McCartney, music by Lo, words by Fernando Brant and Lo's brother Marcio Borges, which go, \\"Because you don't know about the Western trash (...) I'm from South America, and I know, you won't know about it, but now I'm a cowboy, I'm in the mint, I am you, I'm of the world - I am Minas Gerais\\"...)
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Well, the question is, can the Beatles release an album remixed after 33 years of being worshipped because the original album was a Beatles album, and improve the album with the remix?<br />Yes.<br />In the first place, we now have mixing and sound reproduction technology that produce a sound that makes you feel as though you're in the room with these four remarkable young men.  You can hear their energy, their skill as musicians, the superb voices of John and Paul, and the sturdy voice of George, and you can hear all this without the musical static produced on several songs  by Mr. Spector who, you may realize, was trying to tell you what to feel when John and Paul were singing.  They didn't need the help.  This is an elegant, simple, terrifically complex album that was not available until this release.  <br />The songs themselves have such depth, and the performances are so skilled and so personally compelling, that they rivet our attention in the same way that all Beatles releases always did.  Lennon and McCartney are at the top of their form here, and George just emerging as a major song  writer.   The songs have become part of the fabric of our civilization, and the versions on this release explain why.<br />Enjoy!
B000084T18|5.0|This is the best CD out there man.  He is cool and he sings good.  This cd has the best music.  People are saying he sucks because he got shot.  Thats funny.  You know how many people wish to be him.  Well overall this cd is great.
0743490304|4.0|After reading &quot;The Divinci Code&quot; and &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;, I couldn't resist another Dan Brown work.  &quot;Deception Point&quot; is true to Dan's current motif, with an attractive young heroin, a handsome love interest, and a father-like figure who ultimately turns out to be the villan.  Packed with action and twists, this book kept me interested from beginning to end.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have been a HUGE fan since the video Pull Me Under (off Images and Words....second album for those who don't know) hit Headbangers Ball on MTV (When they used to play metal...... actualy, when the used to play music in general.)  If you have been following the updates on them before the album came out, they did say that they were putting out a classic metal album (old Metallica, Megadeth.)  Knowing this, I was very surprised that the was the typical technicality and length of DT....the way that DT can only do and not make it sound boring.  All their albums were different and this one continues the tradition.  Unlike Metallica (where all albums are different) this one is actually awesome.  If you like The Glass Prison (off 6doit) and its heaviness, you definately will like this album.  If you are looking for Images And Words 2 or Metropolis Part 3: Stream Of Consiousness, then this album is not for you.
B000002UA9|5.0|Judged by the standards they set in the mid-sixties, this is not a great Beatles album, yet it is far superior to anything most of their rivals could ever hope to achieve. As such, it (like all Beatles albums) comfortably deserves five stars.<br />Like all the early Beatles albums, this one contains several covers - six in this case. The three best are Baby it's you (Shirelles), Twist and shout (Isley brothers) and A taste of honey. Twist and shout became a UK top ten hit for Brian Poole and the Tremeloes, the group that Decca signed in preference to the Beatles.<br />The album's title track became the first major Beatles hit. The chart that is now generally regarded as the standard UK chart (and published in the Guinness book of British hit singles) registers a peak position of 2, but back in the early sixties there were three other charts and all of those gave a peak position of 1. No chart was regarded then as being more reliable than the others, so most connoisseurs regard Please please me as the first Beatles chart-topper.<br />Three of the other seven originals stand out. I saw her standing there opens the album and was presumably considered for singles release. Do you want to know a secret was covered by Billy J Kramer and the Dakotas and provided them with their first major pop hit. Love me do was the debut single for the Beatles, making the UK top twenty at the time, though it would make the top five when re-released in the eighties.<br />This is not the best place to begin a Beatles collection but it is a great album in its own way and is required listening for all true Beatles fans.
B00008URYM|5.0|Love the songs, love the remixes but word of warning - the &quot;enhanced&quot; portion of the single is simple a link to join Madonna's official mailing list.  This appears when you put the cd in a computer.  Whoop-de-doo.
B00008NRLX|5.0|Fresh, fine guitar and harmonies, uplifting, and definitely helping me through the holiday blues.
B000066NW0|1.0|All I have to say is that Avril sucks. She'a a terrible singer and this cd is crap. Her only good songs are: Sk8ter Boi and I'm with you. The rest are crap. She's the worst singer in the music business and she should also take speech therapies. I don't recommend this album to anyone.
B0000CABBW|5.0|&quot;Whale Rider&quot; is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. Perfectly written, perfectly acted, perfectly filmed, I wouldn't change a thing about it.<br />The actors on the screen ARE the characters. They aren't acting, and when you watch this movie it's as if you were watching real people who aren't aware of the camera.<br />The story is just amazing, powerful. And the soundtrack score is so perfectly matched and subtle that one barely knows it's there (reminds me of the soundtrack to &quot;Monster's Ball&quot;).<br />I highly recommend this inspiring and emotional movie for everyone. If there is justice at the Oscars, it'll get best foreign film.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Believe me, it is.<br />I am not going to tell you about how or when I discovered Radiohead and OK Computer, but after listening to this album a couple of times, I could not disconnect from it.<br />Besides, I must say I have not met anyone who dislikes OK Computer after having carefully listened to it. On the contrary, everyone of these listeners considers this album a masterpiece!!<br />Let's put it back to 5 Stars, where it deserves to stay.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox made quite a mistake by canceling &quot;Firefly,&quot; the hands-down most creative show in history. Joss Whedon is at his writing best with the adventures of the misfits and castaways aboard the Serenity. Though only about 10 episodes made it to air, this package includes all 14 original episodes, and they put them in the right order (note: the pilot episode was aired as the season finale). This is a must have for any fan of space, westerns, or the amazing humor of Joss Whedon. BUY IT!!
0385335482|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a fun read.  For the first time ever I seriously couldn't put the book down.  It was delightful that things did not take place as one might think, but holds the reader until the end.  Even at that that point I wanted to rush to the book store to buy the following books in the series.  I would recommend this book 100%!!
B00003CXZ1|5.0|My family loves this movie, it is terrific.  Lots of action, but yet not gory so that my little one can't watch.  This is deffinetley a keeper.
0062502182|4.0|This book, by Paulo Coelho, is, like all fables, written on many levels. Ostensibly the story of a shepard in Spain who, unlike so many people, follows his dreams. He does get a little help from the supernatural, but many of the stories most intersting thoughts come from his musings on nature. His travels take him across the Mediteranean into Africa, where he meets several archetypal characters (the Man Afraid of Change, the Waiting Woman, the Wise Shaman, the Warrior Chief, the Cynical Fool), learns about himself and his dreams, and finds his destiny.<br />An interesting way to look at this story is to ask the question: who is the title character? Alchemy is such a potent idea--the changing of one element into another has had a grasp on the human mind for as long as we have known about elements. But, of course, alchemy has secondary meanings--an alchemist transforms. Is the boy an alchemist, for transforming himself and the lives of those around him? Is God the alchemist, for transforming the destinies of humanity? Is the reader the alchemist, for taking the fable and transforming its words into something personally meaningful?<br />My favorite part about this book was its gritty reality. I like epics, but there were no sweeping vistas and no ubermensch heros in this book. Everything the boy does (and we never learn his name) is something you and I could do. I guess that's the point of the book.<br />Update: As ihath commented on my weblog, you do learn the boy's name.  It's revealed on the first page.  But, as I remember, it's not used much throughout the book, maintaining the everyman nature of the story.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The title sums it up. From the first episode, (The Train Job) I adored this show...and no, I'm not just a very loyal Joss fan (though you guys rock). I've never watched Buffy or Angel, I just read about Firefly in an upcoming shows article and thought it sounded interesting. I was wrong...it was 10X more than just &quot;interesting&quot;. The characters were flawless, the musical was gorgeous, the CGI and other effects amazing and, most of all, the dialogue was pure genius. I cried when they took this show off the air. And I proceeded to cry again when I watched the never aired episodes on this DVD. This will go right next to Pride and Prejudice and LOTR as the greatest DVDs in my collection...maybe even above since, at least with P&amp;P and LOTR, I had closure. Watching Firefly is bittersweet every time...which in some sadistic way makes it even more enjoyable.
B000002MY3|5.0|As Alanis was making her way to the top she thought that `All I Really Want' is to make it big with some great music that millions will enjoy and `You Oughta Know' that this album is going to be `Perfect' for those fans and as I put my `Hand In My Pocket' I'm seeing `Right Through You,' although those who jaded me may not be `Forgiven' `You Learn' that these things don't matter in the end although I had my \\"Head over Feet' \\"Mary Jane' thought it was `Ironic' in the end that I was `Not the Doctor' and that I should `Wake Up' and enjoy the success of this album!<br />With \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", Alanis Morissette burst onto the music scene with an album that is stuffed from the first track to the last with raw yet very beautiful music!  In her voice and her lyrics, this listener finds beauty and intelligence unmatched by her peers in the industry.  \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" and her next two albums, for me, are required music for any long trip down the highway at any given time.<br />While many may find the subjects and lyrics of this debut album for the ever beautiful Alanis Morissette to be somewhat jaded, as they are, they are also that which launched a spectacular career for her due to that very jaded nature of her music.  It is that jaded nature of many of the songs on this phenomenal CD that adds such a personal feeling to her music that it draws the listeners to her music.  From the very first song to the last, which includes an untitled and unnamed song some time after the last one ends; this CD entertains completely and thoroughly!  I highly recommend this and any other album by Alanis Morissette!  {ssintrepid}
B0000C1733|5.0|I really like the selection of music on this disc.  it's a pretty good hits collection but it is missing a bunch of their really good ones :<br />*The Zephyr Song<BR>*Around the World<BR>*Love Rollercoaster<BR>*Can't Stop<BR>*Aeroplane<br />...did they forget about them?  i know they top my list :)<br />but overall, i recommend it :)
B00000AFDW|3.0|When kiss decided to reunite i was ecstatic! But, this release was lackluster. In fact i would recommend it to any kiss fan. It has a few good songs on it. I think it was one of Kiss's worst efforts along with Crazy nights, Hot in the shade and Carnival of souls. Both Criss and Frehley have left the band at different times since they reunited. This leads me to believe Simmons and Stanley are not giving them there fair share.
B00000G3I2|1.0|The only thing I could relate to in this film was the loss of a 'friend' to a suicide and the music.<br />I was expecting, as it says on the back cover, a movie that was \\"funny and ferociously smart\\" (quote from Richard Corliss, Time.)<br />A small group of college friends of the deceased are brought back together, after a number of years of being out of college, by the suicide of a friend. I can say that the way the people acted was a bit weird, but then there is always an air of akward energy at any fuernal.<br />They spend a week-end at a friends, and as they have gone on with their lives, and a story line starts to develop along the lines of \\"why did our friend commit suicide?\\" which unfortunately is never developed (nor are any of the other stories.)<br />Although the the favorite music of someone who's passed is familiar (as this is custom to many people at funerals) and the Rolling Stones, \\"Can't Always Get What You Want\\" fits the entire movie (and what I was feeling about the movie, as I received it as a gift!), that is likely the most realistic part. The deceased prolly never got what he wanted or needed, nor did anyone else in the movie! Like I said, depressing!<br />A grouping of great actors, a pretty good idea, but other than the music, the movie is simply depressing. How many people find a trip to a funeral (or the aftermath) 'fun' or 'funny?' (I do recall some movie that included a funeral, but this certainly wasn't it!)<br />I'm sure for those who liked Motown music from the late 60's/early 70's, the soundtrack might be a good choice.<br />There isn't much to say about the story, as there isn't much of a story. man takes his life, friends come to a funeral, and have a week-end together and they all seem pretty unhappy with their lives as well.<br />While there is a need for coming-of-age ceremony is our society, and the movie (seemingly without the knowledge of the directors, writers or actors) seems to make that obvious, there really isn't much of a story at all... there IS a mish-mash of people thrown together by the funeral, and their reminising about their 'old times' (but that isn't really developed in the movie either!) and about being lost and unhappy themselves.<br />The uncomfortableness of the situation surronding their getting together for the funeral is felt and is depressing, but then the story sprials out into the mish-mash, and this part of the story gets lost as well.<br />A lot of good ideas thrown together, but none really developed.<br />Yes, I cried, and it made me uncomfortable as I cringed with the actors/actresses as they were akward at the beginning at the funeral, but after that the stories that were being developed are lost, and you have to wonder what happened to them!?!<br />There could have been about 3-4 great movies made with the ideas, and the ideas developed fully. Instead, this movie hacks them into bits, then putting together like making an awesome dinner, then deciding to add all the ingredients from all the parts of the dinner into one bowl and making a disappointing mess.<br />I can totally see why this movie was turned down by so many studios (according to the director/writer in the additional features section) and why those people didn't 'get it.' I don't either, and I am from that generation, DID go to college , and DID experience not only one suicide, but several.<br />Funny? I felt sad that the suicide parts were lost, along with every other story that starts in this movie (then disappears into oblivian.) I tried watching it again with a friend (from college mind you - thinking the suicide thing might be a little too close to home for me,as well as watching it during the holidays) and he thought it was depressing as well (and he didn't know the people I knew that had really committed suicide - I thought it was just me.)<br />The part that is apparently supposed to get across that this guy (who you never see) who commits suicide did so as a result of his disappointmentin himself is never developed (this idea was explained in the documentary, but the movie never gets it across), and why he actually did it, no one really seems to care, other than some idol curiosity - hardly what anyone really does in real life.<br />The music and the cars are the best parts of the movie. Other than this, it's a total waste. I never heard about his movie when it came out, but then I was busy working and raising kids like most of us in this generation, in the early 1980's!<br />If you like laughing at tragety in people's lives, and/or were an raging bully with nothing better to do and still carry that behavoir, I can see why you'd like it. (And PLEASE get some help!)<br />If this movie serves any purpose at all, it reminds us of those people who were hurtful/abusive towards ourselves and others in a deep, lasting way. (perhaps another reason why I found it so depressing, as it was the very people like this that lead to a couple of the suicides of those I knew, and several attempted suicides of others.)<br />If you like this movie, you might ask yourself why? What is it one likes & enjoys about watching personal pain and tragety of others? And you might go see a psychoanalist or psychiatrist, as you might just need some serious help, and may be hurting those around you without even realizing it.nt in himself is never developed (this idea was explained in the documentary, but the movie never gets it across), and why he actually did it, no one really seems to care, other than some idol curiosity - hardly what anyone really does in real life. <br />The music and the cars are the best parts of the movie.

B00008H2LB|3.0|Well, I've owned this album for quite some time, but I finally decided to throw my 2 cents in.<br />Well, this cd is marked off by rather unoriginal guitar work. I don't doubt for a second that every single chord struck on the entire album can be described as &quot;starts with P&quot; and rhymes with &quot;cower.&quot; The riffs are fairly repetitive too, though few and far between. As a guitar player I really can't tolerate this kind of unoriginality, especially when it's accompanied with vast simplicity. I mean, I don't expect them to be like John Petrucci or Steve Vai or anything, but at least show some sign that you know how to play.<br />So then why do people like this stuff? Truly what defines this band is(unusually enough) he DJ. His work is literally the only thing that gives the songs any texture. Indeed, he almost gets the cd out of the deep recesses of mediocrity. <br />Lastly on the vocal aspects...well, most of the lyrics are purposefully vague(so as to make everyone out there be able to say &quot;Hey, thats exactly like my life, this has meaning to me&quot;) Linkin Park zealots would have you belive that Chester has been blessed with a good voice. Having heard much better, I'm not particularily impressed(not that I could do better or anything.)<br />All things considered I'd say the CD is 3.5 stars. I rounded down because I've given much better albums only 4 stars.
0385504209|5.0|I finished reading this last night - 2 1/5 days total reading time, I just couldn't put it down.  Now I won't claim that the book is an A+ Thriller/Mystery as I don't read those books and wouldn't be an educated critic - however, it did keep my complete attention at a busy time of the season (holidays)<br />What I notice is that the book generated many questions for me and I am excited to learn more about lost religions.  I am looking on Amazon for more titles that will continue me on the journey...<br />What I notice is that many, many others are feeling the same as I - I checked the Amazon 100 Best Seller list moments ago and found the following titles -<br />  #5 -  Angels &amp; Demons<br />  #8 -  The Gospel of Mary Magdalene<br />  #16 = The Gnostic Gospels<br />  #22 - Holy Blood, Holy Grail<br />  #28 - Lost Christianities<br />  #37 - Lost Books of the Bibles<br />  #48 - Beyond Belief - The Secret Gospel of Thomas<br />  #74 - The Secret Teachings of Jesus<br />  #86 - Nag Hammadi Library<br />  #99 - The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls<br />This is the best flattery that a book can get - to spawn the interest into subjects that have been ignored by the mainstream for so long.  Proof that there is interest in questioning the status quo. People are finally questioning and questioning is that best one can do to educate oneself.<br />I think this book deserves many awards for the amazing impact it is creating.
B0000CAQ26|4.0|Wandering through my local record store, I saw plenty of music to choose from, but being that I only had just a few bucks to spare, I was limited to purchasing one album. &quot;Try This&quot; stood out - from its playful, unglossed album cover to the intriguing title. I had enjoyed her previous effort, &quot;Missundazstood,&quot; and although I had read various reviews about how terrible the album was, I wanted to take a listen and judge for myself. So, I bought the album.<br />&quot;Try This&quot; is an outstanding record, and a triumph in itself. Pink, as an artist, has never been a fan of conformity, and even early on, she expressed her desire to be different and not follow the pack, so it was no surprise that the album was so diverse and eclectic. In fact, it was unlike any other album by a female artist released in recent years.<br />From the rock/pop-infused &quot;Trouble,&quot; to the softer, acoustic-feel of &quot;Love Song,&quot; Pink's raw, soulful vocals croon like there was no tomorrow. You can hear and feel the passion and determination in her voice, as she sings about love-loss, rebellion and self-destruction. There's a glow on &quot;Try This&quot; that was unfounded on her previous effort, &quot;Missundazstood.&quot; Perhaps, it's the influence of Pink's new producer, Tim Armstrong? Whatever the reason may be, it's a refreshing album that should be praised for its diversity, rather than slammed for not being what people expected. You want to be kept on your toes, don't you?<br />Don't wait another minute. &quot;Try this,&quot; and enjoy it, because it truly is a wonderful, eclectic album, by a rare talent who embraces what makes us all special - difference.
B00004Z459|5.0|OMG! I love Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory CD, it totally rocks! All the songs are awesome! I think the best tracks are 1,2,5, and 8. I'm loving this band more and more as I listen to their album more and more!! Linkin park rocks! And I think everybody that likes rock music or is a Linkin Park fan, they must get this CD today! Go Linkin Park!!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I was never a Britney fan from the beginning. I dont own any of her past CDs. I heard her song \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" I really liked it. So I decided to buy the CD. Big Big mistake. I should've downloaded it but I just couldnt do it. Here's my review song by song. <br />Me Against the Music: It's an okay song. The only reason it did okay is because it had Madonna (not too much of a fan of hers either) on it and because of the hype \\"the kiss\\" received. <br />(I Got That)Boom Boom: I like the beat of this song. For me this is the best song on the album. I could have done with out the Ying Yang Twins. I guess she added them to appeal to the urban market. Sorry Britney but no matter how many urban stars you have on your record you'll never cross over. <br />Showdown: The lyrics? You call those lyrics? I can't even follow them. I really dont know how to describe this song. I can sit here and listen to it but the song just disappears. Nothing interesting about it at all.<br />Breathe On Me: I'd like to see her sing this one live. Yeah right. I guess I should have sad mimed this one. This song sounds familiar. Maybe its the part where she says \\"this goes way beyond the physical.\\" Hopefully she'll go the way of Olivia Newton John.<br />Early Mornin': Is that her voice in this song. To many machines.<br />Toxic: This song is okay. The only part of this song I like is the part where she (the machine) says something like \\"a guy like you should wear a warning.\\" I hear alittle bit of the Boom Boom in this one. <br />Outrageous: This song is just hilarious. It just shows how immature she still is. Yes, R.Kelly wrote this song. But if Britney was all about the quality of music she would not have allowed this song on her CD. \\"Locking down the industry\\" yeah it's because of people like her the door is shut on truly talented artists. <br />Touch of My Hand: More machines. The lyrics could have been better. Oh I wonder why she didnt include lyrics in the booklet. Moms and Dads out there maybe. <br />The Hookup: Britney signing reggae? So funny. Sing this live Britney. Britney tries to be \\"down\\" on this song. It's not working. Maybe if she could actually sing without digital enhancements.<br />Shadow: Take a lot if writing and singing lessons Britney. Not even the machines help her voice here. <br />Brave New Girl: Dumb Lyrics. The beat reminds me of a Madonna song. Is she trying to rap? Whats with the sound effects. This song sounds like a Hillary Duff song. This belongs on the Disney channel. So much for growth.<br />Everytime: Pretty much the only full on ballad. Again the machines dont help her voice much. Did anybody see her try to sing this song on SNL? Trully dreadful.<br />ITS SAD THAT PEOPLE LIKE BRITNEY OVERSHADOW THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH ACTUAL TALENT. I ALSO FIND IT FUNNY THAT I HAVENT SEEN TOO MUCH CRITICISM THAT HER ALBUM IS TOO SEXUAL LIKE THERE WAS FOR CHRISTINA AGUILERA. THIS ALBUM IS FAR MORE SEXUAL THAN STRIPPED. AT LEAST CHRISTINA HAS THE TALENT TO BACK UP HER MUSIC. SHE CHOSE TO BE SEXUAL BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO NOT BECAUSE SHE HAD TO TO SELL RECORDS. OUT OF ALL THE POP PRINCESSES OUT THERE BRITNEY DESERVES TO BE THE LEAST FAMOUS. IF SHE WOULD HAVE COME OUT AFTER CHRISTINA AND JESSICA SHE'S BE GONE BY NOW.
B000066NW0|4.0|Why do people keep giving this cd just because she's not punk? I realize she's a poseur and not a skater but why does that matter? This cd is good with no bad tracks. They are all great, however I agree they have bad lyrics, and this is the reason I give 4 out of 5. And yes, Avril Lavigne is stupid, but I focus more on the music not the artist!
B000060P79|5.0|I recently had my CD player stolen from my locker at school and I was very upset by this, but i was even more devastated to realize that this CD was in it.  i love this CD i don't think that any of the tracks are unlistenable, some aren't as strong as others but thats how most CD's are today.  I thoroughly enjoy this CD and plan to buy a new one as soon as possible.  i would recommend it to most people but if you are a hardcore punk fan i could see why this wouldn't really appeal to you. but i still say that this speaks to almost ever teenager in america and that you should take a listen to it.  some may think that it is just watered down punk, but if you dig deeper it stricks a cord with everyone i know.  so if you are a teenager, or like punk music i would definetly check this out!!! its one of the best CD's out there today!
B00008PW2D|2.0|The first four seasons of SATC were great...they were funny, well-written, and smartly acted. However in 6/02, in anticipation of the Fifth Season...I was expecting what I had seen in the 1st 2nd, 3rd, and 4th season...a great concept only heightened with all the above mentioned...but what I got was a light-hearted effort at best...there were very few funny moments and the writing wasn't up to par with the previous seasons. Admitingly I've only seen about threeor four episodes of the most recent and last season, and they seemed a little more entertaining...I'm anxious to see how the rest of season went...and goes. I love Sex and the City...I think its was the best thing on television in the 90's and the a great prelude into the new millennium...it was (and is) a cultural phenomenon that took the world by storm. I will be sad to see it go...these are my girls...they're are/were great! But if the season's would've contiuned to go downhill...then they should end it. A great series and the best comedy series HBO has put out to date...in my opinion. It's been a great six years.
0800177975|5.0|I don't see what people hate about this film. There are tons of awesome action scenes although they are a bit cheesy. The action is meant to be cheesy though because it's about a movie within a movie.<br />The cast is really good even though the boy seems a little annoying at first. By the end of the movie you will probably think Jack Slater to be really awesome. Anyways, I enjoyed it. There was humor, some one-liners, but the movie was extremely well done and extremely entertaining. 5 stars.
0385504209|4.0|I was really excited to get my hands on this book. I hadnt been too sure about what it was about, but with all the hype became really interested. I've been glued to it book for the past 2 days..and find it extremely fascinating. Knowing that so much recent controversy lies behind &quot;the church&quot; nowadays, this book really fuels the fire of having readers open their mind to what other things the church would try and cover up to keep themselves looking good...<br />It makes me want to learn more about the other little things noted in the book &quot;priory of sion&quot;, &quot;da vinci&quot; etc. I felt like a new door opened after reading this book and do not doubt there could much FACT could lie behind this &quot;Fiction&quot;.<br />I understand how the book could rile people up and cause more controversy and really appreciate that...I think thsi a anotehr great way that peoples minds are opened to alternative history and what other things may have really happened...not to mention it's fun to see the corrupt church break a scared sweat...yet again!<br />I find this all sooo fascinating....
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a great way for fans to really get up close and personal with the Beatles... plus you get to see the three remaining Beatles talking and jamming together... It was nice to see the three of them putting aside their differences and just enjoying each other's comany.... Plus you get both music videos that brought the Beatles back to the radio...<br />This is by far the best documentry on the fab 4... This is a must own for those that can't get enough of the Beatles... Interestin and Bittersweet is what it is for me.....
B00007LTIA|5.0|once you listen to this album a few times, you realize that it's some of the most creatively put together Yes music in their entire catalog. that's it.
B000002AHM|1.0|I was disappointed with this recording. You can admire their great technical abilities but it seemed to me (in my most humble opinion) that the subtle beauty and sophistication, that I believe makes great music, was lost.    They're great masters of guitar, no doubt. I think I should have given this recording 3 stars at least for that. I think I just got used to some Segovia recordings I had been listening to at the time; \\"The Old Castle\\", \\"Pictures at and Exhibition\\", stuff like that. So I was very biased. I was hoping to hear that style of subtlety, less notes and more emotional impact. It might also be an age thing. When I was in my 20's I probably would have really loved this recording because of it's unbelievable technical achievements. It's true what they say, when you get older your tastes refine, or at least change.    If I could change the rating here to 3 stars I would. When I originally reviewed the recording I think I responded too quickly, I was just hoping to hear something like what I had been listening to at the time, Segovia, etc.
B00006V9A0|4.0|The first time I ever heard &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; was on the radio, in my car. I couldn't understand what the obviously angry man was saying, and the rest was very thick bass, loud drums and so much  feedback from the guitar that you thought your eardrums were gonna blow. Of course, I immediatly loved the song. Of course I knew it was Nirvana. It was very Kurt Cobain. This CD is basically a money making ploy, but it does have great material on it. The songs are big hits for the band, containing items from Bleach, Nevermind, In Utero and Live Unplugged on them. Of course it has Smells Like Teen Spirit, but Nirvana was so much better than that 4:57 song about being stupid and contagious.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|I finally got around to see \\"Finding Nemo\\" over the holiday weekend when I received a copy of it for Xmas. I always had a love for aquatic life, especially marine aquatic life. Clown fish are one of the most beautiful salt-water fishes I have ever seen.  I thought it was a great idea when Disney and Pixar made a film that was based around a clown fish and his missing son. I didn't really think that it was possible for Disney to put out a film that could out do \\"The Lion King\\", my personal favorite Disney film of all time. Well, I was wrong. \\"Finding Nemo\\" was such a delight to watch, the film has now pushed \\"The Lion King\\" into 2nd place as my favorite Disney film. The movie isn't too scary for young children except maybe in the opening sequence when Marlin and his mate Coral encounter a hungry barracuda. I could have easily just pushed mute on my remote control and the film still would have been great. \\"Finding Nemo\\" is visual eye candy. The animation from Pixar studios is breathtaking to say the very least. There were moments in the film when I thought what I was seeing was real. The facial expressions of the charcaters totally made me forget that I was watching an animated film. Ellen Degeneres as the forgetful Dory was priceless. Ellen's comic timing is impeccable. She is probably the standout charcater in the film for me. Albert Brooks was perfectly cast as the overprotective, neurotic father Marlin. Albert Brooks has always been in my book a highly underrated comediac actor. His neuroticism was well played out in Marlin. One of my favorite characters is Peach the starfish (voiced by Allison Janney) and the vegetarian sharks (now there's an oxymoron for you), and the sea turtle Crush. I didn't know until I saw the credits that William DeFoe was the voice for Gil. And Bloat the porcupine fish was hilarious. Between the two stories that were going in the film, I can't really pick a favorite between the two because they are so entertaining. There was nothing about this film that I could find nothing wrong. The storywriting was excellent. The cast of actors were wonderfully witty. And the animation was nothing short of amazing, particularly the jellyfish scene and when the fish were caught in the fisherman's net. The scenes looked so realistic that I forgot that I was watching an animated film. When Oscars comes around the corner next year, \\"Finding Nemo\\" better be recognized for the animation work (at least). The animated short \\"Knick Knack\\" prior to the film was very cute to say the very least. \\"Finding Nemo\\" is my favorite Xmas gift I got this year. Anyone who didn't enjoy this film obviously isn't a kid at heart. \\"Finding Nemo\\" is truly one of the best (animated) films I have ever seen in my 20 some years of life.this film that I could find nothing wrong.

B0000C6E4D|1.0|I am a huge Sarah Mclachlan fan. Fumbling Towards Ex. was a pure work of art and I adored her other albums espically the B-sides and Rareities (sp?) cd. However, &quot;Afterglow&quot; which I waited FIVE years for left me completely unsatisfied. Her lyrics had no inspiration and maybe two of the songs actually sounded as if she had any input into their sound at all. If you are already a Sarah fan don't waste your money. This album shows nothing of her talent except her beautiful voice. If you're new to her work than go ahead and give it a try. If you enjoy bland uninspired pop than this is your kind of cd.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|As with the last two soundtracks for the Lord of the Rings movies, Howard Shore has created an awesome score for The Return of the King.  This soundtrack takes the best moments from the movie, giving them to the listener in an audible format.   <br />As with his previous LOTR scores, Shore recreates the mood of the movie as well as the feel of the cultures through his music.  As the movie depicts Minas Tirith, the pride and regality of Gondor is expressed in the fanfares of the themes played while in Gondor.   The heroic, very Anglo-Saxon, spirit of the Rohirrim shows forth in their themes.  The evil of this movie is most evidenced in the subtle, frigtening moments in Shelob's lair and in the doubt caused as the Ringbearer nears Orodruin. However, the brutal power of the forces of Sauron is also made clear.  Overall, the mood of the books is portrayed, in my opinion, most fully through Shore's music.  The spirits and motives of the characters are shown forth in the harmonious interweavings of this musical genius.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who has seen the movie and even to those who have only read the Lord of the Rings.  It is a musical gem!
0671027387|5.0|It's amazing that not one of Brown's works has been snapped up for a movie because just about any one of his thrillers would make for top grossers.<br />If you have read the Da Vinci code, or Angels and Demons, you don't need much convincing to pick up a Dan Brown yarn. But I believe Deception Point is *the* best work yet from Brown, and not only because the riveting plot and its very relateable characters are far removed from the theological.<br />There's a hint of romance here, couched of course in a twist you'd not have figured. Throughout the book I was pretty certain that I had the &quot;bad guys&quot; worked out, but Brown is a master of pulling the rug from under your feet just when you thought you had it figured.<br />Some reviewers lament that the story develops slowly. Frankly, I loved moments in this novel when the underlying technology, gadgets etc are described. Dan Brown is a superlative writer, the modern Grisham if you will.<br />Deception Point is a topnotch thriller, highly recommended!
B00005LC1H|5.0|I'm not going to write a lengthy review, because this series is just simply hilarious. I roared with laughter the first time I saw it, and I still do today. If you like to laugh, then buy it and experience true humor.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Although Scarface is not quit the &quot;Family Movie&quot;, It's good because of Al Pacino's charactor Tony Montana. A down and out man moves to America from Cuba to make something of himself and to make money. He calls himself a &quot; Political Refugee&quot; and while in America, he gets cought up in the cocaine business. Friends die, he finally meets his family. To sum up the first part of the movie,he's dedicated to doing what he is told and will NOT screw any1 over...So, I want YOU to buy it and review the rest of it and promote the Movie!
B000089QEN|1.0|What can I say? Being a great fan of BBC and A&amp;E period dramas, after buying Vanity Fair, I was truly dissapointed. I don't know who was in charge of the casting, but I think it was all the out of work actors thrown together and an ugly bunch you couldn't relate to. The music score was totally innapropiate. I found it to be more of a second rate B movie and would highly recommend that nobody purchase this disastrous production. But on the BBC's behalf I have to recommend as a must for your collection Berkley Square, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Wives &amp; Daughters and Tess of D'Urbervilles. Now these are first class movies, brilliantly cast and excellent performances.
0345452577|2.0|Hard to get into, I am accustomed to getting into one of his books and not putting it down until I finish it.  This book is taking me weeks to finish.  It just has not grabbed my attention. I say, &quot;Bring back Alex Deleware!
B00009V7T2|4.0|This album is amazing yet slightly tedious. Showing an entire scpectrum of music and dynamics- rhythm driven madness to powerful beauty. <br />1. Son et lumiere- vocals almost sound john lennonish though this track leads perfectly up to the fierce and one of  most voilent songs on the album &quot;Intertiatic esp&quot; (8/20)<br />2. Inertiatic esp- The vocals and guitar on this track are amazing, if you were wondering what esp means it means, it means feeling or intuition. The vocals almost sounds like Robert plant on this track. (9/10)<br />3. Roulette dares- my favourite track, maybe because the vocals are robert plant vs. freddy murcury in the chorus which really works well. The chorus is amazing and extremely catchy. The syncopation on this track and rhythm shifts are interestiung to follow... or loose yourself in (10/10)<br />4. Tire me a las aranas (throw me to the spiders)- an interesting work of the guitar sounding brooding yet atmospheric. (6/10) (because its only an instrumental)<br />5. Drunkship of lanters- a definite anthem, displaying vocal range and showing an amazingly tight yet complicated song structure. (9/10)<br />6. Eriararka- this song is a bit droney but has some great melodies on all instruments played. The band doesnt seem to get as involved in this song, but nonetheless it is an epic. (7/10)<br />7. Cicatriz esp- (scar feeling)- if this song wasnt filled with 6 minutes of atmosperic noise, it would be great but its one of those songs you listen to the peak and then skip when the machines take over the instruments... or do the instruments turn into machines? (7/10)<br />8. This apparatus must be unearthed- this song is more int he vein of at the drive in- where the vocals run into odd harmonies and agressive madness. A definite stand out on the album- short and to the point. This song keeps you on the edge of your seat.<BR>(8/10)<br />9. Televators- the ballad of the album, a great song where all the instruments compliment each other well. (8.5/10)<br />10. Take the viel carpin taxt- probably my worst song on the album, its good in its own right but it just doesnt seem to follow the vibe of the album nor conclude it- its too jumpy. (6/10)<br />This is a must-have album... but the album isnt for those who want music they can hear on MTV or listen to on the radio station. Although possessing qualities of a wide range of 70's rock acts, the band turns left of mainstream with its complacent structures and rhythms (which  is a good thing). On the down side... id quite happily trade the album's atmospheric wierd noises (which make up about a third of all the music on the album) for more songs. Though its something no one has ever done to this extent and shows the ruthless extremes in experimentation that the mars volta explore.<br />The music is a mixture of post hardcore, at the drive in, led zepplin, santana, early genesis, queen, and tool- haha is that possible... yeah mars volta did it!
B00009TB5G|4.0|I have a one year old Zenith DVD player and have had to return 2 sets, due to discs 3 and 4 not playing. I have contacted Zenith, and they have told me that my DVD player needs upgraded in order to play these discs and are sending me a software disc to upgrade my unit. For those of you having the same problem, contact the customer service department of your DVD player manufacter. Hopefully, this will solve the problem!
B00005JMGC|4.0|If nothing else, \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" has made me want to learn more about what Wellesley and other colleges like it were really like half a century ago.  It's hard to believe an institution founded on the then-radical idea that women should have a right to an education could ever have been that repressed and conservative; but then, in 1953 those two characteristics could be found in a lot of places you wouldn't expect today.<br />So, is it really \\"Dead Poets' Society\\" with girls?  Only in the most superficial sense.  Yes, they're both about teachers who brought radical ideas to schools that weren't quite ready for them, but that and the decade they're set in are about the only two similarities I could see.  The presentation of that decade is a bit sanitized, as some other reviewers have pointed out, with most of the common intolerances of the time being only hinted at or receiving token mention.  Likewise, Julia Roberts' character usually seems unrealistically oblivious to the limits facing most women in 1953 as she encourages her students to reach beyond the finishing-school life they have all been conditioned to pursue.  <br />It's sad but true that the resistance she meets in that quest is one of the more convincing points of the story, but there are also plenty of delightfully raw looks at what life was like just beneath the surface of the perfect upper-class existence of the era.  The students are also somewhat by the numbers - the free spirit, the conflicted one, the nasty one, the ugly duckling who isn't really ugly - but the talented cast does a lot with the familiar formula all the same.  Likewise, some cliches turn up in the plot, but the story and its characters are original enough that they don't seem too stale.  For example, perhaps you've already seen the student-trespassing-in-an-opposite-sex-dorm scene in every other '50s college movie ever made, but this one at least features the character you'd least expect to find there and you care enough about thepreceding events to be glad it happens.<br />The one real problem with the movie is that most of the characters and the tension in the storyline (to the extent that there is any) are somewhat fuzzily portrayed, with the result that the various resolutions seem either unconvincing or too perfect.  It's almost as if the writers assumed that the audience would be able to fill in the blanks on our own thanks to years of exposure to Hollywood formulas - probably correct, but I was still left thinking much more could have been accomplished with such a great cast, setting and story.  <br />Still, what they do give us is delightful for what it is.  It's a textbook \\"chick-flick\\" (i.e. no nudity or violence - gratuitous or otherwise - most of the major characters are women, and you're supposed to care about them), which will be enough to keep a lot of people away.  For the rest of us, it's unconvincing, but a treat nonetheless.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is the best show ever.  I love this epic about Clark Kent before he was the man in tights and his growing in Smallville aka &quot;home of the strange and town of the weird.&quot;  Clark Kent persues his destiny while fighting it too.  His troubles in love, friendship, foes, and the truth make this show awesome.  Tom Welling does a great job at playing the man who will one day be known as Superman.  I love this show and I hope u will watch and love it too.
B00005N9CV|5.0|After the success of 1999 Platinum-Selling album and Grammy winner for \\"Best Jazz Vocal Album,\\" \\"When I Look In Your Eyes,\\" Tommy LiPuma came up with another bestseller, \\"The Look Of Love.\\"  It has an excellent repertoire of wonderful and infinite songs by famous composers from Gershwin to Carmichael and Mercer to Bacharach. This recording won the \\"Best Engineered Album\\" in the 2002 Grammy Awards.<br /><br />To my ears, \\"The Look of Love\\" and \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" are the best among all of Diana Krall's recordings. Just for two special tracks alone (The Look of Love and 'S Wonderful) is enough reason to buy this fabulous CD.<br /><br />Ms. Krall's sophisticated and elegant vocal artistry as well as Claus Ogerman's superb orchestral arrangements bring out the very best of the ten songs in this album. These songs have been recorded countless times but her beautiful interpretations made them musical treasures of a lifetime. Every song is a gem from the first track, \\"'S Wonderful\\" to the last track, \\"Maybe You'll Be There.\\"  My personal choices include a charming rendition of Bacharach/David classic, \\"The Look of Love,\\" Gershwin Brothers' \\"'S Wonderful,\\" Hamilton's \\"Cry Me A River\\" and Johnny Mercer/Victor Schertzinger's \\"I Remember You.\\"<br /><br />\\"I remember you<br />You're the one who made my dreams come true<br />A few kisses ago<br />I remember you<br />You're the one who said \\"I love you, too\\"<br />I do, didn't you know?<br /><br />I remember, too<br />A distant bell and stars that fell<br />Like rain out of the blue<br />When my life is through<br />And the angels ask me to recall<br />The thrill of them all<br />Then I shall tell them<br />I remember you\\"<br /><br />There's no doubt that Diana Krall is the reigning Queen of Jazz.  It would be great if she will include in her repertoire such lovely songs as \\"Taking A Chance On Love,\\" \\"How Long Has This Been Going On,\\" \\"La Vie En Rose,\\" \\"The More I See You,\\" \\"Just In Time,\\" \\"My Romance,\\" \\"Lullaby of Birdland,\\" \\"Till The End Of Time\\" (based on Chopin's Polonaise No. 6), and \\"Full Moon And Empty Arms\\"(based on Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2), to suggest a few.

B00009AQMJ|5.0|This is a reissue of a reissue...these performances having been recorded originally in the 1960's for Reader's Digest.  The performances are simply fabulous! Both conductor and soloist are magnificent in these full-blooded, exciting virtuoso performances.  Unfortunately, the 3rd concerto is played with the same cuts Horowitz and Rachmaninoff himself used in their recordings (the earlier Horowitz ones; the one with Ormandy is complete).  But don't let that stop you.  Wild plays the absolute hell out of the 3rd concerto!  And the rest of the performances are just as good.  You can't go wrong with this set of all the concertos and the Paganini Rhapsody. Easily one of the best complete sets out there and one of the best 3rds ever recorded!
630280082X|4.0|Hiya there. This is the first review I have written, ever, for anything. I think this was an unbelieveable movie. My dad showed it to me because when i started playing his guitars, I started getting into Joe Satriani. So he said, &quot;You like Satch? You'll never believe this guy.&quot; So we watched the movie, and I am still in awe. I think that Steve Vai is sooo talented and gifted and I just wish that someday I could be that good! Oh yeah, and on a different note, it was actually Stevie Ray Vaughan that played Ralph Macchio's parts, not Steve Vai. I read that Barry guy's review and I was like &quot;DUDE! no no no, Honestly...&quot; So in reality, it was actually Stevie Ray Vaughan who played Ralph's guitar parts in the duel at the end. But either way, the music was jaw-dropping and I absolutely love it. Four out of five stars.
B000002MP2|5.0|I usually do not like pop/punk - but this is the best exception.  This album made my summer so much better, it is better than death, slit your wrists, kill your friends and neighbors music - it is an album to have FUN with.  The album has a teeny pop sound; but if you pay attention to the lyrics, they are very deep and dark full with dissapointment and greef.  If you are into playing guitar and bass (I play a four string bass), then this album is you YOU - fun riffs and lines; i can play almost the whole album on my bass.  Dookie is one of the greatest CDs of our time; each song is just so great.  I have the whole cd on my computer, my iPod, in three cd players; i dont' leave my house without dookie.  I bought this CD during the summer, I have not regreted it.  It made my summer fun and full of great music.  Although people compare Green Day with Good Charlotte; this is an utter lie.  They sound the same, but they are not complete and utter hypocrites.  <BR>     Please buy this CD, you will NOT be dissapointed.  'She' is the best song on the album.  Download it on iTunes or anyother legal system.
B000093NLH|1.0|Unlike other acoustic albums by great bands that enhance their reputations, Acoustica does nothing of the sort.  With the exceptions of songs like &quot;Always Somewhere&quot; and &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot; the album leaves the listener wondering when good songs will begin.
B00007G207|4.0|November 2003: While I agree that the New version does bring about the closure that the original lacked I feel that some of the magic of the film is lost with the telling of the whole story - I therefore prefer the original version for the way it tugged at the heartstrings in the face of an unknown and lost world.<BR>* Mise-en-scene: It was delightful to watch Toto in scenes that were new - I had grown so fond of the character that watching him in new situations was like bringing alive a now dead character and watching him do things he hadn't done.<BR>* I didn't enjoy the sex scenes - they took away from the nostalgia and the innocence of the flashback - may be this is cultural but I thought the original suggestions/subtlety was better than the explicit display.<BR>* It was heart-wrenching to see Toto's girl as an old lady - the irony of how they missed each other was very moving. However the old lady didn't quite have the charm of the young girl - and her character lacked the same conviction - though her lovemaking was a bold move given her place in life.<BR>* The part where the narrative was furthered compellingly was in the director's revealing to us just what an impact Alfredo had had on Toto, when he chose to separate the two lovers - the impact of that decision ultimately made the difference to Toto's life<BR>* I preferred the Old version for Toto's old character - he spoke less, was more reflective, had more aura. While the latest version makes him more human, and we can better understand his character, I feel that in sharing his vulnerabilities the director also makes him more common-place  - the old guy was almost mystical.
B00004YRQA|5.0|An excellent product for any PS2 fan.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|I don't even listen to rock/alternative on a regular basis but this  I have to make an exception. The CD is just one of those things you can listen to from start to finish. It's soothing but not boring. Of course I love the single &quot;Clocks&quot; but this whole album including the DVD is a sit back and enjoy type records. It sounds even better when it's live. Get it. It's a 100% worth it
B000059MEK|5.0|&quot;A Music Fan from Tucson, AZ&quot;, well... He's crazy. He doesn't appreciate good music. Any way, if you like Electronica, or even if you don't, listening to this will be possibly, or close to the best hour or so of your life. It's near impossible to listen to songs like, &quot;One More Time&quot;, or &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,&quot; and not dance. All the songs will have some entrancing effect. Honestly, Daft Punk is underrated, in my opinion. They're one of those artists, that I think few people know about, but truly deserve to be more renowned. &quot;Discovery&quot; has a good collection of Dance music, perfect for a party, and has soft, flowing sounds to settle down to. (Night Vision comes to mind...) Overall, give it a try, you'll probably find at least one song you will like. While it may not be Eminem, or Linkin Park and whatnot, this is a brilliant CD, and we can only hope that Daft Punk will come up with more, perhaps, even greater (If possible.) songs.

B00000634J|5.0|Goodness gracious.  I'm sensing alot of hostility in the reviews about John as a person or musician or whatever.  Look people, no one's putting him on a pedestal..at least, I'm not, but you can't deny his talent.  Ever heard the saying &quot;If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all&quot;?.  Please apply that. Most of you that are saying such rude things were crappin' your diapers when they were making the whole world sing. The guy's not here to defend himself and that's just low-down dirty.  Have some respect.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|We were lucky enough to see a matinee of WICKED in San Francisco in June during the pre-broadway run and liked the show so much that we went back that same night to see it again.  The music helps tell the story and further developed the two lead characters Glinda (Kristen Chenoweth) and Elphaba (Idina Menzel).  We waited with anticipation for the CD to come out just to hear the two leads sing the wonderful music and lyrics of Stephen Schwartz.  Idina sells the &quot;Wizard and I&quot; with such energy and excitement that you don't think she'll be able to top that number, but she does with the Act 1 finale &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; along with Kristen.  The &quot;Popular&quot; and &quot;Loathing&quot; help further develop both characters and display the comic timing of Kristen who's voice can go from opera to pop from one phrase to another.  The music and words of Mr. Schwartz are wonderful, witty and even whimisical.  My 12-year old daughter has not stopped listening to it since we purchased it.  This CD is one that you can listen to again and again without every tiring of it.  Joel Grey and Carole Shelley are two seasoned performers who also add their voices and talents to this beautiful score. Anyone who appreciates a good story, set to great music, performed by two extremely talented actresses will thoroughly enjoy this CD.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself humming the score hours after you've listened to it!  ENJOY!
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Let's be honest, folks, how many of you out there who have bought this have actually viewed all these extras?  Ahhh... that's what I thought.  And how many of you will some day be able to say you've seen every extra?  Well, that's about 0.004% of you.    Extras are nice to have, but the real question is, how do the movies look and sound?  Great--the best they've ever looked and sounded.  Satisfied?  You should be.    That said, the movies vary dramatically in quality--the first movie being an undisputed masterpiece, the second being unabashedly fun, the third being flawed but at times superb, and the fourth being unspeakably inane and worthy of a long, drawn-out death.    Alright now, what happened to the isolated score for Alien?  I felt slightly ripped off when i bought this--perhaps the most enjoyable extra (with the also-missing Scott commentary a close second)--is mysteriously missing from the new set.  How depressing!  So sad that isolated scores are seldom offered on newly-made DVD sets.    Ahhh well.... buy this set for the fabulous look of the movies--particularly the first one.  If there's one movie that I can watch fifty nights in a row and not get bored for a second, it's Alien (scratch that - there's also Chinatown, Casablanca, Ran, and Vertigo).  Anyway, now we can all enjoy Alien in its full glory.
B000001GRZ|5.0|As a youngster, playing the violin, I was always envious of the cello. While never persued further, I would try to take advantage of any opportunity to hear the cello in performance. And so, in college, I noted an announcement of a free (!) cello performance of Bach suites in the music building (UT Austin, mid 70's). My interest in the cello was very uninformed. I certainly was familiar with many of Bach's works, but not the Cello Suites, and not with Pierre Fournier.<BR>But soon I found myself, in the middle of the afernoon, in the smallish performance hall of the music building, four rows back, listening to Pierre Fournier himself (there to teach a master's class), playing I'm not sure anymore what else, but also a Suite for Cello.<BR>And that was that. A lifetime of love.<BR>It is a testament to music, that a relatively uninformed ear, graced by perhaps the finest performer of perhaps the finest music of the human experience, would notice something special.<BR>And so Bach, the Suites for Cello, and Pierre Fournier have accompanied me throughout life, as have my recordings of Pierre Fournier playing them, on LP, and on original CD release.<BR>(I must admit here, I have not heard this re-release.)<BR>I was perfectly content with my one recording, by Fournier.  In the last few years, however, I allowed that I should listen to others, and slowly accumulated Casals, Ma, Rostropovich, and now may of the youngsters in my CD collection. Some entrance, some lull, some amuse. <BR>And I ALWAYS return to Fournier. <BR>Fournier is my absolute refernce for the Suites. Not silly, not rushed, not extravagant, not hokey, not sentimental, not self-important. Not overly moody, not sterile, not overly dramatic for drama sake, not flamboyant, not showy, not show-off-ish.<BR>Truly profound.<BR>And so to the point of this 'review':<BR>ANYONE with ANY interest in the Cello Suites, or music at all. MUST, IMHO, have this recording.<BR>Period.<br />That said, I will simply point out a couple of things. This is an older recording (early1960s), but not as old as the Casals of the 30's. Solidly, cleanly and tightly engineered by Deutsche Grammophon.  Warm, Musical, Analog.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Nobody can put the power of this album into words.  You must listen to it dozens of times.  If you think you get it the first time you listen to it, then you are kidding yourself.  This CD will change your perception of all music forever.  This CD changed the carrers of all the famous musicians that were on it including Miles himself.  Many of the musicians on this record became super famous recording solo albums of similar music after this, and those albums are very successful.<br />Miles Davis is like the director in all of his CD's.  He creates a magical playground for the musicians to create beautiful feelings and then comes in with a few notes that make you instantly feel the entire song come together with a stunning feeling.  It's like the space shuttle taking off when this CD is in your player.  All the parts come together for what seems to be an impossible mission, but it works.  It works so well that almost half of every jazz thing that comes out since it is copying it.  And they just can't do it as well, nobody can.<br />This CD is hip, you won't like it if you aren't a creative person.  And seriously, who cares if you don't like it because that doesn't change how good it is.  Lots of people don't like Picasso because it looks all weird, but it's still Picasso and who cares if you don't like it.  But this is isn't just a still painting, it's a moving work of art that will force you into the back of your seat and you can never forget it.<br />You can't compare this album to anything else.  If it was the first Jazz Fusion CD, then think about it.  Why did everybody have to copy it?  Because it's permanent.  This is like Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix but it's Jazz, big jazz.  Very big...<br />You listen to it 200 times for the first time.
B000069AUI|1.0|I'll start by saying Coldplay has good sounding vocals for the most part. That said lets get to the heart of the matter. These guys don't know music. THe vocalest has carpultunal in his rist because of bad piano playing tecquenic.<br />The group has no Idea what the word syconpation means. Every song hits eather 8th notes concetetly or quarter notes concetstaly. A reacuring pattern I found is that their songs will be devide rhythmicly as 3, 3, 2. I find that rhythm intresting except for the fact that it is used in many of the songs in the album. Honnesty I was playing musicaly more complex stuff in middle school.<br />Another intresting fact is if you guys can guess it one song only has two chords that repeat the whole time. Don't you get bored. They don't even add inversions just repitition!!! The piano and drums might just have well been looped from the begaining to the end of the song.<br />THe chord progressions are nice at first, but wiht out any verations in harmony or counter point it gets boring.<br />Now about the mixing. The Guys did horribal. To much mid lows, plus way to much reverbe and you can't hear anything clearly. This I think is just to try to add more texture that the band members couldn't add with there musical abulities (or lack there of). If your spending so much money in the studio to have these guys edit and produce your music you better make shure that they didnt'get there degree in audio engenearing from a box of craker jacks.
B000067D8X|5.0|This DVD is worth every penny.  However, I recommend buying the complete series first season.  It contains this DVD plus all the episodes in season 1.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is the most amazing tribute/concert DVD I have ever seen.  I guess one would expect no less from producers and musical directors Jeff Lynne and Eric Clapton! Sorry, Dylan fans, Bob was not missed. <BR>I echo all the positive things that have been said to date, and can't recommend this DVD enough.  It is a wonderful example of George's ecclectic taste... from Python's \\"Sit On my Face\\" to Ravi Shankar's \\"Arpan\\". (The way HE composes and conducts is unbelievable!!!) <BR>So much talent gathered there.  And you really could \\"feel the love\\"... all the cracks about Paul \\"grandstanding\\" are unwarranted; it was up to Clapton when and where the musicians came in and I think he worked his magic perfectly. <BR>This DVD appeals to 3 generations, by the way:  I was a Beatles' fan, my daughter is a Harrison fan, and my dad just likes awesome music. Highly, highly recommended!
B000002U82|5.0|With `Dark Side', Pink Floyd takes us through a dreamy journey of music and sound masterfully crafted as an album that does not lose its mood or concept. It is pointless to pick favorite tracks, as the songs were parts of the whole concept rather than individual songs. It is no wonder why `Dark Side' stayed in the top 200 for years.
B000066NW0|4.0|My friend had this album on his computer and I decided to give it a listen and I must say its a pretty good album. Im not into much of todays music but Avril has an infectious voice and the melodies on the some of the songs were fabulous. I don't understand these people that say she cannot sing, she sounds like an Angel.
0375759174|4.0|When I was a kid, I loved to watch Wishbone, the terrier that used Classic Literature as a kind to life. One episode centered around Northanger Abbey. It was my favorite episode. I would play with my friends, that I was Wishbone, and my friend was the heroine, Catherine. That left me with a longing for the real thing. Well, the real thing is much better than the Wishbone version. Some may be surprised, but this is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Emma is second, and the P and P. I dunno, maybe it is that it is funny, or the suspense, but it is highly recommended.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Some soundtrack CDs come with a mix of songs and original score music.  This, unfortunately, isn't one of them, which is a shame as some hauntingly beautiful score music plays during several scenes.  I also share the views of other reviewers re missing songs by those who actually appeared in the film.
B00005Y7GQ|4.0|This movie was friggin hilarious. The plot basically goes down like this: An former soccer player (who is now a coach) recruits a kung fu master who believes that using kung fu to play soccer would be a smart thing to do. They go on to recruit other kung fu masters and the coach then teaches them the fundamentals of soccer. The movie then progresses to show them developing into an indestructable soccer team. The scenes worth watching are the definitely the soccer scenes which involve &quot;Matrix&quot; like special effects. This is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. If you can get your hands on this movie, I suggest that you don't pass it up.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore's score is very excellent.  Number 4 especially features some grand symphonic themes and perfectly captures the magisterial grandeur of Gondor.  However, there is a scene in the movie that I liked particulary when Pippin lights the beacons and there is lots of pretty mountain scenery.  If anyone knows when this is in the score (what track) please POST it.  I would be very happy.
0061015725|3.0|As usual, Crichton goes over the top a bit, but  that being expected, I wasn't disappointed with this story, it was a quick read and a page turner and basically a good story.  The ending had enough of a twist that it wasn't entirely predictable and the characters were interesting enough.  It won't come as a surprise to any that read Crichton that the story involves a situation that could never really happen, but is grounded in enough science and theory to challenge the readers imagination.<br />This story will undoubtedly be turned into a movie, there is an element of horror possible here and if the movie is done right, it could be pretty scary.  I recommend this to any that enjoy science fiction/fantasy type quick reading novels that haven't yet tried out the authors work.  If you already like his work, this book is not the mistake that the novel  Jurassic Park The Lost World is and is not quite as fantastic as the novel Timeline, if you have any interest in the world of nanotechnology it will be thought provoking at the least.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys is BACK!I loved this cd!  Every song is soulful and in every song she puts her all in her delivery.   IF I AIN'T GOT YOU has got to be THE song for this year!  It is being speculated that this is her new single -THANK GOD!  If you are reading these reviews, you HAVE to get this cd. If YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME alone does not make you get up and get this cd, then your nuts.  I went to her concert in San Fransisco and she blew me away!  IF I WERE YOUR WOMAN is delivered with as much feeling as Mrs. Gladys and Alicia makes it her own.  KARMA and SO SIMPLE are just funky and fun.  Every track brings you back to the days of true soul like Marvin Gaye and Aretha Franklin.  How dare some people say it's a step back.  Listen to the lyrics and you will find something that has been lacking in the music scene today-true unabashed emotion.  DIARY pulls at the heart and does not let go.  It may take you a couple of listens, but this cd will grow on you.
B0000640SA|5.0|Why oh why did this NOT win best Original Screenplay?  It's one of the most complex films to come out in recent memory and it loses?(I think it lost to Almost Famous, which was equally good). Anyway enough griping, this was innovative. A movie that starts you off with the last chronological event and working backwards. So imagine having Sleep, Dinner, School, Lunch, School, Breakfast in that order and you get the picture.<br />Leonard Shelby is tracking down his wife's murderer and rapist.  He fought with the assailant only to have his brain screwed with. See, he can remember everything up until the accident but everything afterwards disappears, like if he were to shower, 10 minutes later he'd literally forget he took one.  So to help him out, he takes pictures of places and pictures with notes in order to keep track of who's who and who to trust.  <br />It got quite a lot of attention due to the rather unorthodox way of showing a film(final scene first, first scene last in a time aspect), and also its twist at the end. Once it unfolds towards the end, you really see how the rest of the film came together...if you can remember it.  Problem with this kind of way of showing and also its benefit is that sometimes you forget how Leonard got to a particular place or why he was there, making the benefit of repeated viewings.<br />If you wanna work your brain for a change, instead of the &quot;jerking off the ego&quot; movies that have come out recently, give this one a watch.
B000001EKX|5.0|this album is sooooooooooooooooooo good. it's in my top 3 along with their debut and ALIVE! i have no clue why it gets such a bad rap. the song hotter than hell alone is worth the buy. so if this isn't currently in your collection, i recommend it.<br />by the way, referring to previous posters, SOUND QUALITY DOESN'T EFFECT HOW GOOD THE MUSIC IS.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Excellent fighting scenes, although the goodbye-Trinity-love-scene is a bit too long. Very good movie!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a huge fan of all things Joss Whedon, particularly Buffy, so I eagerly looked forward to the premiere of this show.  But it had a terrible timeslot, and I couldn't figure out what was going on, so I quickly gave up on it.  What a huge mistake!<br />Watching these shows on DVD, in the correct order, is a revelation! This is some of the best television ever, on par with and often exceeding the excellent Buffy, and miles better than Angel.  I don't think I have ever fallen in love with a show so quickly.  <br />The characters are endearing and true to life and the dialogue just sparkles.  This DVD features some of the finest writing on TV.  The actors are each pefect in their respective roles, with Nathan Fillion's Captain Mal Reynolds a particular standout.  So near the charming Han Soloish rogue, and yet he manages to make the character so much more.<br />Watch this DVD and you will fall in love.  With the writing, with the characters, with the overall show.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Such an unbelievable DVD! I bought this not sure of what to expect, and it has transformed me into a huge Coldplay fan! I went and bought both their albums, Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head. Both CD's are fabulous, and this DVD caps off a great collection of sounds.<br />The menu on the DVD is fabulously produced, and easy to use. The only complaint I had with the DVD is the camera work is a little too &quot;jumpy&quot; for my liking, I wish it would focus on each member of the band for a little longer.<br />Anyways, this sure is a great buy. The lighting in the show is incredible, whenever I watch Yellow I get shivers down my back. They way it explodes from dark blue, moody lighting to exciting yellow light is A-1.<br />Great buy, great DVD, great band! Highly reccomended. 5 Stars!
B000002UAU|5.0|Unlike most of the Beatle's records, Sgt. Pepper has few songs of the \\"singles\\" caliber (\\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" the exception).  It is, however, a fantastic recording.  I'm surprised to read other reviewers describe Sgt. Pepper as less than great.   Huh?<br />Sgt. Pepper was revolutionary.  Most other Beatles record were too, but this one, in particular, opened the world of pop music to something new as few had before.  I shan't list all the ways but, for starters, the Beatles used a variety of creative sounds and instruments (e.g., the circus songs in &quot;Mr. Kite&quot;, the Indian instruments in &quot;Within You Without You&quot;) in a fashion heretofore unheard of in pop records.  The movement of the songs from one to another, without a break, too, was new and unexpected.  <br />It may be fun to rate albums or to argue one is better than another but, when talking about the Beatles, I find it rather irrelevant.  Few songwriters before, then, or now, wrote songs like Lennon/McCartney and, with Harrison and Starkey's immeasurable contribution, the Beatles achieved a standard in popular music that no one else has touched.  So, what Beatles record is not a great record?  Sgt. Pepper is certainly not the least of the lot.  I'm not offended that someone rated it #1 all-time.  Who cares?  It's a great record.       <br />I've always felt a greater affinity with the music and personalities of Lennon and Harrison.  Nonetheless, McCartney was brilliant in many ways, and Sgt. Pepper arguably marks his greatest achievement.  To the extent that any Beatle had a greater influence on one of their records, McCartney's influence is on Sgt. Pepper, the same as, perhaps, Lennon's is on Hard Day's Night.   For one, McCartney wrote the majority of the songs.  \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" \\"Getting Better,\\" \\"Fixing a Hole,\\" \\"She's Leaving Home,\\" \\"When I'm 64\\" and \\"Lovely Rita\\" are distinctly his.  He probably wrote most of \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\"and also wrote the middle to \\"A Day in the Life.\\"   <br />Sgt. Pepper was probably the first sure evidence of McCartney's schmaltzy taste, e.g., \\"When I'm 64\\".  But it's undeniably a well-done song.  I love \\"Lovely Rita\\"--especially his lead vocal, and the background vocals.  \\"Fixing a Hole\\" is a nice daydream song.  And those who can't relate to \\"She's Leaving Home\\" maybe have forgotten how they felt as teenagers. <br />For a guitar band, the guitars don't have a heavy presence on this record, although Harrison has a fabulous but short solo on \\"Good Morning.\\"  Also, for the first time, we hear Lennon using a lot of distortion on his guitar, as he would in the years to come, in the opening song.   But McCartney's bass really stands out.  Listen how it shapes most of the songs, e.g., the middle of Day in the Life where he sings, \\"Woke up, got outta bed\\"-and the bass simulates the movement in the lyrics. It seems he really started to stretch out as a musician on this one-not that he wasn't already great in that respect.  <br />What is not well done on Sgt. Pepper?   After years of listening to their songs there are a few instances where I'd wished they'd produced a song differently.  \\"Good Morning\\" is a good example.  According to George Martin, Lennon was obsessed with changing the sound of his voice.  Perhaps that's why this song is so horribly compressed.  His voice sounds like it's coming out of a box and all the instrumentation out of a hole in the ground.  If you listen to the Anthology version of this song you can actually hear him playing guitar, with distinct and pretty chord changes, as he knew how to write and play so well.    <br />The makers of the CD version made the very unfortunate choice of including the after track-the bit you'd get on vinyl if you had a record player that went all the way to the end of the label.  It wasn't meant for CD, it sounds like someone's nightmare, and it should never have been included.  <br />To end on a positive note, \\"With a Little Help From my Friends,\\" despite it's sometimes obscure lyrics, is an anthem for the 60's and, really, even today.  Who hasn't felt \\"I just need someone to love\\"  \\"I want somebody to love\\" and,  \\"I just get by with help from my friends?\\"  It's also Ringo's single greatest vocal and doesn't it just make you feel good?
B000002OCP|4.0|Aside from the pointless meandering of &quot;She's Alright,&quot; this isn't a bad album. It certainly isn't the Holy Grail of blues, but it isn't as bad as Waters or the critics say it is. <br />In case you don't know, Muddy Waters, in 1968, wasn't making any more hits. In a desperate attempt, Chess Records decided to put him with some avant-garde jazz musicians and make a Jimi Hendrix like album.<br />It's not that bad. I Just Want To Make Love To You fits in perfectly with Are You Experienced, and I really like Mannish Boy. Let's Spend The Night Together is quite good, even though everyone disagrees with me. The only song I hated was She's Alright, which went on and on with pointless soloing, and an instrumental version of &quot;My Girl.&quot;<br />I'm sure Muddy was really pissed off that he couldn't make a real blues album, but this is ok. Then again, I always liked the electric blues of the 60s. Listen first, then buy it if you like it.
B00009XITQ|3.0|This movies mainly about her and her father and is more on the serious side than the humorous side; If your looking for lots of humor w/ Bynes I'd highly recommend \\"What I Like About You\\" [...]  1003,00.html Lets just hope the DVD comes out.. But hey if you want to see Bynes in action watch this movie.. Has some occasional laughs worth watching for
B000089RVX|1.0|My friends kept on telling me about this band on the Daredevil movie called Evanescence. They said it was really heavenly vocals over really heavy metal. I thought, cool. This sounds like something for me. A lot of bands I like have calm vocals over hard rck. (Queens Of The Stone Age, Cream, Masters Of reality)<br />EH! Wrong!<br />What we have here is yet another trendy, wannabe goth metal band that sounds too much like Linkin Park, Korn, Staind, the list goes on. This would've been cool if:<br />A.The lyric wirter could've spent more time on the lyrics. (Save me from the nothing I've become? Heard it a million times, my friend!)<br />B.The music had texture, and not a few chords meshed together to make a song.<br />C.NO RAPPING!<br />Anyway, I had hopes for this band. If you do like goth music, try Bauhaus, inventors of goth, or The Cure. Don't listen to this. It's not worth your money.
0385504209|3.0|Thank God it's not just me! I thought this book had a great premise, but was such an insult to the reader's intelligence. I felt like I was 17 again, reading a Sidney Sheldon novel. Dan Brown must think the average reader is a sheer idiot. He spends several pages at a time uncovering what are supposed to be clever plot twists (the tracking device in the bar of soap, the &quot;semitic&quot; writing that baffles the supposedly erudite characters). It's no fun reading a book when you're several pages ahead of the author. I put it down with 50 pages left and don't care what happened. Several hours wasted that I will never get back!
630522577X|5.0|George Cukor's 1964 \\"My Fair Lady\\" won various awards during the Oscars of its time, including Best Picture. George Cukor, famed for directing what society dubbs \\"women's films\\" (The Women, etc) and a homosexual director at that managed to produce a great film version of the Broadway musical.  It is said that the role of Liza Doolittle made Audrey Hepburn a star. Audrey's fay looks and gamine charms are a deep contrast to the imperious, mysoginstic and even callous Professor Higgins. The musical was first staged in London and later on New York City's Broadway with Julie Andrews in the role of Eliza Doolittle, the role she first introduced into the musical world. In this film, Marni Nixon, another Broadway singer, dubbed for Audrey Hepburn's acting.<br />There is much to like about this musical, now on an impressive DVD. Bonus features include commentary by Marni Nixon herself and an audio track that features Audrey Hepburn's attempt to sing the songs herself. There is also a special short documentary on the making of the film. Sit back and get ready to enjoy a fine musical transposed into a wonderful, aesthetically sattisfying film. Highlights include \\"The Rain In Spain\\" in which Higgins has managed to make the illiterate urchin with bad English sound clear and regial.
B00005JKN9|2.0|This material would seem to be perfectly suited to Scorsese's talents. Unfortunately, the result is a big disappointing mess. Set in the slums of lower Manhattan during the early 1860s, the movie is supposed to chronicle the gang warfare that plagued mid-19th-century New York City and the political machinations of Boss Tweed, who played hardball ethnic politics and cleverly pitted the Catholic immigrants against the native Protestants. As I said, right up Scorsese's alley. <br />Instead what we get is a tired, trite, overlong cornball melodrama about a young man (an out-of-place Leonardo DiCaprio) attempting to avenge the murder of his father by infiltrating a rival gang and \\"befriending\\" the leader (an over-the-top Daniel Day Lewis) who killed Leo's dad. Leo waits (and waits, and waits...) for just the right moment to strike. But complications ensue when fatherless Leo begins to develop filial feelings for his nemesis. Will Leo ever work up the nerve to slaughter his new surrogate dad? Will new surrogate dad find out Leo's secret? Meanwhile, the Civil War and the New York City Draft Riots are brewing. <br />Although the costumes and set designs are impressive, and some of the scenes are spectacularly shot, the movie bogs down again and again in fifth-hand melodramatic plot devices and outrageous ham acting. Particularly egregious is the usually outstanding Daniel Day Lewis (as the arch-villain Bill the Butcher), who must have decided that this movie was so ridiculous anyway that the only thing to do was stand out by giving us the hammiest damn performance ever put on celluloid. Twirling his waxed moustachio, sporting a garish glass eye, and chopping up everything in sight with his trademark meat clever, Lewis is funny as hell, but not remotely credible.<br />The ending is so bogus and strained, it would qualify the movie as pure camp, were it not for the offensive way it turns the horrendous 1863 race riots and mass lynchings into just another plot point--and a particularly ludicrous one at that.<br />What a missed opportunity by a great director! The growing pains of 19th-century New York City is a great subject, and the story of Tammany Hall and the Draft Riots is one of the most interesting and important in American history. Scorsese would seem to be the ideal director to tell this story. But he decided instead to make a turgid, corny, anachronistic, flashy (and flaccid) three-hour music video & costume drama. What a waste!<br />If you want to see a good movie about generations of gang warfare in the slums, check out the 2003 Brazilian film \\"City of God.\\" It should be coming out on DVD soon. It's what \\"Gangs of New York\\" should have been.
B000069AUI|5.0|Rush of Blood to the Head is arguably one of the greatest albums ever created. It engages the mind and the heart in a wonderful emotional experience that exhilarates the soul. If I could only listen to one album for the rest of my life, this would be the one. Forget Prozac, Illicit Drugs, or Alcohol--this album is intoxicating on its own.
B00007LTIB|4.0|&quot;Relayer&quot; is probably one of Yes's most overlooked albums.  The shame of it is I think it's one of their best.  Rick Wakeman left to pursue a really bad solo career &amp; so the Yesmen added Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz to create a truly progressive album (as if their previous ones weren't...).<br />This three song album opens with a whopping 20+ minute diatribe against war/armed conflict called &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot;.  It opens almost with a folksy feel and moves into the &quot;heart&quot; of the song with obvious aural allusions to warfare and insanity in the background.  Yes masterfully and tactfully renders the listener stunned with offbeat rhythmn and time changes, granular and dissonant chords, and beautifully crafted lyrics.  One drawback could be the sheer length of the piece.  Yes released the last section of the song (quite ethereal, with a touch of slide guitar) as a single simply titled &quot;Soon&quot;.<br />Next is &quot;Sound Chaser&quot;.  Lyrically I'm not sure what Jon Anderson was trying to say, but the music is first rate.  For an album recorded in 1973-74, the musicianship and daring these men possessed was amazing.  The song, simply put, is FAST.  I know, I know, &quot;fast&quot; doesn't always mean &quot;good&quot;, but in this case it does.  Chris Squire's bass and Steve Howe's guitar work quite well together, despite the incredible speed of the tempo.  Don't forget Alan White's witty drum intro for the song.  A drawback for some is that the piece is quite &quot;busy&quot;.  You may not want to listen to this one if you are already stressed...<br />Lastly is &quot;To Be Over&quot; - My favorite of the three.  It is a very lazy, atmospheric piece underscoring the song's title.  It opens with a single guitar line and builds up (by adding a sitar and Squire's bass) to a really groovy, slow-paced song with lots of textures.  If ever a song could create a mood, this one could.  Every time I listen to this one, it makes me feel as if I'm either floating in water or reclining in a cloud about a mile above the earth.  It is so relaxing...I truly can't find a meaningful fault with this last song.<br />A highly recommended album from the godfathers of prog.l as if I'm either floating in water or reclining in a cloud about a mile above the earth.

0790729369|5.0|It has been years since I have seen this movie and came across it on cable tonight and had to order the book and the DVD.   I enjoyed the movie years ago and totally understood the idea of true love and soulmates.  I can totally relate to the movie and can see how when you meet the &quot;one&quot; person, there is no denying love and time is not a timetable.  <br />This was indeed a movie that expresses the love of two people and the strength it takes to walk away from it to do the right thing.
0451191153|5.0|My reviews generally focus on novels and non-fiction works dealing with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, genetics and the like rather than sixty year old novels, but Rand's ideas will become even more important - and controversial -- in the coming decades.  Although she has pushed objectivism to an untenable extreme, she is still the most relevant and important philosopher of our time and will remain so through the first half of this century.  Why?  Because scientists will incorporate her ideas into the new minds, both human and artificial, made possible by these rapidly evolving technologies.<br />Ayn Rand is a great but flawed philosopher.  Her Howard Roark is one the most admirable and terrifying characters to appear in any novel: a man of rigid, absolute principles; of talent and determination; and of intellect and emotion.  Also a man who will stop at nothing, even violence, to gain his objectives; who cares not a whit about the needs of others, even his paying clients; who regards virtually all of humanity as parasites, living off the abilities of men such as himself.  Roark could be a great man; he could also be a monster.  These strengths will be attractive to many, leading science to develop methods to enhance our machines and our genes.  The latter will be particularly attractive: who wouldn't want these characteristics for your child? The genetic inheritance of Howard Roark will be engineered into our genes, but which ones?  And where would such men take us?<br />The Fountainhead is a great read as fiction, and Rand challenges us with her ideas.  Rather than fading into the background, such powerful ideas become more important as time moves on.
B00008AWOG|5.0|I struggled mightily with this album when I bought it back in 1999; I had, quite literally, never heard anything that even vaguely sounded like it before. For some, Opeth is something of an acquired taste, and this album was what eventually got me hooked, and it remains the album I lend to people curious about the band. Though &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; is probably a better album, &quot;Still life&quot; showcases Opeth better than any other of their discs.<br />Starting off with &quot;The Moor&quot;, the album tells the story of a man who comes to a theocratically ruled society, searching for a woman (&quot;Face of Melinda&quot;) and ends up being hanged (&quot;White Cluster&quot;) after stepping on the toes of the wrong people. Thus, Åkerfeldt stays with his established gloomy lyrical themes. However, &quot;Still Life&quot; is a musical treasure chest, far more varied in its content than it predecessor. Though &quot;My arms, your hearse&quot; is a fabulous album, it is mostly a thrash-it-out effort. Here, however, none of the songs are entirely hard, something that makes its still-plentiful mosh parts all the more effective. &quot;Still life&quot; is the album where Opeth finally mastered the art of pacing; though it is a less accessible album than &quot;MA,YH&quot;, the rewards for sticking around are immense.<BR> <BR>The atmospheric opener &quot;The Moor&quot; might not be Opeth's finest, but is has a poppy chorus and a well-crafted riff structure, and sets the scene for the showstoppers that follow. &quot;Godhead's lament&quot; is simply awesome, with its clinical intricacies and brooding lyrics, while &quot;Benighted&quot; and, especially, &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; are good, atmospheric ballads. However, the main event is the knockout &quot;Moonlapse Vertigo&quot;, with its colossal riffs, catchy melodies and awe-inspiring vocals - witness Åkerfeldt's vocal transformation from polite crooner to rabid dinosaur when the guitars go from acoustic to full distortion. It might very possibly be Opeth's best song, and is easily worth three stars alone. The unrelentingly punishing &quot;Serenity Painted Death&quot; and the sophisticated closer &quot;White Cluster&quot; are good, powerful death/thrash tunes that round out an excellent, if rather demanding album.<br />&quot;Still life&quot; is a bit of an litmus test. If you like it, you'll probably like all the other Opeth albums as well. If you don't, you might still love the viceral intensity of &quot;MA,YH&quot; or the cool sophistication of &quot;Damnation&quot;, depending on your temperament. But don't take my word for it; instead, check it out. You will not be sorry.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Most of the people leaving &quot;1 star&quot; ratings are just doing so because of technical mix ups. Please don't be fooled into thinking this film and the two other films are anything short of amazing. While you may walk out of a viewing of this unsure of whether you think it was all that great, when you look at the story as a whole with all three films you realize how great it really is. I am not putting 5 stars because of all the hard work Peter Jackson did or anyone else for that matter. This gets 5 stars from me because I enjoyed it immensely.<br />As to those questioning the extended version's length as compared to the original: International Movie Database ([...]) has this posted Runtime: 179 min / USA:222 min (special extended edition) So there's you're 40+ minutes of additional footage.
B00006SFBD|5.0|In some ways, &quot;Deliverance&quot; is Opeth's most unified and straightforward album. Though imbued with the trademark Opeth dynamism, the songs have impressive riff economy and stay tightly focused - no mean feat for a fistful of 13-minute songs. At the same time, however, &quot;By the pain I see in others&quot; might be the most experimental song the boys have yet recorded. Similarly, the previous unifying lyrical concepts are gone. So, as is the norm with Opeth, nothing is quite as it seems.<br />What does remain, however, is their traditional excellence in songwriting. Though opener &quot;Wreath&quot; is deceptively &quot;simple&quot; with its looped sledgehammer riffs, it contains enough nuances to keep the listener on his toes. Together with the awesome title track, it serves to showcase the skills (and leg stamina. Does this guy never tire?) of drummer Martin Lopez, while the Morbid Angel-esque &quot;Masters apprentices&quot; allows Mikael Åkerfeldt to show off his vocal development. His voice is similarly used to great effect in the afforementioned &quot;By the pain...&quot; - death snarls over acoustic guitars are certainly an interesting novelty. The last song, the mellow &quot;A fair judgement&quot;, is quite simply beautiful; though not quite as good as &quot;To bid you farewell&quot; off the &quot;Morningrise&quot; album, it is still one of Opeth's top ballads. The contrast to its neighbouring songs - &quot;Deliverance&quot; and Masters...&quot; could not have been greater; this is the kind of light and shade that only Opeth can provide.<br />In summary, this album is pretty much a dream come true,down to the brooding and vaguely menacing cover art. The only quibble I have is that &quot;By the pain...&quot; is too long; they could have dropped the meaningless and overly proggy last five minutes, and the song would have benefitted greatly. However, that is minor stuff. A both achingly beautiful and brutally pummeling album, &quot;Deliverance&quot; isa must-have.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Well, my aunt suggested this and hey i gave it a whirl just to entertain myself one night while my social life had come to a hault. It was exactly what I was expecting. A teen horror flick with a few good scares but nothing really WORTH seeing. <br />We meet up with a brother and sister driving home for vacation. It's obvious that they have squalling problems and that they don't get along the best but (unlike the sequel) the acting is convincing and pretty good. Well the two are almost run off the road by a maniac in a rusted truck and soon find a strange (man?) dumping bodies down a sewer behind a church and the brother wants to explore and finds hundreds of bodies stitched together and hung all over the walls and cieling. Then the 2 find themselves being hunted by the Creeper. <br />Interesting twists make this movie a fun ride but a slow and at times boring one. A sequal, at the time, wasn't needed of even wanted by some, but a sequal is what this movie called for. It took this movie to the next level. Still this is the origional and though it was okay, it could have been better. Reccommended only to benifit purposes of understanding the sequal.
B000000OQF|5.0|im not gonna bore you with a long reveiw fll of useless facts i just wanna tell you my oppinion on this cd. i think that it is f***ing awesome. i love every song on this cd. this cd really made me love guns n roses. they are almost as good as my favorite band, Aerosmith
B000059PPN|1.0|If i could take the 1 star out of 5 of my rating,i would do it,but i cant.<BR>Cutting to the chase.<BR>Worst horror movie of all time.<BR>I prefer watching the TV episodes of goosebumps with my kids, then buying that fulci fart.<br />U been warned
B00009TB5G|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie and the entire trilogy.  I have purchased both the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers extended editions and have yet to be disappointed.  I can't wait to see the results of The Return of the King extended edition!  If you have hesitated to purchase this item before, DO NOT DELAY AS YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  I'm just sorry that it has to end.
B00005JL3A|1.0|The director of Resident evil, Mr Paul Anderson is a huge dissapointment to CAPCOM, the grey coloured playstation console and not forgeting the Resident evil fans world wide.<br />Now let me explain, why R.E is a dissapointment.<br />HISTORY OF THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT<br />The basic reasons are Paul anderson preffered writing his own script by adding additions in the movie which never exsisted in the game itself. <BR>Before Paul anderson wasted his ink and paper on writing his script.There was a director of the name George.A.romeo.<BR>He is the genious behind the zombie movies such as Day of the dead.His R.E script wasnt approved because he wrote the names of the real characters in his script. This is when Anderson was transferred and decided to change the whole script by using everything in his little imagination.<br />NO ORIGINAL CHARACTERS AND STORY<br />So how can this movie be a success, if the director cant even create the original characters of the game and get the authentic storyline. Not one original character is present in the movie, which is a huge dissapointment to the fans and CAPCOM's unappreciated efforts of creating the brilliant characters.<br />NO HORROR<br />The other major dissapointment is that the zombies and dogs looked pathetic, which i found more real terror in the 32bit game itself.<BR>The movie should be aimed at children who enjoy watching goosebumps instead of being aimed at ages above 15.<br />SPEND YOUR MONEY WISELY<br />I would recomend you R.E fans or just horror lovers to think twice before buying this movie. If you are a R.E fan you are better off buying the resident evil comics, because the story and characters are related to the game.If you are a zombie horror fan, i recomend you to buy movies directed by George.A.romero and Fulci, thats the real stuff to get full satisfaction from your hard working money.<br />REMEMER,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
B0000AXE8I|4.0|This DVD has more action and adventure but what about the original story we have seen in the first film.  I think that this storyline is losing itself in all of the action (which is plentiful and entertaining)and in the end we will be left a bit disappointed.
B0000CDL3W|3.0|Terminator 3 does an average job of attempting to explain itself. There is both a prologue and epilogue that attempts to explain and link this movie with the other Terminators. We get to learn of how the world came to be in the future, and how, after visited by another T-101, John Connor is now the new leader to try to save the world from the rise of the machines. He meets up with Kate Brewster (Clair Danes) through a series of events and she also learns her role in the future of mankind. <br />I didn't really go into this movie believing it would be much, but was pleasantly surprised with some of the acting, action sequences and plot. However, as usual in action movies, some of the chase scenes were dragged out incredibly long. I think if this movie would have focused more on building a solid story line through building the characters it would have made for a more effective story. <br />One thing that definitely was a negative was the character of John Connor. He comes across as a whiny, Generation X slacker type that no one watching feels sorry for. He seems to spend his time feeling sorry for himself and complaining about having to lead mankind. He tends to become an irksome point of the movie, and hardly fits the description of &quot;hero.&quot; If they would have made him a stronger character I think it would have vastly improved the script.<br />Still, Terminator 3 is a fun movie. Sequels are definitely one of the hardest types to make successful, and I believe that Terminator 3 succeeds, albeit in a &quot;ho-hum&quot; way. <br />Recommended if you take it in with a relatively open mind.
B000099T2L|3.0|this cd was ok. Beyonce has a great voice, and she's very pretty, and she does have some great songs. But, some of the songs on her cd were kinda dumb.
0060922583|5.0|this book is not about science or the new age or even about a holographic universe. talbot is appealing to a meta-genre: that of finding the pupetteer behind the show. also in this category are: castaneda's &quot;the fire within,&quot; spengler's &quot;the decline of the west,&quot; shlain's &quot;the alphabet and the goddess.&quot; <BR>the premise is the basic theme of &quot;the wizard of oz&quot;: that there is a different, simpler, frequently anti-intuitive explanation to the dynamic of reality. whatever fits our current working model (modern science) we call rational and apply to support the status quo. talbot however turns to the paranormal not as a rejection of the working model we call rationale but an enhancement or expansion of it. in short, talbot's model seeks to subsume the rational by using science (NOT pseudo-science) to explain how seemingly &quot;unscientific&quot; principles could be just as 'real' as basic aspects of reality, such as gravity. phenomena such as stigmata or clairvoyance (which Western minds such as Jung and Schopenhauer have long trumpeted) become a part of the _same_ reality as the conservation of momentum and the boiling point of water at sea level.<BR>this book is about synthesizing the accepted and the paranormal into one beautiful understanding of one beautiful universe. for, if there is a truth to be understood, must it not reflect both the rational and irrational if it is to reflect the cosmos we live everyday?
0790743213|5.0|Marvelous old film with Cary Grant, who really made very few truly bad movies.  It's a romance, it's a comedy, it's a thriller - three genres that only someone of Alfred Hitchcock's myriad talents could pull off so well. Grant plays an ad exec who the enemy mistakes for an undercover agent; when he realizes the bad guys are after him with intent to do serious bodily harm, he of course takes off running, leaps onto a train, and meets Eva Marie Saint. Romance ensues amid continuing skullduggery. There are several unforgettable scary thriller scenes, including the chase by a plane in the middle of a cornfield and the final beauty on the face of Mt. Rushmore - and the final, final scent back on the train with EM Saint.<BR>Top notch entertainment that never gets old.
B00004SCX6|5.0|&quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; is another Britney album by Britney Spears! The tracks on here, are quite different from her first debut, &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;!<br />01) &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;- Oops!...This song is so cool!<br />02) &quot;Stronger&quot;- I can't help feeling as if this song is a sequel to &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;.<br />03) &quot;Dont Go Knockin' On My Door&quot;- A hip-hop vibe to this song, is just the kind of thing that makes this song on this album, great.<br />04) &quot;(Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot;- A remake of the Rolling Stones song.<br />05) &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot;- A romantic kind of song that is nice and slow. Really good. <br />06) &quot;What U See (Is What U Get)&quot;- A pop music kind of vibe, and is abosolutely a good song.<br />07) &quot;Lucky&quot;- My most favorite song on this album of all time!!! I just ABSOLUTELY love this song, totally!!! This song is my #1 favorite on this album! It's so cute and so sweet!<br />08) &quot;One Kiss From You&quot;- I love this song. This song is sweet and wonderful, kind of like the song, &quot;Lucky&quot;, and this song is terrific pop song!<br />09) &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;- This song is alright.

I love the beats!<br />11) &quot;When Your Eyes Say It&quot;- Cute pop song that's romantic and lovely. <br />12) &quot;Dear Diary&quot;- A good song to end this album.<br />Good album!
B000062XGJ|5.0|Predator was one of the first movies re-released on DVD, and as such, it lacks a lot of the &quot;extras&quot; that most of the more recent DVDs offer.  All you get here is the full-length full-screen movie, which is enough, I guess, but I would've loved to listen to some audio commentary from Arnold or director John McTiernan or even a few words from the Predator himself :)  Some &quot;making of&quot; stuff would've also been a nice addition.  Plus, there's also some historical significance here that can't be ignored:  I mean, you have not one, but TWO future governors in the cast!  Wouldn't it have been great to have Governor Schwarzengger and Governor Ventura talking candidly about what they went through to make this movie and what they've been through since?  Well, maybe someday Fox will release a DELUXE multi-disk DVD of Predator and it will include all of the above and even more.  (How about a &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; feature that'll tell us what in the world happened to Sonny Landham.)
B000088E6D|5.0|If you asked me how I'd rate this cd I'd say &quot;PERFECT!&quot; <BR>Elaborate, rich and tasteful production (David Foster is a master) an ususual but classic selection of songs all done to the highest standards. Add Michael's voice and you have a masterpiece. Really, it's a classic example of the best arrangements, best musicians and by far the best new vocalist in the world.  <BR>Perfect!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's CD Chariot gives listeners something they haven't gotten much of lately. His words are very down to earth and real. Though compared much to Jason Mraz and John Mayer, his words aren't cliche and he has written all his songs. His CD is also inexpensive and every song on it is wonderful. It's one of few CDs in this world that is worth the money. It's a feel good CD. Songs such as Just Friends and Follow Through top my list of favorites on Gavin's CD, but the rest of them are at a close second. His song I dont wanna be is one of the first songs that I have heard lately that say, I'm just me and I don't wanna be anyone else. He's comfortable with who he is and that makes him an individual.
B000002UJQ|1.0|I had to literally hold back vomit 10 seconds into this cd. I was afraid that I had somehow been infected by this trash and had to cleanse myself by listening to N*Sync. Only people trying to look sophisticated will buy this album. (look at meeee. I listen to radiohead...I'm sooooo coool!!) Thom Yorke tries so hard to imitate Avril Lavigne, yet fails so miserably. If you want a good album, buy any of N*Sync, Justin, Britney, Avril...you know, good music. I would give this a negative infinity stars if I could.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Have to say that out of all the CD's that I bought this year, that this one is my favourite and probably the most underrated album of 2003.  Whilst I feel that a lot of pressure was put on Cornell and Co to produce a great album by being dubbed the new 'Superband', I felt they lived up to this demand by making an understated but great rock album.  Certain tracks that stand out are the haunting Like a Stone, I am the Highway and Set it Off.  Cochise is the first single and a catalyst for the album. Although it could be described as a rip off of Zepplins Whole Lotta Love, it has all the vital ingredients of a top song and contains more kick then Chester City Football Team.  I would reccomend this album to my friends and if you're thinking of buying it go ahead as Audioslave is probably the group that have done the rock industry proudest this year and will continue to do for some time.
B00009TB5G|5.0|When &quot;Fellowship of the Ring's&quot; extended edition came out it was every Tolkien fan's and fantasy lover's dream. The added minutes might not have worked in the cinema (where countless people don't want to know every detail about hobbits and their everyday life), but they certainly helped to flesh out the story even more.<br />And now &quot;The Two Towers&quot; extended edition, the most waited DVD of 2003, is finally out with an amazing 40 additional minutes that you can only love. In the first cut of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; it seemed that during the first half Jackson didn't dear or want to give Gollum long moments to speaks and act. Well, guess what? The first extended scene involves a short monologue that foreshadows some of the greatest inner battles in cinema's history. <br />Then more brutality is given to the orcs and finding of Theoden's son is shown. Definitely the best extended scenes involve Faramir and Eowyn. Miranda Otto shows us that she can sing as well as act with a heart-wrenching dirge sung at Theodred's funeral. The added scenes also add to the relationship between Eowyn and Aragorn (as well as some funny moments). Faramir, whose character has been changed the most from his bookform, is given more screen time in flashback/dream sequences that also feature Boromir who was killed during the final confrontation of the first movie. The added scenes help us to understan the difficult relations between the two brothers and their father, the Steward of Gondor.<br />And to top the cake with a cherry, almost 10 minutes have been added to the end of the movie. Showing the aftermath of Helm's Deep battle (the revenge of Huorns) and an extended destruction of Isengaard. Plus, of course, the scene where Merry and Pippin find the food and pipeweed cellars of Saruman. <br />The rest of the discs continue the Rings tradition of offering a breathtaking array of information about the making of the movies, choosing the actors, creating the effects, and staying true to the books. One of the best behind-the-scenes looks of all time.<br />I have to say that I have been a Tolkien fan since childhood but I also must confess that I enjoy Jackson's movies even more than the original books. To me the extended editions are the best Christmas gift and I sure hope that some years from now XXL-deluxe-editions will be released where every movie is 5 hours long.<br />Overall, it is understandable why the added scenes were left out from the theatrical cut, but they sure do make the movie even better. This DVD is a must-buy!
B00008US8R|5.0|I too am a fan of heavy rock and punk music and first heard of Evanesence on the Daredevil soundtrack.  My husband bought me this album and I was dubious at first as I believed that they would be a one hit wonder and plunge into obscurity while at the same time being hyped as a 'nu metal band'...how wrong I was.  It only took one listen for me to fall in love with the album which could be described to anyone who hasn't listened to it as merging goth, metal and classical to produce melodic and experimental songs with true meaning.  Songs that stand out are the beautiful My Immortal, Torniquet and Going Under.  I enjoyed every song on the album and unlike some other bands of this genre it didn't contain any fillers.  I would recommend this album to anybody who is interested in heavy music and for those who would like to buy something a little different.  It also hit a positive note in the way that the music was true to it's roots, but didn't feel the need or necessity to show anger in a negative way or be littered with profanities.
B0000DZEA1|3.0|Just like the first two, this is a gorgeous score and I love everything on it. I have one big quibble, though, which is that the CD is heavy on the tear-jerking sad tunes and very light on the herioc music. The track entitled &quot;Ride of Rohirrim&quot; has none of the stirring battle charge music from the incredible scene in the film, but rather is a short montage of sad melodies with only hints of the Rohan theme, my favorite from the trilogy. Much of the uplifting music from the film is missing; buy this CD only if you're willing to sink into the dark side of the films and miss the heroics. That said, it is beautiful music and worth having.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by &quot;Terminator 3:Rise Of The Machines&quot;, especially with it's eerie, yet oddly poetic,ending. It also leaves the door open for future sequels, though I think it's time for Arnold Schwarzenegger, who simply looks too old and tired to be in this role, to annoint a new CSM-101(would The Rock be perfect, or what?)should there be a &quot;Terminator 4&quot;. <br />Overall, this film is the weakest of the three, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, given the earlier two films fixture as science fiction classics, not to mention introducing some of the greatest one-liners in movie history. The &quot;Talk To The Hand&quot; line in &quot;T3&quot; is humorous, but may have been more relevant circa 1996 than 2003. Schwarzenegger is still a fine cyborg, but it's hard to get past the fact he was 55 when &quot;T3&quot; was filmed (nor is any explanation offered in the film as to why the CSM-101 appears so much older than the previous incarnation). The supporting cast is solid- Nick Stahl's performance as John Connor is better than Edward Furlong's in &quot;T2&quot;. Claire Danes-all grown up since most of us last saw her in the TV Series &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;- plays the part of damsel in distress-turned tough chic as well as Linda Hamilton did in the 1984 original. The evil terminator- known alternately as the &quot;Terminatrix&quot; or &quot;T-X&quot;, isn't as convincing, although actress Kristanna Loken looks nice. She just doesn't have much to do, except occasionally harass Ah-nold and crew. Robert Patrick's &quot;T-1000&quot; in the second film was far creepier.<br />Without James Cameron(who apparently thought executive producing the TV show &quot;Dark Angel&quot; was a better idea than directing this film), Jonathan Mostow does a pretty good job of keeping a balance between the action and comedic moments, as well as overseeing a climactic end which I did not see coming. I would be ok with Mostow directing &quot;T4&quot;, shouldthere be one. Think of &quot;Terminator 3&quot; as &quot;Terminator Lite&quot;- looks great but a bit less filling than the previous two.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I'm bewildered by some early reviews which seem to convey Seabiscuit's using  &quot;Ken Burns type naration&quot; as a negative. What other vehicle could present the sub stories better? What I saw was a phenomenon put in perspective of the Great Depression. Rooting for the underdog, having something to believe in. I found it interesting that the US and state governments had basically banned horse racing around the turn of the century, only to breathe life back into it to generate tax money by taxing wagering. My copy of Seabiscuit included the book that the movie was based on. Between the movie and the book, I have a new appreciation of both the jockies and the horses as atheletes. I've never really been too interested in horseracing. I've always been drawn to stories of courage, winning against the odds, etc. The hardships people are willing to endure.<BR>I mentioned Laura Hillenbrand's captivating bestseller, which the movie is based on. At some point before or after watching the film, read her book. It fills in the story in a way that no movie can. It's my belief that no movie can be better than the book it's based on. <BR>The actors all did a superb job making the story believable. William Macy, Bridges et al. Specific roles have been discussed in other reviews.<BR>I must say that I just recently started buying DVDs and of course have purchased or rented most of the new releases. None have had as good a story to tell. Maybe more special effects, explosions, etc. but Seabiscuit still holds it's own.<BR>I'm happy with this purchase.AND I don't have any problems letting my young son watch it.<BR>John Row
B00008I8IF|5.0|This is the Jayhawks second best album, behind only Hollywood Town Hall. If you were a fan from the Hollywood Town Hall era and have been less than impressed with the last few albums, take the chance and get this one. If you can still get the version with the bonus disc, do so; it is surprisingly good (unusual for extra alternate and live tracks often found on such &quot;bonus&quot; discs, in my experience).
B000003S2K|5.0|We use to play this record around 5:30 am when the sun was rising.<BR>This was such wonderful sunrise music, also especially <BR>comforting for a mind that had been up all night on LSD.
B0000A36J5|4.0|I would just like to add a comment about a small part of the documentary features.  At the beginning of the first appendix, Colin Duriez, in a discussion of the friendship between Lewis and Tolkein, claims that C.S. Lewis was an atheist.  I knew this to be false and I wondered how such a whopper could have made it into the DVD.  I did some research and found that Tolkein was instrumental in lewis' conversion back to Christianity.  Clearly this statement by Colin Duriez was part of a longer interview that the editors of the DVD did not include.  Considering that C.S. Lewis spent most of his professional life writing directly or allegorically in defense of Christianity, to include such a statement, taken out of context and unexplained, in the final version of the DVD undermines the credibility of the scholarship about Tolkein presented elsewhere.  I know it is a small point but, even a cursory look into the life of C.S. Lewis should have made the editors realize that claiming Lewis to be an atheist, without further explanation, is incredibly misleading and is a disservice to both Mr. Lewis and Mr. Duriez.
B00000634J|4.0|I am a beatles fan, but i prefer lennons music than paul's. The songs on this album are great, especially instant karma, #9 dream, jealous guy, imagine, starting over and etc. but i hoped it included another 2 songs ,crippled and how do you sleep. I like this album because there will no longer be a need for me to purchase all of his albums. Im saying that its almost perfect because it is not perfect (duh). I am a fan of lennon's music but personally i dont like lennons attitude, I think he is self righteous and sometimes preachy. If your looking for a perfect solo album from the beatles get George harrison's &quot;all things must pass&quot;. But this is good too, and much cheaper, you know what, just get them both.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I adore this music, it makes me so happy, every single song! I can listen to it over and over and the lyrics and rhythms bring something new everytime.  Gavin better keep getting bigger and bigger, because i want MORE!
B000063JZQ|5.0|While Branagh may have pretty much held the top place for bringing the most Shakespeare productions to the silver screen, it is still Roman Polanski who has the best production of the lot. This is Macbeth in all its violent and bloody glory, the way it was meant to be seen!
B0000027RL|5.0|After all the horrible music of the 80s, overplayed pop and hair metal bands were getting the dinosaur treatment. The upcoming generation had nothing to look forward to, no real music that could take them anywhere.<br /> ...And then there was grunge. It seemed it came out of nowhere, Seattle to be exact. The underground had been eating away at this music for years now, but then when Nirvana finally broke out, every grunge band was getting their share of airtime. <BR>Nirvana may have made the music popular...<BR>but Pearl Jam perfected it.<br /> Ten had come out, and was basically ignored, but when Nirvana finally came into the picture, Pearl Jam got their share of radio airtime. Nirvana may have sold 9 million copies and stayed ahead of Pearl Jam for weeks, but Pearl Jam would eventually surpass Nirvana and sell over 2 million more records. Ten was different then any other grunge record, it was much more classic rock oriented. While all of the other bands were trying to get the muddiest guitar sound possible, PJ guitarists Mike McCredy and Stone Gossard achieved a pure, screeching guitar tone that many guitarists dreamed about. <br /> Eddie Vedder, god bless his heart, was one of the rare songwriters in the grunge movement who didn't sing about being down and out non stop. Which gave him plenty of room to experiment and move on with the music. His voice was simple, not complicated with tons of layers backing through it. The greatest thing about his voice, is any Pearl Jam fan can sing along with the record, and be in the same pitch with Vedder, which is a rare thing. <br /> Hard rocking and loud, Ten is possibly one of the greatest rock records, greatest grunge records, greatest 90s records, and definitely one of the greatest records of all time. Anybody willing to put music inside their stereo must own this record.<br />Doesn't matter how punk, metal, hardcore, whatever you are...Ten is a great record, period.
B00006RINF|5.0|Honestly, one of my favorite CDs of all time. And I have ALOT of CDs.<br />1. Swamped - 10/10 A great opening song, and just a great song all together.<BR>2. Heaven's A Lie - 9/10 A little over played.. but still awesome.<BR>3. Daylight Dancer - 9/10 Grows on you.. don't just listen to it once and say 'i dont like it'.<BR>4. Humane - 9/10 Another one that grows on you..<BR>5. Self Deception - 9/10 Loved it from the first time I heard it. But it has a little more of a pop type of sound.. not for everyone.<br />6. Aeon - 7/10 Cristina's voice is very nice in this song, but unfortunately oveall the song isn't great.<BR>7. Tight Rope - 9/10 Great song. The middle blows me away every time.<BR>8. Ghost Woman and the Hunter - 10/10 Weird title but fantastic song! My favorite on the album.<BR>9. Unspoken - 9/10 A Great, catchy song. Enough said.<BR>10.

Cristina's voice sounds great.<br />Summed up in one word: Amazing.
B000002LQR|5.0|RHCP had already been around for years before BSSM was released back in the early 90's. Their funk/punk/metal mixed sound was completely original, the band that came closest to them was Primus, who was in a different league. But RHCP mixed all different kinds of of elements to make this record. Taking Flea's slap/pop bass technique, John's screeching guitar, drums kicking in the back like a marching army, and Anthony's funk/rap vocal styles. This record wasw recorded in a supposedly &quot;haunted house&quot; with producer Rick Rubin. This is probably one of their most credited and commercial records to date. Even though Mother's Milk mainly broke them onto people's tv screens, BSSM made RHCP a household name, hell, your mom and dad could probably sing the lines to an RHCP song (although probably not off of BSSM, since it contains lyrics that aren't for the easily offended)<br /> Anyone who respects rock, funk, punk, or metal must own this album
B00008H2LB|2.0|First off, I dont understand what people find so great about Linkin Park. Yeah, so they have some catchy songs. And  Hybrid Theory  was a pretty good album. But this CD is different. A lot different. And not for the better.<br />I first heard the song \\"In the End\\" on the radio, and was pretty impressed.. being I dont really like that type of music.. I'm more into REAL heavy metal ( Lacuna Coil, Evanescence, Metallica, etc.. ) .. and to even consider Linkin Park \\"heavy metal\\" is totally ridiculous. But anyway.. so I bought the CD Hybrid Theory, and seemed to like it.. other than a few songs that drove me crazy.<br />So a few years later hearing the song \\"Somewhere I belong\\", I had the same feelings I had listening to \\"In the End\\". So I bought \\"Meteora\\".<br />Bottom Line.. other than \\"Don't Stay\\", \\"Somewhere I belong\\", \\"Easier to Run\\", and \\"Numb\\", I'd have to say the rest of the album is just a guy screaming his head off with some upbeat music that sounds like your in China along with a rapper. I'm sorry. But seriously, these people really dont have that much talent. I mean I can scream if I want. I can rap if I want. It's not that hard. To play the instruments.. thats another thing. I'll give them that. But that's about it.<br />Also.. their lyrics. What's up with them? I found myself going through the songs and saying to myself.. Jesus Christ can they get some new phrases?<br />\\"Session\\", on this album, is.. so hard to describe how BAD it really is. There are no lyrics, so you can't complain about that. But.. like what is the point of this song? I don't get it. And the ending.. my God I was gonna throw the CD out the window if that kept going.<br />Thankfully, \\"Numb\\" saved this album from being thrown out the window. But overall.. if you haven't already, don't by this CD. Your gonna waste your money. Now go ahead and give me the \\"no this review did not help me\\".. but I'm only trying to help you.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD is fantastic.  Chris Cornell is probably the best vocalist in Rock right now and when he teams up with Rage Against the Machine what's not to love?  The CD is awesome.  Some are very good hard rock songs (Set it Off, Cochise, Gasoline) and some are nice mellow songs like Like a Stone.  <br />And talk about creativity.  If you are tired of the same old rock listen to some Audioslave.  &quot;Show me how to Live&quot; is one of my favorite songs just because the music is so original.  <br />This is a truly excellent CD.<br />They are also a very very good live band.
0375405208|5.0|I see this book has gotten quite a few negative reviews on this forum, but I really liked it.  This, along with Jackdaws, I think are my two favorites of Follett's.  I can't comment on either the realism of the earthquake scenario or the realism of the FBI office, but only experts will nitpick at that anyway.  This was an exciting page turner with interesting characters &amp; especially a villain you love to hate -- the evil psychopathic old hippie, Ricky aka Priest.  If you are a Follett fan, definitely give this one a chance.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Say goodbye to her pass schoolgirl image and hello to her mistress-like attitude. With her infamous media blitz smooch and numerous half-nude magazine covers, no wonder Britney's In The Zone doing very well by getting double-platinum in only a month! Don't judge the album by its lacklustre lead single and her emphysema-ish vocal. Give it a spin. It's a great pop album. I think the world should stop talking about her but pay more attention to her music.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I had heard that the second X-men movie was not as good as the first, but I just finished watching it and I thought it rocked!  Not only did I really enjoy it, but I thought it was better than the first X-men movie.  You won't be dissappointed!
0156027321|2.0|I kept trying to like this book - the tone and writing were often enchanting, and the premise remarkable. Ultimately, though, I found it shallow, glib and in too many instances gratuitously violent and grotesque. My final take on it, was, So What? The best that I can say about it is, I listened to it in an unabridged audio version, and listening was better than giving into road rage during my often gratuitously violent and grotesque commute.
B00005NGAL|4.0|Ignore the critics. They're stuck-up morons. The musical is quite faithful to the writing of T.S. Elliott, and the creatures and dancing are all very catty. It's fun to watch, and the singing is beautiful.
B000002I53|5.0|Buy this if you are even thinking about picking up a Coltrane CD. Coltrane's range and intensity on this demonstrate what can result when a man becomes a perfect musician in complete control of his instrument. His eastern influenced runs are endlessly inventive and after 100's of listenings I still get blown away and discover something new in this. McCoy Tyner's voicings are equally incredible. If this was Tyner's record with a different horn player it would still be worth owning for his playing on this is stunning. Everything I just wrote pertains to ONLY the title track.....the rest of this CD is as wonderful. This is a highpoint in jazz recording and a must own for anyone who enjoys this style of music.
6305327084|5.0|This movie (set in Upstate NY) is the story of a bunch of friends gathering for their high school reunion, but so much more too...old boyfriends and girlfriends, new loves, fun scenes, flirtations, etc.  One of my all time favorites, must have been a sleeper in the theatre but one I recommend to everyone I know.  I originally watched it because it had Matt Dillon in it (one of his better roles) but keep coming back because of the storyline and the soundtrack.  Everyone I have ever told about this movie has liked it.  The music in it is great - a lot of the movie revolves around the music and very much helps to tell the story.  If you are out of high school to any age adult, you should see this movie.  It definitely has something for everyone it it!
0553296981|1.0|Having had the misfortune of reading the book and skimming over some reviews i have arrived to a few blasphemous conclusions:<br />100 times better than harry potter? To do some simple math- harry potter is nothing, zero, drivel. When one multiplies harry potter by a hundred one still gets nothing, zero, but a hundred times the drivel!<br />The only value this book has is ...absolutely nothing but another opressed perspective which can be found among thousands of other diaries should one care to actually look.<br />Poignant? Not the least bit; it shouldn't be anyhow. Only reason this book is popular is because of the human adulation of cruelty and enjoying to see this cruelty. Obviously all the effeminate readers of this must fell not sympathy or empathy, but pity- the acme of the expression of cruelty.<br />She figures out the true meaning of life? Spare me the stupidity- there is no one true meaning, and anyone who thinks that there is, is an idiot.<br />Indestructible nature of human spirit? Destroy the human and what?- you have destroyed the spirit.<br />Yes, we should especially listen to those who cannot even properly spell- a profound &quot;a&quot;ffect on everyday life? Taking this drivel seriously is cardinal idiocy.<br />A gift to us? In what way? Surely the perspective of her, if we listen to an authority, Hegel, is worthless- it is far too subjective.<br />Shiver at the loss? Death is a necessary condition. Once you stop thinking of it as torture you might see it as liberation (not in the swinish Christian sense though).<br />Having read over the reviews I come to a conclusion: good material for a withdrawn, God-fearing, effeminate, sickly animal. I am sorry if I have damaged anyone'shigh strung sensitivity.<br />I slightly disagree: it deserves 1/100
B000002H33|5.0|Just. AWESOME! THIS IS M E T A L L I C A !! AND FOR THOSE WHO THINK IT SUX, WELL THIS ISNT UR TYPE OF MUSIC, SO DONT WRITE CRAP ABOUT IT, AND CONTINUE LISTENING TO YOUR GOOD &quot;MUSIC&quot;.
B00005JMGL|2.0|What I hate most of all is a film that looks wonderful, should be wonderful, and then is wretched.  The previews for this film, by PJ Hogan, made it look extraordinary: dark, mysterious, adult. So I was hoping for something dark, mysterious, and adult. I was disappointed.<br />Sure it has great effects and brilliant cinematography (I love the image of Wendy laying on the grass), but for all its stunning visuals, the film never decides what it wants to be. At times it hints of a darker, more adult drama, but each time it dead-ends, leaving me exasperated and wishing this hadn't been made with children in mind. <br />The acting in the film ranges the whole spectrum. Rachel Hurd-Wood, as Wendy, is marvelous, in honesty I think one of the best performances of the year. Jeremy Sumpter is badly miscast as the title character, however. It's not his fault though..its just that he's the only American in a cast full of British folks and he sticks out like a sore thumb. Jason Isaacs, as Hook/Mr. Darling, is good but not great. Lynn Redgrave's invented character, \\"Aunt Millicent,\\" is really weird. Speaking of weird, Tinkerbell is a very strange creation here. She flits around, makes faces, and is very annoying and bizarre.<br />All in all the film's greatest flaw is the disappointment factor. If i had walked in knowing nothing, I may have enjoyed it more. But all the hype and lovely trailers turned a standard adventure into a mediocre, bombastic mess. Grade: C
B000089RVR|5.0|I normally do not listen to music like this, but I will recommend it to anyone who likes well written songs and good music to drive around to.  It also serves as good background music to clean your house to or play video games to.  Great album.  Dido definatly fills a void that is lacking in popular music today, and for that I'm thankful.  Her songs are predictable, but that is the best part to me.  I like her style.  And that, to me, is the most important part of a popular artist.  She has her own thing going and that is awesome.  This album is different than &quot;No Angel&quot; in several ways.  The songs seem simpler, but that can be a good thing.  More attention is paid to vocals in this album.  The songs are more lyric-oriented.  But that is a good thing, in this case.!  In a time where teens are too &quot;indie-savvy&quot; and the mainstream is producing really bad music in general, this album is like a breath of fresh air.!
0385504209|4.0|The book served as an introduction, at least for me (and I am not very knowledgeable in this area, to the world of 'alternative' religion. I don't know how much of what was told in this book resembles any degree of truth. But it makes you wanting to read more on this subject. That's what I first started to do upon completion of this novel. And it's great achievment of the author. At the same time, I found it to be quite lame thriller, contrary to many reviews. The plot lines are predictable in many cases. In addition, Dan Brown is not a very good writer. His style is somewaht 'wooden' (as was mentioned in one of the reviews of this book). And what about all this itallics - I found such widespread use of itallics very annoying. That's why I gave it four stars. This book has a very interesting content, which is delivered in imperfect way.
B00000099Y|5.0|There are so many reasons that this album is the best ever, but you would do yourself a favor to just listen to it instead of take my word for it.  It may very well change your life.
B00008K7AM|2.0|I'm normally a huge Rob Schneider fan, but I found this movie to be a big disappointment.  Schneider gas station attendant character trades bodies with a sorority queen after he tries on her magic earring.  Schneider then mugs around for the next hour and a half learning to deal with the surprises of having a guys body while trying to get his former body back all with predictably hilarious results.  Except that the results are instead predictable, dull and poorly thought out.  Is a urinal really that hard to get used to that it takes a week to master?  Wouldn't s/he have been beaten up for breaking the guy code and starting a conversation in the bathroom, never mind admiring someone else's mastery of the urinary process?  And if you fight like a girl in a fight you're not going to win - you're going to get taunted and then smacked down.  I don't care if you're a girl trapped in a guys body or not - you can't kick another guy in the happy sacks.  The sentimental bits cloyed and the comic bits dragged and it'll take me a long time in therapy to rid my nightmares of images of Schneider giving lap dances in a bikini.<br />Be a nice person and don't pick things up from the ground.  Lessons learned, no need to buy this one, try some of Schneider's others instead - my personal favorite being Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Tied With Sevendust for album of 2003. A chilling journey into the mind of a deadman, De-Loused in the Comatorium is written from the perspective of either a member or someone close to the members of TMV. He tried to kill himself and wound up in a coma, and then when he awoke from the coma he had scars all over his body and killed himself. The cryptic lyrics focus solely on this topic and the entire cd serves as a concept album to take you through what he was thinking. Screw Sparta, all of ATDI's talent wound up in the Volta (aka Omar and Cedric). Mars Voltas' eclectic Punk Jazz is something to be heard. Pick this up at all costs.<BR>P.S. ESP means &quot;Enter Sleep Pattern&quot;, to make the track titles more understandable.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Pirates of the Caribbean use a wide variety of high school band type instruments.  This CD put a lot of energy coming from the movie right into your sterio.  The inspirational music will lift you into a pirates adventure.<br />Once the CD begins you are transported into another world, from the first song to the last all you think about is a battles from the pirates of the caribbean.  You think of a pirate fighting on floor boards.  You are put on the black pearl itself and everything is so sad and errie.  The Pirates of the Caribbean grabs your attention with loud brass instruments and drums.<br />The composer for Pirates of the Caribbean uses a familiar theme throught the entire sound track, with added effects from the movie.<br />The instruments include:<br />Brass, Stings, Percussion<br />No sythesizers in this piece of music...just sounds like it because it is extemly addicting and LOUD!<br />All of the instruments combine together to make an stunning effect that will keep you listening to this CD for hours. (EVEN THOUGH IT ONLY 45 MINUTES LONG)<br />Enjoy the CD (but i wish the soundtrack went along with the movie sequence)--ANONYMOUS
B0000AQS6R|5.0|If you haven't seen this before---Where have you been this is a classic. If you like slapstick comedy you'll love this. And watch for Chevy to ride the snow saucer, I almost hurt myself laughing.<br />There's a great cast, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Dennis Quaid, and many great character actors.<br />There's a of discussion about what constituits great features, but the film alone is worth the price----You won't be sorry if you get this one!!!
B0000CAQ27|3.0|I have been soo excited to listen to the new Pink cd for months now, and when I finally got it for Christmas, my anticipation was alot better than the actual ownership of the album. Yeah, she has some powerful lyrics and nice beats, but overall, the album is a little disappointing. In her song &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot;, she claims that she is no Britany and how she is a rebel, though alot of her songs on Try This have more pop lyrics and remind me of Britany. &quot;Love Song&quot; is one of the best songs I think. And while alot of her songs are &quot;rebelious in the lyrics&quot;, the way she sings and the music are most certainly not the way we are use to hearing her. I'm thinking a bit of help from he music industry? There are reviews loving the album and not so much loving the album, but I would have to say I am a little disappointed and this is not an album that will be worn out in my cd player.
B000089RVX|5.0|In my opinion this is by far the best album released in 2003. Usually (even on my favorite albums) cd's only have about 3-4 songs on them that I can say I REALLY like. But on the Evanescence album &quot;Fallen&quot;, I LOVED EVERY SINGLE SONG. I recently read another person's review saying this album was overrated. Nothing could be further from the truth to me. If you want to use the word overrated, at least use it with a name that fits the word's true meaning...Britney Spears. As for the Evanescence album, I would recommend it to anyone with good taste in music.
B00004WIBW|4.0|The VHS version of this film wasnt anything great I would very much like to see the DVD version with the special features. But the movie was fine without them.<br />There was many changes to the tale of sleepy hollow. But the overall plot was the same, the headless horseman is coming. This movie had a very spooky enviorment, background, and overall disturbing images. There is alot of blood, see... The headless horseman is being controlled by an unknown force, and is going on a killing spree.<br />I thought some of the killings were quite clever, like two kills and one body. It took me a while to find out what some of them ment. But it is a great movie to watch if your looking for a slasher that makes you think. If you like this movie, I might suggest Frailty.
B00008OWZC|4.0|As a HUGE fan of Led Zepplin, it was great for me to hear the mix of live concert recordings on these three disks. Fantastic performances, and Jimmy Page did a good job of not only choosing, but compiling a sort of &quot;live compilation&quot; collection. The only reason I don't give this set a 5-Star rating is because &quot;Ramble On&quot; did not make the cut, and it is my favorite Zepplin song.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Well, let me say first off, this is not Rage against the Garden, or Sound against the Machine, or Ragegarden or anything like that. This is Audioslave. Just because the band is made up of members from Rage and Garden, everyone wants either Rage against the Machine, Soundgarden, or Ragegarden. Sorry guys, but what you get is Audioslave.<br />There seriously isn't a bad song on this album. Some are better than others, but I don't feel like there's any filler here. Sure it's nothing ground breaking, but why does every new band have to reinvent the wheel? This is just great hard rock.
0689859368|2.0|This book is entertaining, and a promising start, BUT, it is nothing more than a start:  unlike a book in a true series, this one cannot stand on its own.  It is really only the first chapter or two of a book rather than a complete story on its own.  The characters are introduced,  the stage is set, a mystery is introduced... and the book ends.  Seems like a sleezy marketing ploy to inflate the price of a book by selling it in five installments.  I enjoyed the first installment, but the rest will be checked out of the library.  I'd advise other shoppers to do the same, or buy it used.
B000059T00|5.0|It really is unfortunate that these guys only made one album.  But what an album it is!  Blind Faith combined the soulful guitar mastery of Eric Clapton, the powerful vocal stylings of Steve Winwood, the classically-influenced artistry of Rick Grech and the pounding, mammoth drum thrashings of Ginger Baker.  Four musical geniuses, nothing less.<BR>&quot;Had To Cry Today&quot; is an emotional epic of a song.  At nearly nine minutes, it's a uniquely crafted rock gem, complete with Winwood's passionate wails and Clapton's even MORE passionate guitat solos.  But &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; is even better, if you ask me, and easily one of the greatest ballads ever written.  Definitely Winwood's finest vocal performance on the album.  Such an emotional song.  &quot;Well All Right&quot; is the only weak song on the album in my opinion.  I really don't care for it at all.  <BR>The legendary &quot;Presence Of The Lord&quot;, noteworthy for being Clapton's first original composition, is a staggering tune.  I guess that Clapton was really starting to feel the downfalls of fame at that point, so this was his outpouring of emotion.  And of course, he rips out a killer solo in the middle.  &quot;Sea Of Joy&quot; is also a real treat, but &quot;Do What You Like&quot; is a masterpiece.  I'm sick of all these people whining about it being too long.  They complain about the over-emphasis of solos.  I don't see why, because all of the solos are great (except for Grech's bass solo, which is actually kind of boring).  As everyone knows, Baker is the real star on this one, and that drum solo is still one of the all-time greatest.  Even better than the one on &quot;Toad&quot;.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Everyone else has pretty much said it all about this movie. As a young child I read all I could about horses, especially race horses. Without going into great detail, I would like to point out that there are several historical &quot;inaccuracies&quot; portrayed in the movie &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;. Most can be easily explained as to why they are left out or have been changed, however ONE really, really, REALLY bugs me:<br />War Admiral was only 15.3 hands high! Only 3&quot; taller than Seabiscuit. That's it. They were BOTH small horses.<br />While I can understand that the &quot;big little horse&quot; theme pretty much ran the whole movie, in reality it just doesn't wash. Surely they could have found something else to hang everything on rather than change an important historical fact -- such as the size of the rival horse? Sheesh :)
B000001E3V|5.0|I won't make this a very long review.  I'll just keep it simple and say this: THIS ALBUM CONTAINS THE GREATEST GUITAR LICKS IN THE UNIVERSE.  I can't even begin to try describing it in words.  Clapton was in a zone, and the passion and emotion that he displays on this album completely blows away ANY other  guitarist in the world.  \\"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad?\\", \\"Key To The Highway\\" and \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\" will leave you totally speechless with their unimaginable intensity.  Clapton has never played like this before or since.<br />So whenever someone starts whining about how Hendrix is so much better, or about how Clapton isn't as good as the 'original' blues guitarists, just look them straight in the eye and say \\"Dominos Live At The Fillmore\\".
B00005JL3A|2.0|...on it's own, standard Hollywood fare. Don't go into this expecting a faithful take of the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game; that storyline was tossed out the window, with director Paul Anderson inserting his own cookie-cutter vision (lack of vision?), looking to cash in on the franchise name.<br />Anderson, in the liner notes, is called a &quot;fan&quot; of the RE video game series. Coulda fooled me, since his big-screen adaptation hardly has anything to do with RE. For whatever reason (ego? studio execs with zero inspiration beyond $$$?), Anderson decided to script his own &quot;prequel&quot; to the events of the first RE game. The game was a slow-paced creepfest, all about atmosphere. This film is typical Hollywood tripe, full of kung-fu babes, lame one-liners, wooden acting, obnoxiously-loud industrial metal music, and cheap &quot;things popping out of lockers&quot; scares. <br />The basic plotline: Umbrella, a sinister mega-corporation which profits from bio-engineering &amp; genetic alteration aimed towards warfare while operating under the guise of a General-Electric type company, has a massive underground lab. Nine-to-fivers work there like they would in an ordinary office, live there, eat &amp; shop there, shut away from the world above. This is all hidden under a pristine mansion. Some criminal jerk decides to steal a very lethal viral agent known as the T-Virus, intentionally loosing the virus in the process, causing all hell to break loose. Everybody down below dies, re-animate as zombies. A &quot;crack&quot; SWAT team swoops in to find an amnesiac agent and a do-gooder trying to bring down Umbrella. Zombies attack, and most of the squad dies in a laser room before most of the action goes down. Later, mutant dogs abd beasts attack, Milla does her &quot;Matrix&quot; routine....you get the point.<br />Anderson turned a great game series into a convoluted mess. There is no &quot;Red Queen&quot; killer computer in the game. No underground office workers. No Alice the Zombie Killer. The script is paper-thin. Here's a great example; Team Leader: &quot;Report, soldier.&quot; Jovovich as Alice: &quot;What?&quot;. Good stuff, eh? Michelle Rodriguez will make you wonder how she gets paid to act, irritating you beynd belief in the process. She plays a Vazquez-from-Aliens ripoff character, snarling the entire movie in an effort to play a tough commando chick. The rest? Uh, doesn't matter since you barely even learn any of their names. Bad zombie effects, mediocre CGI work (including some zombies), blasting music....meant as a distraction, I believe, from the awful screenplay.<br />There's no crumbling Spencer Mansion. No odd puzzles to solve. No lone zombie wandering a dark hallway. No mouldering tombs to search. No blackened catacombs. No Trevor family. No freak mutations like the massive snake Yawn, Plant 42, Lisa Trevor, the shark Momma Neptune, or the dreaded Tyrant. No moody atmosphere of being stranded in a remote mansion, looking for your missing comrades without a clue as to what happened. No horror of discovering sinister experiments. In fact, there's nothing in this movie that made the game so creepy and effective. It was all there; perfect source material to make a truly frightening film. Sadly, it was all trashed in favor of pretty actors and lame Matrix-like action. In other words, Hollywood took another promising franchise and turned it into the typical garbage that they churn out day after day. On it's own, the film is your average Hollywood action/horror job, indistinguishable from the rest of its ilk. As a RE film, it is a complete bomb &amp; miserable failure.<br />Want a great RE movie experience? Buy a GameCube and the Resident Evil remake. The graphics are amazing, and the mood is perfect. Play it in the dark and you start looking over your shoulder. Want a bad RE movie experience? Pop this film into your DVD player and you start looking over your shoulder for the nearest exit. Shame on you, PaulW.S. Anderson. What does the W.S. stand for? Writes Sh*t? Next time, stick to the storyline and spare us your own embarrassing version of things.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|This latest CD incarnation of Jefferson Airplane's second album, Surrealistic Pillow, is the third U.S. version to be issued by RCA/BMG. I have owned all three versions. The first CD version was in the mid-80's when CD technology was in its infancy. Many of us were abused by the major labels as they exploited us by charging premium prices for CDs of classic albums mastered from very bad (as in worn out) LP masters that were never intended nor engineered for the dynamic range capability of the compact disc. At any rate, all of the criticism about the first version is valid. It is easily identified because it has shoddy packaging as well and the old Airplane label moniker, GRUNT. The second version wasn't issued as an individual CD until 2001. It was significantly improved and included liner notes from Jefferson Airplane/Starship historian Jeff Tamarkin. The &quot;audio restoration&quot; for that one was done by BMG engineer, Bill Lacey. This CD was originally part of a four disc boxed set, and it included both mono and stereo versions of the album. Interestingly, the credits list two different engineers for the digital transfers of each version (stereo by Eddie Tallia and mono by Mike Hatry). <BR>The third and most recent reissue of Surrealistic Pillow is part of BMG's Heritage series which is supposed to be as close as they are going to get to mimicking the fine reissue works of competing labels like Rhino (WEA), Hip-O (Universal), and Legacy (Sony). In fact, BMG Heritage contracted with independent engineer, Bob Irwin, to do the latest Jefferson Airplane remasters (also includes - Takes Off, After Bathing At Baxters, and Crown of Creation). Bob Irwin's past remastering credentials includes the fabulous Legacy reissues of The Byrds classic catalogue. If you have heard those albums, then you know he has high standards. His work on Surrealistic Pillow is not an exception, despite the belly aching criticism some other Amazon reviewers have written. Irwin is based at the independent label, Sundazed when he's not doing contract jobs. <br />For those who say that this latest CD sounds hideous, I think they protest too much. This is as good as it is going to get as long as they use the original two-track stereo masters. The only other possible way to improve the sound is to remix from the multi-tracks, and that rarely happens if the record is a classic. The biggest exception to this was the reissue of the Who's catalogue in the late 90's, but Pete Townshend himself was involved with approving each remaster. While I thought they sounded great, there was a lot of protest from fans that they did indeed sound different. When the Beatles catalogue was being prepared for CD transfer by George Martin, he remixed the earliest albums, but wisely chose to leave the later albums as was. It is possible to make an old two-track master sound good if the LP EQing is removed and the dynamic range is expanded. The late engineer/producer Gus Dudgeon (he engineered early albums by Moody Blues, Bowie, and produced many classic Elton John albums as well as remastered his entire catalog) wrote a very interesting technical article about the remastering of older albums and how it can and should be done. It can be found by searching on Google. His remastering of the 70's Elton albums is flawless.<br />So, my opinion is that the 2003 CD of Surrealistic Pillow is the best there can and will be using the original mixes. The packaging has been restored with all the original elements and there are 6 bonus tracks including mono single mixes of the classics, &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Somebody To Love&quot;. Therefore this is the definitive remaster...unless Paul Kantner and Marty Balin are allowed to remix the multi-tracks with a very good engineer.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This film is obviously fantastic, there's no doubt about that. The voice acting is brillant, and the music is outstanding, definatly the best disney soundtrack.<BR>I just had a great laugh when I read a couple of the reviews going on about how violent it is for young children.<BR>And how many times the word &quot;kill&quot; is used.<BR>I can't imagine the word &quot;kill&quot; effecting any young child. And if it does, they need serious help.<BR>Who wants a film to be all happy, and no sense of adventure, no sense of a will for the good guy to win over the bad guy. What do you want the lions to do, go and sit round a table and have an adult discussion.<BR>So the people who are going on about the movie being too violent, get a life, life's too short to go around complaining about stupid things like that.
B000099T2L|1.0|For the record I am a big fan of Destiny's Child and Beyonce.  I loved their last 2 Cd's.  I thought the songs were great, most if not all of them written by Beyonce.  So i was excited when I heard she was recording a CD.  I absolutely LOVED 'Crazy in Love'!  I couldn't get it out of my head.  So I bought the CD but was very dissapointed.  What a let down!  The first single is very deceiving.  I really didn't like Baby Boy.  Me, Myself and I was just decent.  There are no other good songs on this album, Im sorry to say.  Crazy in Love is good, baby boy and me myself and i are just so so.  The rest are just fillers.  So if your like me and loved crazy in love, just buy the single.
B000089RVX|4.0|wow who would have thought christian rock could be this good. i mean this entire cd is about god, and yet it is very hard to distinguish the diffrence between this and many other non-christian rock band. the cd see,s to have a theme of being lost and falling(hint: FALLEN)away from life.this cd also has the biggest fault that so many cds have now. the theme. everything in it sounds the same. its just one really long song with little spaces here and there. if you like creed or linkin parks more &quot;peaceful&quot; songs then this is defintly a must have.
B0000VAFNQ|3.0|This basically sums up the portrayal of the vamps in \\"Underworld\\".  The vamps were nothing more than humans with fangs, in my opinion.  they were just weak.  Now I did like the silver nitrate bullets but vamps with guns???  They looked more like Matrix-wannabes than the living dead to me.  There was no show of their \\"otherworldly\\" powers until towards the end of the movie.  And even that showing of power was \\"weak\\" for lack of a better term.<br />The lycans, on the other hand, were awesome!!!  Being a huge fan of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, series I often sided with the vamps and looked down on the whining, wimpy lycans but I definitely was cheering the lycans on in this movie.  Their leader, Lucien, was definitely running things and as his story was revealed, we learned that underneath all the fangs and fur was a real romantic.  Moving on....<br />The special effects were pretty good.  All in all, the movie was worth watching but I'd think twice about making it a part of my dvd collection.  Had there been more of a showing of supernatural stand-offs and such, I might have been persuaded differently.  But as is, \\"Underworld\\" just didn't live up to my expectations.
B00005U122|2.0|I watched the concert live at the PNC Bank Art Center in NJ, sometime in the summer of 2000. It was an overwhelming experience, as I had never been to any live show by any Pink Floyd member or the whole band for that matter. I recently purchased the DVD out of sheer nostalgia, as I think I have experienced the best of Pink Floyd in one form or another already. <br />First, about the DVD. The thing that put me off most was the guitarist, who kept on chewing gum during even the most sombre solo pieces. His dress was equally hideous and so were his movements. He should join one of the neo-pop divas. He may be skillful but was unable to capture the Pink Floydness. He will be an extreme disappointment for people who have heard a very matured Gilmour of recent times.<br />The editing and camerawork is lacklusture and so is the DVD organisation. I believe for most people it is the first Floydian experience on DVD and superior sound systems which explains so many of the five stars. I would not recommend this DVD to newbies. Die-hard Floyd fans can buy and ruminate over this DVD.<br />There is this ongoing debate about who captures the essence of Floyd most - Waters or Gilmour. I belong to the camp that believes both had equally important roles to play to make the legend what it is today. However, please note that while Waters has been the concept, creative and lyrical force behind the band, Gilmour supplied the musical softness and sublime beauty. Unfortunately, since Waters has not been very creatively eloquent in the recent times, you are better of with the Gilmour faction - which exhibits superior musical execution, not to mention more skillful musicians over all.

0446677450|5.0|After putting off reading this book for months, once I started, I didn't want to put the book down until I was finished. This book contains a wealth of information about the philosophy, mentality, attitude and desire associated with getting rich, and thus living the life you've dreamed of.<BR>As a 25 year-old looking for a way to both work at a great job and be able to travel and do all of the things I want, I find myself constantly unhappy because all of the things I would like to be able to have are out of my reach financially. <BR>This book should not be seen as a &quot;self-help&quot; book. Rob Kiyosaki is not preaching to you or telling you what you should or shouldn't do. He simply lists the lessons he learned from his rich dad, and tells you how and why they worked for him. The best thing he does is address all of the doubts and cynicism you have in your mind, and really helps you retrain your brain to think like a rich person. <BR>I highly recommend this book for any young professional who grew up in a middle class family, never had parents who were big into investing, and figure they just have to work their whole life to find financial security. This book helps you realize you can be one of the people out there living the lives of their dreams, you just have to stop making excuses, educate yourself, and not be afraid to do it. Great book!
B00007BH5C|5.0|I grew up preferring classical music to pop. I even recall being appalled by the Beatles after finding out about them from everyone at school the day after they first performed on the Ed Sullivan Show. (I never watched the Ed Sullivan Show.) It took the efforts of one of my college roommates to find some music that I liked that was not orchestrated classical music and that was The Moody Blues. It turned out that they used orchestrated music in their work. Today my interests are still more conservative I think than most and some of the things still appall me. But my interest has moved to movie soundtrack work, especially John Williams and Howard Shore. It strikes me that their work is the most consequential new music being written. More people listen to it in an atmosphere that is cathartic than anything else. It makes use of all we have learned about music and how it affects us and our moods. I also feel that movies such as the LOTR threesome represent the art form of our age. So we should pay a great deal of attention to it and try to measure how it affects us and influences our culture.<br />It also seems right to try to evaluate which of the movie scores succeeds most in accomplishing a goal of enhancing the movie, playing on the chords of human emotions, and offering the community the cathartic experience. In TTT Howard Shore does this spectacularly. Of concern, in class room discussions over the question of good and evil as portrayed in the films, it seems there is a serious issue over the portrayal of ethnicity. Can we seriously ignore the contrast between northern and southern, white and black, light and dark, good and evil when even the music uses ethnic sound to emphasize the contrasts? This scale of good through bad is developed by JRRT and reflects his work, his personal history, WW's I and II, and portrays the West against the rest. While it makes the heart sing (whose heart?) with grief and happiness does it fight against our social emphasis on multi ethnic reconciliation?ic reconciliation?
B00003CXGG|4.0|Most of you are wondering why I give this 4 stars, yet I stated that it is Jet Li's worst movie. B/c Jet Li has never starred in a bad movie, But if I had to rate his American flicks from best to worst, this one would be the worst. However, it is still a very enjoyable kung-fu flick to watch. This movie has some of the best martial arts fighting scenes I had ever scene. Jet Li is way better then Jackie Chan, but I still like Chan too. Its combines high flyin fighting with hip hop music. It delivers a great lesson about who you should trust and who you shouldn't because betrayal is one of the themes in this movie. Anyway here is the plot.<BR>Han Sing is a former hong kong cop who is now a prisoner. Then one day he learns that his little brother Po, who lives in America, has been killed. Han escapes from jail and travels to America in search of his brothers killer. He comes to America at the same time his Father Chu'ing, and his buisness partner Isaac O'day (Delroy Lindo) who are also both rivals(inclding their families and friends), are fighting to own some piece of land. Upon his coming to merica, Han meets Isaac O'day's daughter, Trish (Aaliyah) whom he falls inlove with but also contributes problems betwwen the families. Then we also learn Han's backround about why he was an ex-cop who became a prisoner. It turns out that years before, his father, Ch'u Sing was a gangster in China and was gonna be put for trial. Chu knew he would recieve the death penalty, so Han managed to let him escape so his father would be able to get away and provide a better life for him and his little brother Po. His father fled to america w/ his brother, and Han was stripped from his badge and thrown in Jail for doing what he did. And back to what's going on right now, Later Trish's own Brother, Colin is later killed. Who is killing all these people. Why are so many loved being killed. Soon Han learns he is in a place where he may not be able to trust anybody.<BR>That is them plot. Thee isn't much more to say about this movie. All actors and actreeses do tremendous jobs. The chemestry between Li and Aaliyah is very convincing. It is a must see movie for all Martial arts fans.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|The dvd lacks due to the fact that the pilot on the dvd is not the originally FIRST aired pilot, but is the original pilot that was shot first(they shot the pilot on the dvd first, and fox told them to reshoot, and the reshot version was what aired--that is the better version in my opinion)--personally I would have enjoyed the dvd containing both pilots, but what can you do.
B00005LOUP|1.0|I don't understand why these sort of films have to be made, and made so differently!<BR>First of all, we see the classic. It's a story that kids and adults can watch and enjoy. It's clean and overall pretty decent short story.<BR>The point of the story is that Christmas doesn't mean getting all the presents. It means being with the family.<BR>What do we see in the movie? Jim Carrey is crude, gross, and a total turn off.<BR>It's NOT a program for kids. And to that person who says it's great for kids to get into Dr Suess's films, I say NO!<BR>It's the WRONG approach BY FAR.<BR>The original Grinch, or Dr. Suess's work is far better, and is of course, the true Suess.<BR>This new version is just gross and deserves to be in the trash.<BR>And why a long movie? Why mess up the story?<BR>The story is that the who's don't care for presents, but in the movie, that's all that matters to them.<BR>Jim Carrey is not funny, and this film is NOT for kids.<BR>Wouldn't you rather have your kids grow up with better shows or movies?<BR>I love the classics and at age 21. I love Honeymooners, Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, the old Target with Gene Hackman, Ben Hur (1956), so on and so forth.<BR>This movie is just GARBAGE!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I believe that the fifth track The Steward of Gondor, The Return of the King track- 17 and the last track Into the West performed by Annie Lennox are just beautiful tracks. The Return of the King because Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn)does a short and sweet melody that just lifts up the whole rythm of the track! The Steward of Gondor because Billy Boyd (Pippin) does this short, sweet and sad song. The Steward of Gondor and Return of the King tracks just make you remember some of the movie which is brilliant. Finally, Into the West, Annie Lennox does a wonderful job on it. Into the West, the song just makes you remember each and every character, and whatever character you fell in love with, and you remember that actor you like for their time and effort and accomplishment they put into the movie. You also remember Frodo saying good-bye to Merry, Pippin and Sam, so in that way its sad. The one song I believe that is the best though is, the one done by Enya, May It Be. That is the best song out of all three cds. Compared to the first to cds, I believe that the orchestra really pulled themselves together for the third cd though!!!! Both Enya and Annie Lennox have done their songs wonderfully and with such energy!<BR>                                  <BR>                                                           A+
B00005JLSE|1.0|I bought this DVD based on its numerous awards and great ratings and reviews by well known personalities.  Ooops!!  This movie is totally lame, slow moving, pitiful plot, a complete waste of time.  So it's a musical, hey none of these people are Julie Andrews or somebody like that, it's a lousy musical.  You just can't trust the academy awards anymore I guess.
B00005QZWI|5.0|When I listen to sound track music I count on it to set a mood for me that will be similar to the one I experience while I watch the movie. The nice thing about listening to the sound track instead of watching the movie is that I can be in that mood but still get work done. When I watch the movie that is what I do. Watch the movie. Some movies do not set the mood I want to be in while I work. That is part of the problem with this sound track. The mood it sets for me is too intense for me to work. It demands full attention even when it is just the sound track. It doesn't just put me in the mood the movie does. It puts me into the movie in my mind. I find myself wanting to fight evil yet still be good. How can you fight evil when evil is fighting? How can you cheer for the small guy when the small guy is in a hopeless situation? And this only reminds me that we are all in the same hopeless situation. The evil is death. We cannot all go to the Gray Havens. We are not elves but men and men are mortal. All men are mortal. So in the end, I will be what I will be. Even my loyal friends will not be there for me. So I listen to these but not when I want to get my work done.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My headline sums it up on 2 levels ... when the geniuses at Fox scattered this show across timeslots, it was easy to miss.  Now that it's gone, it's also very easy to miss.  I don't write reviews lightly.  This was the most intelligent, best casted, humorous, compelling sci-fi series to come along in ages.  If you haven't seen it, all I can say is it's truly a treat.  Even my 55 year old mother, who pretty much hates most things sci-fi, found herself strangely intrigued with the cast, the sets, the laughs, and the dialogue.  This is soooo much more a TV treat than 95% of the garbage seen to fill up 800 cable channels, and 95% of the movie screens today.  Fox blew this one big time.  Even the subtle touches (no sound in space) are wonderful.  I would encourage you strongly to buy it.  I would encourage Joss and Universal even more to bring the rumored movie to life.
6301868684|2.0|People who think that the working class or anyone who is down and out is necessarily brutal and self-serving will love this film. For those who like their &quot;social realism&quot; as ugly and unambiguous as possible,this is the film for you. Most of the characters are one-dimensional,yell their lines and are either outrightly cruel/unfeeling (practically everyone) or hystrionic/narcissistic victims doomed to be wiped out by the end of the film (eg Gorgette the transvestite, Tra La La the town &quot;tramp&quot;). Almost all are totally unsympathetic--practically no-one in this film is worth caring about. Sorry, but real life is NOT like this,not even amongst the &quot;downtrodden&quot; who obviously make such sensationalist fodder for those eager to &quot;slum it&quot; vicariously for a couple of hours. This film might titilate nihilistic 20 yr olds or middle class suburbanites and has clearly thrilled all the critics (and almost everyone else in this forum) but I found it stupid and ugly (and boring). Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrific, I must add. That is the only good thing I can say about this film, I'm afraid. For those looking for uncompromising social realism and characters written with compassion rather than contempt, try reading Steinback's &quot;Cannery Row&quot; or see the movie of his novel &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; or, for a more contemporary, very bleak but infinitly better film than Last Exit see &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot; directed by Gary Oldman.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Firefly DVD collection gives the series the justice that FOX never did.  A witty dialogue, interesting storyline and lively background are brought together by nine characters with depth to give hours of levity and suspense.  This is the start of a beautiful science opera cut short in its prime.  Buy the series and cry when you finish disc four, in all of its fascinating and incomplete storylines.<br />Don't even try to compare this to the start of any other science fiction series, it is an undeserved insult.<br />A hex on FOX for their (purposefully?) bungled presentation of the original series.  Someone at FOX must have thought that westerns and scifi don't go together.  I might have agreed with them until I saw Firefly.<br />'...and Kaylee, what the Hell's goin' on in the engine room?  Were there monkeys?  Some terrifying space monkeys maybe got loose?'
B00008J4P5|4.0|Elephant is the best new rock album I've bought in a long time.  They're style is distinct (yet simple) and they're rhythm is unmatched with a great beat.  I just love listening to this CD.
B00003CXXM|3.0|Action packed...yes...good acting...yes...a bit drawn out...yes...easy to follow...no!! This movie was good...but it was very hard to follow, it jumped around a lot!!

If you are looking for a good...not great thriller...then rent this one!
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyoncé's first solo album is finally here. The first two singles, \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\", will make you think that this album is packed with songs similar to these two, but that's not true. There are only about five songs in this album that are good for dancing. The majority of the songs are slower songs, and some of them, like \\"Speechless\\", \\"The Closer I Get To You\\", \\"Gift From Virgo\\", and the hidden track \\"Daddy\\", are even slower songs that you might rather skip if you don't feel like sleeping. \\"Naughty Girl\\", on the other side, is a great song with a cool beat. I like the way Beyoncé interprets this song. \\"Hip Hop Star\\" is another song with a cool beat, but it gets annoying in the middle. Big Boi and Sleepy Brown appear in this song. My favorite songs in this album are \\"Naughty Girl\\", \\"Be With You\\", \\"Me, Myself And I\\", and \\"That's How You Like It\\". \\"Be With You\\" is a very good love song. \\"Me, Myself And I\\" is another great song that talks about being independent. \\"That's How You Like It\\" features Jay-Z. It's an excellent song with a cool, fresh beat and pretty good lyrics too. Beyoncé features Missy Elliott in \\"Signs\\", an R & B song with very creative lyrics. The song \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\" comes from the Destiny's Child \\"Survivor\\" album. Why is it included in this album as well? It's the same thing. Nothing changed in this song except that there's a 2 after the word 'Love'. <br />Beyoncé is a very sexy, talented woman with a great voice, but this album could have been made way better. Hopefully, Beyoncé's next album will include more songs like \\"Baby Boy\\" and fewer songs like \\"Speechless\\". That would most likely be a five-star album.
B0000DCGT0|1.0|Smells like horse manure...This movie is still playing as I am typing this, and it is just awful...I could not watch anymore of it. It is a complete bore, and I wanted to fall asleep...to get myself not to fall asleep, I had to get my son ready for bed himself...lol! I did not feel anything for the characters, and Seabiscut is almost non existent in the film...the only touching part that I saw was when Jeff Bridges character's son gets killed  in a car accident...and that was near the beginning of the film...from that point on..you want to fall asleep...the movie bounces around way too much and it is very hard to follow...please whatever you do...if you want to stay awake during a film...don't rent or purchase this one!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I was just commenting on an earlier comment made about information within the DVD.  I was reading reviews (not like i really needed to because i know it's going to be great) but someone made mention of C.S. Lewis' aethism and how this person knew that to be false.<br />  For correction, C.S. Lewis was an aethist.  I have done some research on Lewis, and if this person would have read something by Lewis or done even a little research, he would have realized that Lewis was an aethist during his lifetime.  However, the person isn't totally wrong about Lewis's aethism.  C.S. did convert to Christiainity.  I just thought I would provide this information, and J.R.R. Tolkien and Lewis did a lot of Christian Fiction together,<br />  Enjoy the DVD!!!!!
B00004R99J|1.0|The &quot;Pocohantas&quot; movie is OK, but my biggest beef with this product is that Disney is now using forced previews at the beginning of all their DVDs. These are over 5 minutes of dull Disney previews that you are FORCED to watch. You can't skip over them or fast forward through them, and you can't start the movie after them. If you want to watch the movie, you HAVE to watch the previews.<br />This might not be such a big deal if you're only watching the movie once, but if you're like most families your kids will watch this movie over and over again. Then its really annoying.<br />Disney should be ashamed for being so greedy that they have to put this defect in all their DVDs.
0385504209|4.0|I got the novel for Christmas, and I literally had it finished before I went to bed that night. I've seen a few negative reviews here about it, and I will admit that it's the research and historical/art history facts that make this book so fascinating. But that doesn't discredit Brown completely-the plot kept me reading (he came up with codes and clues of his own that I thought were quite intelligent), and his writing is great. He's no literary master, but I always appreciate books where I can see everything happening in my head. It reads like a movie, I suppose you could say. The characters are three dimensional, and by the end of the book, I cared about what happened to them and was happy when it had a, well, happy ending. In short, it's a book I thoroughly enjoyed, and if you like books dealing with this sort of thing, don't hesitate to pick it up.
B000002LND|5.0|Here are just some of Madonna's early classic hits. When this compilation was assembled, Madonna already had too many hits to include them all on a single CD, hence the omission of Angel, Dress you up, Gambler, True blue and all the hits from the soundtrack, Who's that girl? Because of her continuous success in the years that followed the release of this compilation, a comprehensive Madonna hits collection would now require a triple CD. That is a measure of her brilliance, sustained over a very long period of time.<br /><br />The set begins with three hits from her debut album, of which Holiday is the best but Lucky star and Borderline are also wonderful. Then come Like a virgin and Material girl, two of the singles released from her outstanding second album. Crazy for you, an excellent ballad, and Into the groove, a superb dance song, come next. Although the title track is omitted, four other major hits from the True blue album (Live to tell, Papa don't preach, Open your heart, La Isla Bonita) can be found here, each one of them a classic but very different from each other. Three major hits from Like a prayer include Express yourself and Cherish. Vogue (from I'm breathless) and two tracks not available on any previous album (Justify my love, Rescue me) complete the set.<br /><br />Anybody who does not understand why Madonna has such a huge fan base only has to listen to this compilation to find out why. Catchy pop tunes with interesting lyrics (for those that bother to listen to the words) are Madonna's trademark, yet she manages to avoid becoming formulaic. Madonna has continuously changed her style, so you don't hear the same sound over and over again.<br /><br />There is no definitive Madonna compilation yet but we may have to wait a few years for that. Until that time, this is the best introduction to her music that is available.
B000089RVX|3.0|I just recently started listening to rock and metal so i don't know what is &quot;real&quot; metal and what is &quot;fake&quot;. I think Fallen is a cd that will sound wonderful to people like me who don't know anything about rock.  But if you're someone who is a big fan of goth rock and metal than you would probably not like Fallen because I believe it was made to be easy on the ears to people like me.
B00005JLT5|5.0|As I get older, I tend to appreciate \\"historical\\" movies.  I often learn lessons that I never knew took place.  This movie is one of those.  When it came out, I thought it would be extremely boring.  It premiered on TV last night.  I watched something else.  I happened to turn my TV on very early this morning and it was on.  Figuring I'd be bored, I expected to turn the TV off very early into the film. I was VERY wrong.<br />I couldn't turn the TV off.  I learned about a part of history I didn't even realize took place.  I felt for the Jewish people and the fear, torture and often, eventual death, they encountered.  This took place only because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs.<br />I applaud Roman Polanski for his outstanding directorship (he definitely earned his Oscar).  The movie was very realistic and allows the viewer to \\"see\\" what happened a mere 60 year ago.  I believe this is partially due to his own life experiences.  He had fantastic control over what appeared to be a high number of \\"unnamed\\" extras.  The realism of the costumes and behaviors were also excellent.  But how can I forget Mr. Brody, an Oscar winner himself.  He was outstanding.  His character made his experiences a lasting impression on me.  It makes me think of what is going on in our world even today.<br />The final lesson I learned was we need peace worldwide.  If you watch this movie and aren't moved, take the temperature of your heart because it obviously has a slight chill to it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is the best Britney album ever! Here are ratings of the songs:<br />Me against the music: 9.5/10 Love the beat and vibe. Really catchy. At first I didn't like it but it grew on me.I really like Madonna on this because she spices up the song which is really great.<BR>(I got that) Boom Boom: 9.5/10 Love the songs and I love the ying Yang Twins on this song. Britney blends in with the Ying Yang Twins which is awesome.<BR>Showdown: 9.5/10 It has an R&B/Reggea vibe to it. Love it<BR>Breathe on me: 10/10 Sounds a lot like Kylie Minogue. It has a trancey feel to it. This song is the hottest song Britney has ever sung. This song will be a big hit.<BR>Early mornin': 6/10 Worst song on the album. It was produced by Moby and I wasn't really a fan of his music. This song is really boring! and it's oversung. The chorus is the worst. It's really annoying and it doesn't sound like Britney at all.<BR>Toxic: 10/10 Best song on the album. I love the beat of the strings on this song. My favourit songon this album<BR>Outrageous: 9.5/10 Produced by R.Kelly. Itis really catchy and is a great sing-a-long. It has an awesome Hip-Hop beat which matches Britney's voice.<BR>Touch of my hand: 7.5/10 A song about masturbation. I don't really like the Chinese strings in the backround. But otherwise this song'sokay.<BR>The Hook up:7.5/10 A reggea song!Her accent is hilarious!!! The song's okay though. I was really surprised about this song when I first heard it.<BR>Shadow: 8/10 First ballad on this album. It was produced by the Matrix. It sounds a lot like Avril Lavigne's \\"I'm with you\\". Song's pretty good.<BR>Brave new girl: 9/10 It sounds a lot like Madonna's \\"material girl\\". It's the poppiest song on this album. It's computerized. This song is awesome.<BR>Everytime: 10/10 Second best song on the album. It'sa song for Justin Timberlake. The best ballad I ever heard. The first time I heard it. It made me cry. It'sabout relationship's.<BR>Me against the music(remix): 7/10 I don'treally like this remix becauseit has an Indian vibe to it and I'm not a fan of Indian music. But the song's okay. Itkind of sounds like the original.<br />Buy this album right now if you don't already have it. This album is probably the best album of 2003. I think Britney has really matured and evolved on this album. I love it. It's da bomb. I recommend it to everyone.
B00008RH1H|5.0|&quot;Throne of Blood&quot; was my first introduction to Kurosawa. To sum things up in a couple words, I'd say: Give me more! I've never been into old movies, but one cannot like this movie, and being a Shakespeare fan helps even more, as it does the play justice. Not completely accurate, but close to perfection on the silver screen.<br />Like most of Kurosawas films, this stars Toshiro Mifune. Some say that he is the equivilant of harrison Ford in America. I dissagree. He's better than Ford. He can fit any roll, and his role as a Samurai given his destinee by a witch is very touching, and there are many moments in the movie that you soon won't forget. <br />I strongly recommend any film by Kurosawa, especially Ikiru. Kurosawa is a film-God and can change the way you look at life in just a couple hours.
B000002H33|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS EVER MADE! the only people who don't seem to know good music when they see it are old people who golf and spend their time on the computer. and for the people who say kirk's solos are just finger tapping, id like to see you do better. anyways, there are some of the best songs ever made on this album. each continues to blast in your ear, but changes keeping you satisfied. i rate this album A! u see that. and puff daddy gets a u-------------. happy?
B00005JKDR|5.0|It is cute, funny, has a lot on adult in-jokes and I really love the &quot;out-takes&quot; at the end and the company play. I have watched it several times with my husband and I never get tired of it.
B000002H6C|5.0|this cd couldnt get any better in my opinion. the solos are most excellent(to quote bill and ted). if u don't like this cd, go to an ear docter, and have him pull the cr@p out of ur ears. if u think this is just noise, it isnt. if u think im just a metal head, im not. i love hendrix and other things like that. if u think, u could love this album. if u don't, u will. A+++++
B00005JM02|2.0|It happens when our two fish heroes are hauled to that shark &quot;ten-step&quot; meeting, Nemo's father tell about what happened to his son, that he was taken by human divers. The sharks reply about the divers, &quot;they think they own everything. Yeah, probably Americans.&quot;<BR>From there the cartoon went downhill from there for me.
B00005JMTN|4.0|Let me start off by saying that the only reason I really liked this movie was for Ewan McGregor.  His performances never cease to impress me.  I thought he played his part very well and gave me a reason to love this movie.  As for Tim Burton, well, he's losing his touch.  After Sleepy Hollow and Planet of the Apes, he needed something good.  And I think with this one he was really just trying to say \\"look at me, I'm still cool!\\"  The movie doesn't have the same feel as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice or The Nightmare Before Christmas.  He just seems to do weird for weird's sake without really digging into the characters.  This movie is interesting and visually appealing, but it's trying for a depth it just doesn't have.  It seems fake and the relationships forced.  The twins seemed to be there only to provide another oddity to the film.  They had no depth.  We sort of got a look at Carl, but nothing very deep.  Everything about this movie got me excited - Ewan McGregor, Danny Elfman, Tim Burton, Alison Lohman and a fantastic plot.  But it fell flat.<BR><BR>The strong points of this movie, and the reason for it's 4 stars, were the ideas that could have been great.  The witch, for one, was a fantastic idea.  That whole thing was interesting and I wish it could have had a little more to it.  Also the idea of blending reality with tall tales was fantastic, but it just didn't work right in this film.  Ewan did a magnificent job and brought some life to the film, but while it could have been brilliant, it just didn't work as well as it could have.
0671027387|5.0|Read 'Angels and Demons' and was so impressed that I had to grab another Dan Brown book but did not want to buy the hard cover DaVinci Code. Anyway 'Deception Point' had me riveted from the first page, this guy is a master, and I couldn't put the damn book down. Never have I 'met' an author who has made me so interested in researching other areas which I wouldn't have given the time of day to before. OUTSTANDING book. Not sure who to trust any more :-)
B0000E2FLC|5.0|THis is definitely the best AC/DC video yet. They show great angles, with the band's best songs. Couldnt get much better. The only thing i would like is more close ups on the lead guitarist. Otherwise this is the greatest!!!
B00003CXTG|2.0|I bought this DVD from Amazon 2 years ago and finally watched it yesterday.<BR>As a WW2 buff who grew up in England, I enjoy most movies about this era, however this one was mediocre at best.<BR>The RC airplanes getting their wings blown off in every dogfight, crashing into towers and still being decipherable, weird 10 minutes with the English battles, 10 minutes at the end for the Doolittle raid, ridiculous love triangle, was not what I had hoped for.<BR>The actual main battle scene was good, but there were way too many pretty people in this movie to make it real.<BR>And there was plenty of fiction in this one. Let's not use this content for any history books...
B00004TVG7|4.0|I was expecting something a little more vigorous.  But it is still fun.  In a sober way.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This is the second album, from what I call Radioheads years of meditation.  I read some other revieuws and the reactions are very various.  Well, first of all: it is a good album, it is better than Kid A.  Second: It is still not very accesable.  You have to work your way into it because it wil not introduce itselve.<BR>Opener Packed like sardines in a crushd tin box is very sober, based on a hypnotizing chorus (&quot;I'm a reasonable man, get off my case&quot;).  It says &quot;welcome, we have more sweets for you&quot; but not on a signboard on the door but scratched into it.  Second comes the Pyramid song: brilliant, moving, touching.  Pulk/Pull revolving doors is just another Fitter happier.  It disturbes the athmosphere of the album and the overflow between the tracks.  In You and whose army? demonstrates Yorke his singing abilities, soft, careful and in the end letting loose all the restrained energy.  Amnesiac contains lots of songs based on computer bleeps that at first seem a bit confusing with disturbing rhythms and guitars but when you listen carefully you discover nice songs like &quot;I might be wrong&quot; or &quot;Like spinning plates&quot;.  The closing track &quot;Life in a glass house&quot; was a risk with its jazzy orchestra but it has lead to an impressing result.  If this had been the first Radiohead album, the critics bould be very good.  But it isn't their first.  It is a good album but people don't accept 'good' when they can get 'brilliant' or 'fantastic' from the same group.  The spirit of the Bends and OK Computer lives on, and that's regrettable for an album like Amnesiac wich is good, if not very good.  For those who expected a second The Bends or OK Computer: I recommend Hail to the thief.
B00005JMGL|5.0|Well, I guess everyone knows by now (or at least should) the story of Peter Pan, so I see no need to write anything about it. What I think is worth talking about is the adaptation of it.<br />The story is very well told and the film is visually stunning. This is truly a perfectly executed movie. But what sets this version apart from all the rest is the cast. First of all I should say that it was a complete pleasure to watch great Jason Issacs bring to life infamous Captain Hook. What an extraordinary talent. I guess that was no surprise, after all can any of us remember a bad performance by him. A surprise and a pleasent one at that, was watching rest of the cast. An incredibly ralented group of kids with perfect chemistry between them, especially Peter and Wendy. Which brings me to Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan. Finally I got to see Peter Pan as I remember reading him. Excellent cast and an excellent movie.<br />I will definitely be making space for this DVD among my collection.
B000002TQV|4.0|There are two kinds of Radiohead fans: you have the early fans who love The Bends and OK Computer (and Hail to the Thief maybe).  And you have the more recent fans who love Kid A and Amnesiac.  Ofcourse there are many people who like The Bens AND Kid A but these are two very different kinds of music.  The Bends is rock music as pure as it can be.  After Pablo Honey Radiohead was known as &quot;the guys from Creep&quot;.  With this one they show that they can do alot more.  The tracks on the Bends are piece by piece from an exceptional quality.  The group shows its ambition.  Some tracks are spitting energy (the Bends, Bones) some are so moving that they should be forbidden: Fake Plastic Trees, Street Spirit (unfair competition: who could ever do better than this??).  Yorke's singing capacities are from a very high level.  He's able to pull you're heart out of your chest.  Back in 1995, when The Bens was released, the world was curious for what Radiohead would offer the following years.  Now we know.  I don't recommend the Bends to just Radiohead fans, but to all the fans of rockmusic!
B00000273M|4.0|I love good '80s music so I'm glad I got this CD for Christmas. I was already familiar with the songs 'Manic Monday', 'Eternal Flame', and 'Walk Like An Egyptian' but I discovered much more gems on this album as well. 'Be With You' is one of my favorite songs and 'Hazy Shade Of Winter' and 'Where Were You When I Needed You' are great cover songs. If you like good poppy rock from talented female bands, then this is for you!
B000092ZYX|5.0|People, they're back.  Did you miss Radiohead as in The Bends and in OK Computer?  Didn't you found the latest two albums interesting?  Are you tired of all those non-music tracks on Radiohead-albums?  Get Hail to the thief, because this one contains nothing but real songs.  Less experimenting, more music.  Right after you pressed the play button, you hear a plug from an electric guitar being plugged in.  Then, you get a 3.25 minutes lasting storm called 2+2=5 (I checked it, it's not correct).  Why should you love this album?  2+2=5 (see above), SAIL TO THE MOON: a nephew from the Pyramid song and The Tourist; beautiful singing with that voice ful of complaint.  THE GLOAMING: tends to art: interesting computer bleeps but thanks to the rhythm more rock than Kid A.  THERE THERE: fantastic single, WHERE I END AND YOU BEGIN: good song, good rhythm, beautiful title.  WOLF AT THE DOOR: closes Hail to the thief just like the Tourist did with OK Computer.  This one leads you around 60 corners and lets loose a fantastic chorus when you least expect it.  Radiohead at its best.  Negative points about HTT: GO TO SLEEP: poppy song based on a moderate riff.  WE SUCK YOUNG BLOOD: A bit to complainingly.  In the end: 5 stars.  This promises for the future.
B000002KNU|5.0|This is the definitive Talking Heads record. The Heads were basically art geeks from RISD in 1977.  While Led Zeppelin was wowing kids from the Island at Madison Square Garden with guitar riffs and light shows (&amp; I love Zep!),  Talking Heads were singing quirky energetic songs like &quot;PSYCHO KILLER&quot;, and &quot;NEW FEELING,&quot; &quot;PULLED UP,&quot; &quot;THE GIRLS WANT TO BE WITH THE GIRLS,&quot; &quot;DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE GOVT&quot; and more.  They played at seedy clubs like CBGB blew people away with ther nerdy hyper intensive style.  This is top notch stuff.  I still listen to it 25 years after I first heard it. It blows me away even now. They are fantastic live!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|After the release of Fallen, I just had to have this album. So, I got it come Christmas time, and I must say, it's a very good album. It's not the best, but it's definitely not as bad as alot of people are saying. It'll take a little while to get used to though. My four favorites so far are Fallen (of course), World On Fire, Stupid, and Train Wreck.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Judging by the somewhat disappointing 3.5 rating that Amazon reviewers have so far given the new version of the Beatles &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, entitled &quot;Let It Be...Naked,&quot; I think a misconception needs to be cleared up here. The new version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; is simply meant to be a *companion* version to the original, NOT a replacement. The original version remains a fine Beatles album, but the &quot;Naked&quot; version has only been released as a way to strengthen the album musically, and bring it closer to the Beatles' original vision of it. Therefore, Phil Spector's orchestral &amp; choir overdubs---which were put on without the Fab Four's consent---have been removed, the screwing-around tracks &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; have also been removed, the brilliant ballad &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; has been restored (finally!), the running order of the songs has been changed, and, of course, the tunes have all been remastered for better sound quality. Personally, I think &quot;Let It Be&quot; has become a better, stronger album because of it. Again, I'm not knocking the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album---it's still a Beatles classic, Spector-warts and all---but *musically*, I feel the &quot;Naked&quot; version has definitely strengthened the album, and I'm very, very happy with it. As for the bonus 22-minute &quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; CD of Beatles chatter and rehearsal soundbites, I may not be playing it all too often, but nonetheless, the bonus CD IS a very fascinating little glimpse into the making of the album, as you're virtually allowed to go into the studio with John, Paul, George &amp; Ringo, and hear the lads working away. Besides, it's worth listening to if only for the band's brief run-through of the rare Lennon/McCartney song, &quot;Because I Know You Love Me So,&quot; previously unavailable.   By all means, keep your old copy of &quot;Let It Be.&quot; Keep it for the Spector production (whether you truly like it or not), keep it for &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae,&quot; and keep it for John's classic closing remark about the band passing the audition. But I see no reason why &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; can't deserve a place sitting next to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; CD in your Beatles collection. Remember, it's a companion album to the original, not a replacement. And a classic Beatles album has been musically improved in the process. In my opinion, &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is &quot;Let It Be&quot;...better.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Adrien Brody was a Great selection for this very Gripping film about the Holocaust&everything going on.I Finally got to see it in all the way through&was very moved.Roman Polanski did a Great Job.
B00009TB5G|5.0|After buying, and watching over and over again the Fellowship of the ring extended i had high expectations from this one. one word can describe this dvd, FANTASTIC! wow, this movie is a wonderful piece of art and deserves the respect that a couple of the other reviewers did not give it. this is a true classic. The extended version is a lot better than the regular because it goes deeper into the great story. It grabs your attention and won't let go. Kudos to Peter Jackson!!
B000002AP1|5.0|Honestly too many dull stooge fanatics get hung up the semantics of the band lineup and the billing iggy &amp; stooges on this record.   The simple fact is that this the greatest record iggy or anyone in rock has ever been involved in period  The  album starts with the blitzkrieg of 'Search and Destroy' which wipes the floor with all of the stooges previous efforts (within the first couple of bars)   Funhouse lp has got its place as the punk pre-cursor of punk in history but where on that record do you hear the sublime guitar frenzy of 'Your pretty face is going to hell'?   Where do you get the straight up wierdness of 'Penetration' or the gal to front the violent pysched 50s throwback 'Shake appeal'  Even the concluding and uneven 'Death trip' will violate you in way no other record will dare...like who ever sat through the entirity of La Blues borefest on Funhouse?
B000127LW2|5.0|Despite what others have said in their so called negative reviews... I loved Star Trek Voyager.  If any trek series is an utter failure it is 'Star Trek':Enterprise that is currently airing.  Voyager was more like 'Star Trek' than DS9 was.  It reminded me a lot of the original Star Trek series.  It also was the show that launched the UPN network from Paramount.  I agree the price could be much better than what it is being offered as.  I think that perhaps fifty to sixty dollars would have been a better price for the mere 16 episodes they had for a 1st season.  The one episode I cannot wait to view again is the episode that occured during the 30th anniversary of Star Trek.  It took place on the U.S.S. Excelsior with Captain Sulu.  It was a direct take from the begining of the movie 'Star Trek:6 The Undiscovered Country'.  It was great to see George Takei in command of the Excelsior.  <br />If you are a real Star Trek fan, and want to see another best in the Star Trek universe then you cannot miss getting the Voyager series on DVD!  <BR>There is so little in Trek merchandise out there in stores now.  It's not like when Voyager, TNG, and DS9 had tons of merchandise and a whole aisle in Toys R Us dedicated to it.  Now you cannot walk into a store and find much of Trek merchandise like you use to.  You can find a few 'Art Asylum' toys from Enterprise, and the classic Trek.  You can wait until each August to find at least 3 new HallMark ornaments for Christmas...  But other then that the Trek Franchise is slipping away.  I feel a lot of it has to do with Rick Berman's hands on the franchise.  He has been running it into the ground for about 3 years now.  Soon... I fear Star Trek will fade away from being in stores...  and the fans will be back in the same boat they were in during the 70's when you could only find some sort of merchandise at conventions only, or from a mail order catalog (But now there is the internet to satisfy that craving).  So ignore all of the overlyintellectual people that down grade the Voyager series.  It is by far the last and best that came from the Star Trek franchise.<br />If you miss out on it...  Then it will be your loss.  It is the last thing that was the closest (aside from TNG) to Gene RoddenBerry's dream...  That man will survive...  There will be a future!  We will work together and the earth's people of all races will be at peace and work together as one equal society.<br />Thank you for reading this review.
B00005JLR6|2.0|Upon making my way to my local theater to see \\"In America\\", I was hoping to see an honest rags-to-riches story of one Irish family's struggle to make a good life for themselves in their homeland, and come to America to bask in the splendor of opportunity and wealth. My thoughts couldn't be any further from the truth - for what I saw instead, was a some hour and forty minutes of sheer boredom and falsities of this great country we call America. I kept expecting our \\"heroes\\" to pull out of their bastion of poverty, but what I saw instead, was a poorly conceived display of what has to be the most schizoid pretense of acting on the planet. In addition, \\"In America\\" is chock-full of ethnic and social stereotypes, to which there are many. This film portrays people of African descent in a negative light, in that it treats them as raving, cannabalistic maniacs, and that's just scratching the surface of this heavily flawed cinematic bombast. It also sees the U.S. as a lazy, unintelligent nation, and also fails to view the positive, humanistic side of our great nation, of which there are numerous facets. Director/writer Jim Sheridan failed to do his homework, therefore missing out in capturing the true American spirit. Also, Sheridan didn't do his own nationalists any favors, either, by insulting this particular Irish family by sticking them in an urbanized New York City ghetto, let alone leaving the children alone with a helpless mother with very little income. Seeing this family's struggle, I couldn't help but sit through the movie, thinking \\"Is this family stupid, or what?\\". Better yet, \\"Were Jim Sheridan and his relatives sniffing toxic fumes (particularly from the chipped paint of the run-down apartment complex) when they concocted the idea for \\"In America\\"'s storyline?\\". Besides the vocal venom spewed by its two main stars, Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton throughout this horrible display of a sad plot and shoddy dramatics, the Sheridans need to burn the master reel, and kiss the famed Blarney Stone, before they return to this country to make another motion picture. Gaining furher undertanding of U.S. culture and customs would advance their cause as well, including a case study of our child labor and care laws in addition. To avoid futher cultural shock and disappointment, I would advise against seeing this indigestible piece of cinematic monstrosity, whether it be here \\"In America\\", or anywhere else, regardless. Also, a label should be affixed, saying: WARNING: KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF SMALL (AMERICAN) CHILDREN - due to the toxic material contained within - enough said.and kiss the famed Blarney Stone, before they return to this country to make another motion picture.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is one amazing soundtrack. Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are wickedly wonderful as well as the rest of the cast. If you like musical theatre then this soundtrack is a must-have. There's great music and lots of fun. Deffinatly try it out. The song \\"Defying Gravity\\" sung by Idina Menzel will give you goosebumps.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Seems like this movie has divided reviewers between &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;superb&quot;.  I fall into the latter category.  I think Solaris is the best movie I've seen all year - and this has been a year when I've watched an average of 4 a week as I catch up on years of not seeing any.<br />Solaris is not, strictly, SF.  It's a deeply affecting humanist story set (mostly) in space.  It has more layers than a wedding cake and the performaces are mostly excellent, particluarly Clooney and McElhone.  (Although I did find Jeremy Davies kind of annoyingly affected.)<br />I kept waiting for Solaris to let me down with some kind of Hollywood cliche and was almost dreading the ending being just that.  But it just kept getting better.  The chemistry between Clooney and McElhone is amazing and the dialogue in Solaris - especially between these two - is faultless.<br />So forget the SF bit (despite the amazing sets and photography) and enjoy Solaris for what it is - an incredibly involving and thoughtful look at the human condition : regret, longing, religion, the afterlife, etc., etc.<br />PS  I have never written a review before but this movie needs the balance of opinion adjusted here at Amazon - I'd hate for you to miss it.  I think it will become a classic.
B000089RVX|2.0|It's quite simple. Fallen is THE music for the masses (contrary to the album title of Depeche Mode!), targeted to pop/heavy rock oriented population. While it has some moments (all singles and torniquet), it's incredible how artificial this album is! The singer, Amy, has a beautiful voice (ToriAmosque!), but she can only sing in the same tonal range (at least for now), without any ups and downs, which soon sounds tired and repetitive.<BR>The record is also very forced. For example, My immortal, while a relatively good song, it doesn't produce any specific emotion in me, except &quot;it's ok song&quot;. I've heard a lot better &quot;sad&quot; songs, sung by female vocals (10000 Maniacs, Tori Amos). Also, I think they made this song to be &quot;sad&quot; on purpose. It was like &quot;guys, we have to make a sad song, Kleenex payed us few grands to try to make the people use them with this&quot;. Ok, I was a bit ironic here, but really, I cannot feel any true emotion with this album. It just plays... some songs are good, some are not (the majority).<BR>The only real feeling I get listening to this album is that some songs I want to hear over and over again for some (short) period of time...then I get tired of them. That's what pop sound is all about! This album is Heavy Pop and that's all. Artificial, forced, overproduced and overpolished (especially for a debut!), yet the mixing/mastering is below average!<BR>Want to listen to true sad stuff that can kill you right off? Try The Cure - for example, Charlotte Sometimes. That's what I call a kleenex-song! Not some forced-sad female vocals and a wimpy piano.<BR>But still, I no longer wonder why people like this album and why it has over 4 stars. Simply put, this album was made for large audiences and it delivers some instant-emotions that are easily recognisable and digestible for majority of mediocre population that like &quot;edgier&quot; sound.<BR>Two stars for good singles &amp; videos.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Everybody remembers the scene. It's the one where he walks along the street, dancing, and singin' in the rain. The musical sequence has yet to be surpassed by any film -- even my all-time-favorite musical, &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), doesn't stand a chance. In fact, there's another great musical number in &quot;Singin' in the Rain,&quot; with Donald O'Connor throwing his body around like a rag doll. Even though the singin' in the rain number is the infamous trademark of the film and musicals everywhere, my personal favorite is &quot;Make 'em Laugh.&quot;<br />Not many people know, however, that Gene Kelly had a 103 degree fever during the filming of the infamous scene -- a dangerous thing to do, in retrospect, considering that he was flailing about and working up a sweat in pouring water with such a high temperature. But even then, not many people know that the &quot;rain water&quot; pouring down on the joyously cheesy street was actually composed of water and milk. The milk was added to the mix in an effort to achieve the effect of raindrops showing up on screen. (Mel Gibson noted once that most of the time during the filming of &quot;Braveheart&quot; it was raining around them, but it was basically impossible to notice any rainfall in the film since the sheets of liquid were so thin.)<br />&quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; can probably be called the greatest musical of all time, even though my guilty pleasure is &quot;Grease&quot; (how outdated the film is, and yet how amusing it remains!). Every serious filmgoer knows this movie, and just yesterday as I watched Britain's countdown to the greatest musical ever made, I noted that &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; was high on the list (&quot;Grease&quot; was no. 1, although any list that posts &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Musical&quot; higher on a list than &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; can't be trusted).<br />Don Lockwood (Kelly) is a silent film star in 1927, an ex-musician living an on-screen romance with Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and letting the publicity take their screen relationship to a whole new level (think Ben and Jen's recent tabloid romance). The press loves to think that its two biggest stars are the nation's cutest couple, but in reality Lockwood despises Lamont, and Lamont -- having read trashy magazines -- believes their relationship to be factual. &quot;Oh, Donny!&quot; Lina cries. &quot;You couldn't kiss my like that and not mean it just a teensy bit!&quot; Lockwood: &quot;Meet the greatest actor in the world -- I'd rather kiss a tarantula.&quot; Lina: &quot;You don't mean that.&quot; Lockwood: &quot;I don't? Hey Joe, get me a tarantula!&quot;<br />When the silent film studio begins the transition from silent film to new &quot;talkies,&quot; it means that Lockwood will have to take acting lessons in able to learn to truly be able to act, and Lamont -- a squeaky-voiced young lady -- will have to learn to learn proper grammar. (Some scenes with a grammar instructor reminded me of &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; truth be told, although it was filmed 12 years afterwards.)<br />Lockwood meets a young girl named Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), who refuses to fall victim to his Hollywood charm but eventually learns to love the guy after he gets her out of a tight squeeze or two.<br />Meanwhile, Lockwood's pal, Cosmo (O'Connor), suggests that they start to stage film musicals instead of feature &quot;talkies&quot; -- that way, all Lockwood needs to do is sing and dance, something he already excels at. (&quot;Make a musical! The new Don Lockwood: he yodels! He jumps about to music!&quot;)<br />But people want Lockwood and Lamont, not Lockwood by himself, and the prospect of losing money is not a bright prospect for the film company. So Lina is filmed in the musicals with him, and towards the end of our film, sweet young Kathy dubs over Lina's voice and is given no credit for the task. Lamont is too embarrassed to admit that she can't sing, and so she blackmails the filmdistributor -- if they credit Kathy at the end of her new feature film, she'll take legal action.<br />And so comes the climatic finale on stage as Lockwood reveals the true singer behind the film (ironic, since it was Lamont herself who dubbed over Reynolds' voice during the sequence). As Roger Ebert noted, the scene where Lockwood bursts onto stage and fingers out Kathy from the crowd of onlookers is corny, but it's sweet and exactly the time of emotionally uplifting moment that is rarely made nowadays.<br />Gene Kelly's notorious cruelty on the set of &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; has become a sort of folklore, and it's true. He berated the actors if they messed up a single dance number. O'Connor later admitted that he was extremely frightened to make a single mistake, afraid that Kelly would lash out at him.<br />That strictness doesn't shine through Kelly's character in &quot;Singin' in the Rain.&quot; In fact, many of the dance moves (such as the frantic splashing in the puddles) look quite haphazard, but they were all choreographed to an extreme.<br />Is that why the film is highly regarded as perhaps the definitive American musical? That probably has something to do with it. I think it's mostly the joy of it all, though -- bright, cheery, happy, and uplifting, the film is one of the most purely fun films of all time. It doesn't demand anything like some films, but it gives a lot back.<br />The ads for &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; promised a glorious feeling, and in that way the film lives up to its slogan. It is fun and bright and glorious and entertaining. It doesn't take itself seriously, but it offers the viewer a chance to experience something quite rare -- an all-around great movie. <br />What a glorious feeling, indeed.
B000089RVR|5.0|What can I say. I love the song White Flag. Five stars to you Dido!
B000002P5W|1.0|A great album on vinyl, but I noticed the latest CD mixed out the opening lyrics for the masterpiece, &quot;if 6 was 9.&quot;  This type of remixing is also noticable on other Hendrix songs and albums as well (e.g. &quot;purple haze&quot; lyrics on the Experience album are barely noticable on the latest CD, etc.).  This is unacceptable, and changes my review of a 5 star &quot;album&quot; to a 1 star &quot;CD.&quot;
B00005UKE0|4.0|Not a great one.  The inclusion of \\"The Original Jam\\" (originally titled 'Apple Jam') simply does not warrant this.  Any musician can get his friends together in the studio and jam, record and release it.  But George does this and it inflates the cost of his 2 disc set.  For what?  As it is, the orignal 2-disc set (with some exceptions) more than stands on its own.  \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" has George starting out his first solo disc with a slow, almost dreamy, country sounding (The Band comes to mind) song. Super tune with a beautiful guitar solo near the end.  \\"My Sweet Lord\\", despite the lawsuits with this song, when I hear those big acoustic guitars and that chanting, I remember that this was THE song of late 1970.  \\"Wah-Wah\\" is one the few songs hurt by the big Phil Spector production employed on this disc.  Being that it is such a good song, it simply doesn't need it.  However, Ringo excels on drums.  \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" is a superb song.  Nice arrangment by John Barham with the strings and good counter melody played by George on guitar but the song goes on too long.  \\"What Is Life\\" is George's pop song--and a darn good one too.  Catchy, with stinging guitar and good horns.  More country leanings with Dylan's \\"If Not For You.\\"  This song  benefits from an uncluttered arrangement.  Kudos here to steel pedal guitarist Pete Drake who performs magnificently on this song as well as others on this disc.  \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" is another fairly sparse countryish production, although not as good as the previous song.  \\"Let It Down\\" has Harrison going back to the big production and succeeding.  Cannon drum shots cut through the reverb to highlight one of Harrison's more thoughtful songs.  \\"Run of the Mill\\" boasts George singing (very well) a gorgeous tune.  A definite highlight of this disc.  \\"Beware of Darkness,\\" lyrically could be the high point for Harrison on this set.  A very interesting and moody piece.  \\"Apple Scuffs\\" is just an ode to the fans who hung around the Apple offices.  Simple and to the point, and it works.  \\"Sir Frankie Crisp\\" a piano driven piece of no real consequence.  \\"Awaiting On You All\\" is another bloated production that is today, almost unlistenable.  Besides, its too preachy.  \\"All Things Must Pass\\" was debuted during the \\"Let It Be\\" sessions.  This song could be the jewel of the set.  Passionately mournful, expertly sung with beautiful words.  Harrison outdoes himself.  \\"I Dig Love\\" is a dud.  Filler.  Did he forget all of a sudden how to write words?  \\"Art Of Dying.\\" Can there be a religious, up tempo pop song about dying?  Sure, but does anyone want to hear about it, that is the real question.  \\"Isn't It A Pity (version 2)\\".  There is no need for this.  Version one sufficed well enough, thank you.  And finally we have \\"Hear Me Lord\\" which closes out the set.  It's not a bad song but by now the overall preachiness of the set has worn in and another song about religion is overkill.  This is unfortunate as the backing for the song is tremendous.  The only redeemable features for me regarding the bonus materials were \\"I Live For You\\" featuring more superb playing by Pete Drake and the alternate backing track of \\"What Is Life,\\" which has the different arrangement which I enjoyed.  The 2 demos (\\"Beware of Darkness\\" and \\"Let It Down\\") didn't peak my curiosity much.  The re-do of the hit \\"My Sweet Lord\\" was just awful.  It's interesting that Harrison would never again use the big Spector production approach again for his material (for the most part).  By cheapening the album with a 'jam' that had no relevance to the rest of the set, Harrison hurt the overall feel of the disc.  However, the disc was a success because of the good songwriting, superb musicianship and crafting of each song.he Apple offices.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|quite honestly one of the best cds i own.  if you like something with substance,  something with soul...  this album is probably for you.  he's got a smooth voice but it's got character.  he often sounds like stevie wonder,  glenn lewis or maxwell...  which is GREAT....  but somehow he manages to make the sound all his own.  he's got a realness about him.  check it out...  you won't be sorry i guarantee it.
0312319517|3.0|A little thing aside first: this is a readable book. But it ain't up to par with what I expect from FF.    The story might have been interesting, if not for the fact that it feels quite contrived in parts, and the author felt the need to push some politcal agendas of his.    Most irritating is the fact that the protagonist is so fricking perfect and has ALL the luck. There is not ONE serious setback for him during the whole book, and he shows not ONE real weakness, whether physical/skillwise or psychological. He can do it all, knows all the right people, and the sun always shines for him. Such a hero is boring. He dies at the end, and we barely care.    As a final note: the purely technical writing style is still good if not that exciting. But when the Cold War ended, Frederick Forsyth lost his background and his touch. Read the Devils Alternative if you don't know him, and if you do, read this only if a 'light yarn' is your idea.
B000003TA4|2.0|sorry to break all you mtv   generation hearts  but i rembember when this  came out working in a record store and wondering what all the hype was about . sure it was better than  all the  fluff/hair metal bon jovi  stuff that mtv was playing  but hardly the  best thing to come along  in the last 20 + years as many  would have you belive  do your self a favor and go listen to JANES ADDICTION'S- NOTHING SHOCKING  OR SOUNDGARDEN'S- LOUDER THAN LOVE both  far better than nevermind as far as the grunge thing  i'd  say  ALICE IN CHAINS- FACELIFT was far more intresting and  DIRT far better  than nirvana's- nevermind  sorry  i didnt belive the hype nor do i belive it now  over nirvana or nevermind.
B000023VR6|5.0|This album is a modern classic! Dr. Dre's personal rapping skills are sometimes questionable and some songs may sound out-of-place, but &quot;2001&quot; comes from the most highly respected rap producer of our time and features a countless list of excellent rappers. The perfectionistic production of every beat on the album is another reason why it should not be missed. Again, you may well dislike a few tracks on this album, but you should not, you can not miss it. His last album was the Chronic, but he still 's got it!
B00007KQA3|4.0|As a film designed to warn audiences about a bad-case scenerio, 1984 (like the Orwell book it was based on) is an excellent instance of what Aristotle called &quot;deliberative rhetoric&quot;--a piece meant to urge people to consider what they should do (a) to achieve future happiness and/or (b) to avoid future misery. Orwell, who was dying of cancer while he wrote the book, was NOT writing science fiction to entertain people, nor was he attempting to &quot;predict&quot; the future. Following World War II, he saw disturbing trends in England and the other victorious nations: sophisticated techniques were being used to manipulate the masses to react in ways desired by politicians and businessmen. Orwell feared that the Allies' governments and businesses would become the new enemies of their own citizens. Writing in 1947, Orwell chose the date 1948 and merely reversed the last two numbers to set his tale of despair and disillusionment in the near future, 1984, hoping that common people would wake up and AVOID any similar unhappy fate. Winston Smith (well played by John Hurt in this version) is a kind of generic good person we are meant to root for as he rebels in little ways against the control of Big Brother. Orwell's strategy is to horrify us by having Smith and his lover get caught and have their spirits totally crushed. When evil triumphs (and Richard Burton does an excellent job here), we, the audience, are supposed to react with anger and indignation: in this case, back in 1984 (the year this film was released) we were meant to go out of the movie theaters and take action to FIX what is wrong in our society. Alas, as Aristotle says, no persuasive technique is foolproof. Neither the original book nor any film version of it has done much to wake up most people to the dangers of the wide-spread deception and manipulation that are still with us. (Other films/novels that use this same shock strategy to try to give us different wake-up calls are COOL HAND LUKE, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, and FAHRENHEIT 451.)EW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, and FAHRENHEIT 451.)
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Things that might help:<BR>- leans away from pop<BR>- if you never bought any of Britneys previous cds maybe you might like this style<BR>- if you have then it will surprise you with something different<BR>- you don't hear the range of her vocals<BR>- music overbearing her weak, trying to sound sultry singing (get arguilera, simpson, moore if you want to hear good vocals)<BR>- &quot;Toxic&quot; is the best song <BR>- no good lyrics<br />Ok, I liked Britney's 2 previous albums because they had some taste in it with good pop music.  Sometimes pop doesn't have good lyrics because its the beat that carries it.  However, this album doesn't have great lyrics nor good tunes, it sounds messy.
B000066NW0|1.0|first of all, avril is an awful singer. on her CD she sounds prettey good, but live shes terrible. i've heard her live and it sounds like a dying chicken. they just change her voice and make it sound good on her CD. buying this CD was an absolute waste of money because at this point, hilary duff and britney spears sing better than her. DONT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!
B00005QENZ|2.0|Get A Grip continued Aerosmith's amazing comeback. It was their first #1 album and spawned 4 hit singles, although none hit the Top Ten. But while this album sold in the millions, it's much weaker than the previous albums Done With Mirrors, Permanent Vacation, and Pump. Part of the blame must be centered on the 3 sappy ballads featured here which were all big hits even though they weren't among their best songs. It's like their record company told the band, \\"Hey guys, the songs here aren't up to par. So you better write some more power ballads if you want to hold on to the masses.\\"<br />The first half of the album is clearly the stronger half and features the great rocking tracks \\"Fever\\", \\"Eat The Rich\\", and the title track. \\"Living On The Edge\\" was the first single and is also a very good track. Then the album goes downhill. \\"Flesh\\" and \\"Walk On Down\\" are decent songs, but not as good as anything on Permanent Vacation or Pump. The second half of the album is power ballads and filler. The forgettable rockers \\"Shut Up And Dance\\", \\"Gotta Love It\\", and \\"Line Up\\" share space with the aforementioned hit ballads \\"Cryin'\\", \\"Crazy\\", and \\"Amazing.\\" The ballads are among their worst, with only \\"Amazing\\" being decent. All told, Get A Grip is one of Aerosmith's weakest albums. If you want the hits, just pick up Big Ones or O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This review refers to the rather transparent review given by a woman from the UK.  No, Agatha Christie would certainly not have written something this good, she struggled to produce decent books for most of her life, though appealing to an audience of a rather subdued level of literary exposure.  This is smooth, intelligent script writing, with some minor flaws.  Lush yet cold, observant but secretly intrusive.  Smith indeed steals many of the scenes, but Gambon is superb at stabbing them all in the back...
B0000A0DXA|1.0|I got all excited when I saw this DVD sitting on the shelf so I picked it up and read the back of it.  I figured that since I had Part 1 that I would add this to my collection.  What a rip off! All this movie is is Part 1 with the stupid director-in home video form-talking, trying to convince you that Part 1 was based on a true story.  You can even see him smiling while he is trying to act serious.  I think he knew that he probably screwed alot of people out of their money because when I tried to take this back for a refund I was told that since it was unwrapped that I could not return it.  Well Ulli, or whatever the hell this so called directors name is, here some advice-read up on FALSE ADVERTISEMENT LAWS because I have a feeling that after this crappy stunt you might be getting into some trouble.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just got the DVD box set for Christmas.  <br />What I like most about the series is it turns stereotypes on its head.  One episode in particular made me start wincing and laughing.   Mal was being tortured after several horrible scenes he somehow got loose.  At the same time Serenity's crew was coming in for an impressive rescue.  By the time Zoe and two others came in the torture chamber Mal was fighting with one of his torturers.  Jayne was getting ready to shoot the person punching Mal when Zoe said this is something Mal should handle by himself.  Mal hearing this puts Zoe straight by a simple &quot;No, it isn't.&quot; <br />I love the way the show was serious and funny at the same time.  As well as showing the more positive attributes of family and friendship.  Since watching the show back to back for several hours I notice great many episodes show them at the table eating and enjoying one another's company (like family).
B000060P79|5.0|EARLIER I WAS SAYING THAT THIS CD WAS BAD BUT I GOT TO LISTENING TO IT THEN I REALLY LOVE IT!
B00003CXD5|5.0|Here you have a trully great package: a top director (John Huston) and a top star (Bogart) with an great screenplay, music (by Max Steiner), great photography (by Ted McCord) and a top cast. The story revolves around a group of stray losers (stranded in a mexican town) who decide to join forces and go after the (gold) riches of the wild, lawless mexican lands. They are greedy Dobbs (Bogart), honest Curtin (Tim Holt) and wise old Howard (Walter Huston). But the gold fortune they gain from the mountain soon transforms their views and relationships as Dobbs quickly falls into paranoia.<br />This is a trully classic film which deserved a trully great DVD edition... and this is it!! A two-disc edition with everything you can dream of... A great documentary (The Story of TTOTSM) with Martin Scorsese (lots of and others), another documentary about John Huston, two great Bugs Bunny films (one is a funny spoof of this film), A Lux Radio Theater broadcast, a vast gallery of photos and publicity material, a dozen Bogart trailers, one short film, a newsreel... everything you need to reproduce a classic night at the movies back in 1948!!!!!!<br />Obviously, the film in this edition has flawless sound and image... and along with this incredible tray of extras, this is surely the DVD edition to buy.<br />It seems that Warner Home Video is commited to release deffinitive editions of some of its classics (Thanks, WHV!!). I bought this DVD in a box that contains also Yankee Doodle Dandy and The Adventures of Robin Hood (two other two-disc editions who got this first rate treatment).<br />A great buy for an affordable price! Check for the 3 film box containing The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Yankee Dodle Dandy and The Adventures of Robin Hood.<br />John Huston appears briefly (and repeatedly) as the american in a white suit who gives Bogart a coin - surely, the greatest director-cameo I've ever seen in an american classic film.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|this album is not bad at all; in fact, it's quite interesting.  it's clear that he's a fantastic musician with totally original ideas, which is refreshing.  while it's not an album I would play every day, it's definitely something to turn to when I'm in the mood.  and for all of you who, for some crazy reason, think you know classical music enough to make comments, please realize that wainwright quotes ravel's &quot;bolero,&quot; not anything by puccini, in the first track.  the entire song is based on that piece, so no, rufus did not &quot;throw in some horns&quot; to make it sound interesting...  it was a total formula, and is definitely my favorite track.  I'm begging you, do a little research before you &quot;speak.&quot;
B000002UAR|3.0|Every once in awhile I'll give this album a spin after I haven't heard it in awhile, and like it. But it never stands up to a second playing. It's just not that good.<br />I can accept that the Beatles were doing a major gear shift in their thinking and approach to music, and had to crank out this one in order to grapple with the new directions in which they wanted to go. Upon a second listen, I always detect that the album lacks the &quot;soul&quot; and charisma that came across in all of the previous albums (most especially Rubber Soul). If you listen to the singing and playing on this album, it definitely comes across as stiff and even a little tentative and afraid. And there's really nothing to the song structures. Moreover, they used exactly the same &quot;hall of mirrors&quot; trick during this era on the vocals at the beginning of Paperback Writer, the end of She Said, She Said, and at the end of Good Day Sunshine. Not very inventive. The album is just plain cold and impersonal, in some ways making this album their worst, rather than their best (well maybe the stuff they did during the Magical Mystery Tour era was their worst). I think there must have been some points in the Beatles career where they put out an album that deep down they may have been somewhat ashamed of, forcing them to bounce back with something more worthy of them. Thus, Revolver gave us Sgt Pepper to compensate, MMT and Yellow Submarine gave us the White Album (which, if you strip out the second rate crap that clutters the album yields in many ways the best and most personal work they ever did), and the Let It Be fiasco (although I love the new Let It be Naked album; the fiasco was more in their personal lives, financial and legal hassles, and growing animosity towards each other than in the quality of the music) led to Abbey Road.<br />Compared to everything else except MMT, Yellow Submarine and the crappy parts of the White Album, this is the Beatles album I'd be most embarrased to be heard playing. Also, the mixing is not good. The album sounds like hell on my car stereo.<br />Albums I think are better: Please Please Me, With the Beatles, Hard Day's Night, Beatles for Sale, Help!, Rubber Soul, Sgt Pepper's, White Album without the crap, Let It Be Naked, Abbey Road, not in that order.<br />Song by song commentary:<br />Taxman - Take their early era sound. Add bitterness. Chill.<br />Eleanor Rigby - &quot;Yesterday&quot; on steroids. Beautiful chamber music (check it out with no vocals on Anthology!). Add somewhat annoying vocals on top. Lyrics could have been penned by a sensitive 16 year old high school poetess.<br />I'm Just Sleeping - I like this song. It's the first taste of the later era Beatles John Lennon.<br />Love You To - Likeable in many ways. An interesting sensibility and vibe. But still cold and harsh.<br />Here, There, and Everywhere - Amazingly pretty in many ways, but still too cloying and overly sweet. &quot;I Will&quot; on the white album is a better realization of the mood.<br />Yellow Submarine - Sometimes I really like it, sometimes I really hate it. You'd be a real dork to play this one if anyone else was within earshot. It is the first glimpse into Pepperland, however.<br />She Said, She Said - A great song, that if you listen closely somehow had the life taken out of it in how it was produced. The production doesn't do justice to the idea of the song. Separately, everything works: the furious syncopated drumming, the psychedelic jangling guitars, the soaring vocals, Lennon's voice, but it just didn't get put together quite right.<br />Good Day Sunshine - A good song. A little stiff and formal in the delivery.<br />Your Bird Can Sing - I recorded my friend running his nails down a chalkboard and burned a version of Revolver using that rather than this song to try to improve the album.<br />For No One - Interesting, but it comes across as a personal experimental exercise of McCartney rather than something that should have been on the album.<br />Doctor Robert - Likeable in some ways, but unduly repetitive.<br />I Want to Tell You - The lyrics of this song somehow encapsulate the album. There's something the Beatles are trying to say, but they just can't get it across. For this reason I find this song to be quite interesting and enjoyable!<br />Got To Get You Into My Life - Lame and annoying. The tune and feel was lifted to give the theme song for Sigmund and the Sea Monsters on 70's Saturday Morning TV. The song is that good!<br />Tomorrow Never Knows - Now this kicks ass!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is too bad that the series was canned.  It was a great show and Fox was stupid for letting this gem go.  Buy this DVD set and you will not be dissappointed... and then go tell your friends to buy it. By the end of it all you'll wish there was more and you'll be wanting to buy a brown coat... You'll see what I mean. ;) <br />Fox<br />PS- There is a movie in the works. (O_O)
B00000ILDF|4.0|The Face Hugger at the beggining in the EEV is a super-face hugger(shown from a distance in the extended Alien 3 version by a prisoner holding it up). It is much larger and has webbing in between its leg tentacles. The egg this face hugger came from was either carried by the queen and or laid by her at the end of Aliens. She doesn't need her egg sack to lay eggs, its just for extra protection for the eggs as they drop out. She could have even carried the egg containing the super-hugger on her back tentacle spikes, and left it on the drop ship(It never shows her from the back in Aliens until after she drops from hiding). Anyways, even though it is not fully explained in the movie, the script states that this super-hugger has the ability to lay a queen embryo in a host AND a warrior protector alien to defend her as she grows to her full size to lay eggs. So this super-hugger is unique and can produce 2 aliens instead of just the one. I know there are a lot of holes in this plot to cover, but this seems to be the most talked about one. Also, it takes days longer for the alien to pop out of Ripley because Alien Queens take much longer to grow before having all components to function on there own, without the warmth of a host. Hope this helps you understand the beggining. Not the best movie either, but light years ahead of Alien Ressurection.
0061015725|4.0|Prey is the first fiction book I've read in a while; a welcome change from having to take notes on every page of similarly-themed scientific works. It explores a nanotechnological disaster, with self-replicating machines working as swarms to overwhelm their creators. Crichton, as always, has done his homework on this one, with several pages of references contained in the back of the book.<br />The overwhelming theme of the book is man's hubris and our headlong rush into technological achievement. I was reminded several times of Jeff Goldblum's character in Jurassic Park saying &quot;Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they never stopped to think if they should.&quot; It was difficult to believe the extent the characters went to in protecting their precious achievement, (SPOILER AHEAD) though explained dubiously by the machines invading human bodies and influencing them biologically.(END OF SPOILER)<br />Many signs point to &quot;emergence&quot; (see the book by Steven Johnson) being an essential thing to understand for this book. In a nutshell, this is the idea that you can predict the actions and responses of individual agents in a system, but not the agents acting together. As Crichton puts it on page 173:<br />&quot;The results of these interactions could not be programmed. It just emerged, with often surprising outcomes...For the first time, a program could produce results that absolutely could not be predicted by the programmer. These programs behaved more like living organisms than man-made automatons.&quot;<br />The scientists' solution to this unpredictability was to program the agents as predators--whose single desire is to feed. This consistent goal keeps the pack working together.<br />As the authors admit in the book The Experience Economy, &quot;Those who decried previous economic shifts...failed to stop the progression of economic value to higher-echelon offerings. It happened despite their protestations.&quot; The question is not whether machines will reach this level--it is how we can benefit from that.<br />Crichton stops short of admitting that or any other further possibilities of this technology, but manages to create a good thriller nonetheless. 4 stars for the story, but the philosophy behind it will require more exploration.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|As noted elsewhere, there is a glitch on the first disc (freezes then skips ahead or chapters back).  This glitch occurs in the original Alien theatrical version in chapter 18 at approximately 1:10 (not the director's cut).  Interestingly, the scene that skips in the original theatrical version has actually been cut from the director's cut (director's cut is 1 minute shorter).  Not really a big deal though... the extras and transfers more than make up for this problem which appears to be fairly widespread.
B00005JLT5|4.0|\\"The Pianist\\" wasn't an easy movie to watch, and it's proven even harder for me to review.  To put it mildly, this isn't a feel-good movie, and I certainly wouldn't recommmend it to everyone.  Telling the story of a young Jewish piano prodigy who manages to survive the Nazi occupation of Poland, this film is almost unfailingly bleak and depressing, practically making \\"Schindler's List\\" seem cheery by comparison.  I've read about the Nazis' incredibly harsh rule in the conquered territories of eastern Europe, but seeing it on screen is still daunting, and Roman Polanski's camera is there to capture the physical and mental devastation that World War II brought to Poland.  Not a movie you'd go to on a first date, to be sure.<br />Throughout the harrowing first half of the movie, we see the humanity of the ghettoized Jews reduced by degrees until their lives have become as meaningless and disposable as those of cattle.  There are some brutal scenes of schockingly callous violence perpetrated by German soldiers, but the violence itself isn't even the worst part.  The systematic denial of humanity that enabled such senseless mass killing is much worse, especially since we still see this going on in various conflicts today.  And unfortunately, you can't remind yourself that it's just a movie.<br />As reviewers more eloquent than I have pointed out, protagonist Wladyslaw Spzilman isn't even really a hero.  Those Jews smart enough to realize their impending fate and brave enough to fight back are killed just like the rest.  His experiences during the German occupation of Poland don't constitute a tale of heroism so much as they illustrate the power of man's primal urge to survive.  Once Spzilman goes into hiding with the help of a few good Samaritans, nothing much happens; by then the psychological damage has been done anyway.  The prevailing failing of this second hour is one of the overwhelming emptiness that characterizes a country turned into a wasteland.<br />By hiding out Spzilman has escaped the death camps, but his fight certainly isn't over.  Not only does he have to worry about getting through the rest of the war in the most hostile environment imaginable, but there's a question that nagged at me throughout the movie: does Spzilman even manage to retain any of what made life worth living in the first place?  How could anyone?  That's why the famous late-movie piano-playing scene assumes such importance.  When Spzilman plays for a sympathetic German officer, it's not only a moment of catharsis for the audience, it's a reaffirmation of his very humanity.<br />In the end, \\"The Pianist\\" is worth watching, even if, like me, you may decide afterwards that you have no urge to see it again.  If nothing else, it serves as an example of what can result from failure to acknowledge our shared humanity.  That said, Polanski's portrayal of the Holocaust is surprisingly free of political correctness, making clear that there were good Germans and bad Jews to be found.  Unfortunately, moral ambiguity is often in short supply in Hollywood, but this is hardly a Hollywood movie.  It doesn't go down anywhere near that easily, which is part of what makes it so compelling.g out Spzilman has escaped the death camps, but his fight certainly isn't over.

B00005JLR6|3.0|IN AMERICA is the story of an Irish family that moves to New York to escape the memory of a child who has died tragically. The father (Paddy Considine) is an aspiring actor and the mother (the great Samantha Morton) is forced to take a waitressing job as the family can only afford to live in a drug infested Hell's Kitchen tenement. The two young daughters (Sarah and Emma Bolger) rely mostly on each other since the parents both seem to be numbed by grief. <BR>It's a very episodic film, filled with snatches of moments as the family settles in to their new home. Johnny, the father, can't find acting work and takes a job as a cab driver. The kids start a new school where they are inexplicably alienated from all the other students. Things go along, and a pregnancy threatens the health of Morton's character. The circumstances of the child's death, whic hovers over everything, are never explained clearly--references are made to falling down the stairs and to a brain tumor. Most predictably, the family is pulled out of the doldrums by their encounter w/ a neighbor (Djimon Hounsou, in a role so symbolic he should have had \\"Life Force\\" written on his clothes) who is dying of AIDS. Of course, he reminds the family what's important. (Hounsou actually performs with great warmth and makes the best of this cliched role). <BR>The movie is constructed so that just when things seem at their worst there's a moment to remind us how great life really is (a snowball fight, a bizarre scene at a street fair)... It ends on an up note, although I'm not sure it's earned. Made with great skill and affection by Jim Sheridan, who directed and cowrote the autiobiographical script with his two daughters. Morton and the kids are good, but Considine can't suggest the necessary degree of inner turmoil.  Worth a look ...
B00005N5S5|5.0|I said a couple weeks ago on this site that I considered \\"Terminator 3\\" arguably the best of the series, but having just watched this one again after buying it on DVD I have to rethink my position.  In the few years since I last watched this movie, I had forgotten how dark and disconcerting it managed to be without any uber-expensive special effects.  Since it didn't have anywhere near the budget of its sequels, the original \\"Terminator\\" had to rely on some old-fashioned devices like detail, atmosphere, and characterization.  The second and third installments were certainly solid efforts, but they seem almost sterile in comparison.  This is easily the rawest \\"Terminator\\" movie, and all the better for it.<br />While the screenplay is a model of tightness and efficiency, it's James Cameron's grim vision and stark direction that steal the show.  Nuclear-age paranoia has been a staple of filmmaking at least since \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" but the image of the future depicted here is even more unflinching than most.  The L.A. of the 1980's is made to look pretty dark and desolate, but the post-apocalyptic dystopia of 2029 is much worse.  It's a cold, mechanized world, with laser-firing machines roaming around and human skulls littering the landscape in a very nice touch.  And in 1984, man and machine do battle with nothing less than the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.<br />\\"The Terminator\\" is probably most notable for introducing a new entry into the pantheon of legendary movie supervillains with the role that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger into mega-star status.  As the fearless, guiltless, pitiless twenty-first century killing machine known simply as the Terminator, Schwarzenegger cuts a largely silent swath of destruction through 1984 Los Angeles, killing almost everyone unlucky enough to get in his way.  With the square-jawed Schwarzenegger striking a very imposing figure, the Terminator has become an enduring film villain precisely because it's so mechanical and unfeeling.  In one especially chilling scene, a heavily armed Arnold nonchanlantly strolls through a police station, wordlessly shooting up defenseless cops who have no idea what they're up against.  I can't help thinking that the Terminator would've made a great Nazi.  And when its skin gets burned off and it's reduced to a metal skeleton with fiery red eyes and an evil grin, the Terminator is even scarier.<br />The movie's human characters don't fare too badly either.  If there's one area in which \\"The Terminator\\" clearly outdoes its successors, it's emotional depth.  Arnold may be the picture of cool detachment, but the unfairly neglected Michael Biehn (who managed to carve out a decent career himself) turns the future soldier Reese into a tortured soul worthy of Shakespeare.  Everything this guy says and does is intense, fuelled by the horrors that he's experienced and that he knows are coming.  And over the course of the movie Linda Hamilton turns the hapless Sarah Connor into a genuine tough chick, a role that would be taken to its logical conclusion in \\"Terminator 2.\\"<br />Since this movie the \\"Terminator\\" franchise has taken on a life of its own, with Arnold playing no less than three different cyborgs in increasingly expensive epics.  The original still hits the hardest though, precisely because it relies more on writing and direction than the special-effects blockbusters of today (this certainly doesn't just apply to the \\"Terminator\\" movies either).  Not to mention, this movie introduced the line \\"I'll be back\\" to the national dialogue, for which we should all be eternally grateful.  In this writer's humble opinion, the \\"Terminator\\" series decks it out with \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" for the title of THE movie trilogy.nd unfeeling.

B0000E2FLC|5.0|This DVD is a MUST HAVE for any fan of AC/DC! What a performance by all, especially Angus. The guitar solos alone are worth the price of the DVD, this guy is FANTASTIC! All of the wanna-be guitar players of the world will want to see these fantastic licks and riffs. The audio and video quality of this DVD is superb, the camera always seems to be in the right place all through the video. If you really want to see AC/DC in one of their finest concerts, don't pass this one up! I have watched this DVD several times and I'm simply amazed each time I watch it. Really good stuff!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|What happens when a band that were kings of all metal falls from grace(rather ungracefully)during the proceeding decade? Why they reunite their classic lineup and shatter the expectatons, of course! Following the 5-year split with singer Bruce Dickinson (and nearly a decade split from guitarrist Adrian Smith), the Classic Maiden line-up plus 3rd guitarrist Janick Gers reunited to stage a comeback that would take the metal world by storm. The resulting album was Brave New World, an album that picked up in the directon of their last classic album 7th Son of a 7th Son. It was essential that Bruce was with them during this album, as former singer Blaze Bayley would not have had necessary range. The album isn't without it's faults. At first listen it'll be near perfection but when given a closer listen one will notice some of its flaws. the first half is mildly dissapointing, but the brilliant second half more than makes up for it. <br />The album starts of in the explosion of The Wickerman, one of the finest openers of Maiden's career and one of the most climatic songs too, this song is vintage Iron Maiden, an a glorious way to start the album. Ghost of the Navigator is a fine song, as is the title track, but they do not really display much feel and dont rise much above average. Blood Brothers is an improvement, and a pretty good track with great lyrics and good keyboard work. The Mercenary is the lowest point, a track that barely reaches mediocrity. The first epic, the 9 minute Dream of Mirrors is where the band hits its stride, delivering an huge epic about dreams and deja vu's, with another great climax and an awesome use of dynamics. The Fallen Angel is a heavy rocker, the heaviest track of the album, and not dissapointing in the least bit. The Nomad is another song of epic proportions. it takes a while to sink in, but its worth it, as it'll hit you hard at some point or another. The melodic assaoult of Out of the Silent Planet, with its trademark huge chorus is yetanother awesome song, one of the finest of the album. The closer \\"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\" provides such a great end for a great album, a haunting track that may even finds its roots in Pink Floyd (another reference to this band is in Wickerman, \\"piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way\\")!<br />As a whole, this album may not be the most consisten Maiden outing, but it is indeed a great comeback effort and one of the finest metal discs of the new millenium.<br />Song Ratings:<BR>Wickerman- 10/10<BR>Ghost of the Navigator- 8/10<BR>Brave New World- 8/10<BR>Blood Brothers- 10/10<BR>Mercenary- 7/10<BR>Dream of Mirrors- 10/10<BR>The Fallen Angel- 10/10<BR>The Nomad- 9/10<BR>Out of the Silent Planet- 10/10<BR>The Thin Line Between Love and Hate- 10/10
B000066NW0|1.0|Avril Lavigne is a joke.  It's astounding that she has a career.  I don't know who to blame - the recording industry which promotes this garbage, or the teenage girls who buy it.  This essentially Britney Spears with dark eyeshadow and a sound with slightly more guitar.  Other than that, there's no difference.  The fact that Avril tries to pass herself off as punk is laughable.<br />Hey kids, the music industry is owned by only a few corporate conglomerates.  Two companies - Viacom and Clearchannel, own practiacally all of the radio stations in this country.  They want to maximize their advertising revenue by playing the same &quot;recognizable&quot; commercial songs over and over (if they play recognizable songs and can get more people to stick around and listen to the advertisements, the advertisers will pay them more money for the ad time).  For radio listeners, that means about the only new music you'll hear is pop garbage like Avril Lavinge.  There is good music out there if you look for it, but this isn't it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|After 4 unremarkable (to say the least) studio albums and one gigantic come-back, Iron Maiden return with their best album since 7th Son. This is their \\"sophomore comeback\\" effort, and it's certainly no slump, as it further continues the achievements of Brave New World and even surpasses them.     The opener \\"Wildest Dreams\\" is really the only letdown in the whole album, as we're used to have a rousing powerhouse of an opener for Maiden albums, however, it does become better as you let it sink in. The secon single, \\"Rainmaker\\" is a catchy number that captures the 3-guitar attack that Maiden employs at near-perfection. The first 'epic' track, \\"No More Lies\\", is a pretty good track, even though it could've been much shorter without sacrificing quality. \\"Montsegur\\" is when the band finally kicks into Fantasy-Metal Territory, as it is an awesome rocker about the Templar warriors that has excellent major-minor key dynamics. Next up is the title-track, which tells a similar tale to that of the classic Number of the Beast and bears some reassemblance to Heaven can Wait, except now we have the 'protagonist' stumbling over a ritual dance by undead fiends that separates his soul from his body. Great Stuff. The Next two tracks, Gates of Tomorrow and New Frontier, may appear like filler at first, but worry not, after some listens you'll discover these songs have extremly catchy choruses plus very interesting lyrics (esp. New Frontier, which deals with cloning to much better results one might expect). Paschandale is the album centerpiece, a mighty war Epic about a dead soldier. The guitars doubled by the strings and the pounding drumming almost give the impression of cannons being fired; its truly a track that will become a Classic. Face in the Sand and Age of Innocense are great songs which deal with very modern issues as well. The former is driven by great double-bass drumwork while the latter is one of the gems of the album, with one of the best maiden choruses yet. For the album closer, Maiden tackle the acoustic ballad to create a great closer unlike any other song by the group.    It is great to see maiden do something few groups manage to do so late in their career: begin to improve. I hope this signifies great new things from the band, and lets hope their career still has a lot to offer.

B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden have always had a fame for releasing insanely consistent albums, and this one is no exception. Powerslave is a Classic metal album that pounds the listener with adrenaline from beginning to end, and only manages to stop at certain points of the 13-minute epic of Rime of the Ancient Mariner, but otherwise just keeps on pounding. The Band's preformance tight and inspired, nearly as much as the amazing songwriting skills they possess. <br />The opener Aces High is probably the best opener Maiden have written, and it's one of the high points of the album, starting it out with the right foot (and that is an understatement). The biggest strength og this number is the catchy chorus, which showcases Bruce Dickinson's &quot;Air Raid Siren&quot; at its best. Next up is the anti-war tale, 2 Minutes to Midnight, which is another great Maiden classic. The instrumental Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) is one of their finest, instrumentals, if not their best. The next two pieces are worthy rockers that follow the usual Maiden formula and again are a display for Dickinson's awesome voice. Back in the Village is my least favorite off the album, but it's still a pretty good song. Fortunately, the magic is instantly regained with the pounding work of the title track, Powerslave, and it's delicious &quot;Egyptian&quot; riff, one of the very best tracks on the album. However, it's the closing epic Rime of the Ancient Mariner that serves as the greatest achievement, a huge epic based on the writings Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Far and away one of the finest tracks Maiden have ever cut, another work that establishes Steve Harris as one of the most talented songwriters in metal ever.<br />All in all, this is one of Maiden's best, and a brilliant chop of British Metal that should more than satisfy a majority of Metal Fans.<br />Song Ratings:<BR>Aces high- 10/10<BR>2 minutes to Midnight- 10/10<BR>Flash of the Blade- 9.5/10<BR>The Duellist- 9/10<BR>Back in the Village- 7.5/10<BR>Powerslave-10/10<BR>Rime of the Ancient Mariner- 10/10
B000002U82|5.0|Simply the greatest album ever produced, deserve 6 out of 5 stars
0385504209|4.0|Whatever my other thoughts of the book are, this is definately a page-turner.  It's easy to get caught up in the thriller aspect and Dan Brown obviously had his eye on Hollywood as he wrote.  I liked the way he wrapped ideas (some I knew of, some I didn't) as part of the story.  He has a message which he delivered in an entertaining way.  I disliked the more obvious storyline cliches.  But I was always aware of the blaring question.  When did the characters sleep?!
B000065LXZ|2.0|This signaled the end of Supertramp as I liked them.  Their previous albums rocked with some serious songwriting and musicianship.  This is where Supertramp got on the bubblegum bandwagon, going for AM radio play.  I love Crime of the Century and Crisis, What Crisis?  Even in the Quietest Moments is downright boring
0684803356|4.0|It cracks me up how Hemingway refuses to write swear words and the word &quot;obscenity&quot; becomes a verb, ie. We are obscenitied!<br />The obvious Spanish syntax is interesting as well and I imagine that those not fluent in Spanish would find the English both twisted and awkward at times.(example, Hemingway writes, &quot;For a favor, do this!, which seems a direct translation of &quot;Por favor&quot;.<br />Another example is &quot;How many years to you have?&quot; (Cu&aacute;ntos a&ntilde;os tienes) instead of the proper English &quot;How old are you?&quot;.  It's as if Hemingway wrote the dialogue in Spanish and then translated it word for word into English. I'm not sure if this is genious or annoying.<br />Regardless of this goofy English, the novel is a good read and I recommend reading it.
0345441184|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and would highly recommend it to anyone, especially someone who enjoys the Arthurian legends.  I love how the women of this book are so empowered and have a hand in the fate of Arthur.  Pick this book up and be prepared to not want to put it down!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|This CD did not live up to all the media hype.  I only liked 2 or 3 songs.  She basically moans, groans, purrs,...does everything BUT sing through the whole CD.  She needs to show us her vocal ability.  Her previous 2 CD's were alot better...huge disappointment.
B000002BFZ|3.0|This was the first disappointment from Pearl Jam.  It is a very good album, but just a letdown from their previous efforts.  No matter how hard I try to like it, I just can't stand &quot;Who You Are.&quot; This was the first single from the album.  Everyone I knew said, &quot;Have you heard the new Pearl Jam song?  It sucks.&quot;  It really does.  Luckily, the overall album is much better, but this was still a let down after Ten, Vs, and Vitalogy-which were all classics.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is a great CD.  Christina definately has powerful vocal talent.  The songs are very well written and performed very well.  Christina dug deep down inside herself to write these songs AND sing them.  I would definately recommend this to anyone.
B0000027RL|5.0|Rock critics will, justifiably, talk forever about Nirvana's Nevermind and how it changed music.  Ten did just as much to get rock music out of the hair band crap era as Nevermind did.  I feel Ten is a more listenable album than Nevermind.  This album was liked by just about anyone who heard it.  It was more listener friendly to the average person listening to the radio.  And thank God MTV and radio people began to push this new sound over the Bon Jovi, Winger, Use Your Illusion-era Guns n Roses that had dominated airwaves.  I always enjoyed rock music, but when the &quot;Seattle sound&quot; of Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Nirvana came out it was taken to a new level.  This is truly a classic album.  I either wasn't around or didn't care about music prior to 1985, but for my era this is a top 5 album.  It might be the best
B00004XONN|5.0|How do we say that an album is the best that came out of an artist? perhaps, some will say, it is measured by how many number 1 hit singles it has spawned or something like that. for me, it is the total impact of the album on the music generation, of how influential and MOVING the album was put against a music background that is largely vulnerable to a lot of musical styles and innovation. Radiohaed was ahead of our time with this one. COnfessingly, i am a radiohead fan. and has been a fan for years. and again honestly, i assess that their latest, &quot;Thief,&quot; is a slight disappointment. it cannot be put at par with other radiohead greats, &quot;ok computer,&quot; &quot;amnesiac,&quot; and this one. so i can say that this is as unbiased that i can get.<br />Kid A, as some people would say, is one long song with countably 10 parts.. if you listen to it from start to finish, a general, uniform mood is created and felt. that of melancholy and desperation. thoughts and moods ranging from expectations to disappointment, insecurities to alienation, paranoia to cynicism, and from discord to hope.. beyond words, really. <br />this requires an appreciative and open mind..
B00006CXSS|5.0|Incredible!  The realism and photography give one a new appreciation of what our boys did for us in World War II.  Some scenes are not pleasant to watch, but they are not there for shock value.  Instead, they are done in such a way that it only emphasizes the sacrifice.  Strong language throughout the movie.  The language, coupled with some realism, make this a movie for adults.  Nevertheless, it is one that every American should see.  Fantastic directing and excellent acting combine to make this the best &quot;docudrama&quot; I have ever seen.  Every episode kept me spellbound.  Destined to become a World War II classic.
1400049628|3.0|Although initially I had great enthusiasm for the book, after I got half way through it I became increasingly bored. Though some of the author's ideas were great, the book could have been condenced into a hundred and fifty pages and I found myself wondering if my time could have been better spend reading a zombie novel instead.
0385504209|4.0|I just wrote a very in-depth review of the book, and my computer deleted it when i previewed it (and by the way, im not incompetent when it comes to computers).  Anyway, i'll sum up what i said in one sentence:  The book was good, considering i don't tend to like mystery thrillers, though i was annoyed at the astounding assumptions and conclusions made by Langdon and Sophie, which tended to make the book somewhat unrealistic and idealistic.
B00006LI4S|5.0|There was a time when I went nowhere without a Pink Floyd album close at hand. &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; formed the crux of my listening habits for nearly two years back in the days when such things mattered more than they do now. Eventually, I picked up every Pink Floyd album I could lay my hands on, along with solo albums from Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Syd Barrett. Probably the capper of my Pink Floyd listening days was finally getting to see them live in 1994. I don't listen to this stuff as much as I once did, but anytime I get a chance to check out something new I usually do it. That is why I decided to watch &quot;David Gilmour in Concert,&quot; a collection of concert footage shot between 2001 and 2002 in London's Royal Festival Hall. There are no fireworks, no huge video screens, and no massive sound system belting out the hits to tens of thousands of people here. Instead, you just get Dave along with a small group of musicians and a few backup singers. Those used to seeing Gilmour blasting out Pink Floyd hits with the rest of the band--sans Roger Waters, of course--will still enjoy how effortlessly he cranks out the music in a much smaller venue than he is probably used to playing.<br />Arguably the most notable songs on this DVD are the Syd Barrett tunes Gilmour adds to his play list. Hearing &quot;Terrapin&quot; and &quot;Dominoes&quot; performed live really thrills, even if it isn't Syd Barrett doing them. Gilmour has a perfect right to play these songs, in my opinion, because he helped produce Barrett's solo albums back in the early 1970s. Heck, he even provided back up on more than a few of them as well as performing live with Barrett during a few abortive live shows. History has it that Gilmour and Barrett were very close friends, and the two even spent a summer slumming through France playing tunes for pocket change years before Pink Floyd morphed into the stadium powerhouse we are familiar with today. Fans know that several Floyd albums pay tribute to their crazy founder in one way or another, so finally seeing someone from the band play some of Syd's solo songs provides more than an additional reason to pick up this DVD.<br />Gilmour certainly doesn't stop there. Several Pink Floyd tunes find there way onto the play list. There are two separate versions of the guitar anthem &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; both of which are excellent renditions. On one of them, none other than Bob Geldof--looking very old and sporting a huge comb over--walks out on stage to recite a few of the lyrics, on the other version Soft Machine member Robert Wyatt (I think) does the honors. The guitarist performs a stellar interpretation of parts of &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; from the Wish You Were Here album along with several lively cuts from the Division Bell album. The real treat, for me at least, was finally hearing a live rendition of &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; from the Atom Heart Mother recordings. I have always considered this one of Gilmour's finest contributions to Pink Floyd's body of work, and he doesn't disappoint with the treatment given to it here. Well, he disappoints slightly because the version is acoustic. The vocals sound perfect, but hearing that soaring, groovy electric guitar would have been nice. Gilmour proves that he still has what it takes to make it all look effortless. Pink Floyd fans should not express much disappointment with these performances.<br />A few odds and ends make their way on the disc. &quot;Smile&quot; is a nice little tune that Gilmour says is new. Before playing the song, he goes so far to advise bootleggers to &quot;start recording now.&quot; &quot;Hushabye Mountain,&quot; &quot;Je Crois Entendre,&quot; and a Richard Wright tune, which the Floyd keyboardist turns up to play, &quot;Breakthrough,&quot; rounds out the DVD. Also included is a nifty little tune, &quot;Sonnet 18,&quot; on the disc that shows us the inside of Gilmour's floating recording studio while letting us know that his voice is as strong as ever. It is always nice to hear Gilmour play some non-Pink Floyd material. My only problem is he didn't do enough of his solo songs, songs that are often excellent in their own right.<br />You have completely lost it if you cannot find something to like on this disc. Pink Floyd fans often see Gilmour as a lesser force, usually submerging his talents and importance under the contributions of master lyricist Roger Waters. That's true to some extent, but Pink Floyd would never have made it this far without Gilmour's stellar guitar work. This disc underscores what an excellent musician this man is even without any Pink Floyd influences to fall back upon.

It is always nice to hear Gilmour play some non-Pink Floyd material. My only problem is he didn't do enough of his solo songs, songs that are often excellent in their own right. <br />You have completely lost it if you cannot find something to like on this disc. Pink Floyd fans often see Gilmour as a lesser force, usually submerging his talents and importance under the contributions of master lyricist Roger Waters. That's true to some extent, but Pink Floyd would never have made it this far without Gilmour's stellar guitar work. This disc underscores what an excellent musician this man is even without any Pink Floyd influences to fall back upon. He makes it all look so effortless, as though he is merely crossing the street or doing his laundry.

0385504209|5.0|This book will spark a good conspiracy theory and like most of the 4.3 million readers of this book you'll like it too....First off great book very well written - great plot - and a very original story - the climax was good but if you read it throughly (as the book makes you) you kinda of figure it out..You don't figure out the ending until its too late (but the whole name change was a given). I was dumbfounded to find that the answer all along was given in his draft. I must say that there is alot of facts especially about christianity, and secret societies in the book....Which of course this is a novel but he seperates them very very well. Some people said this book is very anti-catholic - which even though I am not, I did think so until the last 3-4 chapters where well I don't want to give it a way of course but I will say not so much so... Lastly you can buy it at overstock.com for $12.00 or you could a week ago.....Enjoy!
B000023VR6|5.0|this was an amazing album. what amazed me the most was the beats.<BR>the beats are sooo dope. the lyrics were good. another thing i enjoied about this album was how many time snoop dogg guest appeared. This cd is worth alot, it is my 2nd favorite cd i own. first has to be tha last meal by snoop dogg. yo, read my lips, by both of those albums now fools!
1400031354|5.0|I came upon this book cold at the library, never heard of the author or the series. I'm so glad I picked it up. First my husband read it, then I read it, then my sister, then my daughter (31yr. old)--who were visiting for Christmas. We each loved it and passed it to the next one. It goes quickly yet engrosses one completely. It is a treasure. Has a BIT of the feel of the film &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; maybe because of the locale...but also the pure joy and goodness of the people in this story. I can't wait to find more stories of Ms. Ramotswe and her friends.
B00004CIBB|4.0|I love the film, both versions.  HOWEVER, one thing most reviewers seem to overlook regarding the Director's cut is that we already know the film and are familiar with the general film noire approach to the story, character interaction, development, and so on.  <br />Classic film noire often needs narration. Even if Ford initially narrated poorly on purpose, it kind of fits in with the character.  Besides which, the D Cut does nothing to replace the narration, so there are great gobs of panoramic dead air, with maybe a bit of background music.  It becomes a struggle to stay focused. I tested this with two of my Media Studies sections, and the narration kept the most audience attention hands down, not to mention a keener grasp of the film.  <br />I think a perfect marriage would be to include the extra footage, the D cut ending, and selected portions of the narration.
B00006GEXQ|5.0|I rented this because I wanted something to make me smile, Pirates of the Caribbean was out, and a rerun of Sense and Sensibility made me remember how much I always enjoy Hugh Grant.  In short:  my expectations were low.  I'd read the book when it came out and very much enjoyed it, but expected a movie to take the premise and make it formulaic.<br />That premise:  a likeable wastrel, a cad with no malice in him, a slacker with money, pretends to have a child so he can meet single mothers-- they are nurturing, sexy, and tend not to want long relationships.  A variety of circumstances forces him into a big-brother-type relationship with a nerdy 12-year old with a suicidal hippy mother.<br />Now, the best thing about Nicholas' Hornby's boos isn't the situation-- it's the insight of the characters, the little thoughts they share that we all have.  Well, like the earlier film of a Hornby book, High Fidelity, this movie captures many of them by using voiceovers-- and it works perfectly!  How can you not like a character who while sincerely upset by having to go to the hospital following the hippy mother's suicide attempt, confides that driving fast behind the ambulance was brilliant?<br />Is there a driver among us who wouldn't secretly think the same thing?  Sure, we wouldn't share it-- but that's what makes Will's character so likeable.  He's basically an honest person-- he only lies to get girls.  He is shallow, knows it, and is content.<br />Or so he thinks.<br />I also love that it's obvious that Will and the hippy mother will NOT miraculously hook up, that the nerdy boy transforms gradually-- no Pretty Woman-like miraculous makeover.  The pair of cool trainers (sneakers) Will buys for him is stolen by bullies!<br />And yet, we do see the characters change.<br />I found I just didn't want the movie to end.  It was charming, and smart.  Hugh Grant plays these smart, charming, mischievous characters so perfectly.  (He plays a similar purposeless-rich-fellow in Two Weeks Notice, which is also a charming movie, but more contrived than this one).  There is real pain and loneliness in the movie, but they are not at odds with the laughs and the heart.  Great ensemble acting all around.   Most of the comedy stems from character, and the characters are recognizable-- flawed, human, lovable.<br />\\"No man is an island\\"-- was it said by John Donne?  Jon Bon Jovi?  Will wonders early on, watching \\"Who wants to be a millionaire.\\"  His character enjoys being an island that occasionally has ties to the mainland-- he considers himself Ibiza (he pronounces it, hilariously, Ibetha, using a Castilian lisp).  Watching Will enjoy himself connecting to others is comic and yet also as satisfying as any AT&T commercial without being half as maudlin.<br />Just what the doctor ordered when you need a diversion that doesn't insult your intelligence; a real delight!
B00005JKCH|5.0|I saw this movies at my cousins,I was really into the movie.I became in love with it, I wanted to watch it again and again.I played the game I watched the movie, does it get better.Alot of high flying stunts, I could tell u that.You dont have to be a Spiderman fan to watch this, the movie is worth watching.
6302891272|1.0|I have currently done extensive studies of Shakespeare's Macbeth. I watched Kurosawa's movie Throne of Blood and was told to compare the two. I tried to note the differences and the similarities. I found very few similarities in the two. I think that Throne of Blood is an ok movie, don't get me wrong, but I felt that it was no comparison to Macbeth. <BR> Throne of Blood has a story line that has many differences to the story line of Macbeth. I understand that many of the happenings in Scotland would never happen in Japan, but there could have been more similarities in the movie. A major part of chilling factors about Macbeth is that the three witches just pop up and are very creepy, but the one witch in Throne of Blood is kind of nice looking and didn't seem very eerie to me; I felt that Kurosawa could have done much more to give the witch a more of a scary feeling. Another difference that could have been added to the movie to make it more like Macbeth was my favorite scene when the door keeper is drunk and has to open the door, and it is a very comedic scene, yet there was no trace of it in Throne of Blood, at this difference I was very disappointed. Also, Kurosawa cut out a very important character in Macbeth! Throughout the whole movie I was wonder, &quot;HEY! Where is Mac duff?&quot; if you didn't notice or didn't find it a big difference throughout the movie, I don't think you watched the same movie! By cutting out Macbeth it took out much of the storyline, there was not a bit of the &quot;Fear Mac duff&quot; or &quot;Not of Women Born.&quot; I felt that this was a critical part of Macbeth, and without that there was not much of a need for the witch. <BR> There were a few similarities that I noticed throughout the movie, although they were hard to spot. The ending was similar in ways, actually I thought the ending in Throne of Blood was very creative and actually a little more entertaining then the ending in Macbeth. I have to admit if I had watched these two different movies without the help of a teacher, I would have never guessed that Throne of Blood and Macbeth had any similarities; I might have just thought the ending was a coincidence. <BR>I definitely didn't find Throne of Blood anything comparable to Macbeth. I feel that Kurosawa butchered Macbeth in so many ways that it wasn't the same story at all. I strongly suggest that people just skip wasting there time watching Throne of Blood and just watch Macbeth.
B00006HBUA|4.0|I first saw this movie at my little cousins house and before I watched it Im like should I watch it and Im like,im gonna give it a chance and when I put it one I laughed my ass off, and I told my sisters that it was good, so we rented and they watched it, it was so funny my mom wanted to watch it and she laughed her ass off.This maybe for kids, but grown ups could watch the movie and laugh there asses off.Really worth watching for kids and grown ups.
B000089QEN|4.0|I have read &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; twice and intend to re-read this coming year. I remember seeing a BBC version with Susan Hampshire in the role of Becky Sharp back in the 1970s, as well as the 1930s Hollywood version with Mariam Hopkins on late-night television when I was a teenager. Now I understand that there is to be another Hollywood version, with Reese Witherspoon, of all the odd choices, to play Becky. Natasha Little is, in my opinion, an outstanding Becky Sharp, surpassing both Hampshire and Hopkins in the role. I cannot feature the vastly overrated Ms Witherspoon being able to give as subtle and natural a performance as Ms Little does in this A&amp;E production. Ms Little is at once appealing and a monster, a woman &quot;on the make&quot;; in one very funny, and creepy, bit she is forced to turn down a marriage proposal from the coarse Sir Pitt Crawley, because she is already married to his dashing  son. When Pitt Crawley leaves the room, it becomes clear that Becky would have married the vulgar old man for the security he offered had she been free.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was very good, particularly the actors portraying Amelia, George, Rawdon, and Dobbin. There has been some criticism of the appearance of the actors, that they were too plain or even downright unattractive for the roles. One of the differences between British and American productions (particularly those made for televsion) is that in British productions the performers are more often selected for their talent than their appearance. Sometimes this backfires, as in the case of the remake of &quot;The Forsyte Saga,&quot; when many viewers complained about Geena McKee being too plain for the role of Irene Forsyte, who was supposed to be a great beauty. In the case of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; I feel that the actors were just right for their roles in every way, including appearance. Becky's attraction was her spirit as much as her face, and Amelia's sweetness was the inspiration for the love and admiration she received from men.<br />My one criticism of the film was the loud background music. It was supposed to suggest a carnival or fair, but it was so blasted loud that at times it drowned out the performers. Although this was not as constant as one reviewer indicated,  it did happen often enough to be annoying. If you like Thackeray, I think you will be pleased with this version of his masterpiece.e and admiration she received from men.<br />My one criticism of the film was the loud background music.

B0000E1ALR|4.0|No matter how good a hits collection is, or how many are made and put out, there is always going to be things that were left off or maybe even included when they really didn't need to be, that will always mar these releases from being truly complete or truly &quot;essential&quot; as they call it. Case in point being this new release of hits from Springsteen. This isn't to say that it isn't a brillaint collection of his work, because it is, but when you go through the trouble of making it and putting it all together, and have three discs worth of space, how can you still have huge notable omissions?. His version of the Manfred Mann hit, &quot;Blinded By The Light&quot;, is here. In fact, it's the first track on the first disc. If that's on here, then why couldn't his, and far superior, version of &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;, made famous by Natalie Cole in the mid 80's, be included as well?. Should of been here. His live top 10 hit version of &quot;War&quot; was a great, rocking effort from the boss, but that's missing too. As is &quot;One Step Up&quot;, &quot;57 Channels(And Nothing On)&quot;, &quot;Better Days&quot;, his top 20 hit &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, and his live holiday track, &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&quot;. It's disappointing. But that's not the most disappointing of it all. Two definitive tracks from the &quot;Born In The USA&quot; album are AWOL too. There is no &quot;I'm On Fire&quot; here, which is odd because it too was not on the 'Greatest Hits' CD that was released a few years ago. Also, &quot;My Hometown&quot; is nowhere to be found either. Not even &quot;I'm Goin' Down&quot; is here. What is already a great and needed purchase could of been so much better if these tracks, which are far more 'essential' than many others on here, were included. The liner notes from Bruce himself give indication that Bruce himself was a part of putting the tracks together. Bruce, why did you leave those out?. Besides these flaws, it is still a brilliant andworthy collection to have. In fact, it's about the best set out there detailing Bruce's long and brilliant career. Many tracks that I have not heard in ages are on here, and most of the big notable hits are mostly accounted for. His biggest hits, &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot;, &quot;Glory Days&quot;, and &quot;Born In The USA&quot; are here, as well as most of his later 80's and 90's hits. I am so glad that &quot;Living Proof&quot; is on here. Hallelujah!. &quot;Human Touch&quot; is a great and underrated song that is so perfectly written, as is his other great late 80's hit, &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot;. His Oscar and Grammy winning song, &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia&quot; is here, and remains to be one of Bruce's most powerful and hypnotic songs. Three tracks from his brilliant &quot;The Rising&quot; CD are on here, and that is such a huge plus. The title track, &quot;Mary's Place&quot;, and &quot;Lonsesome Day&quot;. The third disc has a few worthy tracks on it, like his cover version of the Elvis hit &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, and two bouncy little ditties, &quot;From Small Things(Big Things One Day Come)&quot;, and &quot;The Big Payback&quot;. I am familiar with a number of his 70's work that is presented on the first disc, most notably &quot;Born To Run&quot;, and &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, but a lot I am hearing for the first time since it was before my time and I mainly first got into him in the early to mid 80's. It's a nice treasure trove of music to discover for the first time. Springsteen has always been one of the best, and most brilliant of performers, and has secured himself on the top of the list of gifted and most important lyricists, and this sprawling three disc collection of his work just drives the fact home. Now, if it weren't for those missing tracks....
B000005YU5|5.0|I think so. The new Led Zep dosent come close.Music wise I would say Zep have the edge, because they wrote more classics, but recording quality, not on the same planet. Who ever produced this was well ahead of the game. You just dont get live recordings like this, when the band,venue and producer were there for a one off piece of rock history. My comments are based on the gold dcc version, which I only have a copy off now. Lets have it reissued on SACD with somebody like Bob Ludwig from Gateway Mastering doing the transfer.That is the only way this can be betterd.Music this gets 92% and recording 90%.
0767827716|3.0|Stephen King movies have always been spotty. You get some good ones going, and mediocre to bad ones immediatley come along. It goes back and fourth. This film adaption of King's book of the same name is somewhere between 'okay' and 'pretty decent'. I read the book 8 or 9 years ago and haven't read it since, so my knowledge of the differences between the book and this movie is practically non-existent. What I do know is that this film adaption is a fun little thriller, but is far away from being the best film adaption of a King work, or being near the best of the film's director and composer, John Carpenter. The film centers around young, geeky Arnie Cunningham, who is played by Keith Gordon, who is known for his victimized teen in &quot;Jaws 2&quot;, the son of Angie Dickinson in &quot;Dressed To Kill&quot;, and the collegiate son of Rodney Dangerfield in &quot;Back To School&quot;. Arnie is the classic dork. Dark Buddy Holly glasses, poor wardrobe, bad hair, and an unfortunate physique. It doesn't help any that he is also under his parents' iron thumb. He spots a beat up old car one day while out with his best friend Dennis Gilder(John Stockwell), and buys the car on the spot from the creepy old man who was selling it. Dennis tries to talk him out of it, and his parents even more so, but an upset Arnie keeps it and stores at the auto body shop Darnell's, the namesake played by veteran actor Robert Prosky. But the car, named Christine, has a mind of it's own and it's possession of Arnie soon takes hold. He thinks of nothing but the car, stands up to his parents, starts doing his hair different and stops wearing glasses and nerdy clothes and begins dating the cutest girl in school Leigh Capp, who is played by future &quot;Baywatch&quot; star, Alexandra Paul. And when people and bullies get to Arnie, Christine takes care of them all with her special brand of possessive love. Can Dennis and Leigh save Arnie before it's too late?. You'll have to watch to see. Carpenteris a master at fine suspense and thriller, and while this 1983 effort isn't overly scary, he still manages to supply some of his trademark Carpenter creepiness into a number of scenes. Most of which having to do with Christine's midnight jaunts of horror and mayhem. Things are also given the right mood by Carpenter's subtle, but yet eerily effecting score he keeps playing to the right degree in the background. Keith Gordon is the best of the bunch. He really delivers a contained and realistic performance of a high school nerd dealing with the pressures of every day life that range from strict parents, to bullies in the school hallways, and to generally being a social outcast. He impresses the viewer further when the transformation takes place and gets stronger, more bolder, and grows a back bone. Good job. The rest are all solid enough, especially Prosky, and Harry Dean Stanton who appears in a surprisingly small role as a detective, but it is Gordon that owns the movie and makes the biggest impression. Stockwell is a very likeable presence and has a nice charm to him, but Alexandra Paul is barely given enough time to become a character and before you know it she is already involved with Arnie and the crisis that ensues. One of the film's best assets is the use of old time rock and roll that is peppered throughout the movie. George Thorogood's &quot;Bad To The Bone&quot; is especially perfect for the nature of the film. And while I have given mostly good things to say about the film, it isn't without it's flaws. The biggest question, and biggest flaw, that never got answered was how Christine got to be the kind of car she was. Maybe it was in the book and I can't remember or I just missed something, but why not give a little explanation as to why the car was possessed?. Besides all that, the film is solidly put together into a pretty okay package that would certainly be fun for a nostalgic trip back to early 1980's terror.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I am a total fan of x-men comics and the x-men movies ...<br />Firstly, I don't think the two movies should be compared at all .... both are excellent: x-men 1.5 (the first movie) introduces x-men to us, and x-men 2 is the follow through movie, primarily about wolverines search for his past and the new threat to the mutant populations existence ... and anyone who doesn't like the storyline should consider the fact that this series is based on the comic - so take it like it's meant to be!<br />This is an excellent movie, with heaps of action, twists, and kick-ass moves!  Well worth watching ..... hey, rent it, borrow it, or buy it - it is totally worth watching!!!!!!!!!!!  Additionally, there is a further 4 hours of totally cool 'behind the scenes' type stuff .... most awesome!<br />Can't wait for x-men 3 .... if that ever happens!!!!!
B00005JMCW|4.0|This is the third adaption of the &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; book by author Mary Rogers. The first with Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris in 1977, and the second was a TV movie in the mid 90's with Shelley Long. This new adaption, I have to say, blows the other two out of the water. I went into this film knowing that it will probably be a nice little movie(which it is)and will probably think nothing more of it while and after I watched it. I am happy to say that I am wrong in that case. This Disney released film is a joy and a delight from the first frame to the very last. I credit the screenwriters and director Mark Waters for delivering a breezy, witty, lighthearted, lift me up romp that is sure to please and satisfy everyone looking for a nice family for everyone to watch. The film is about The Coleman family. Mom is Tess Coleman(Jamie Lee Curtis), a widowed psychiatrist trying to maintain a job, a home, and raising her two kids. Son Harry, and her 15 year old daughter Anna(Lindsay Lohan). What we soon come to learn is what we have already expected. Mom and daughter not getting along for all the usual reasons. It's the constant battle between young and adult, kids and parents. Anna is a rebel type who is in a rock band that plays in the garage, gets into trouble at school, and feels like everyone is against her. Mom Tess is just trying to keep things together after their father passed away 3 three years before. Tess is engaged to nice guy Ryan(Mark Harmon), and the wedding is in 2 days or so. After a dinner at a chinese restaraunt where Tess and Anna get into a fight, a chinese woman gives them a magical fortune cookie that makes the two change bodies. They wake up the next morning in each other's body's, and the fun really begins. Each try to be the other - Anna, in Tess' body, tries to do her mom's job and to keep up appearances with Ryan. Tess, in Anna's body, tries to go to school in Anna's place. Each learns a lesson while being each other and it's a lesson wehave come to all know. It's not easy being a teenaged girl when you are going through changes, falling for boys for the first time, and thinking that nobody, especially your parents, don't understand you. And it's not easy being a single parent with a teenaged girl having to deal with her issues as well as your own and caring for the well being of your family and keeping the house standing. It's something we have seen countless times in movies and TV shows, but it really works here. The main reason for that are because of the wonderful performances by Jamie Lee and Lindsay. I have always been a fan of Jamie Lee's, but even more so now. She delivers a great performance that gets to showcase how good she is at comedy and at physical comedy. She has the moody,snotty teenager thing down pat. You can tell she is having a blast doing it, and it comes thru in the performance and enhances it even more. The performance from young Lohan is equally engaging. She was much better when she was acting as her mom than she was when she was herself. Playing her mom, she had a real knack for giving out a parental demeanor and it was strong and even endearing in some of her actions and mannerisms. The success and every winning aspect of this film is because of these two actresses. Mark Harmon has a pretty typical role, but it's nice to see him in a movie again. Chad Michael Murray, who is quickly becoming the new heartthrob for young girls around the world thanks to this movie and his series &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, is Jake. The token &quot;potential boyfriend&quot; that gets into the mix. Like Harmon, it's a pretty by the numbers type of character, but he does what he does. While it is so easy to dismiss a film like this for being light and fluffy, this one has better odds of making a longer impact than others because of it's sweetness and because of the appealing performances from Curtis and Lohan. I enjoyed this film a lot and it is just about as perfect as a nice family film canpossibly be. Nothing more, nothing less.
B00007E8SW|5.0|This is a classical album... so there's not so much to say about it. I want to say something instead on the format SACD.<br />I've got the CD version, the Vinyl version, but with my player, apart of the &quot;silkness&quot; of the vinyl, the SACD is simply fantastic! This new format is quite perfect... and i don't understand why the software house don't move to replace the old CD that have so many limits, comparing for example to the obsolete but still excellent VINYL.<br />Please.....
B0000C0FJB|5.0|This was a great show and to have a snapshot I wonderful.  For any and all RUSH fans, I would recommend this CD.  It is really good.  I suggest taking a look at the DVD as well.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|One of all-time favorite Springsteen songs is missing from this collection(&quot;Secret Garden&quot;), and I find no reason why it was left off. Being a moderate &quot;supporter&quot;(I hate the word &quot;fan&quot;) of Bruce, I was so excited when I ran into this collection at my store, but left feeling dissapointed. If you really would like a great collection of Bruce Springsteen, this is definetly the way to go that includes all his hits up to his latest album &quot;The Rising&quot;(arguably his best album...with some of his best lyrics). If only &quot;Secret Garden&quot; and &quot;Ain't Got You&quot; had made the cut, this would have truly been an Essential Collection of the Boss.
B000060P79|4.0|I thought this CD was great. The only thing was that I wished they would have had a couple more slow songs (only one) but otherwise its great. But people who enjoy &quot;hardcore&quot; punk rock aren't going to like this one. It's kind of like Good Charlotte (some of the band members sing in some of the songs). I recommend this CD.
B000006TRV|5.0|I first was introduced to Pink Floyd by their album Dark Side Of The Moon, Which is a great album. I thought that no music could be better than Dark Side of The Moon. About a month later I bought The Wall. It truly changed my view on music. I listened to the album over and over and could not get over how great the CD was, the great bass line from Waters and the beautiful guitar from Gilmore. I think that this is the greatest album of all time and that you should buy it. Below is a list from 1 to 5 of Pink floyds best albums. 1 being the best and 4 being not the best, but still great.<br />1. The wall<BR>2.

0385504209|1.0|I am amazed that so many people have been taken in by this trite, poorly written novel. The supposedly explosive subject matter is common knowledge to anyone who is evenly reasonably well-read, and it has been discounted long ago. Books like Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and a plethora of others about Mary Magdalene are based on much spurious information and an abundance of paranoia about and downright hatred of Catholicism. It is easier for most people to comfort themselves by bashing the Bible than for them to read it and live it. I am surprised that I hear intelligent people trumpeting these half-baked theories about a Catholic conspiracy. I thought we left that garbage back in the days when it was commonly believed that Catholics ate babies, drank blood, and stored guns under their churches so they could eventually take over the world. Even my Wiccan friends are laughing at this one!!
6305603847|4.0|I bought the wall, the movie because i really like the wall, the album. IT starts as out Pink, the main character, not born yet's father in the war, then goes through Pinks life and all of his problems. This movie explains all of The Walls Lyrics. In the movie there is next to no talking. I rated this movie 4 stars because it has too much blood and graphic sex, and would not be apprpriate for the younger audiance. If you liked the Album the wall, then you will defidentally like the Movie. I hope you found this review helpful.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This is a flawed gem. It has everything from up-and-coming of age drama, sci-fi, horror and bags of philosophy. This is a metaphysics wet dream of a movie and it does move along at a fairly rapid pace and is very funny in parts. The only thing is that the ending is a bit of a let down, but the music score is as memorable as say - Halloween and certainly this is one of the best indie pics we have seen in years. Watch out for this new talent because on the bases of this first movie he is sure to fire out some remarkable stuff on a better budget.
B0000CNY5G|2.0|As many reviewers have noted, the video quality is terrible in many editions.  I have only experienced the Madacy edition -- that's the one where the cover has the original poster, surrounded by a white outline and the actors' names below -- and it's terrible.  I will be sticking with my laser disk until (or if) Paramount releases a studio version.  My two star rating is therefore an average of a &quot;zero&quot; for the technical quality of the Madacy DVD and a &quot;four&quot; for the movie itself (which features some of the most memorable dialog ever in a western, which I understand was in no small part due to Ben Johnson -- Brando would ask him, &quot;Ben, what's a better way to say that?&quot; and Johnson would come up with some wonderfully colorful expression like &quot;I hear there's dirt between ya&quot; or &quot;Don't be doin' her like that&quot;).  So pray for a studio edition, as this movie certainly deserves first class treatement.
B000068W42|5.0|Take a dash of Nirvana, a hint of Red Hot Chili Peppers, some Metal Lite* but heavy on the gee-tar, and you got yourself a trashing, crashing and fast grudge delight that will please many fans of this music genre. There are some fantastic tracks on this album and anyone into the indie scene will appreciate it. You can not go too far wrong getting this album.
B000127LW2|3.0|Although both DS9 and Voyager were continuations of the Star Trek continuum following TNG, each tried to differentiate itself from (happy idealistic) TNG in various ways. DS9 was dark and brooding, and everything didn't work itself out by the end of the weekly episode - generally speaking, DS9 is Star Trek for (brooding?) pragmatists, not idealists, happy or otherwise.<br />Voyager's twist is to be Star Trek for the metaphysical/New Age crowd - a kind of Star Trek for brooding idealists, if you will. I can't forget the scene with Chakotay showing Janeway how to contact her spirit animal/familiar with his meditation rock, during which she gained keen insight into the Problem of the Week and subsequently saved her crew and ship. This New Age element is lost in later seasons (thankfully), but the first two years in particular are notable for this persistent theme, and I can't speak to Season 3. If such alternative practices aren't your style, you may find some of Voyager annoying. I certainly did. Like DS9, Season 1 of Voyager wasn't a happy Star Trek, but in a very different way.<br />Having shared what I perceive to be the greatest flaw of this show, let me also applaud the great characters and settings that were apparent from the get-go. Janeway is a fantastic captain worthy of the Kirk/Picard/Sisko legacy. I have read several reviews that mention her unique command style - its all true, Kate Mulgrew was terrific in the role! Tuvok, Neelix, Kes, Kim, and Paris were also very likeable personae. Chakotay and Torres, the major Maquis characters, were generally good additions to the mix, although they could have been better. I expected the former Maquis members to be stronger characters, along the lines of DS9 Maquis. The most intriguing species from Season 1 (and from any Trek series/season in my opinion) was the Vidiians, a formerly Federation-like, medically advanced race now forced to steal body parts from others for their own survival. The horror factor of this race rivals that of the Borg. The Vidiians are truly to be feared, avoided, and pitied. It was unfortunate that we saw so little of such a facinating culture.<br />As a stout Star Trek, particularly DS9, and Babylon 5 fan, I gave this show a lot of attention early on, but largely ceased watching halfway through Season 2 - I was a bit too New Age for my tastes. I came back and enjoyed later seasons, and I think most viewers would enjoy all 7 seasons of this show - just be aware. I don't think Season 1 of Voyager realized its potential, but it certainly wasn't a bad product. The show definitely recovered to become a very strong addition to the Trek pantheon by the close of the series.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Okay so George made a number of very bad calls with Ep.1 that include: Limited references to the force, Limited use of the force, Not giving us much force and then forcing our patients instead with Jar-Jar and his alien friends. Okay Jar-Jar was not as bad as many had made him out to be. He was a hyper-realistic CGI character and George was also touting us that Ep.1 was just going to be a set-up for the triology and all has been forgiven with Ep.2 which has some of the best Star Wars battle sequences ever seen and is a way darker than this move.<br />Ep.1 is like Ep.2 *lite*. In fact it is lite in nearly every department but the final battle scene is worth the ticket alone. Not a great film by any means but not a total flop either. Ep.1 certainly lowered our expectations for Ep.2 but Ep.2 made up for what this one left out. Ep.3 should be the best of the series with the way things are going but the original still rules them all.
B0000DDAU9|5.0|There are so many good new bands in the underground and Mastodon is one of them.  Combine Neurosis, Unsane, and Sleep and that will give you a general idea of what Mastodon sounds like.  Overall, they have a unique sound of their own that is very tough to classify.<BR>&quot;Remission&quot; is like stoner-doom-metal with high energy.  The first track is a good warm up and then &quot;March Of The Fire Ants&quot; crushes everything in its path.  One of the words that come into mind when first hearing this album is massive.  Mastodon knows how to make the their music build-up to a peak and then explode with brutal strength.  Some songs take a while to build-up to a peak, which just makes the break out of destruction all the more powerful. <BR>The vocals aren't the typical cookie monster growl that so many of Relapse's bands have, but it's a distorted shout.  Mastodon's sound is perfect.  I've heard people talk about the drumming on &quot;Remission&quot; being complex and amazing, but it's hardly the focus of the album.  All the instruments seem to blend together perfectly.  The rumble of the bass gives the album have a massive sound.<BR>&quot;Remission&quot; is an album that makes the listener want to play it again right after it ends; I have several times.  Fans of all types of metal will find this album quite satisfying.  Like the animal their name depicts, Mastodon sounds like a huge beast that cannot be stopped.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Peter Jackson has done more for the DVD medium with this release than anybody can comprehend without watching it. The extended version of the Two Towers just shows the full scope of the entire movie making process. The extra scenes will blow your mind. It was like watching a totally different movie. I sat down and just experienced a NEW Twin Towers and it had all the joys and novelty of sitting through the first cinematic version of the Twin Towers.<br />SIMPLY THE BEST DVD RELEASE TO DATE - EVER!
0446677450|2.0|I found this book to be a nice pep talk, but it didn't have much concrete information in it.  I would recommend the book to people who are looking to convert from consumer to investor, but this book will be mundane for anyone who has taken the first step towards being an investor.<br />Because the book is an easy read (thank God, since it is verbose), I gave it 2 stars.  I would have rated it higher, but the shameless advertising for the authors' other products (and encouragement to purchase such products) was a turn off.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|The hype about this film is the plot twist however it does not turn out to be half as good as what people where saying about it. It is a good ending to a film in a Hitchcock sort of way but does not come close to the twist scene in the Usual Suspects but it is still leaps and bounds ahead of say - Identity. The film is mostly shot in reverse and that is a very cool concept that is committed to the screen in a very daring and remarkable way. Great entertainment value but not the best plot twist we have ever seen by a long shot.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a big fan of Buffy/Angel- so my sister got me this DVD because the creator of Buffy (Joss Whedom) also came up with this series.  At first glance, it seems like a sci fi--which isn't really my type of tv show.  But i am glad that i got this DVD- this is not your typical space/sci-fi/futuristic show.<br />  Firefly is set in the future, but unlike other space shows, it has a different feel.  Space is actually quiet and soundless.  The future seems to be dominated by Chinese. There are high tech weapons (lasers and hovercrafts) but also guns, horses and a western feel to some of the episodes.  This is a view of the future that is quite different from most space shows- more grittier, more real, more of a struggle to survive.<br />  The strength of the show comes from the characters and their interactions with each other--they just happen to be on a space ship.  ( i should have known that any show by Joss Whedom would be one of relationships, diaglogue and struggle)<br />  Firefly tells the tale of a rag tag bunch of outcasts who are on a ship (Serenity).  They are lead by their Captain Malcolm and his first mate Zoe (both would be familiar to fans as Caleb from Buffy's last season and Darla's child from angel-i forget her name.)<br />  Joining them are Walsh (zoe's husband), a doctor and his sister, Kaylee (the mechanic) and Jayne (a kind of mercenary).  Also on board is a preacher and Inara \\"a companion\\" prostitute.<br />  Together this group flies around doing odd jobs- some legal, some not.  They are avoiding the alliance (a quasi govenment bad guy), some strange blue handed men and \\"reavers\\" ( sort of space pirates-murderers) as well as their own enemies.<br />  Like all of JW's shows, the human element and relationships are ones that any viewer will be drawn to- the struggle between Walsh and Zoe's marriage (walsh can't believe that he has married such a beatiful and strong woman when he is the opposite):  the deep respect and trust between Zoe and Malcolm:  the budding romance between Kaylee and the doctor:  Inara and Malcolm's tension and attraction:  and all of them has to intereact and deal with River- the disturbed sister of the doctor who was rescued from the alliance and is being pursued by them.<br />  This DVD set contains 14 episodes as well as the usual DVD extras including the making of firefly, Joss Whedom's comments,a gag reel,  deleted scenes etc.  It is interesting to watch and imagine where this series was headed before it got cancelled- but JW himself hints that there may be another reincarnation of Firefly (another series ??a film ??).<br />**also there is a hidden easter egg--jayne singing the folk song about him, on the last disc**<br />  So if you are a fan of good drama, intriguing characters, and witty diaglogue..get this DVD.  I don't know how it got cancelled (bad timeslot? lack of advertising?) but it wasn't because the show wasn't compelling, fascinating and different.the budding romance between Kaylee and the doctor:  Inara and Malcolm's tension and attraction:  and all of them has to intereact and deal with River- the disturbed sister of the doctor who was rescued from the alliance and is being pursued by them.<br />  This DVD set contains 14 episodes as well as the usual DVD extras including the making of firefly, Joss Whedom's comments,a gag reel,  deleted scenes etc.  It is interesting to watch and imagine where this series was headed before it got cancelled- but JW himself hints that there may be another reincarnation of Firefly (another series ??a film ??).<BR>**also there is a hidden easter egg--jayne singing the folk song about him, on the last disc**<br />  So if you are a fan of good drama, intriguing characters, and witty diaglogue..get this DVD.

078401213X|3.0|Pi is good because using low-budget constraints the director has managed to do a remarkable job of it all, however like most other reviews do say the movie does fall short and never really gets around to sorting itself out and opts for an ending that is shocking but does not really pay-off. Watch it for a good job done on a very small budget with limited characters.
B00005JM02|5.0|I thought this movie was great! My friends and I went to see it just as a gag, but we had a great time.  I even got the DVD the day it came out!  Dory stole the show!
0783225903|5.0|Brazil is a great film that is made in the same vein as 1984 and Brave New World. This is a trippy movie that has all the elements of a film maker who has been let loose to do as he pleases. You will enjoy it if you are expecting madness in a David Lynch sort of way and who could not forget DeNiro in his roll as the SAS type plumber flying around the city. This is a crazy movie and has a remarkably unsettling plot twist in the end. Zany movies do not come much better than Brazil.
B000002I27|4.0|But NO ONE did Halloween like the Doors! This album makes \\"eerie\\" into an art form, with strategic use of echo effects throughout. This is easily my favorite Doors album, with great, Rimbaud, William Blake-type lyrics decrying the sinfulness of society, the recalcitrance of feckless young women and pollution, among other things.<br />One of my very personal favorties on the album, \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\", could easily be called the \\"obsessive mania song\\" for its intensity and powerfully insistent arrangement. \\"Horse Latitudes\\" has oodles of Freudian imagery and puts you in mind of Moses or God Himself screaming from the top of Mt. Sinai. If madness had any patron saints, they were the Doors!<br />The eerie aesthetic carries on even to the romantic ballads on the album, like \\"Love Me Two Times\\", \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\", and \\"I Can't See Your Face in My Mind\\". The epic piece on the album, \\"When The Music's Over\\", is much more accessable and less terrifying than \\"The End\\" from the previous album, and is actually largely a polemic advocating the advancement of the youth movement of the time and eco-consciousness. The title tune is the moralist of the group, decrying rampant sin, while advocating \\"playing\\" or \\"finding a new town\\", a dichotomy to be sure.<br />Considering how soon this came out after its predecessor, the first Doors album, it was obvious that the group had done a LOT of writing, practicing and refining of their sound, since this is STILL the best thing the Doors ever put out, and it was only their second album! By this time, they were already legends, and this album certainly cemented it!<br />Alas, we lost Jim Morrison in the early seventies, due to his both \\"playing\\" AND \\"finding a new town\\", namely Paris, France,  where he died of a heroin overdose, a la Jean Paul Marat, in his bathtub. At least he had found his \\"Lost Little Girl\\".....
B00003W8NM|5.0|The plot twist is not the best, but Fight Club is one hell of a trip. The best part of this film is the whole anti-social element that the film revolves around. You will not see a better film about anti-social political ideas that cause the plot to develop into a revolution that takes America by storm. In the wake of 911 this film was almost prophetic and it still stands out as one the best DVDs you can own. In short this movie is a plastic explosive that Hollywood let go off for the hell of it and it was well worth the risk.
B0000DIXRU|4.0|This is definitely a mood-centric album. And after inventing a term, I have to describe it, so...<br />By mood-centric, I mean that enjoyment of this album is more based in a feeling than an appreciation of the songs themselves. Have a listen to 'Are You There?' (which is available for free download from Anathema's site...or was at last check), and you'll see what it means. These songs will put you in a mood, but you have to be half-way there already or it just won't work.<br />None of the songs here are particularly strong from a songwriting standpoint. It's in the atmosphere where 'A Natural Disaster' shines. Wind-swept backgrounds and blurriness are the staples here, and they work. For the most part. If you're trying to listen to this album on poor speakers, it'll fail miserably. Headphones work better, a surround sound system is best. Immersion is the point. Anathema have worked very hard to get the spectral effects down pat, and little flitting synth effects are the stars of the album.<br />Side note that's not really too important: the artwork for the album truly is beautiful. It fits very well with the music itself.<br />Anathema are going in a direction more towards the niche. I don't pretend to know exactly what they're doing, but I'll admit they've become more unique. Where they are right now is wedged inbetween the Anathema of 'Judgment' and the band Antimatter (which features a former member of Anathema and *another* Cavanaugh...how many are there?!). I hope they don't quite as far as Antimatter, but experimentation is fine by me.
0345452577|3.0|Jonathan Kellerman has become one of my favorite authors over the past year, having devoured his Delaware novels, and his other good books such as &quot;Billy Straight&quot; and &quot;The Butcher's Theater&quot;.  However, this book is quite unlike Kellerman's earlier efforts.<br />While I always admire an author who wants to break away from his series characters (ala Harlan Coben, Jeffery Deaver, etc.), I think Jon misses the mark in this one.<br />Jeremy Carrier is not the strongest of lead characters.  At times, his own self-pity and lack of communication skills makes him obscenely apathetic; when he attempts heroics, he seems incapable of filling the hero's shoes.  The whole club idea is so preposterously laid out, that they come across as the Golden Girls on Prozac.  The killer's identity is anticlimactic in the fact that it's a character who has had so little involvement in the book, it's like Betsy Palmer coming out of the woods in &quot;Friday the 13th.&quot;<br />Kellerman's usual mastery of pacing, suspense and intrigue are replaced with long, monotonous scenes, and very little tension.<br />I hope this isn't the beginning of a new series, cause I don't think Carrier can carry it!<br />Go back to Alex Delaware, Jon, and return to those pulsepounding thrillers you captured our hearts with!
B0000E6I1J|5.0|What can I say about this moving tribute to a true artist? Perfection in every detail, from the song selection to the artists to the sound and editing this is the kind of celebration George deserved. There is true emotion while George's friends play and sing his music. While My Guitar Gently Weeps has Eric Clapton on the verge of tears as well. For an even more powerful experience, listen to All Things Must Pass, 30th Anniversary Edition (CD)after you watch the DVD. You will not be able to stop listening to either one. Dhani's presence on the stage throughout (compare him to George's picture onstage) will move you.<br />Make this DVD #1 on Amazon's sales list- it will remind you of an era when music was made for its pure joy, not just commercial value.<br />Hail and Farewell, George.
B000001FS6|5.0|&quot;Rattle And Hum&quot; is an exciting, poetic and sometimes visceral take by U2 on American music. Like the album that preceeded it, &quot;The Joshua Tree,&quot; &quot;Rattle And Hum&quot; is filled with vibrant colors, memorable images and driving music. The band shines with what was to be their last work of more stripped down music before jumping into modern electronica with &quot;Achtung Baby.&quot; The album opens with a blistering cover of The Beatles' &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; where Bono proclaims that they were stealing the song back from Charles Manson who stole it from The Beatles. The Edge exercises his pipes with &quot;Vin  Diemen's Land,&quot; a haunting, almost etheral ballad. &quot;Desire&quot; is a fast-driving number that remains a fan favorite. This album is a find for listeners barely discovering the band's work, some of the songs here that are not widely known are very good such as &quot;Hawkmoon 269&quot; which pounds and grooves up to a great climax. &quot;Heartland&quot; is a beautiful song with an atmospheric quality. There are some live moments here too that shine like an edgy cover of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; where the band manages to capture a lot of the song's essence. There's also a version here of &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; with a gospel chorus that makes the song soar and shine. &quot;God Part 2&quot; is an interesting sequel to the John Lennon original. &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; is a wonderful love song that a great classic feel. &quot;Rattle And Hum&quot; didn't receive much high praise when first released, mostly because of the much disliked film of the same title (which is a damn good documentary). But it is a great album filled with great music, wonderful melodies and memorable words. This is a band with much passion and skill in their music and &quot;Rattle And Hum&quot; is a timeless document of the band's exploration of American rhythms and feels. If you've already grown to like the other albums, then it's time you take a look at &quot;Rattle And Hum.&quot;
B0000CFW87|5.0|This album is like a breath of fresh air after all the junk that is out there today in the music industry. Thank God for Josh. Somebody with real talent and not somebody who won a contest on a TV show. Josh shines on this album. More than his previous one in my opinion. This music is pure class and David Foster is responsible for that. He has taken Josh under his wing after, sadly, losing Celine Dion to Sony. But as long as Josh is singing, there will be quality music out there. Thank you Josh.
B00000720W|4.0|First of all a word to the music fan from Silver Spring, Maryland.  If you owned this cd you would know that it IS Maniac on vokills.  Dead came in 1988 along with Hellhammer so get your facts straight and you're not a true Mayhem fan.  This cd is where it all started for the legendary Mayhem.  Musically speaking it's not their best, but the attitude and intensity behind Deathcrush more than makes up for it.  This is heavy stuff and the lyrics are absolutely gruesome.  If you want to see for yourself go to [...] and you'll know what I mean.  Some of Mayhem's classic songs came from this album; Deathcrush, Necrolust, Chainsaw Guts***k and Pure F***ing Armageddon.  The lineup back then was Euronymous, Maniac, Necrobutcher and the miserable Manheim.  They also had a session vocalist named Messiah.  I don't think any Mayhem fan would dispute Dead being better than Maniac but Dead's dead my friend and Maniac is the next best thing so get over it just like I did.  By the way, Blasphemer is more skilled than Euronymous on guitar but it doesn't matter to me. Euronymous was a personality and a face for Mayhem but he wasn't a great guitarist, he was average so I actually enjoy Blasphemer's skills more.  Anyway, I recommend this album to any real BM fan and it's still stands the test of time.  BM doesn't sound as evil as this anymore, maybe more should listen to see how it's really done.  If Dead were still around I'm sure he would've hunted down Count Grishnackh and killed him.  He was that kind of guy, he's an example of a man who actually lived his music literally.

The gloomy side presents problems such as alcoholism, isolation, and cynicism.

This story offers a blissful journey, which presents moments of self-reflection and amusement.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phil Collins has always been one of my favorite musical artists. When this album was released and True Colors hit the airwaves, it showed how remarkable this man's journey through stardom over the past 20 years was. <br />Hits includes the songs that made Phil what he is; the slick tune with the drum solo In The Air Tonight; the best ballad ever written Against All Odds; the sentimental and dedicative Another Day In Paradise; the chilling I Wish It Would Rain Down; the fun pop grips of Easy Lover and You Can't Hurry Love; the groovy One More Night; and the incredible Take Me Home. <br />However, many songs were left out; I Don't Care Anymore, Don't Lose My Number, Do You Remember?, Everyday, It's In Your Eyes, and my favorite Find A Way To My Heart from But Seriously. <br />Still, the songs offered on Hits are worth having this album available to you...seriously!<br />Recommended<br />B+
B00005JLEU|5.0|A young girl, Chihiro, is sad over leaving her old home and friends when her parents move to a new town.  On their way to their new house Chihiro and her parents get lost and by accident find a temple of some sort.  They enter the temple, which has a tunnel that leads to a huge pasture and as the family walks around on the field to find a small town.  Their noses also  find a restaurant with tons of food waiting on the counters.  Chihiro is very hesitant to everything that her parents do, and she does not eat the food, which her parents gobble up.  It seems like there is something wrong which is confirmed when a mysterious young boy insists that she must leave in order to save herself.  Spirited Away is a wonderful film that deals with multiple issues that Chihiro faces through her adventure in the town.  These issues are left for the audience to ponder while traveling with Chihiro through this amazing journey.  The audience is left with a simply brilliant cinematic experience that offers high repeated viewing value.
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel Washington has played many brilliant characters in the past, most notably Malcolm X and The Hurricane, Rubin Carter. Unlike those real life characters, Alonzo Harris has no ties with reality,  thank God. This character is a cop who has been in the streets for too long dealing with scum that eventually his mind and morale went crooked. Trust me, we do not want these kind of characters wandering our streets! Denzel nails the part with extreme professionalism which earned him an Academy award for Best Actor.<br />Ethan Hawke, who plays rookie cop Jake Hoyt, is excited and yet very unlucky to be assigned to Harris for a his first day, training day. What Hoyt is about to experience is a day that he will be looking back at not as a day of his training to be a cop, but as a day he chose the moral path he would stick to for the rest of his life. <br />Antoine Fuqua's direction brings the realism of the streets and smoothens the atmosphere for his characters to express themselves freely, especially Washington who seems to steal every scene he's in with the dialogue that he conveys like a pro and its Ethan Hawke who does a wonderful job of staying one step behind Washington making the characters interactions one on one an interesting viewing.<br />The DVD features several bonuses including a behind the scenes segment, an alternate ending and a couple music videos.<br />Recommended<br />A-
B00007G1ZC|5.0|A kaleidoscope of eight dreams where each dream leaves the audience with an open ending triggers thoughts and reflections shadowed by the audience's knowledge, values, and believes.  The beauty of each dream offers several different meanings for each individual viewer, which provides personal impact on the audience.  The dreams also present many similar notions, yet, each notion has its unique symbolism formed by the viewers own collective knowledge, beliefs, and values, which in the end offers an absolutely exceptional cinematic experience.
B00008G9JO|5.0|OK; I sat down at the computer yesterday, and read ALL of the reviews of this album, pondered them all through some beverages and a night's sleep, and came to some conclusions. And oh yes, I ran to the record shop and bought the newly remastered version of this record as well. I'm on about my fifth listening as I write this.<br /> <BR>Positive or not, you all make good points, some articulate, some obtuse, some as though you have issues totally unrelated to what comes out of the speakers after you push the play button.<br /><BR>If you 'music fans' out there care enough about this CD enough to be so critical of it, that in itself is enough of a compliment to warrant its purchase for you and all your dysfunctional friends. Ian's laughing all the way to the bank, and I for one am only too glad to make his trips there all the merrier.<br /><BR>No, Ian's not Robert Burns. Mr. Burns' magnificent use of the English language warrants no musical accompaniment; it lies brilliantly as it is, and as it should be.<br /><BR>What Ian does, and what we fans appreciate, is his audacity (if you will) to meld thoughtful, provocative lyrical imagery with well-crafted, stylistically varied rock and roll. And the 'purists' hate it. The English majors (yes, the 'teachers') think he's being banal and verbose, and the classical buffs find no place for the immediacy of rock music in their preferences. All the more a pity, because this is quite simply one of the finest recordings ever made, and if our learned friends would simply open their intelligent minds just a wee bit more, a whole new world would magically blossom before their eyes and ears. And they may even find the inspiration to make this world a little more peaceful; don't we have enough hate and war already?<br />Music, man, pure and simple. The sound and performances that spring forth from this CD are a loving tribute not only to Ian's talent and the band's execution, but to the benevolence of our Great Creator. It really is thatgood. The experience of music on this CD finds Our Favorite Band (and I say that proudly) in a solid groove, effortlessly (or so it seems) blending Celtic folk and 70's rock innovation with dazzling  musicianship, exquisite taste, and unrepentant joy. Sure, Ian allows his emotions to slide occasionally into the darker realms of expression, but isn't that one of the guilty pleasures of rock music? We are, after all, human; we live hard, love hard, and sometimes make a bit of a mess. Good for us. Sure beats lying still underground. <br /><BR>Bottom line: if you're curious enough about this CD to have gotten to this review, then (at least after you read this) log off your computer and go to the nearest business establishment that has this CD for sale, and exchange your hard-earned currency for the privilege of experiencing this disc. And if it turns out that you don't care for it, at least thank God for the opportunity to be able to use the tools He gave you. Rock on.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This movie was just awesome!  No one could have pulled it off better than Kate Beckinsale!  You must watch!  You will love!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|To begin with.... no one owns te truth, but I am getting a bit tired of some nonsense reviews here, I dont mean to be offensive because after all everybody has the right to express what they feel. I just cant agree with some opinions: <BR>- If you want to hear all the chatting between songs buy the original &quot;let it be&quot; and stop being problematic, &quot;Let it be naked&quot; is all about MUSIC. - Thanks to its superb sound we can hear clearly the driving acoustic guitar in &quot;I me mine&quot; with one of the finest drum performances made by Ringo in a Beatles record. - The rest of the album sound better than ever, so clear that even &quot;Dont let me down&quot; sounds played with a renewed power and conviction, for me it is without a doubt the better rock-ballad ever recorded.- the song list is a bit more coherent. - The long and winding road  is finally heard as it was supposed to be; a warm and a gentle ballad, I thought that it could be released as a single even now, but the John Lennon bass line is almost amateurish!!. Sabotage??. - If you people dont like macca`s work it is YOUR problem!!, but dont mess with the Beatles and use LIBN as an excuse for your attacks, and leave it alone, let people judge by themselves...we are talking about THE BEATLES, I had to say it twice because seems that you forgot it.<BR>On the other side, I am not gonna play the &quot;fly on the wall&quot; disc too often, it is a bit boring after a while, but it is an interesting document about the greatest band ever in the middle of their break up. Ah, I dont like the title (naked?). It sholud have been called &quot;Get back&quot; I guess.<BR>We have to be grateful with a band that has given us so much, an endless legacy. After all, we ve got pop rock, psychodelia, progressive, power pop music, among others,  because of them.
B00006CXSS|5.0|To &quot;A viewer from San Diego&quot; ... to answer your &quot;So I bet there were many 'bands of brothers' on the German side too&quot; comment, of course there were, and nobody with any sense thinks otherwise. If you'd actually watch the miniseries you'd realize there are some quite vivid scenes describing just that (toward the end where the German officer is addressing his troops -- exhausted but still standing straight -- following their surrender, and calls them a &quot;band of brothers,&quot; for just one example). This isn't Star Wars, buddy, and Spielberg and Hanks know that.<br />Are you sure you aren't Neville Chamberlain speaking from his grave? To respond to your &quot;It is a shame that war becomes gloryfied [sic] in a miniseries in this way when it is really the worst thing that man has created&quot; comment, I'd say yes, war is terrible indeed, terrible almost beyond measure, but then what's your alternative? This miniseries is based on a true story, so should the script have been &quot;adjusted&quot; to more accurately portray &quot;the worst thing that man has created?&quot; Or should a 10-part movie be made about a company who died to a man and didn't do a single heroic thing (I think you'd be hard pressed to find one, but just for the sake of argument)? Or would you have us ignore the history of war completely and try to forget it instead? I think not. Defeatists and pacifists are what got our world into the mess in the first place.<br />&quot;Those who will not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.&quot; - George Santayana.<br />As to &quot;glorifying&quot; war, without the courage, valor, determination, and fortitude of the Allied soldiers and their leaders the entire world's history since the 1940s would be absolutely unrecognizable to any of us today. And, again, if you'd actually watch the miniseries you'd realize that it does not try to &quot;glorify&quot; war in any sense -- this story is told without the gloves on, and the horror and pain of war couldn't possibly be clearer to the viewer. <br />Here's my review: for the entire planet World War II is the single most important human-driven event of our time. Stephen E. Ambrose's book is truly amazing and is also highly recommended, but for visual learners and people raised on television this mini-series is, hands down, the best and most informative medium I've ever seen for learning about WWII in Europe. Watching this DVD set will make you laugh, cry, and appreciate, but it will mostly make you learn more about the Allied soldier's perspective of the war in Europe than you ever thought possible. Buy it today if not sooner.
B000002J1S|4.0|Anyone who complains about the music, lyrics, and production of this album really has to listen to it again, and a gain, until they get it. Ill admit some of it it isnt incredible, but there is a lot of amazing stuff on it. The drumming is incredible, and very musical. The bass keeps the whole thing together, and the work of Tony Banks is spectacular-he flawlessly turns out amazing chord sequences, while creating huge textures that add so much to the material, and of course, Steve Hackett's guitar work is one of the highlights of the album-the tone he has is so smooth, and he has such good taste and discretion, even when he is experimenting and creating tones that are out of this world. The vocals of Peter Gabriel are great-no other singer can belch out such great lyrics. The album is awesome.
B00005JMCN|4.0|The end of July always seems to be a bit of a drag at the box office and no more so then this year. The summer of 2003 has been a pretty disappointing season with most, if not all, sequels failing to live up to their predecessors and potential blockbusters falling hard just after barely leaving the gate. The only highlights this summer would includ Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, both of which belong to the Walt Disney Company. Disney is leading the way as they seem to be the first studio this year to reach the $1 billion mark and could potentially win the year despite competition from The Matrix Revolutions and The Return of the King. Though Universal is pretty far in the back of the pack (#4 at time of publication), they hope to make it up by grabbing some Oscar gold instead. The late July release date for the film may be weird choice if you want your film to be ?Oscar bait? but the studio is hoping that the film will generate the same amount of buzz at last summer?s Road to Perdition so when it comes to nomination time, the film will remain somewhat fresh in the mind of voters. And with the deadline for consideration pushed up this year, Seabiscuit has a lot better chance at getting a couple of nominations then 2002?s Perdition, or at least that?s what the Universal suits are hoping for.    The story of Seabiscuit is based on the true story of the ?little horse that could? which was depicted in Seabiscuit: An American Legend, written by Laura Hillenbrand. The film follows the events surrounding the lives of Red Pollard, Charles Howard, and Tom Smith in the 1930?s. Around this time the country is desperately trying to pull itself together after The Great Depression of 1929 but nothing seems to going right for any of the main characters. Charles Howard, who made a fortune by introducing the Buick automobile to the American West, has lost his son in an automobile accident and, in event, loses his relationship with his wife. Tom Smith loses his purpose performing in the Wild West show thanks to the introduction of the automobile in the West and so goes into seclusion. And Red Pollard, who was given up by his parents during the Depression, stumbles from horse racing to boxing just trying to make a living. These three very different individuals come together after Howard purchases a gangly horse named Seabiscuit in 1938 and decides to race the horse despite overwhelming odds. With ?a horse that?s too small, a jockey who?s too big, and a trainer who?s too old?, Seabiscuit gathers the attention of the public and raises the hopes of a struggling nation. The story for Seabiscuit is a well-balanced blend of humor, suspense, emotions, and historical context, something that is rarely achieved altogether by most ?Oscar bait? flicks as of late. The historical background sequences are quite possibly the most important aspect of the feature as the way they are set up and delivered does not make the audience feel as though they are being dictated to and flowing through another typical history lesson.    The talented group of actors and actresses that make up the respectable cast for Seabiscuit are probably the real reason why this film is, and will be in the months to follow, considered an Oscar potential. Tobey Maguire, who starred in Oscar nominated Cider House Rules, is best known on the big screen for his role as Peter Parker in the smash hit, Spider-Man, but he shows his true brilliance as an actor in the role of Red Pollard. Maguire showcases a lot more emotion in Seabiscuit then in the role that made him famous in the mainstream and shows that he can still perform at the level of Oscar potential dramas. Chris Copper, who won an Oscar for his role in Adaptation, is right on the money as Tom Smith though his character isn?t shown as much as the other three lead male roles. Elizabeth Banks, who also starred in Spider-Man with Maguire as a secretary at the Daily Bugle, receives her first lead roleand does a pretty good job with it. The problem lies mostly in the fact that there is so little information given on her character, like where she came from and such, that you don?t feel as attached with her character as much as the three main leads. One of the biggest highlights of the cast is William H. Macy, who is right on target with his performance as a 1930?s radio announcer. Macy rambles on with crazy one liners while being accompanied by sound effects which makes the historical background all the more engaging.    Overall, Seabiscuit, unlike past ?Oscar bait? dramas of the summer, clearly and proudly defines itself as solid sports-drama right from its direct burst out of the gate all the way to the genuine feel-good ending, despite tending to lag behind the pack near the finish line. Though that being said, there are sufficient problems in the film that, in turn, hurt it just enough to prevent a perfect rating from being scored. The time length of two hours and thirty minutes simply feels twenty minutes too long. It would have been more effective if the filmmakers had ended the film with Seabiscuit beating War Admiral as the last twenty minutes that do mark the film?s ending seemed dragged out and disrupted the overall flow that had been present. Another problem that was frequent throughout the feature was the transition sequences that showcased no dialogue or sound, just musical score with quick cut scenes that ended up confusing the audience more then moving the story along. But those gripes, Seabiscuit plays out ten times better then a sports-drama of this quality would normally play out to so wide an audience. What makes this horse picture superior above the rest is the Ken Burns/PBS Mini-series historical allusions presented between scenes that help set the audience up for what the country was like at that time without having it drag out into a boring history lesson. It may not be an instant classic but its good enough to spend a hot summer afternoon with.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is impossible for too much to be said about the merits of this amazing yet short-lived performance. (I shy from calling it a &quot;tv show&quot; because it is so much more than that.) I watch very little television, but I distinctly remember previews to Firefly, and wanted to see it but never did while it was aired, which is probably due to the terrible scheduling by our good friends at FOX. Fortunately some friends taped it and I watched all the episodes, pilot first (again - cheers to FOX for not airing the pilot first.) I was absolutely astounded by the production - the characters, the story, the presentation, every detail is meticulously perfected. The combination of scifi/western is never forced, but seems like a natural progression of the human plight in the future. I, like hundreds of thousands of fans, am completely disheartened by the fact that one of the most entertaining performances ever given was hardly given a chance. I can't think of a single person who will not find something or some character to relate to. The DVDs have only strengthened my conviction to tell everyone I meet to watch Firefly. Do not miss this opportunity!
B0000E6XKF|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have become one of the best live bands ever, and this DVD is proof of it. The show opens with By The Way, an obviouse new favourite, and closes with The Power Of Equality, an older hit. The hilights include Under The Bridge, Venice Queen, Dont Forget Me and Universally Speaking. It also includes Havana Affair (originally off the Ramones tribute album). I think it is impossible to say a bad word about this DVD, as it is a reflection of one of todays greatest bands at their best.
B00005QCVY|5.0|I can no longer remember the first time I saw this great story of hope and miracles.  Once having seen it, you'll not forget its story of encouragement and faith, and in a positive way showing that what goes around truly does come around.<br />George Bailey seems to be a simple man.  In fact, he is a simple man.  Yet, with his solid values and feeling for what is right and wrong, George touches the lives of those around him.  George saves his brother from drowning as a child.  When his brother grows older he shoots down an enemy plane during World War II, saving a transport ship into which the plane was attempting to crash.  George prevents the pharmacist from accidentally giving a young boy poison as the pharmacist grieved for his own son.  George takes on the responsibility for running the Bailey Savings and Loan when his father passes away.  The list of good deeds that George performs is long, and he has not touched so many individual lives as he has an entire town.<br />It seems that while George is not wealthy in terms of money, he leads a full life.  He has a wife and children, and in he is clearly a powerful force for good.  His brother is coming home, a celebrated war hero.  Life could hardly be better.  But then an event occurs that can shake anyone.  Eight thousand dollars is lost on its way to being deposited at the bank.  Suddenly, George Bailey is under suspicion for embezzlement.  Suddenly, all the good deeds that George has performed count for nothing, because George may find himself in prison as repayment for being a good man.<br />George lashes out at those around him.  He has always been the person with the solutions, and suddenly he finds himself in a situation he can't control or solve.  He runs from this unsolvable problem, crashing his car, stumbles to a bridge to commit suicide.  Before George can jump in, someone else jumps in; an angel with a mission.<br />George and the angel, Clarence, talk about George's plight, and during the discussion George wishes he had never existed.  The angel grants George's wish.  During the next portion of the movie we see a Bedford Falls that would have existed had George never lived.  The name of the town is Pottersville and it is full of bars and vice and crime, and many of the houses owned by Mr. Potter are little more than hovels, slums in the making.  The people who George touched live a very different life in this alternate reality.<br />As dark as the movie is at times, at its heart it is a story of hope and miracles.  George is given an opportunity to see the difference he has made in people's lives.  George discovers that while evil has befallen him, the evil that he has personally averted is far worse.  On the small chance you have not seen this movie, I'll not reveal the ending, but you may trust that the ending always brings a smile to my face.<br />The DVD restoration of this classic is excellent, a significant improvement over the numerous poor copies previously available on VHS.  Make this movie one of your family's favorites for Christmas and any other time of the year you need to be cheered.George wishes he had never existed.  The angel grants George's wish.

B000069AUI|5.0|This is a brilliant album by a amazing band. Its got all the songs that made them its just brill!!!!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I adore all three soundtracks for Lord of the Rings trilogy, but the one for Return of the King is undoubtedly cr¨¨me de la cr¨¨me. It is a highly emotional compilation that encompasses many of the most memorable themes we have loved during these three years. Not only does it stand out on its own accord by introducing new themes such as the magnificent theme of Gondor (Minas Tirith and White Tree), the heroic theme of The Steward of Gondor and the heart-breaking Billy's song, and the solemn Aragorn's Coronation, it also revisited the Hobbit theme, the Uruk-hai theme, the Rohan theme, and the Rivendell theme, thus making this score the perfect ending chapter. It brings us through an emotional roller-coaster ride, and gives us flashbacks of the various scenes in the movie, from the epic to the tender, from the hopeful to the melancholy, from the heroic to the idyllic. Unlike many songs or music that I get tired of after repeated listening, this soundtrack gets better each time, and there is not a single track to skip.<br />My favorites are:<br />3. Minas Tirith (featuring Ben del Maestro): brings out the sweeping landscape of Gondor and the splendor of the White City, my 3rd favorite track (the Rohan theme in The Two Towers is my favorite)<br />5. The Steward of Gondor (featuring Billy Boyd): exquisite song; Billy¡¯s voice brings tears to my eyes every time.<br />6. Minas Morgul: ominous and unrelenting.<br />7. The Ride of the Rohirrium: an overall uplifting, exciting, and heroic them, blended with a brief reprise of the Hobbit theme in the middle.<br />8. Twilight and Shadow (featuring Renee Fleming): breathtakingly gorgeous and tender, this is my 2nd favorite track.<br />13. The Fields of the Pelennor: magnificent<br />17. The Return of the King: calm and hopeful tune with Viggo's solemn voice, perfect!<br />19. Into the West: great song, but way out of Annie¡¯s vocal range. (probably the only thing I slightly dislike about this soundtrack - they got the wrong person to sing this, IMO!)
B00004XOWM|5.0|this album is great the song rollin is the savery of this album. but that song &quot;HOTDOG&quot; well that is a classic it is really funny. it kinda speaks to you.that song &quot;GET YOUR GROOVE&quot; is a funny song too. &quot;you dont wanna f*** with me today.cause a little sumthin sumthin didnt go your way.so try not to be like that today cause i am a real mother f***er from down the way.got to get your groove on got to get your groove on.&quot; see that is a funny song. but &quot;ROLLIN&quot; is the way to go so buy this album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|first of all, I want to say that SuperCoolDude, kudos on your awesome review.  I realize you are kidding and it was actually pretty funny.<BR>But as for the album, I would like to make some comments. (I do not like Radiohead because they are the cool thing to like.  In fact, at first I did not want to like them because of the pretentious college poseurs that are associated with them.)<BR>I have a theory though, about the relationship between this album and Kid A.<BR>I believe that maybe Kid A is a continuation of the &quot;storyline&quot; that this album has.  In the song Subterranean Homesick Alien, lyrics speak of aliens &quot;making home movies for the folks back home.&quot;  And as for Kid A, this whole album seems to be a concept album about the life of a modern human being (The title track in the beginning for some reason reminds me of a baby, and the last song is obviously concerning death.)  Even the title, &quot;Kid A&quot; sounds so impersonal, like a slideshow presentation given by aliens to their fellows showing an example of the lives earthlings lead.  And the last song on Kid A is called &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot; <BR>yeah, so thus ends my stupid little ranting and raving.  i went out on a limb there, and im prolly wrong, but i wanna know what others think.
B00004XOWM|5.0|this cd is sweet you no the real savery of this cd is rollin. gotta get your groove on is a funny song. this album rocks a classic is hotdog. so buy this album.
0553213105|4.0|My favorite chapter was chapter eleven in volume two because I found it amusing that Elizabeth turned down Mr. Darcy's proposal.  I think that Elizabeth's own prejudice against Darcy didn't allow her to see his affections for her. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of having too much pride, and she accuses him of prejudice, when in both cases they both show pride and prejudice.<br />  I think this book is appropriate for students in high school because it is not complicated to read and therefore they should be able to read it.  I like the fact that the author uses a lot of dialogue to reveal ideas and personalities of different characters.  In my opinion dialogue is very important because sometimes it helps me understand what the characters are like, or it can reveal a character's look, and that helps me develop a picture of that one character.<br />  I like this book because it wasn't as hard to read as I thought it was going to be.  One thing that I learned was that you should carefully read the story because sometimes you might miss the important parts.
B00005R2IS|4.0|I like the _Mad Max_ series, but I think the two sequels are better movies than this one.<br />It's not that it's _bad_. It's just that it consists mostly of an hour and a half of atmosphere. Another film would have had this entire plot take place in the first half-hour and gone on from there.<br />The idea -- a postapocalyptic mood piece set in the Australian Outback -- is wonderful, and naturally enough the scenery is gorgeous. And considering the shoestring the movie must have been made on, it's very good. It's just not much fun to watch twice, because it takes so bleedin' long for anything to _happen_.<br />The best thing about it is the young Mel Gibson, who perfected the likeable-handsome-lug persona a generation ahead of George Clooney and who plays Max with just the right combination of rogueish charm and leonine ferocity. When he finally _does_ go 'mad', his puckish humor evaporates and he burns like a slow and deadly fire.<br />The rest of the cast does well too -- and having previously owned this film on VHS, I'm glad that the DVD special edition includes the original voices. The thick Strine may be a little hard for U.S. audiences to follow at first, but once you pick up the wavelength you won't have any trouble. (Besides, the old U.S. dubbed version is available as an option.)<br />Anyway, as a longtime SF geek and an avid devourer of postapocalytpic films and novels, I really like the atmosphere and the concept of this movie. I just have a hard time watching it too many times close together. For that, I prefer the two sequels.<br />But this one is still worth watching, and owning, for the story it tells -- the mythical tale of the birth of one of modern cinematography's great heroes/antiheroes.
6305827079|3.0|As many other reviewers have pointed out, this is Elvis at his best.  However, it is not the same movie that I saw years ago.  At least two songs featured in the original, Sweet Caroline and Bridge Over Troubled Water, have been cut.  You can still see snippets of them in the original trailer.  I wish they had included the songs that were cut for the &quot;restored&quot; version as extras on this DVD - anything Elvis sang whether he wrote it or not is worth hearing and seeing!
0553812173|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic.  George RR Martin needs to set up a throne along side of him for Erikson as the reigning kings of fantasy.  Huge in scope, massive, pleasantly dense, and one of the richest stories I have ever read.<BR>'<BR>Not for the feint of heart, and certainly not for the &quot;light&quot; reader.  Gardens simply takes your arms and yanks into the Malazan Empire and lets you choose sides.  Wow, what an ambitious project.  DO yourself a favor and buy this book--no matter the cost, because you will find a spot for this book right next to Martin, Kearney, Hobbs, Marco and Keyes as the best fantasy writers alive today (or ever?).
B0000019PA|5.0|I first heard of Neutral Milk Hotel when In the Aeroplane Over the Sea appeared in my Amazon recomendations. So I downloaded a few songs to check them out. The two songs were King of Carrot Flowers Part 1, and In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. I thought the songs were good so I bought the CD. The first time I listened to it I was busy doing other things and did not really like it, I thought it was weird. Then later in the day I had time to listen to it again and really pay attention. I was blown away, I could not believe what I was hearing. The passion and emotion in Jeff Mangum's lyrics and voice are unbelieveable. By the middle of Oh Comely I felt a tear run down my cheek. I could not believe it. His voice is so haunting and full of emotion. Although the lyrics are very abstract, I knew exactly what he was trying to say. In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is the best CD I have ever listened to. It is 40 minutes of pure genius. Buy this CD, you will not be dissapointed.
0393974650|2.0|This is one of the hardest and boring books in life! It deals with strict men of Science, for instance, Dr. Hastie Lanyon. This book, like the Invisible Man, is a novel that has WAY too many details and should be strictly enforced not to be read. Who wants to read a book about science-fiction and not to mention the cuss words on every page? Who likes minor details around every corner. But, I must admit, there are fabulous descriptions of the characters and them themselves are quite interesting! But, this book is not good.
0446608955|1.0|This story is about how a young man's life is changed by his reluctant close-encounter with the class oddball who happens to be Southern Baptist girl.<br />I'd sure like to know where Nicholas Sparks got his information on how a Southern Baptist thinks and lives. The story would have been better if it weren't for some glaring inconsistencies with the Baptist theology and mindset. <br />First of all, the narrator tells us the Baptist minister in the story baptized babies. Baptists don't baptize babies. That is one of their PRIMARY theological distinctions.<br />Second of all, if the young lady in the story read her Bible as much as, and as often as, the story says she did, she would not have, under any circumstances, agreed to the narrator's plan at the end of the book. I cannot say further without giving away an essential part of the plot. Neither would her father have agreed to it. <br />Do you want to buy this book? It is sad. I heard that it was sad before I read it and determined not to cry, but I cried anyway. <br />I object to the foul language--again, this did not make sense in light of the Baptist connection to the narrator.<br />I enjoyed Mr. Sparks's ability to spin a story, but I did not like references to modern events, television shows, or currently popular celebrities. To me, these detract from the story rather than drawing readers in.  <br />If the main character had just been a &quot;nice&quot; girl, rather than a Baptist girl, the story would have been much less offensive and the inherent mistakes could have been avoided.
B000066NW0|3.0|Most people love Avril or hate her.  She's comparable to Michelle Branch, though Michelle is a little more genuine and talented.  Avril can also be described as a mini Alanis Morissette because she's Canadian but Alanis is also more genuine and talented.<BR>Avril Lavigne gives off a strong poser vibe with annoying tracks like &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; but she does show promise.  &quot;Losing Grip&quot; is pretty good.  &quot;I'm With You&quot; is an awesome track though the lyrics aren't that great.  &quot;Mobile&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; are also nice tracks that distingiush Avril Lavigne from other bubblegummy pop artists.  To be honest those are the only tracks I've listened to since I just bought the album today.  This album is worthwhile if you pay under $10 for it.
B000066NW0|1.0|Gimme a break! Avril Lavigne sucks. Don't waste your money on this crap. It's not worth it. I give every song on this CD an F and a 0/10. Get real people, her music is horrible! She claims to be punk-rock, when she's really just pop. I am not suprised that she hasn't made a second album. I am just warning the helpless, don't waste your money on this! Avril is also a poser and a loser. She is so phoney, no wonder people buy her stuff!
0385504209|1.0|I picked up this book after hearing a lot of hype about it, and it proved once again that you should not believe everything you hear.  While the book has an intriguing premise, it is one an altogether original one nor does Dan Brown make it very interesting.  His characters are not very interesting, and they don't seem especially bright for people with supposedly &quot;brilliant minds&quot; (when the reader is a few chapters ahead of the characters in a suspence...things are pretty bad).<br />All in all, this was a poorly written book with poorly drawn characters with a plot we've all read before.  Find something else to read.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I bought this album(my first ever from Nickelback) not sure, because so many hard rock bands are not as great as they used to be a while ago. However, Nickelback has qaulity stuff. Nickelback needs to teach bands like Metallica how to re-rock. All the songs are good. This is an awesome album, it's been a while since a good heavy rock band has come out, and they ARE the new Metallica, or whomever you like. I hope to see these guys live, Chad has an awesome hard rock voice, and the guitars are good. Go get the cd, you won't regret it, they are popular, simply because they make quality stuff, and Long Road attests to it.

Need an album to inspire you to perform in your current employment?  This is the album...forget leadership books, inspirational speakers -- this is IT!  Live or Die! There is no other option!  Reign in Blood cures the commute, replenishes the weary and enables the wicked!  Slayer - the window to eternal Slavation!
B00005A46T|3.0|When i first bought this album, i really liked it, however, it quickly wore off on me.  Once you listen to the album, it gets pretty repetitive.  Also, on slipknots s/t album, i found that the guitar works were heavy and fast, and there were no long intros to the songs.  On Iowa, many songs have a good 2 minutes of a boring 2-note riff before they actaully start singing. But there are some good songs on it, such as Iowa and People=Sh**.  All in all, this albunm is ok, but only for the hardcore slipknot fans, if you want something that is loud and talented, i'd go for their s/t album.
B0000CABBW|5.0|When this film first came out, I bypassed it in favor of films with well-known casts and lots of marketing. When I eventually got the DVD (rental), I was disappointed -- in that I did not take the time to see it sooner.  And while I've been told that the movie is quite different from the book, and that as a coming of age film, it rehashes over-used themes, it is still a film well-worth seeing.<br />In presenting us with how a headstrong young girl tries to find her place in her Maori tribe against the wishes of her stubborn grandfather-chief, Whale Rider shows how tradition need not clash with modernity, but can meld with it to create new ways of living and being.  And that change can bring hope and not necessarily calamity.  The artful use of foreshadowing and juxtapositioning of the old and the new, of various motifs, to make this and other points is elegant.  Take, for instance, the temporal symbols of transportation: the unfinished waka (an ancient maori boat) used by the ancients, the bicycle used by Pai and Koro (a mildy sophisticated invention), the tractor used by Uncle Rawiri (a deleted scene, but later it is used to try to free a beached whale), and Pai with her father in his (rental) Ford Focus (a symbol of modern 21st Century technological prowess). And there are a myriad of others.  There is an underlying feminism here, too. The girl Pai (short for Paikea, a boy's name) striving to assume the role of tribal leader, a position reserved for the first-born males.  And Nanny Flowers as the only woman who can say no to grouchy paternalistic Koro. <br />There are also subtle references to the social and economic plight of the Maori.  A careful view of the film will easily reveal all the nuances and references to problems that the Maori -- like so many cultures face: of absentee fathers, of crime and jail (Hemi's dad), of the troubles of the working class versus the elite, of outmarriage, the abandonment of tradition, disrespect for elders, etc.  (I later found that some of these points are spelled out in the deleted scenes, but the editors were wise to delete them.  The subtleties in the plot and script say it all.)  <br />In some ways, this film is a treatise on the tough choices that so many indigenous groups have to make: stick to their old ways and risk death, or adapt to the new, the different, -- and prosper and survive.<br />This, then, is a wonderful film, for both adults and children, engaging, witty, poignant, beautfully written and filmed. Hats off to all involved, especially Ms. Caro for the script and Ms. Castle-Hughes -- believable as Pai, an unbelievable feat for an 11-year old girl (now 13) with no prior acting experience.<br />If there are any flaws in the film, it would be that things go too well for Pai, that things are too predictable; but, perhaps, that is the beauty of this film, that, like fairy tales, happy endings usually are the norm.<br />And as others have stated before, don't miss the two hidden features of the DVD: Select SPECIAL FEATURES, and then when the MAIN MENU is highlighted on the bottom of the Special Features screen, press the right arrow to get the original New Zealand trailer for this film.  Or press the left arrow to get and select *auditions*: 6-minutes of Keisha Castle-Hughes astounding audition.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The 'Return of the King' Soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.  I own the other LOTR soundtracks and this one is by far the best.  The CD is filled with inspiring, dark, and beautiful themes and is one of Howard Shore's best scores.
B000066NW0|5.0|when i first heard avril's debut hit, i knew i had to buy the cd. i went to the store the next day and bought it. the moment i got home i sat down and listened to the cd. i must have listened to the whole cd like a million times. i love it. now my walls are covered in avril lavigne posters, i own her dvd, and have two copies of her cd. (funny story, i lost the first one so i had to buy a new one, then i found the old one). while in school i made my own avril lavigne tribute, it consists of cut out picture of avril and her cd. i love her and her music.<BR>amber dawn
0156027321|5.0|This book is not what it seems. It seems incredibly improbable in parts - after all, Pi survives for MONTHS alone at sea - and perhaps it is. This book is fantastically written, witty, and heartbreaking. The question you must ask yourself pertains to the truth in the story of your life: which story do you tell?
B000092ZYX|5.0|The first listen of this album was slightly disappointing - much like the previous two albums (Kid A and Amnesiac) it seemed to drag and not have much of a punch. A sort of watered down version of the band that brought us a masterpiece with OK Computer.<br />A few more listens though, and the different layers of guitar, electronics and vocals began to emerge and provide this album with a sustanance which their previous two albums seems to lack. Returning to a more instrumental based music Hail re-emphasizes that Radiohead is still on the forefront of music and doing something that most bands wish they could dream of achieving.<br />I've heard quite a few people mention that they see influences from the Bends and OK re-emerge in this album, which is true, but I also think that there is a bit of a resurfacing of Pablo Honey, which seems to be the forgotten introductory album. Admittedly, Pablo does have Creep on it, which served as more of an anchor to the band than anything else, but quite a few songs did offer the blending of guitars, instrumentals and Thom's voice which seems to be a driving force (although much less intense than on previous ventures) behind many of the songs in Hail.<br />All in all, this album is not their finest work, but it is close. It seems to be a culmination of all of their previous efforts, blending in to a cohesive piece which flows from song to song in an awkwardly depressing, yet fulfilling, stream. The high point of the album, much like their early releases, is the final song. Wolf at the Door is an emotionally draining and haunting song which leaves the listener perched on the seat waiting for more.<br />Their recent tour only enforced the significance of the album and its power. The songs were even more intense and the bands dark sense of humor only added to the affect. It was a concert that everyone who is a fan should make every attempt to see.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Let me start by saying this was a well-made, intelligent thriller. The cinematography was exquisite, the music was beautiful and eerie at the same time, and the entire film had a feeling of impending doom. It actually made me jump about four times, and I usually don't jump that much during a horror movie. The thing that makes this really good is, despite me having already seen this previously, and all ready kind of knowing what shocks were about to occur, they STILL shocked me seeing it again! That is a good mark of a horror director. Those are some of the pros, but there are definitely some cons to this film. 1. No chemistry between Hopkins and Moore: As most fans of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; know, Julianne Moore played Clarice in this version, because Jodie Foster turned down the part. While she portrayed this version of Clarice very well, she and Athony Hopkins did not have any chemistry together. 2. Too much gore and disgusting scenes. This movie was WAY over-the-top, and some of the scenes of disgusting gore weren't necessary at all. The hanging scene was well-done, not too over-the-top, but the scene with the brain, not to mention the gross scenes with the hogs, and the whole way Mason Verger's face looks, is basically too the extreme. It would be far scarier, and less silly, if the film would have just used eerie scenes rather than so much gore. 3. Clarice just didn't seem to be Clarice. True, Julianne Moore and Jodie Foster are two different actresses, and Clarice has changed a lot over the years, but she didn't really even have the same personality. She didn't seem as concerned, as obsessed with trying to catch the villain as she did back when she was working on Bufallo Bill. She seemed more fascinated with Hannibal than genuinely concerned with endeavoring to capture him. I don't know if this is the way the character is supposed to be or not (I haven't yet read the book), but I believe that a character should not chance that much, or if she does, explain in more detail why she changed. All in all, though, this was an intelligent thriller that has you screaming (at those jump-out-of-your-seat moments), laughing (dark humor moments), and rolling your eyes or even getting sick (those gross-out, over-the-top moments). Good job, Ridley Scott, with creating such an atmospheric, darkly funny, and very scary movie. I would recommend it for fans of disgusting horror, but as for fans of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, some like &quot;Hannibal&quot; and some don't. It all depends on your taste.....So to speak.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This compilation is amazing and brings you back to the early Pet shop boys days. It has all the great hits on it, and it has never left my cd player since i've got it. I love it. You should definetely go and buy it today, right now, if you love theM.
B00000DGUG|5.0|As Alanis stood upon the stage of her successful career in today's pop/rock industry, she stared deep in the `Front Row' and said `Baba,' I `Thank U' but `Are You Still Mad' that I was not a `Sympathetic Character' to the follies of stardom and would lay upon `The Couch' wallowing in success but I `Can't Not' do such a thing when `UR' all that `I was Hoping' for!  I was the `One' they thought `Would Not Come' when my letters were `Unsent' but I felt I would be `So Pure' in `Joining You' in the `Heart of the House' upon receiving `Your Congratulations' for my success!<br />Upon the heels of three years time in between albums which included a fair amount of touring and a great amount of anticipation, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" was released in November 1998 and greeted eagerly by her droves of fans and critics who, most of which, accorded it the accolades it was due.<br />From beginning to end, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" is a study in the flawlessness of music that Alanis Morissette is so capable of in her beauteous variety of modern pop/rock!  Given the time to listen to each and every one of the seventeen wonders on this album, one finds an impressive intelligence in the lyrics and a welcome beat in the music itself.  While many albums of such length may suffer some driftage in the great number of songs, this album suffers no such loss and is an overall delight to listen to at any time.  Each and every song could've easily been released as a single and made it high upon the charts!<br />Lending greatly to the success of Alanis Morissette's music is the exceptionally personal feelings that she seemingly displays with ease in a majority of her songs.  One such example is track 13, \\"Unsent\\" which a beautiful but seemingly so personal song that it almost gives one the feeling of intruding.<br />I highly recommend this CD and any other made by the ever beautiful and gifted Alanis Morissette!  {ssintrepid}
B00006CXXU|5.0|She's got the best voice ever! I like all the songs, it's amazing. Christina has so much talent, she's a real artist!
B0000648WZ|4.0|It is in some ways a good film. The various « animals », in that case bugs, are very well animated and very realistic. If you don't like bugs, you will get a real thrill out of it. In fact they are even funny in a way. Then the film itself is a series of borrowed elements without any deep meaning at all. You will recognize some elements from Platoon, Aliens, Star Wars, even Star Trek, and many other films. But it is very representative of a « man-centered » approach of the universe : aliens are necessarily hostile and they have to be destroyed. But this film tries to be a little bit more intelligent than many other militaristic films : you have to understand their intelligence to defeat them. One step further and you may come to the idea of looking for a political solution that would lead to coexistence. This film is also a good illustration of the vanity of such an approach. In a war of that type there are not one head and slaves. This is a caricature and it may lead to catastrophes. When you get into a war with a whole people, race, species, etc, this group that sees you as the enemy, and that you see as the enemy, will be moved by their survival instinct which will lead them to a high level of autonomy and creativity. You can capture or kill the leader, or even the main leaders, that will not stop the war because it is a survival war, and everyone will be under pressure to do something for the survival of the culture, the country, the regime, the religion, you name it you have it. What do you think moved the French during World War II to resists against the Germans, to the point of liberating Paris and most of the big cities ? Many reasons but with one at the core of them all : it was the only way to prevent the anihilation of the nation, to guarantee the survival of the nation.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B000070WJE|4.0|He could do better. It was still a great album, although it didn't have the same spark as his others. Hot Fudge, Handsome Man, Feel and Me and my Monkey were among the best. He has a great strong voice and could do better. I hope his next album is able to launch him into the Canadian/American spotlight, he definetey deserves it. Nice try though, Robbie.
B00003CXC7|5.0|&quot;Rear Window&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot; have been referred to as Alfred Hitchcock's voyeuristic masterpieces with good reason.  The latter film relates to Jimmy Stewart playing a retired detective determined to make another woman into someone he believed had previously existed but never did, and was only a fictitious creation of her lover, who was a clever murderer.  Kim Novak, in one of her early efforts, played the dual role with just the proper measure of ethereal distance.<br />Four years before &quot;Vertigo&quot; previewed Hitchcock directed another powerful voyeuristic film with Stewart cast in the male lead, this time opposite another blonde bombshell, the future princess Grace Kelly.  Based on a story by master thriller author Cornell Woolrich, &quot;Rear Window&quot; is about a successful photographer who, after breaking his leg in an accident while covering an automobile race, is laid up in his Manhattan apartment.  In between visits from gorgeous socialite Kelly he whiles away his time observing his neighbors from the apartment building behind his own, separated by a courtyard.<br />Stewart lives as a voyeur, spending his time observing people like Miss Lonelyhearts, the woman who fixes herself candlelight dinners she shares with wine and music with imaginary love interests, a composer constantly at work at his piano, and a seductively constructed ballet dancer with a seemingly unending host of male admirers.  Kelly becomes concerned over his interest in observing the ballet dancer.<br />Eventually Stewart becomes preoccupied, however, with another neighbor, the husky, white-haired Raymond Burr, several years away from his future starring role in the Perry Mason television detective series.  Stewart notices that Burr's wife is ill and confined to bed.  He then becomes increasingly preoccupied with Burr's comings and goings at various hours of the night.  At first Kelly tells him he is concerned over nothing.  He then attracts her interest, and finally that of his detective friend and former World War Two Air Force buddy Wendell Corey.<br />Just what is happening?  Are their imaginations overworked?  The finale is spelled out in typical Hitchcock fashion, after he has worked his audience's curiosity to overpowering levels.  Hitchcock seemingly loved little, if anything, more than tweaking his audience.  The curiosity grows and grows until the finale.<br />The color and camera work are spectacular.  We stare into the lives of individuals who are unaware of the fact that we are there.  That is, until Raymond Burr begins to suspect something.  At that point the story moves into high gear, all the way to its compelling climax.
B00008PW2D|5.0|Sex and the City is by far my favorite show. It is the story of four single ladies mainly on a quest for men. This is a show about love, sex, dating, friendships, cocktails and fashion. Mostly, I would consider it to be a comedy. For all you women out there and even men, I highly recommend this show. Although there is only eight episodes in this particular set, it is still worth it to see. However, I think that you should watch all other four seasons as well. Trust me, you will be hooked.
0060254920|5.0|My almost two year old loves the monsters in this book. Of the dozens of books in our library, this one is clearly a favorite of all our family members. This is a great book for showing that scary looking monsters may not really be bad after all.
B00008US8R|5.0|I loved this cd. It was dark, but hopeful at the same time. I found that I could relate to most of the songs. I loved everything on this album. Amy's amazing voice brings a great sound to the heavy guitars. They really outdid themselves. The songs that most stand out to me were Going Under, My Immortal and Hello, although they were all great. Everybody should own this album, and if you don't, you better get it before someone finds out.
B00005JMGC|5.0|I truly loved this movie, even if I am a guy.  The writing, directing, and acting are so terrific, that I smell Oscar all over it next tear.  The movie does not fall into cliche.  It is just great all around!  I loved it.  This is a case of a strong ensemble of actors and that such a great story about women was written by two men, I am very amazed.  It has my highest recommendation.
1559409002|5.0|If you are a fan of this cult classic the the Criterion version is the only way to go!!! This contains two versions of the film(Theatical version and Extended Director's Cut). Both versions are superb!!! The audio commentary from the late Herk Harvey and John Clifford is also top notch!!! The extras are awesome!!! The outakes are super cool and look great to boot!!! Other extras include short film excerpts from Centron:the company who employed Herk Harvey and John Clifford!!! It also contains documentaries and other cool goodies!!!  This is one of the best deluxe DVD sets out there!!! Five Stars!!! A+
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet may be a copy of the White Stripes and have major influences from AC/DC, but does no one else see that they are almost identical to the early Beatles?  Even the album art looks like the revolver album. They feature many soft rock songs with a nice &quot;old school&quot; feel.  Highly recommended.
0385504209|1.0|I am not a Catholic.  I don't even have any close friends who are active Catholics, but this is too much.<br />The only reason other writers could give this book praise is because of its mercenary value.  Every writer would love to turn a trick like this one. Runaway best seller, movie deal.  You could retire and write some good stuff.<br />Fortunately most respectable writers have more integrity than Mr. Brown and would not stoop to this level.  The writing is junk.  The controversy is junk history.  Brown saw an opportunity to take advantage of the current anti-Catholic sentiment and jumped on it.<br />I'm sure he is laughing all the way to the bank.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a cute show.  It's amazing, but my 6 month old, baby girl LOVES this show.  I'm sure it is only for the bright colors, etc...   but it's fun to watch her look at all the shapes and colors.  I quite enjoy the movie myself.  It does have adult humor, but none that I find offensive to small children.  If you think your children are being corrupted, you're overestimating their comprehension a tad bit.  There is a reason why this is the best seller.  IT's a fun movie.
0375701427|5.0|American Pastoral is a brilliant work of literature. If you're looking for a novel that moves along rapidly and spends little time on character development and analysis, you might want to pass. However, if you're looking for a slower, deeply textured and obsessively detailed work, go for it.<br />This was a strange reading experience for me. The author, Philip Roth who won a Pulitzer Prize for this book, accurately describes precise locations - neighborhood, street, three-family-house, school yard, synagogue - where I grew up in Newark, New Jersey. He should know since he grew up there himself as did my parents at the same time in 1920's and 1930's.<br />There is a vivid depiction of the 1967 Newark riots. Being nearby as a 16-year old, I recall that one day there was fire and smoke and tanks rolling down the street and the next day there were block after block of boarded up, bombed out buildings.<br />Swede Levov, the book's protagonist, is a high school superstar. He is a first generation Jewish-American kid who is tall, blond, and athletic. He aspires to everything that many of the turn of the century immigrants wanted for their children, for them to assimilate fully and realize the American dream. For Swede, the American dream is transformed into a nightmare. As the book jacket aptly states, \\"overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longed-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk.\\"<br />Swede marries a Catholic girl from Elizabeth who is crowned Miss New Jersey, takes over his father's glove manufacturing company in Newark, and moves with his new wife to a suburb about 40 miles to the west despite his overbearing father's protests. They have a daughter Meredith who they affectionately call Merry and who, as she grows up, is anything but merry. She stutters when she speaks and when she speaks, and shrieks, it is often in protest.<br />Merry gets swept up in the radical protest politics of the 1960's - civil rights, Vietnam. She learns how to make bombs and, still a high school student, is implicated in the explosion of the post office in her quiet suburban town. The blast kills a well respected and beloved local doctor and Swede's American dream. A perfect life in the perfect suburb is quickly transformed into domestic disaster.<br />Swede, early on and before the fall, is presented as a hero who strides and glides through life, full of grace, admired by all, and unperturbed until the increasingly inescapable underbelly of American life as we know it today catches up with him. The dinner party at the end of the book brings Swede face to face, hilariously and tragically, with many of the contradictions and questions that come to besiege him.<br />As Swede the hero becomes the prototypical when-bad-things-happen-to-good-people tortured soul,  American Pastoral leaves me thinking that there's a little of Swede in all of us and, what was once the American dream is at best an anachronism or was, just beneath the surface, never more than an illusion.ake bombs and, still a high school student, is implicated in the explosion of the post office in her quiet suburban town.

0140390693|5.0|Little Women is a 500+ page book. Although long, it is a wonderful book that I will eventually read again. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are four teenage sisters. Throughout the book we see their lives. The father is fighting in the civil war. They are a poor family. But even so they find a way to make the best of life. Meg is proper and ladylike. She simply loves silk dresses. Jo is a tomboy with a temper. She loves to write and although she wants independance and freedom, she also wants to do something for the world and craves respect and honesty. I am most like Jo. I love to write and even though I am not a tomboy I feel that I most identify with her. Beth is a sweet pianist who is a little angel. She is timid and feels that she does not do enough with her life as she mostly stays home with their maid Hannah. When she is on her deathbed she reads a poem by Jo about her and realizes that she made a difference in her older sister's life. THat makes her feel better. Amy is a bit of a snob. She is a talented artist who hates her nose. She says she will marry for money. Laurie is the next door neighbor. He and Jo become best friends. When he asks Jo to marry him she refuses because they are both so independant that it would ruin their relationship as just friends. It breaks his heart. He later marries Amy, who although Laurie does have a lot of money, she also loves him. Marmee is a mix of all four of her daughters. I highly recommend this book. Don't put it down because it is too long. The second half of the book is better. I admit, I felt like punching it when I was at the last 25 pages. Suffer through 562 pages and not regret it because of the ending, trust me you will love this book! Go Little Women!
B00009TB5G|1.0|I cannot get through 10 minutes of any of these movies.  I know some may love them, but I find them so boring.  It is all I can do to stay awake during the trailers.  I think the effects are awesome, but the story and characters just don't grab me at all.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This album is fantastic.  It is fresh and new.  Josh excels in pleasing his audience.(I think he needs a new manager to give him greater exposure to his fans!) This CD has a wonderful mixture of music.  The tempos change and he draws you in to listen to every word and note.<BR>Unlike most young singers of today he does not scream and shout and distort his voice.  He is a breath of fresh air. He can appeal to all ages that know and love excellent talent and can spot it.  How nice to be able to understand every single syllable that he sings!
B00005JMGL|5.0|What a beautiful work of emotional and external art! I have always been a Peter Pan fan, but had yet to see a motion picture that quite did the book justice--and I have finally found one! <br />The movie is faithful to the book without being slavish though--after all, this IS someone else`s vision of a universally loved book. P.J. Hogan adds an interestingly *older* appeal while still retaining all the beauty, wonder, and young innocence of Peter and Neverland. Jeremy Sumpter is the boy always meant for this role. I could not *dream* up a better Peter, with his dirty feet and ethereal smile. Rachel Hurd-Wood is surprisingly convincing as Wendy, and Jason Isaacs a strangely seductive Captain Hook. I also love the new take on the mermaids, and the sheer realness of the Lost Boys. The effects are almost liquid, they fit so well--I`m quite impressed with the flying scenes most of all. <br />This is undoubtedly the best Pan adaptation to date, stunning in story and setting (filmed in Australia). James Newton Howard blends a perfect meeting of old and young feelings into the score. It made me almost sad that I wasn`t little anymore, even though I`m really no more than a teenager at sixteen. It was the feeling of security and fun that trickles away with the years, and Peter Pan has always aided me on helping me regain that sense of wonder for everything around me. This film is no exception. ^^ <br />The `I do believe in fairies` scene was absolutely magical. <br />I loved the chemistry between Peter and Wendy--and the fact that it was taken a step further. It really gave more internal depth to them both, Peter in particular. <br />A truely timeless story evolved into a truly timeless picture--a triumph! I can`t wait to see it again.
B00005JMTN|5.0|As the movie begins, we see a fantastic fish swimming in a fantastic body of water, as a man's voice tell's the tale of how he caught said fish, on the day of his son's birth. Imediately, I was excited to watch this film, since as a fouteen-year-old following the craze of Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, and had to search many theatres to fine where it was showing.  We ended up at this two-screen theatre down in our area with big squeaky blue seats.  People behind me keep talking, and yet the cinematography and enchanting imagination of this movie truly had me captivated. Not only did I love the plot, I was entralled by the characters and the father-son tension.  I was endeared to Ewan McGregor's character from the start where he thanked the fish for giving him back his wedding ring and transitioned to letting the fish go so his son could have a similar outlook-changing experience and catch an uncatchable fish. I would reccomend this to all, but I do believe a certain portion of people would not appreciate this film, and many amy not comprehend it's comlicated double-plot line.
B00008PX8P|4.0|This DVD is strictly amazing, there is no other way to put it.  So why did I give it four stars, we'll get to that.<br />The first disc is the main attraction, a 2 hour concert from 1970 meant to be watched as a movie, and let me tell you, it is one.  I could not move during Jimmy Page's amazing display of guitar innovation during Dazed and Confused, and found myself jaw open for ten minutes while watching him perform White Summer alone in the middle of the stage.  John Bonham proved once again he is the greatest Rock and Roll drummer during Moby Dick.  But here comes the reason I gave it four stars.  Sometimes, the footage goes into still shots or slow motiont shots or speeds up, little camera tricks.  It doesn't happen to often, except during the last song, but when it does, I find it insanely annoying.  However, this alone cannot sway me from thinking this is an amazing DVD.  The second disc, especially the acoustic performances at Earls Court, is equally stunning.  I recommend this DVD to any Zeppelin fan, young, old, new, or faithful.

Great dvd!
0553573403|5.0|I love this series!  I can't wait for book 4.  Ok, I'll admit that it started out a bit slow and tedious.  And I kept wondering when we were going to get to the action.  But then I realized this book is not about action, its about the characters.  Every character in this series is so vivid.  And you get to know the evil characters so well you actually end up rooting for them.  This book is definitely not black and white when it comes to good and evil (among the humans at least).  There's also plenty of mystery and intrigue, as you know some other-worldly force is brewing up north but you don't know what it is.
B000002GYW|4.0|Although I've been a casual fan of Eagles since they got started, I never actually owned one of their albums. I asked for this one for Christmas because in spite of this being only their second release, it has three of their finest songs: &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; and (Whatever Happened to)&quot;Saturday Night.&quot; The CD is only a little more than 30 minutes in length, but the rest of it isn't bad either. &quot;Doolin-Dalton&quot; and the &quot;Doolin-Dalton/Desperado Reprise&quot; open and close the journey, and are different enough and good enough to bear repeated play side-by-side. &quot;Outlaw Man&quot; by the under-appreciated '60's folkie David Blue (who died too young) is also of interest. Put on the market 30 years ago, this one still holds up, in my view. The selections could almost pass as traditional cowboy and outlaw songs, and those never go out of date.

0061015725|5.0|This is a great book.  By about page nine or so it will start to get under your skin and itch (bad pun intended), and you won't be able to put it down until you finish it. <br />Crichton has really put it all together here, a tight well worked plot, a really terrifying threat, and just the right touch of erotically served up evil to really give you the creeps.  The Thomas Dolby song &quot;She Blinded Me With Science&quot; will make the perfect opening score for the movie.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|the only problem is the sound on &quot;aliens&quot; it still sounds as crappy as the previous release maybe a dts track couldve helped.i mean its still a good 5.1 surround mix.there just isnt a whole lot of clarity or seperation.look what james cameron and crew did with redoing the sound on the first terminator.that was a crappy mono track and they turned into a powerhouse of punch and clarity i dont know why they couldnt have done some of that with &quot;aliens&quot; too.but overall this box set rocks.you get to see all the actors then and now.commenting on the production and how it affected their lives at the time.and just tons of other stuff.go buy this you wont be sorry!!!
B000002AGM|5.0|I like this project better than &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; because there are more midtempo tracks here, and it has a more cheerful mood throughout. As with the &quot;Spain&quot; CD, Gil Evans uses a big band in a subtle manner to enrich Miles' solos. I think newcomers to classic jazz would be pleased to hear it, and encouraged to explore Davis in more depth. This is my eighth Davis CD, although I was a casual fan back in the early 60's in college. I even saw him at Madison Square Garden around 1970, but I much prefer his 50's and early 60's work. Read five or six of the earlier reviews to get details of the album. I will play &quot;In Person Friday at the Blackhawk&quot; and &quot;Saturday at the Blackhawk&quot; and &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and &quot;Milestones&quot; more often than &quot;Miles Ahead&quot;, but your own tastes will lead you to different choices. Suffice to say that the almost 60 minutes it takes to hear &quot;Miles Ahead&quot; is an hour well-spent, featuring a troubled genius playing near his peak in 1957, with great accompaniment and intelligent production.
B00004W52U|5.0|I absolutely love this band.  Pre-Rancid.  Just plain awesome.  It has all the best songs on here...  And you will for sure rock out to it.  My sister who is into hip op loves this CD as well.  It is upbeat and will always put you in a good mood.  Anyway.... Take warning! :)
B0000DJZA5|5.0|There is no doubt that Let It Be Naked is the most rockin' album 2003. Not quite as good the original, but nevertheless, not bad at all. The second disc is interesting - a nice look into where they were at by Michael Lindsay-Hogg in 1969. <BR>Yeh, the first just hits 35 min, but it's still all great music.<br />Great stuff.
B00005JM0B|5.0|ok yeah it couldve been better with james cameron directing it.but really this movie rocks.and the reason i read for eddie furlong not reprisng his role as john was because he has had a bad drug problem.and the casting director and everyone thought he would have been too much of a risk.alot was riding on this movie and everything had to be just right.i also heard that james cameron thought this movie was still brilliant.
B000002G7E|5.0|White Light/White Heat is the best album, in my own opinion, from the Velvet Underground (Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Maureen Tucker). The dissonant, sonic noise that pulsates from Sister Ray is worth the price of admission alone! Below is an analysis of the contents of this abrasive masterpiece:<BR> <BR> <BR>1. White Light/White Heat: A cross between 50's music and 70's rock creating the 2nd best song on the album.<br />2. The Gift: \\"Interesting\\" is the only word to describe this. John Cale reads a story written by Lou in the left speaker, while the band jams in the other. I have mixed feelings on this song.<br />3. Lady Godiva's Operation: Who knew that a song about a sex change operation could be so wonderful? John Cale sings through half of the song, then Lou Reed starts to interweave his own voice into the mix. Excellent vocal sound effects at the end.<br />4. Here She Comes Now: A fantastic soft song. Short, sweet, almost like an intermission for the sonic bombardment to come.<br />5. I Heard Her Call My Name: The only song that I usually skip over when listening to this CD. The feedback-laden guitar solo can only go on so long before it gets on my nerves.<br />6. Sister Ray: It is rumored that during the recording of this song, the sound engineer walked out and said, \\"Let me know when you're done!\\" It was all for the better. Everyone in the band is fighting for the spotlight, turning the amps up to 11 (literally!) to be heard over all else. It should be called \\"The Battle Of Sister Ray.\\" A sonic masterpiece.<br /> <BR>This album has a fine place in my collection, along with my other VU albums. I pull this one out most often cause I think it's thier peak as artists. Don't get me wrong, I like the others (especially The Banana Album), but this is the best, over all others. <br />Pounding fuzz, feedback, distorion, and noise.<br />I like it.
0767906543|5.0|If you haven't already read Mr. Commitment then you are missing out! Mr. Commitment is a great novel that will keep you turning the pages.  I read this book in a few days even though I was only reading at night.  The fact that it was written by a male author made it more interesting to actually read about the way the male mind works.  The only thing I didn't really like about the book was how much British language was used because I didn't understand some of it. But overall the book is awesome!<br />I definitely recommend adding it to your collection!
B000002UB3|5.0|This could quite possibly be the best beatles album next to sgt. pepper (with the exception of maybe, revolver). great compositions, orchestration - a wonder of musical history!<br />A great album!
0689859368|5.0|I loved these books and can hardly wait for the others. I lent them to my mother and have forwarded them on to my nephew. We all enjoyed them. I find nothing objectionable about these books. I wonder if the other reviewers gave the same bad reviews to other children's classics that were more scary and violent. These showed the value of family staying together and helping one another under adverse conditions..a father leaving or goblins attacking. Wonderful!
B00005JLKB|5.0|This dvd is great for remembering when: Clark couldn't even walk  up to Lana with out falling. Remembering when Lana and Whit were the perfect couple.Remembering when that girl had an obsession over Lana. Remembering when you would jump out your couch at the sight of Lex, cause you thought he knew Clark's secret.. I could go on and on. Lets just sum it up and say that Smallville dvd season one is the best.
B0000013G9|5.0|CrazySexyCool was THE soundtrack of the mid-90s. The album title alone entered the world's lexicon sheerly on the strength of TLC's popularity. All four singles, Creep, Red Light Special, Waterfalls and Diggin' On You, redefined the girl-group sound and R&amp;B in general, and it's not for no reason that TLC was the best selling female group for a long time.<br />Greater things could have come from this already massively great album if it wasn't for bad management and bad luck. Kick Your Game and Switch, among other potential hits, could have been smashes in their own rights.<br />TLC had a unique sound and awesome image, stood up for what they believed in, produced the best videos, and were the definitive independent women with plenty of girl power. This is the TLC album to buy if you, for some weird reason, do not own any yet.
B00004VWA7|5.0|Amazing! Jaco played the bass so well, I just can't tell you how great this album is - this is the best, and most innovative bass album ever!<br />Great!!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is another great Miyazaki film and has brought his name and his art to attention of the world. Disney's DVD release of the picture is an all around excellent DVD with some insightful extras.<BR>Personally I don't find Spirited Away to be the top of Miyazaki's game. I found Laputa, Nausicaa, Mononoke, and Kiki to be better works. Had Spirited Away been created by another artist I would have hailed higher, but Miyazaki has such a stunning catalogue that comparisons have to be made. The reason for my lower opinion of Spirited Away is the way Miyazaki's absolutely breathtaking and stunning imagination tends to overwhelm the narrative. Spirited Away is a masterpiece in visual design and is a truly one of a kind fantasy world, but the story didn't captivate me as much as other Miyazaki pictures. The grand narratives of Mononoke, Laputa, and Nausicaa dwarf Spirited Away while still thriving in the visual department. The simpler films: Kiki and Totoro captivated me more sucessfully on an emotional level then Spirited Away. Still the film is amazing, a wonder of animation, although I was a little bothered with a few uses of digital work for motion. Integration is still sketchy at this stage, but not as bad as in live action films. The movie is a marvel, but younger children might find some scenes a little disturbing. The dragon bleds alot leaving some heavy blood smears and the No Face eats some people and grossly vomits out brown liquid. When I saw it in the theater several young children started to cry and even as a college student found the scenes pretty intense for real young ones.<BR>Picture quality is excellent. A great tranfer that highlights Miyazaki's amazing animation. Colors didn't seem as bright as the Kiki DVD, but still a flawless print with stunning sharpness and color. Image is nn 2:0:1 to perserve aspect ratio and good for small tvs. Sound is excellent, the Japanese and English tracks are in 5.1. I only have stereo speakers so I can't say muchon that. The English track is fine, but always go for the Japanese, although the ending song is in Japanese on both tracks. Making up for the problems on Kiki and Castle is an on the fly audio/subtitle change option. There is French too. Subtitles are yellow and in frame, good for 16x9 tvs, bad for small tvs because it covers up more of the image. <BR>Extras have the standard Lasseter intro, which starts if you change to Japanese and \\"resume film\\" even if you don't want it to play. The English production is documented in \\"Art of Spirited Away\\". It is a good documentary on the English production, shades of Disney specials. Worth watching for the explanation of the finger chop that Chihiro is given. The behind the microphone section is not interesting. The Japanese Trailers run back to back and give away most of the story. The highlight of the extras is the fabulous Nippon Special on the film. This Japanese documentary gives Miyazaki fans a dream come true, an indepth look at Miyazaki's creative process. We are actually taken into the studio for over half and hour to watch step by step how Miyazaki's team created Spirited Away. From planning to intensive drawing sessions, to recording voices and sound, to the story behind the stunning closing song, the documentary is a wonder. Anyone interested in the process of animation will be amazed at the limited resources Miyazaki has in comparison to American animators. The recording room is a converted movie theater without a soundproof window, so a laugh from a crew member will spoil a take. Miyazaki own dedication and involvement with every detail is made extremely clear with his late night working binges and supervision of everything. We even see him cook dinner for the team. The most fascinating aspect comes in the planning stage where Miyazaki can on the drop of a hat explain the every detail of a single real life movement or action that he wants in the film. Miyazaki is shocked when he discovers his team hasn't seen lizards fall from trees and haven't held open the jaws of a dog. He sighed and laments on the end of Japanese culture. The documentary is a true wonder and an absolute must for any Miyazaki fan. The second disc is the storyboard of the film with complete language tracks. It has what Castle in the Sky and Kiki didn't, an angle switch option with the animated film making it worth something.<BR>Spirited Away is a great animated film a stunning work of imagination and fantasy, but by my taste not Miyazaki's best. Disney's DVD release has the stunning picture and sound of all its Miyazaki release and fixes the angle switch and on the fly audio/subtitle problems in previous the dvds. The extras are amazing with a good English documentary and a fascinating and one of a kind Japanese documentary that takes you into Studio Ghibli to showcase Miyazaki's production process.<BR>The film I'd give 4 out of 5.<BR>The DVD 5 out of 5.
B000060MWU|3.0|I swear it looks like this movie was put on DVD by a 14 year old with his home computer.  The quality looks so much like VHS that was put to DVD that I think it is a shell game to a consumer to let them think this movie is available on &quot;DVD.&quot;<br />Movie is great, but DVD quality so poor hard to ignore.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I've been waiting for so long for the second release of new material by Josh Groban.  I gave his first CD as a gift to at least ten other middle-aged women, and started them all lusting after someone young enough to be their respective sons.<BR>I heartily recommend it to any man who can't figure out what to get his wife for Valentine's Day.  It's a great aphrodisiac, no matter how old your lady is.<BR>That said, the second CD was a slow starter for me.  I've given it as a gift to three people; two of them also prefer the first CD.  I have slowly grown to like about half the songs, strictly for the quality of Josh Groban's voice.  It is incredibly beautiful, and he could sing a grocery list and I would listen.  To borrow a line from an old Neil Diamond song, lower the orchestrations and just &quot;let the little boy sing&quot;.  He's just so cute and seems like such a nice guy.  And the voice; oh, the voice.  Just sing, Josh!!!!!  No other musical instrument can compete.
B0000VAFNQ|4.0|Wading through the reviews of Underworld, it's easy to get a mixed feeling of how good or bad this movie is. Here is the simple truth: if you know what the plot is (ware wolfs vs. vampires), and aren't completely tuned off by the idea, go ahead and give the movie a spin. For what it is, and what it has to work with, it is a very good title that will, for the most part, keep you entertained from start to finish.
B000002BHE|5.0|In 1996, Celine Dion released her fourth English-language album called FALLING INTO YOU and what a hit it was! After the release of her 1993 album THE COLOUR OF MY LOVE, Celine married her manager Ren Anglil in 1994 and in 1995, she released her famous French album D'EUX. So, when she returned with FALLING INTO YOU in March 1996, people rushed to the stores to get this album. The first single was the #1 hit &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; from the movie &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot;. The album contains 15 songs and all of em' could've been top ten hits, three of them did become top ten hits. But the crown jewel of the album is certainly the remake of Eric Carmen's &quot;All By Myself&quot;, which Celine performs with such vocal power that it makes the song the best Celine Dion ballad. The album also includes the song produced by Jim Steinmmen called &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot;. FALLING INTO YOU was released in March of 1996 and sold 32 million copies worldwide including 11 million copies in the U.S. alone, making it the best-selling album of 1996 and also of 1997. It made Celine Dion a worldwide superstar since she did a two-year world tour following the release of this album. In February of 1997, Celine won two Grammy's including the most important of them all: Album Of The Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. It also paved the way for her 1997 album called LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is by far my favorite album of all-time and a must own. The album has a sence of loss, but a will to survive, which is ironic and symbolic for all the things that happened to them while recording this and being dropped from Reprise Records. I give so much credit to Jeff Tweedy for his songwriting, but everyone involved in this album I feel went above and beyond. One thing that I love about this album, is that it was very grass-roots for the band and it also became their biggest success and greatest album to date. Jeff Tweedy is the kind of writer that does not try to write a &quot;Hit song&quot;, but writes for himself, and that is what I truely admire. If you can find the extended Tour Edition of this album with the 6 extra songs, I highly recomend it. It is worth the extra money for the songs &quot;More Like The Moon&quot; and &quot;Handshake Drugs&quot;, plus &quot;Bob Dylan's 49th Beard&quot; is really good too.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Unfortunately, to the average fan this stuff is great. The problem I have is the Earls Court footage is not from the best night. Folks, you must believe me here. The DVD bootleg footage of 5/24/75, which is the night before most of the dvd footage,blows it away. The version of 'The song remains the same and the rain song' give me chills. The entire acoustic segment towers over the dvd versions. Why Page didn't commercially release this is beyond comprehension. The Knebworth footage is enlightening, especialy Bonzo. But hears the real thing. What made Led Zeppelin so special is the fact that you could never grab them. They were inaccessable. The only incredible times are the ones you hear but never see. No interviews, no t.v., hardly a press conference. Just the music. Street music. Bare bones rock and roll that you would have heard from the lower east side of Manhattan to Upper Harlem. You can hear them in rock, progressive, rap, dance, ect.. Zep had the groove. They were the real deal. After every tour it was back to the midlands of England with no fanfare. As Jimmy Page once said, it was 'light and shade'. For a band to be second to the great Beatles in record sales with only a handful of records, no solid concert footage, albums with no writing or band identification on them, and constantly featured, to this very day, in musician magazines and music weeklys, as major influences, its quite a treat to 'almost' capture them. But we will never, really.
B000031XCR|5.0|In 1999, Celine Dion announced that she was taking a two-year break from the music industry to try and have a child. Before leaving, she left us with a compilation of her greatest hits throughout the 90's. With songs like THE POWER OF LOVE, BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME and the big hit MY HEART WILL GO ON, you are gonna enjoy this CD for many years. The CD also includes 7 new songs recorded especially for this compilation. It includes the top ten hit &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot; and others. The new songs are very good and she could've easily done a whole album with songs like those, they have been produced with Max Martin who worked with NSYNC and Britney Spears among others. The CD is sad because you know that it's gonna be the last one for a while. So, if you like Celine Dion and have many albums of hers, buy this one.
B00006CXSS|5.0|this is the most accurate wwII story ever,  it follows the brave men of easy company and puts you right in the battle as you experience it  through their eyes.  if you are interested n wwII at all, buy this right now, excelent movie
B000001DVD|4.0|This record was released when disco was all but dead,(i hated disco)and radio needed something to play and rock needed a shot in the arm. As MTV was just getting off the ground, Def Leppard ended up in heavy rotation as there was not a lot of videos out there. All that helped launch Def Leppard and this record just rocks, start to finish. It has an AC/DC flavor to it, but you could tell these guys were on to something.  If you don't have this one in your collection, buy it and you'll see how these guys could rock with the best of them.
0671027387|5.0|Prepare to be thoroughly entertained when you pick up a copy of Dan Brown's \\"Deception Point\\".  The book takes off from page 1 with a plot that's so well crafted the reader will practically burn his or her fingers turning pages so fast!<br />The story centers around a tight Presidential race between the incumbent, Zach Herney and his ethics-challenged rival, Sen. Sedgewick Sexton.  As Sexton gains ground in the polls, it appears to Herney and his staff that only a miracle can keep him in office.  That miracle appears in the form of a spectacular discovery that NASA makes in the Arctic.  A discovery that could change the course of mankind forever.  To give this find credibility, Pres. Herney calls upon the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to verify the discovery before he goes public with it.  As luck (or good writing) would have it, the NRO agent assigned to the verification process is Rachel Sexton, daughter of Sen. Sexton.  A daughter who hasn't spoken with her ambition-blinded father since her mother died.<br />When Rachel travels to Arctic to help with the verification process, she suddenly finds that there may be reason to believe that NASA's discovery is part of a government conspiracy of the highest level.  As she and scientists, Michael Toland and Corky Marlinson, get too close to the real truth, they quickly find themselves scrambling to stay alive in the desolate Arctic locale.<br />Filled with memorable characters and great plot twists, the reader with be enthralled with \\"Deception Point\\"!  Just when I thought I had a pretty good grasp of \\"whodunit\\", Brown would pull the plot rug out from under my legs.  Unlike a lot of the fiction that I've read, there's a lot of \\"gray\\" in many of the characters in this book.  I found that to be refreshing and actually increased the credibility of the book.<br />This is the first book that I've read by Dan Brown.  I can't wait to get the opportunity to read his other novels (as of this writing) \\"Digital Fortress\\", \\"Angels and Demons\\", and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!s\\", \\"Angels and Demons\\", and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00000I3JM|5.0|When I first heard this album, the thing that amazed me the most was how truly timeless it sounded. I could not believe it was written and recorded 20 years ago. Unlike many of its contemporaries, it has avoided the &quot;trappings&quot; of the &quot;new wave&quot; sound of its era. I purchased it after reading so many glowing reviews, and was expecting to hear something along the lines of say, ABC, Heaven 17 or Gary Numan, who were defining the sound of modern music of that time period. Instead, I got something unique. This is not David Sylvian or a blast from the past of that 80's new wave sound, but something that stands strong on its own. I truly love it because it is a rare album that is beautiful, eloquent, elegant and powerfully moving yet without a bit of the melancholy that usually pervades music of this depth. Thanks Blue Nile, sorry I overlooked this all these years.
B0000DI86O|5.0|Umberto Giordano's most famous opera &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; portrays the tragic fate of poet Andrea Chénier in the French Revolution. Setting the real-life figure as the lead character and with the poet singing his own verses, this verismo opera embraces the realism enthusiastically. Character Andrea Chénier is a romantic and idealistic poet, who loved his country ardently and faced his death heroically. It's a tenor's opera. You would think a lyric tenor would be most suitable for the character's poetry, if he could also bring off some great heroic moments in the big orchestration. In this 1985 production, Domingo rendered Andrea Chénier with a well-balanced poetry and heroism. He filled poet's big arias with rich lyricism, at times, intimate feelings, and yet, the big outbursts were all there. Domingo was well matched by the powerful-voiced Anna Tomawa-Sintov as Maddalena. In her dark and rounded voice, Anna Tomowa-Sintov sang the character strongly, although some delicacy and variety might make the role more interesting. Her \\"La mamma morta\\" was in no short of dramatic expressions in both the recitative-like passages and the emotional outbursts followed. Giorgio Zancanaro, who approached the revolutionary Gérard humanly, sang a wonderful \\"Nemico della patria\\", which won him a storm of applause from the audience.<br />The stage design of this Covent Garden production is conventional, straightforward, with a few moments quite affecting, one of them would be the haunting picture at the end of Act I, in which the shadows of the poor and the angry gradually appeared above the aristocrats who were in the center stage, singing and dancing, without the faintest idea of what was awaiting.
B00005UKKF|3.0|Well let me start off by saying that I first saw this concert when it was aired in my country during the day. Inevitably I recorded the concert and was awestruck with the last performance (Baby One More Time Remixed). About 6 months later I saw my local CD/DVD store had this DVD on for sale and I bought it expecting pretty much the same footage of what I saw on the tv aired version of the concert.<br />The first thing that got to me when I played the DVD was the intro, I noticed that new footage of the intro was inlcuded on the DVD which were cut down from the tv aired version for time constraints, so I thought to myself &quot;oh so this DVD has the uncut length of the concert&quot;. While going through the concert most of the footage was pretty much the same as to what I saw on the tv when it was aired with the exception of some performances that had different angle shots to the tv version such as I Love Rock &amp; Roll, What It's Like To Be Me &amp; Baby One More Time.<br />Ok now to the things that were cut out of the concert when it was aired on tv, as mentioned before the intro was much longer than the tv version, after performing Stronger Britney takes a short rest and comes out talking about how proud she is of her country and going to the satellite feedback of selected military bases that her concert was being aired to, a comedy skit of &quot;Making The Band&quot; Documentary which was really the interlude to her I Love Rock &amp; Roll performance and a bungee jumping &amp; running scene which Britney performed straight after performing I Love Rock &amp; Roll, one more factor or thing I noticed was that after the concert the credits went longer then to what was aired on tv but most of you guys wouldn't care about this anyway unless you liked listening to the background music while the credits roled.<br />Another thing I noticed was that her vocals for her performances of Anticipating &amp; Baby One More Time was edited, this to me was a let down for her BabyOne More Time performance because the performances of these songs I saw on the tv sounded different such as Anticipating the back-track for this song dropped out tremendously in the tv aired version where I could even hardly hear Britney's &quot;pre-recorded vocals&quot; but on the DVD the sound has been edited and I could hear her vocals (not her real vocals of course). For her Baby One More Time audio, I can say that she DID sing live for that track but for some reason the people who made this DVD decided to decrease the sound of her vocals for this performance and put her backing-vocals before her real vocals (in other words minimise Britney's singing voice). I found the decrease of the crowd's screaming &amp; yelling sound to be a good factor as it let me hear more clear of Britney's performances.<br />One obvious feature that this DVD lacks is the Bonus Features, well from what I have my Aussie version of this DVD, it contains 3 music videos which are I'm A Slave 4 U, Overprotected (European Video) &amp; Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman (Non Movie Version) and these are really the only extra features which I was kind of disappointed as they could've added the HBO commercial for this concert &amp; the Crossroads trailer.<br />Overall, I found this concert to be enjoyable but some performances that I could've done without such as Don't Let Me Be Tha Last To Know &amp; (You Drive Me) Crazy (thank god for the skipping button) the visuals &amp; choreography for this concert was superb (I liked the idea of Britney battling against a virtual-version of herself for the performance of Lonely) however the singing in this concert was definitely lacking &amp; yes I know that she lip-synched throughout most of the concert but with the concert as energetic &amp; tiring as it was which singer wouldn't do that but I did get put off on how Britney lip-synched for her performance of Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman with how slow paced the song was she could've at least sung it live that'snot to mention her bad, bad singing for Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know in this concert which in fact was her real singing of that song. If you're a ultra die-hard Britney fan then this DVD is for you but don't expect special features other than the the 3 music videos &amp; trailer for Crossroads (I don't know why the trailer wasn't put onto my aussie version of this DVD but it was put on the US &amp; UK version).
B00005JMCN|5.0|I really can't see how people do not enjoy this film. Of course it can't illustrate EVERY fact that is told in the book; the movie would be three hours long! I think, however, that this film actually does stay pretty close to the novel, and I would highly recommend both. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Tobey Maguire, and especially Bill Macy all turn in great performances. Who knows if the Academy will recognize any of them, but regardless, Seabiscuit is a touching story of an underdog who taught the world about second chances, hope, determination,and courage. Great movie.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Okay ... I know most people wont admit it that they are a Britney Spears fan but, I am.  Having bought her first album, I thought it was great!  The favorite song from the first is \\"Sometimes.\\"  After buying the first one, I had to wait for the follow up \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" only good songs were \\"Stronger\\" \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Dear Diary.\\"  I had to wait LONGER for the long awaited album \\"Britney,\\" which was to be the Crossroads soundtrack (well ... had 3 songs from her movie.)  Only good songs on that album was \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" and \\"Overprotected\\" also \\"I Love Rock-N-Roll.\\"  Had to wait for about a year for this long awaited smash hit to BRITNEY.  I was wrong!  This album is crap and I'm not afraid to admit it.  I bought it thinking it would be as good as the first 3, but, not even close!  What has happened to the Britney Spears we know?  Good songs are \\"Me Against The Music\\" and \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom.\\"  Listen to me and don't buy this album!!  It sucks!!
B00005IC2H|5.0|The lyrics of Agaetis Byrjun ARE actually translatable (if you happen to be one of those people who MUST have words), though I prefer to quiet myself and let the music do the talking...<br />After reading several of the reviews here I'm rather surprised to discover that most people are under the false assumption that the entire album is sung in lead singer Jonsi's &quot;Hopelandic.&quot; If you do your research you'll find that the only song on Agaetis Byrjun sung in this invented language is &quot;olsen olsen.&quot; The rest of the album is in plain ol' Icelandic, the lyrics of which have been translated into English on various web sites on the web. For example &quot;Svefn-g- englar&quot; literally translates into &quot;the sleepwalkers,&quot; &quot;ny batterí&quot; means &quot;new batteries&quot; and so on. For more info I'd recommend the band's website. Just a thought, folks...
B00009RDG9|5.0|I rented this movie for Christmas time hoping to see a great movie and YES it was the greatest movie I've seen in 2003.To my biggest surprise the movie starts off with the war in Kosovo where the serbs are so vividly and accurately described<BR>killing innocent Albanian civilians as they burn down their <BR>towns and villages. What serbs don't know is that the Americans are observing their massacres from the very same spot so SAS forces head on and one soldier goes and slaughters the serb commander who gave orders to kill everyone in the town but when this soldier comes back home to U.S.A. he can not let go of the horrible things he saw.<BR>The killings and slaughtering of hundreds of Albanian men,<BR>children,women and elder people by cruel and idiotic serbs haunt him and change the path of his life. So back in U.S.A. he protects deers and other animals and kills all their killers.<br />This movie is so great and it makes you do a lot of thinking.<BR>Only once you've seen this movie you can have some idea what really went on in Kosovo and how bad it really was (and can be).<br />Highly Recommended for all.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes come through with &quot;Room on Fire&quot;.  This New York sensation went in a slightly different, more upbeat direction with their newest CD.  While &quot;Is This It&quot; had a brilliant, low tempo opener, &quot;Room on Fire&quot; blares the stereo with its catchy instrumentals and infectious lyrics (I wanna be forgotten/And I don't wanna be reminded/He said, Please, don't make this harder/No, I won't yet).  The first three tracks that lead up to the single &quot;12:51&quot; are amazing, but distinct- overcoming one of the shortcomings of &quot;Is this it&quot;.<BR>     The eighth track, &quot;Under Control&quot;, is a good break in the CD.  They decide to slow it down a bit in this 60s shoutback that is remarkably reminiscent with &quot;Find Another Girl&quot; by the Hives.  This leads to the song that, in my opinion, is the best song on the CD.  &quot;The End has no End&quot; is catchy and full of explosive energy, and I could listen to it non-stop for days.  All in all, the CD is incredible, and don't let any of the negative reviews fool you.  Most of those people don't know what they're talking about.  If you liked the Strokes first effort, you have to buy this CD.
B000050XEI|5.0|A Day Without Rain is brilliant. Enya has an incredible power to heal my soul from the first time I've listened to her with &quot;The Cetls Album&quot;. The career of this genious artist will last forever. I am always anxious to get the next album.<BR>The first track is named with the album title. As it sugests, Ireland has a very changeable weather, but Enya has the power to settle down the &quot;storms&quot;. If you have the opportunity to see the videos based on her songs, you will see that whenever you do it, you have a new sensation of peace and comfort. She is the metaphore of the eternal youth. See, for instance, &quot;Wild Child&quot; video. &quot;Only Time&quot; was used on the film &quot;Sweet November&quot;, with Charlize Theron and Keenu Reeves. Imagine yourself on a road and have Enya as a guide. &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot;, in latim, as &quot;Cursum Perficio&quot; and &quot;Pax Deorum&quot;, on previous albums, lead us to a mystical environment, echoes from the past, memories of the celtic civilization. &quot;Pilgrim&quot; shows us that each of us are pigrims in our journey on earth. &quot;Lazy Days&quot; is brilliant. For me there are two moments on the song: the days we are resting and the days we are working hard. <BR>It's quite impossible to describle each of the songs. Each of them has its particularity. <BR>After also buying &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; soundtrack, in which Enya performs &quot;Anron&quot; and &quot;May it be&quot;, I am searching for &quot;Enya Video Collection&quot; everywhere. Enya, in a nutshell, is a Fairy Tale.
0736041850|5.0|Strength Training Anatomy is exactly what it claims to be:  the best anatomy reference as it relates to strength training.  While this book doesn't offer information on strength training programs or offer any real secrets to getting big or toned or anything to that effect, it does offer beautiful anatomical illustrations of people performing typical exercises.  If you enjoy learning about the human body and are passionate about strength training, this is a wonderful reference which will satisfy your knowledge of the basic anatomy of weight training.  <br />However, please realize that this book does not offer any form of advice or insight onto training programs, simply gives a good picture of what muscles are moving the weight.  This is a very good layman's anatomy reference, so keep this in mind!
B00005JMGC|3.0|I attended Wellesley in the early to mid 1960's and thought the movie would be authentic for the time frame it presented --1954--because there aren't too many years in between.  I laughed at the silly stuff we still did in the 1960s, like the hoop roll, the sack bathing suits for swim class (and the caps!), wearing skirts to class, using rollers and pin curls in our hair, and the pearls, the lessons on etiquette (how to sit, stand and walk, we really did that!), the parietal rules, etc.  I mostly laughed during the movie--a lot!  Those days seem so far away to me now.  I'm glad so many people enjoyed the movie, even if they didn't go to Wellesley!
B0000AUHOH|4.0|I saw this movie the first day it came out, and I am in agreement with the widespread belief that this movie is the worst Star Trek movie ever made.  The Special Edition is worthwhile, though, because of the hours of extensive extra commentary and behind-the-scenes documentaries that are included.<br />The subtitle text commentary points out some of the movie's minor and obvious flaws.  The audio commentary by Shatner sounds like torture for him as he explains what went wrong.  I feel bad for him having to sit through the entire movie and comment.  Some of the documentaries go into the problems that made the movie a failure.  According to the documentaries, they couldn't afford to do the ending they wanted.  Shatner had envisioned an action ending with monsters spawning from the planet and chasing the landing party through the rugged terrain.  Without an action ending, the viewer is left looking for a philosophical conclusion that is just not there.<br />Although the commentary only scratches the surface of the problems in the making of the movie, I got a pretty good idea of what went wrong.  Shatner muscled is way into the directing job.  He lacked the experience and political acumen to get people on his side to \\"push back\\" on the producers regarding schedule and budget.  He seems to fancy that Star Trek is all about Captain Kirk.  His original idea for the plot was for everyone to be co-opted by Sybok with only Kirk unaffected.  He admits in the interviews that he didn't know what job functions some of the characters perform on the show.  At one point he appears to forget Walter Koenig's (who plays Chekov) name.  This gives me the idea that he underestimates the importance of the other actors.  It is sad that the movie was a failure because despite their flaws everyone involved clearly tried hard to make it good.<br />For people who don't know, here are the movie's failings:<br />-Slapstick comedy is mixed clumsily with serious ideas.<br />-There is almost no real treatment of the serious ideas brought up.  The movie seems to take its search for God seriously, but it doesn't given the viewer any substance to draw you in.<br />-There are glaring technical flaws such as the Enterprise having more 78 decks and the Enterprise being able to reach the center of the galaxy so quickly.<br />-The fact that the Enterprise had technical problems and insufficient staff added nothing to the story.  The way Sybok's group took control of the ship so easily and that the crew simply did not notice an approaching Klingon ship made the crew appear incompetent.<br />-Sybok said he chose Nimbus III because it had representatives from the governments.  Why did he need to get representatives from multiple governments to steal a ship?<br />If you are buying the DVD, it's for the commentary.  It really gives you an insight into what went wrong.  Some Shatner's comments are bizarre.  In one of the interviews Shatner carries on for minutes about how a rock climber desires to make love to the rock.  In another interview he says that his greatest ability in the making of the movie was denial of the problems.  I wonder if the people in charge of editing this video had a grudge against Shatner.  If for nothing else, you can watch it with all the morbid fascination of reading the flight recorder transcripts from a plane crash.l treatment of the serious ideas brought up.

B00005JMFO|5.0|Richard Curtis is a talented screenwriter who proves to many that he can deliver the goods in directing a multi-faceted film for those who love romance.  Curtis also wrote the screenplay for Love Actually and he demonstrates his comfort with the material, but also a good eye for the camera.  Curtis work is set in Britain, as were his other phenomenal and scripts (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill) and his famous adaptation of Bridget Jones Diary.  Other than in About a Boy, it seems that Hugh Grant, Curtis actor of choice (he also has written much for Rowan Atkinson) has his greatest successes with films where Curtis lines can invoke the most likeable aspects of Grants characters.<br />Obviously, others are eager to work with him, and the cast of Love Actually is a directors dream  amazing actresses Emma Thompson and Laura Linney, backed up by sparkling newcomers Keira Knightley and Martine McCutcheon; who both really light up the screen.<br />On the actors side, frankly, Id see anything on screen with either Colin Firth, Alan Rickman or Liam Neeson (imagine all 3!), and here I was treated to a bit part for one of my new favorites, Chiwetal Ejofor of Dirty Pretty Things fame.  Thomas Sangster is charming and fresh as the young stepson of broken-hearted Neeson, perhaps the most charismatic youngster on screen since Haley Joel Osment.<br /> Lastly, the smaller parts and the cameos are done brilliantly, and with first-rate talent (or faces) such as Bill Nighy (as an aging rocker, discovering before it is too late how much brotherly love he has for his agent), Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thornton, Claudia Schiffer , and some American lovelies such as Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth and Elisha Cuthbert.<br />There are 8 (or is it 10) vignettes about all sides of love featured here, from Sams (Sangsters) puppy love (my favorite story, with Liam Neeson helping his stepson along, and in the process, learning to heal both their hearts), to the desperate love of the long-married, staying together when one has strayed (Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman).  Some of the stories are perhaps just fillers for funny bits, such as the British Colin, who emigrates to Wisconsin, where hes proved right  American girls WILL love him, if only for the accent; and the tale of two porn star stand-ins, where the nudity and oddity of the love story is purely Brit humor.  Just about every moment with Nighy (Billy Macka really, really oldRod Stewart?) is exceptional:<br />Kids, this is a message from your Uncle Billy. Don't buy drugs. Wait until you're a rock star, and they give them to you for free!<br />Many of the subtitled exchanges  in the Firth romance with a Portuguese housekeeper (newcomer Lucia Moniz as Aurelia) between them, and between Firth and her family are sweet and wildly funny.<br />But, fun and movie stars aside, this is intrinsically a movie about love, and Curtis uniquely captures it in all of its disguises, on film.  The sparks are visible between Grant and Natalie, his assistant, as improper as they might be construed.  The anguish of betrayal is real and compelling when Karen (Thompson) blunders into the secret relationship between her husband and his secretary.  The lingering loneliness and loss for Neesons character is believable, and you can feel how it touches the loss that Sangster feels for the same woman, his mother.<br />Aside from Thompsons vignette, the Laura Linney tale, of a young woman so devoted to her disabled brother that she cannot have a romance of her own, and the love triangle with Knightley as the centerpiece (the film made by Mark (Andrew Lincoln) of her in the wedding is a true testament to someone who is in love) portray the sad sides of love, but their juxtaposition with the more positive tales prove that Curtis knows whereof he speaks when he writes about love.<br />There are a number of non-cast or writing features of the film that contribute to the overall experience.  The settings are a marvel, from the Heathrow airport scenes at the early and late stages of the film, to the warmth/formality of 10 Downing, and to the fact that Curtis has ostensibly made a holiday film, so central to the plot is the Christmastime and seasonal backdrop.  And lastly, the score for the film is remarkable, and Ive purchased the CD to prove it.<br /> A new version of Both Sides Now by Joni Mitchell is featured, as is the poignant Songbird by the amazing Eva Cassidy  a better version than even the original by Christine McVie.  I was caught up in Wyclef Jeans duet of Take Me As I Am with Sharissa, and new group Maroon 5s Sunday Morning.  I can forgive the inclusion of Jump by the Pointer Sisters (their worst song) with the need for something similar to back up the funny Hugh Grant scene that appears in the trailer, because the collection also includes the Otis Redding version of White Christmas.  Lastly, bluesy Turn Me On by favorite Norah Jones and one of my Kelly Clarkson favorites, The Trouble With Love show both sides of the lovesick blues.  Clarksons Miss Independent was the most unique cut on her album, and earned the praise it got, but her true calling, white girl blues, is demonstrated by the first cut.<br />The trouble with love is<br />  It doesnt care how fast you fall,<br />  And you cant refuse the call<br />  You see, youve got no sense at all<br />That pretty much sums up all the nuances of love that Curtis so succinctly demonstrates in this fine, romantic film.  One of my top 10 films of the year, and a real surprise and pleasure! Ill see it once more in theaters and then patiently await a DVD which Ill probably wear out.

B00004ZB9D|4.0|Lenny Kravitz is quite the musician. Not quite hard rock, not quite alternative, not quite pop, just good solid music. His sound is all over the place, from heavy riffs to almost to almost a 70s feel including reggae, blues, and house. Kravitz has a good ear for rhythm that leads to some cool grooves. He is a master at punctuating those grooves with mutes and accents and hammered chords.<br />There are numerous hits on this album. The rhythm guitar from \\"Fly Away\\" is simple, yet infectious. The bass line gives it a unique feel, and the slight echo on his voice makes the chorus all the more powerful. \\"Black Velveteen\\" has an industrialized rhythm, and more effects on his voice. He kicks it up a notch during the song, coming forward with the rhythm guitar with excellent punctuation making for a powerful song. The album opens with his theme song of \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\", with its cool opening groove. The cover of the Guess Who classic, \\"American Woman\\" appears here as well as a dozen other good cuts from Kravitz's repertoire.<br />This album has a lot of his best cuts, and saves the trouble of finding his most popular songs on all of his discs.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Still reeling from his past projects of teeny-bopper fame (Titanic) I initially cringed at the thought of voluntarily watching something with Leonardo Dicaprio in it. Unless you are a 12 year old girl, his acting does not offer much, and I always feared my brains turning into mush as an inevitable side-effect of watching any of his projects.<br />That is until this film....<br />Dicaprio plays John, the member of an Irish immigrant gang, who are earnestly trying to make their way in turn of the century NYC against insurmountable odds (including anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic sentiment). Juggling basic survival needs against resources, he sets out to avenge the death of his father himself killed off by one of the street gangs<br />Boss Tweed (Daniel Day Lewis ) is only open to these afforementioned newcomers to the extent they will maintain his power structure exactly as it is. The actual provision of social services as myself and many other 21st century Americans understand them (even in the era of goverment downsizing) is non-existent. Mutiple fire departments spend more time amongst themselves arguing who should be privlleged enough to put out an inferno (and receive money) than saving lives.<br />The Civil War is roaring, but the North is just as suceptible to racism as the more doccumented South from liberal usage of racial slurs throughout the film, and scenes of one pro-slavery rally. For individuals such as myself who were students of American policy and had fancied ourselves educated individuals, complex reality was very jarring. The working class youths volunteering for Union Army conscription do so out of realization this may be the only practical way to get food than racial justice as myself and others currently understand that concept.<br />Eeerily foreshadowing the Flordia 2000 scandal, Boss Tweed's political coruption is a centrail theme of life for many imigrants. Personally, these same people do not like him, but understand a working relationship is important for their survival. Individuals who do not vote when and how the machine wants can expect swift retribution and vote counters themselves wield inordinate amounts of political power. American society made some important advances since the Nineteeth Century, but in some respects we are dealing with the same issues because they were not properly handled the first time.<br />For all of it's mentioned pluses, this film has some serious limitations. The realities of abdominal surgery (dangerous/fatal until development of antiseptic surgery and antibiotics during the 1930's) is repeatedly ignored in several storylines so the characters can make medical recoveries commonplace with Twentieth and Twenty First Century medical innovations. Only once is the procedural-historical seriousness remembered (Cameron Diaz's Cesarian Section) but even this scene only dwells on the risk temporarily instead of treating it as a running theme throughout every person's life.<br />Overall, this is a good film which will readily entertain political and party animals alike. The long run time is compensated by the lively plot and characters throughout the entire film.p is important for their survival.

B00005JMCW|5.0|I loved this movie. There are only a few movies that I can sit and watch over and over again, and this was one of them!<BR>The movie was very realistic (until they switched places). I know this, because I'm also a teenager, and I kinda act like Anna too (and I completely understand her!).<BR>I thought the Freaky Friday was very funny, too. When I was watching it the time just flew by.<BR>I'd tell about one of my favorite parts in it, but there are just to many.<BR>In conclution, the movie is very enjoyable, for the whole family (and the acting is great, too)!
0385504209|5.0|I loved this book. Why? Because it did what a book is supposed to do.  It was entertaining, and took my mind off the &quot;real&quot; world for a time.  That is what a book is supposed to do and this one does just that.<br />However, it also made me do some research...a book that makes you think...now there is a novel idea!<br />I did research on DaVinci, and looked at his art and writings in a whole new light.  I also did research on the various other Churches and socities mentioned...by doing that I learned some quite valuable history. I have barely scratched the surface of what I intend to learn from this book, and I look forward to researching even more.<br />Thank you Mr. Brown for giving me an opportunity to LEARN.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|George Harrison- Spriitualist,Musician,but most of all Humanitarian. The world is a lot lonlier with out him. To say a musical genius is an understatement. The Beatles-need i say more. Humanitarian just look around. This concert is an incredible celebration of the life (and humor) of George Harrsion. The artists that got together to celebrate the wonderful (but extermly sad) event are at the top of their game. They all gathered to pay homage to the quiet one George Harrison. His music is timeless and will always span the test of time. This concert was a celebration of life, but one cant be hepled to be moved to tears to here by the heartfelt renedrings of While My Guitar Gently Weeps, My Sweet Lord, Or I'll see ypu in my dreams. To see Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr take the stage for the 1st time in more than 30 years and the smiles on their faces....so see Eric Clapton almost cry...and George Harrisons son..the EXACT likeness of him....this is a concert for the ages and a MUST Have for any one who truly apprieciates music.. Just as George said..&quot;give me love give me love..give me peace on earth&quot; GOD SPEED GEORGE......OM...PEACE...AMEN....
B00005JMGL|5.0|There is a Bible passage that goes like this:<br />\\"If I Speak with the tongues of men and angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging symbol.  And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.  And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.\\"  (I Cor. 13:1-3 NASV)<br />After watching P.J. Hogan's (My Best Friends Wedding) brand new retelling of J.M. Barrie's classic novel, I think we can see this old passage come to life.<br />If you've spent the last century living under a rock then you'll have never learned of the little boy who never grew up.  You'll have never seen Walt Disney's chaste adventure, Steven Speilberg's reimagining, or Mary Martin's stupid musical.  You've never been enchanted by thinking good thoughts or laughed yourself silly by not believing in fairies (Oh darn, I just killed another one).  If you have been deprived by never having read or even seen this enchanting story unfold, then I suggest you rush out to your local library and read the book.<br />For those of us who know the story, I will tell you that this is the most faithful adaptations of the book and also the most interesting.  For the first time in cinematic history Peter is not seen as a hero, but as what he truly is; a sad lonely boy who's trapped in a fantasy world of his own design.  A boy who has the whole world at his fingertips and yet has the one thing he can never have: love.<br />I was blown away by how this film is so bold.  Every other PETER PAN film or story usually features a woman or a grown man in the part.  But for once this film shows us the Peter that truly exists.<br />I remember seeing J.M. Barrie's stage play by the Royal Shakespeare in 2000.  I remember how the press made a big deal about the play because it was the first time a male would play him on stage and when I got there I saw an effeminate male prancing around.  What was missing was the light of a child's eyes and that's what this PETER PAN has.  The illusion of a boy who never grows up is lost if he's played by someone who has already grown up.<br />Jeremey Sumpter (Fraility) plays Peter with exuberance and the hint of sadness that is always under the surface.  While we cannot be children forever, don't we all long for that?  But what if you could be a child forever, as the world grows up around you?  Your fantasy world may start to lose its luster.<br />I also loved how Neverland was full of danger.  I remember going through my old writings and finding a book I tried to write when I was four or five.  In it was a mother dying and lots of violence. Innocent and cute on the outside, but all my inward fantasies were full of violence.  This Neverland is full of peril, from the Mermaids who want to drown you, to the large Croc who swallowed a clock.  Neverland may be a fun place, but it's definitely not a safe place.  Much like the playgrounds of old.<br />The other more important story points that this new film really handled well was the innocent sexual tension created by two children.  Peter and Wendy are still at the point where girls and boys are icky, but yet are brought together by fantasy and fun.  What was your first crush like?  Kind of awkward and a little funny.<br />I loved to watch the fantasy of the two of them dancing in the moonlight.  Their attempt to play the role of mother and father when they have no idea how, and their longing to be together.  Since they are young, they do not have the facilities to understand this feeling.<br />Rachael Hurd-Wood portrays Wendy with a gentile innocence.  This is her first film, but she's so good other roles cannot be far off.  She reminds me of a young Nicole Kidman.  Her character is nicely rounded and full of the childlike wonder you normally see in the role.<br />I would also be remiss if I didn't mention PETER PAN'S nemesis Captain Hook.  Jason Issac's (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) Hook is faithful but a tad too dark for it's own good.  It's also a little creepy to watch this grown man's obsession with a little boy.  But then you begin to understand that Hook is Peter Pan's manifestation of his own adulthood.  What's the easiest way to never grow up?  Turn your adult tendencies into the villain and then manifest your childhood hopes and dreams into a little fairy named Tink (Ludivine Sagnier, Swimming Pool).<br />All in all PJ Hogan's PETER PAN is really good.  If you're in the mood for a bold film with lots of laughs and lots of adventure, then run out and see Peter Pan.so be remiss if I didn't mention PETER PAN'S nemesis Captain Hook.

B00005JL3A|2.0|This movie was not at all like the game. They put a big twist on the first resident evil, by putting the members of s.t.a.r.s. under ground instead in the mansion where they belong. The movie added new members to s.t.a.r.s. that did not exist. The movie had a horrible storyline, of Jill Valentine waking up in the shower and dicovering that she was a member of s.t.a.r.s.. The original story was that Jill, Chris, Barry and Wesker were forced to stay in the mansion because there helicopter pilot abandoned them. The only thing from the game that the movie had right was the zombies. This movie only desreves 2 stars because first it was a bad movie and secondly it was not true to the original story. I hope that the sequel is true to Resident evil three.

You can't help but feel sorry for Lex and Clark knowing what is to happen in the not so far off future.  I can't wait for Season two to be released on DVD!!  I will definitely be the first in line to pre-order it from Amazon!  Excellent show!!!!!

You can listen to this cd ALMOST from start to finish, w/ the only filler type songs being 'I'm A Soldier', 'Say Goodbye to Hollywood' and 'My Dad's Going Crazy'. A lot of people recommended ICP's 'The Wraith.....' instead of The Eminem Show. That REALLY shows hat real hip hope music is, right? F**kin' wrong, ICP may as well be two midget Bonecrushers or Hitman Sammy Samms. Eminem IS what real hip hop is, real and raw. Shady records is real and raw. So if you want a list of real rappers outside of Pac &amp; Biggie, here you go, but this is only a portion of it&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shady Records[Eminem,D-12,50 Cent,Obie Trice],Dre, Snoop, Rocafella[sans Diplomats,sans Black Album,Blueprint 2], Westside Connection, Juvenile, Wu-Tang, D-Block, MF Doom, Del and it can go further than that. But that's ust me and real hip hop's opinion, you can stick w/ the wack a*s Joe Buddens, Fabolous,ICP,Ja Rule and whoever else. PEACE
B00005JM0B|4.0|All I have to say is what if you gave the Terminator franchise to a direct to video action director...that's what Terminator 3 is. The acting ...you can't blame the actors. They could only work with the lines they were given.  The special effects were not too bad. The ending does make it worthwhile though. The effects in some of the scenes are good and advance what we saw in T2.  I was hoping that Stallone would be a cybernetic rival to Arnold..but I don't think they could agree on who would get more screen time.
B00005B364|5.0|About as good as they get. Focus continues with their second album without original drummer and bass man. Instead, they pick up the great rhythm section of Duth group Brainbox (originally of whom Akkerman was a member before joining Focus), which gives the band a more tightened sound. Obvious is the extent of chemistry within the band than the first Focus release, after all, it's three members from Brainbox and Van Leer as their hub.<BR> Beautiful melodies in the bread song and interspersed throught. Absolutely soaring flute and guitar solos. They make some hesitation about rocking out as in Hocus Pocus, when the opening rocker ends and the mellow stuff begins, it sounds like two different bands. But they return in full form in the funky middle part of Eruption. More ups and downs than a yo-yo. A bit overwrought for some, but all pretentiousness is cast aside with Hocus Pocus.<BR>Very well orchestrated with superb production, tight performances, and a little humor. A standout of the prog genre.
B00009YXHN|2.0|\\"I will not be shackled by the failures of your God.\\"  Thus says mad genius Dr. Herbert West, who is back along with partner Dan Cain - only this time, they're creating life.<br />The story involves West (Jeffrey Combs) and Cain (Bruce Abbott) returning from war in Peru.  After much research, West has finally discovered the secret to creating human life, and using Cain's lust for a mate as motivation, he proceeds to attempt to make Dan a bride from dead tissue.  Naturally, there's also a few re-animated freaks who survived the first film, along with a suspicious detective (Claude Earl Jones) and West's nemesis, Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale), who's still a no-body.  Get it?  A-ha-ha-ha...<br />First of all, let me say I was a serious fan of the original \\"Re-Animator\\", thus I had no problem with buying a sequel that has a very bad reputation.  Well, I can only say \\"Bride\\" lives up to its reputation.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with any of H.P. Lovecraft's works, however it does borrow a few elements from his tale \\"Herbert West -- Re-Animator\\" which weren't used in the first film.<br />The acting is fine, the effects are fine, the music is fine.  The direction is okay, although it can't match Stuart Gordon's.  There are a few funny moments in the film, but overall it has a very, very unpleasant feeling about it - which the first film did not have.<br />Overall, this is only for serious \\"Re-Animator\\"/horror fans.  Rent the first one instead.  \\"Bride of Re-Animator\\" is nothing more than a failed re-animation.<br />DVD: This DVD is pitiful.  No special features, Dolby Digital 2.0 sound, and picture quality that could've come off of an old VHS tape.  It will do find if you're just a casual viewer, but if you're a fan of the film, then make sure you buy the excellent Pioneer edition.
B000060MMI|4.0|This flogging molly has a variety of some of their really good songs like, of course drunken lullabies, whats left of the flag, may the living be dead, and swagger.  The other songs are awsome also but some of the other songs are more of the calm type songs(not a lot of punk rock, hard core). Overall this cd is kick ass and you should buy it, and it has a pretty good amount of music on it(good length songs).
0790732203|5.0|Rarely will you find a video store without RISKY BUSINESS. Not only is it a contemporary classic, but it was also Tom Cruise's breakthrough film and a major hit. While reputed to be a very good movie, upon watching it, I found it to be something else. It's an excellent movie.<br />Tom Cruise plays Joel Goodson, a high-school kid who is just that - a good son. He's responsible, careful, and trusted. But when his parents leave town for the week, Joel decides to loosen up - but after he nervously invites call girl Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) into his house, everyone goes horridly wrong. With only a few days left to go, Joel must raise his grades, make $8,000, get back stolen furniture, and escape from the clutches of Guino (Joe Pontoliano), the killer pimp. Work is hell. And Joel knows it.<br />This movie is great. It wildly exceeded by expectations, and is much better than it's said to be. Cruise is great - the fact that RISKY BUSINESS is Cruise's first major film is enough to make it worth the watch, anyway; De Mornay is also very good. Paul Brickman's direction has a sort of artistic feeling to it (he also scripted); he has a unique way of creating a film that's funny, erotic, and occasionally suspenseful. <br />Another wonderful aspect of the film is its terrific soundtrack. It features rockin' songs from such popular artists as The Police, Bob Seger, Talking Heads, Muddy Waters, Phil Collins, and Prince. It also features new music by the hit-making band Tangerine Dream, whose techno, futuristic-sounding score gives the movie an occasionally nightmarish, occasionally unpleasant mood to it - and, of course, the film is about every teenager's nightmares come true.<br />All in all, RISKY BUSINESS is essential viewing from the 1980's, and it works just as well now as it did then. Tom Cruise's first hit, a terrific soundtrack, and a cult classic - this is RISKY BUSINESS.
0345452577|1.0|I hoped that with a new protagonist, Jonathan Kellerman would once again come through with a goodd read, but I found this as bad as most of his recent Alex Delaware novels have been.  There is no comparison between the early Alex Delaware novels. The Butcher's Theater (the best) and his recent books.  Maybe he shoult take a rest.
0393317552|4.0|How did the West grow rich and conquer the world?  It<br />wasn't racial superiority, as the Victorians thought - indeed, Diamond<br />gives evidence that the average New Guinean may well be smarter<br />than the average Westerner.  His own one-sentence summary of the<br />book is:  \\"History followed different courses for different peoples<br />because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of<br />biological differences among the peoples themselves\\"[clunk]. Or, it's the<br />environment, stupid.  Or, the West got lucky.<br /><br />I'm uncomfortable with history-as-polemics, but Diamond (usually)<br />keeps his facts and interpretations pretty well separated.  And this is a<br />wonderful one-volume history of the human race.  It is unusual, and<br />refreshing, to read a history written by a distinguished and literate<br />biological scientist.  History isn't generally considered to be science -<br />\\"it's just one damn thing after another.\\"  But then, you could say the<br />same for large parts of astronomy, biology & geology.<br /><br />13,000 years ago, the most recent Ice Age was ending, and people<br />everywhere still made their living as hunter-gatherers.  Diamond starts<br />his story at the dawn of civilization.  By Chapter 3, he's recounting<br />Pizarro's conquest of the Inca empire in 1532.  In an afternoon, 168<br />Spanish soldiers routed an army of 80,000, killed 7,000, and captured<br />the Inca emperor.  It's not surprising that the Spaniards would feel<br />superior.  But the conquistadores' invisible allies had been at work<br />since 1492 - smallpox from Spain had killed the previous Inca emperor<br />and his heir, setting off a war of succession that fatally weakened the<br />empire.  Diseases from Europe would ultimately kill up to 95% of the<br />native peoples of the Americas, often before they saw their first<br />European.  The old American cultures were doomed from first contact,<br />even if the Old World visitors had been peaceful explorers and traders.<br />12,000 years of isolation had left native Americans with no resistance to<br />the lethal European microbes.<br /><br />Where did these diseases come from, and why didn't the Indians<br />return the favor by infecting Eurasia?  Many came originally from<br />domestic animals (for example, measles and smallpox from cattle), and<br />required large, dense populations to evolve.  The Indians had few<br />domestic animals - one reason why they were poorer than Eurasians,<br />and those (fortuitously) had no diseases that \\"made the jump\\" from<br />animals to humans - good evidence for Diamond's \\"history as luck\\"<br />hypothesis.<br /><br />Diamond's history is wonderful, full of new science, strange facts, and<br />great anecdotes.  The polemics get repetitious and a bit defensive at<br />times, but can be safely skimmed. This would have been a better book<br />had it been written as straight history, letting the facts speak for<br />themselves - but it's still well worth reading.

0385507755|2.0|Thousands of alcoholics and drug addicts may read this book and get hope that they too can make it without AA and God. Most of them, maybe all, will die. Thanks Mr. Frey.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I received a lot of music DVD's for Christmas and this is hands down the best of the lot. If you are a fan of Harrison's music (or a fan of Clapton's, McCartney, Petty...etc...) you will not be disappointed. Excellent video and sound. Highlight for me is &quot;While My Guitar Gently Sleeps&quot; and &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; but every song is a gem.
0345440900|2.0|My friends and I that read this book all agree... we found her baby descriptions to be ridiculous as it seems that almost every baby will fall into every one of those categories, just depending on the day, hour, minute... I also found some of her assertions ridiculous and completely unrealisitic for infants.. Maybe this book if fine for working with older babies, but I think it falls into the category of one of those books that makes you question yourself and worry that you are &quot;doing it all wrong&quot;... <BR>On the positivie side, some of the &quot;baby signs&quot; and what they might mean were helpful and on target for the most part, but the rest of the book I suggest reading with a grain of salt..
B00006BTCA|5.0|Takes several listens, so don't give up so easily! It's a great album. Lives up to the hype
B0000019PA|5.0|I bought this back when it came out, but I didn't listen to it that much at the time because I was in some different musical head space.  Every time I was going to trade in some old CDs I'd glance at this and ponder the notion before some urge told me to put it away and hold onto it.<br /><br />I finally listened to it just recently and heard something I hadn't heard the first time; I was immediately impressed.  From the moment Jeff Mangum strums the first chords and voices the first lyrics, it is clear this album is something totally different from anything ever put to tape.<br /><br />First off, there is supposedly a loose thread about World War II, Anne Frank and reincarnation melding with  Mangum's imagination.  That may be the case, but the lyrics are broad and vivid enough for the listener to create their own world these words can inhabit.<br /><br />'King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1' and 'Part 2 & 3' segue perfectly from the strummed acoustic folk of the first to demented church song and electric noise folk of the latter within the blink of an eye.<br /><br />'In the Aeroplane Over the Sea' is a simple yet majestic piece; the following triumvirate of 'Two Headed Boy,' 'The Fool' and 'Holland, 1945' go from one to the next almost too quickly, but not so fast that you're not able to appreciate them.<br /><br />In fact 'Holland 1945' leads into 'Communist Daughter,' a quick, ethereal floater that is replete with Mangum's vivid lyrical imagery.<br /><br />'Oh Comely' is a movie set to music and voice, and could be the emtional centerpiece of the album.  'Ghost' is another of NMH's blistering electric folk songs overflowing with horns, and energy.<br /><br />The second instrumental song - 'Untitled' - is a looping circus waltz that fades into 'Two Headed Boy Pt. 2,' a man-and-guitar ballad.<br /><br />Not everyone will take to \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" upon the initial listen, but time and patience are rewarded in spades.  After a few weeks, or months or years, go back and listen again.  This album may just change your persective the next time, and the next time, and the next.......ctive the next time, and the next time, and the next.......
B0000CD5I6|2.0|If you must have some sort of Christmas album, I suppose you could do worse-you could also do much better. If, on the other hand, you're expecting something remotely worthy of the Jethro Tull of old, forget it. Some less general remarks:<br />1) Re: \\"Take a look at the overall rating for this CD and decide for yourself if it's worth looking into.\\" Sorry, the \\"overall rating\\" for this (and most of the products advertised at this site) is propaganda. Ignore it. <br />2) Ian Anderson took rather a large chunk of \\"A Christmas Song\\" directly, intact, and UN-ATTRIBUTED from a song called \\"Once in Royal David's City\\" written by Cecil Frances Alexander and Henry John Gauntlett. \\"A Christmas Song\\"'s lyric begins: \\"Once in Royal David's City/Stood a lowly cattle shed/Where a mother laid her baby/You'd do well to remember the things He later said\\". Mrs. Alexander's 1848 lyric begins \\"Once in royal David's city/Stood a lowly cattle shed/Where a mother laid her baby/In a manger for his bed\\". In  \\"A Christmas Song\\" Mr. Gauntlett's 1849 melody is played (without alteration) by Ian Anderson's flute. There is a word for this sort of practice, and that word is \\"plagiarism\\". In any case, this version of \\"A Christmas Song\\" is decidedly inferior to the one first appearing (for American audiences) on late 1972's \\"Living in the Past\\" album. For one thing, Ian Anderson can scarcely sing any more. For another, the string quartet has been replaced here with cheesy ersatz synthesizer settings.<br />3) Since I used to enjoy Ian Anderson's interpolation of \\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\\" into his flute solo in concert, I was looking forward to the group's rendition of the carol here. Alas. The tune is played in swing rhythm which sets us up to expect some jazz solos. Instead we here snatches of the tune in different keys, interminably, relentlessly, gratuitously in different keys--as if there were something extraordinarily clever about changing keys.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Like everyone else, I had my doubts about this movie. Without James Cameron behind the wheel, it could never be as good as the first two, or so we thought. Well, we were wrong. With the director of U-571 in charge, T3 is every bit as good as Cameron's works, except that it's a lot more funny and the plot holds more surprises as it unravels. The whole thing with this Terminator being the same one that kills John in the far future is wonderfully ironic. Sarah's absence is explained beyond beautifully, and Dr. Silverman is back! I only have two complaints. The first is that it has a few clerical errors - for example, it says John Connor was 13 in T2, when in fact he was ten. The second complaint is that despite our computer technology being some ten or twelve years better than what was used for T2, the CGI actually looks WORSE. Of course, T2's CGI only had to make a silvery blob, and didn't try to make anything as complicated as the T-X.<br />Make no mistake, this movie is definitely a legitimate and powerful extension of the Terminator saga.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|I don't share the mystical faith of some here that both Naked and Let It Be will remain in the catalog indefinitely. I think the economic reality is that eventually one must give way to the other. Which one is up to you.<br />This recording (among its many other faults) does exactly what my old Recording Techniques professor bade his students not do, in a more extreme form even. The instruments are separate and distinct such that they don't seem to be playing together; each is given its own ambient space such that they don't seem even to be playing in the same building. The effect is particularly repulsive for the electric piano parts (with the exception of &quot;Get Back&quot; because the electric piano part on it is intrinsically interesting of itself). There is one tune here (which escapes me just now) in which Ringo's ride cymbal is risibly obtrusive. (Ringo probably loved the attention paid to make it artificially ring the first time he heard it, and he probably hasn't heard it a second time, which is just as well--the effect palls rapidly.)<br />&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; seems to be dragged in here only in order to torture and abuse it. The guitar solo in &quot;Get Back&quot; sounds hideous, and its ending--or, rather, stopping--is abrupt and unmusical.<br />I noticed that someone tweaked McCartney's very out-of-tune singing on the middle section of &quot;The Two of Us&quot;. This is probably the one improvement over Let It Be on the entire album. Even here, though, I have reservations. I liked the rawness of the real--non-electronically modified--&quot;The Two of Us&quot; (the nakedness, if you will), and, as a matter of principle I think the digital tweaking here is cheating. Certainly it contradicts the stated intent of this release.<br />The removal of the &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; from the end of the Beatles last single, and the removal of John Lennon's &quot;Did we pass the audition?&quot; quip from the end of the Beatles last album goes toshow, I think, that a certain ex-Beatle has no sense of humor whatsoever, and that's a shame.
B0000501C3|5.0|I love classic music, and I have to admit that this is the best CD you can buy if you like it, too. Music is really great, even if it is music for movie. My favourite is &quot;Les Folies d'Espagne&quot;, and I love to listen to it at least 5 times a day... If you really want to enjoy in classics, buy this CD, and you will definitely not regret...
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is a quality CD.  Every single track is amazing and well worth  your money.  I love his unique sound, that you can't find any where else!
B0000A118M|5.0|This album (contrary to some reviews you may see here) is one of the quintessential musical montages ever devised by the human mind.  If you have only been exposed to straight swing and bop, this album may take some getting used to, but realize, that this album is not about structure.  It is not about the black man sticking it to the MAN.  It is not about changing that which is jazz.  It is not about anything other then pure, unadulterated, heavenly sound.  It is a view into this man's very life, feelings, and soul.  To totally appreciate it, you must keep this in mind at all moments you listen to this album.  So buy it, sit back, and don't look for a message or meaning.  Just enjoy.
B00005JMCT|2.0|Let me start off by saying, I am a fan of the first two 'American Pie' films. So the idea of the third sounded good. \\"Sounded\\" is the key word. This third installment of the very popular teen series is keyed by the wedding part in the title. Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Allison Hannigan) are ready to get married. With Stiffler (Sean W. Scott) not invited, they feel the wedding should go off with a bang. WRONG. Stiffler shows up and thats when the trouble starts. This chapter in the 'Pie' series is horrible. They try to make gross out, laugh-out-loud humor, but most of it falls flat on it's face. Sean W. Scott tries to save this disaster, but even 'The Stiffmeister' can't save this dud. The film starts with so much promise, it looks as if they actually could make it work, make a absolutely hilarious 'Pie' with more heart than the first two, then it falls. Again and again. The most memorable character 'Stiffler' isn't memorable at all in this edition. I was kind of sad to hear them ending the series, but after this last installment, I'm kinda glad. Stick with the original two, their awsome.
0385504209|3.0|Okay, this is a decent, workmanlike novel. It's not overly sophisticated and is sort of like the Cliff's Notes version of Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_. There are very modest amounts of real scholastic effort here, simply presented, about the Knights Templar and so on. The writing is remarkably flat in tone: reminiscent of, say, Adam Hall's Quiller novels. I can see how readers who come to this material fresh are fascinated, but having read the aforementioned Eco novel (and others with similar material), I found this effort pretty thin gruel in comparison. Despite the author's best efforts, this is a straightforward thriller (almost a procedural), with fairly flat characters. You won't care all that much about anyone here and you won't find the really deep mysterious material that others (especially Eco) explore elsewhere to better effect.<br />I guess I enjoyed the book, but only as a temporary diversion. Wait for the paperback: you'll read this novel in a couple of sittings and, if you're like me, will want something with more substance. In particular, the Bad Guys and the New Age Goddess vs. the Pope stuff is so rote as to be a parody of itself. Look for this one at your local Cineplex Oderama soon.

B0000CABJ1|5.0|I think this collection was and is an unexpected release for the fans.  Earlier in 2003 I thought this year would have brought nothing at all, so this for me is great.  The Journey does just that, it takes you thru the stages of Donna Summer's career which now spans four decades.  This collection has three new songs with the current promo only single released to radio called you're so beautiful, which is currently a top five smash on the Billboard Dance Chart.  That to me shows how after all these years in the business Donna Summer is still able to deliver the hits!!!<br />I look forward to an album of new material which I have heard may be released in the Summer of 2004.  I love the additional new songs That's The Way and I Will Live for Love.<br />Donna Summer is a music icon no matter how many greatest hits packages are released.  This one also has some great liner notes from Donna.<br />Be sure to pick up this essential collection.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|It boggles the mind at how a gem like this was ever cancelled by Fox. Countless reviews have been posted on what a great show this is, and let me say that it's all true. I was worried at first because so many reviewers were Buffy fans. A show I could not stand. Thankfully I went ahead and bought it anyway! Here are a few things that I thought elevated this show to the next level...<br />Special Effects- The best I've seen on TV. The effects are used sparingly but to great effect and realism. Characters- This series proves that Sci-Fi can be entertaining using human characters while not having to rely on aliens for interesting interactions. Sexual tension and human greed create more than enough drama when written well. The Firefly universe- Brings a mix of many styles together creating a unique look and feel. The old west, Asian influences and futuristic backdrops are all interwoven for a rich visual palette. If your on the fence about getting this dvd, just get it. It's smart, funny and at times shocking! It's such a refreshing change from the Sci-Fi mainstream.
0930289234|5.0|Moore brilliantly deconstructs the medium's traditional interpretation of the superhero- fearless, mighty, zealous defender of the good- and reconstructs him/her by asking, quite rightly, what kind of person would ever want to dress up in tights, cape, and/or mask under the auspices of fighting crime? Before Watchmen, this question was completely ignored. Consequently, comics focussed more on the external battles between 'good' and evil' at the expense of studying the internal psychodynamic battles attending all superheroes.<br />The great part about reading any of Moore's stuff (V for Vendetta, From Hell, etc.), is that he's so obviously brilliant; unlike a lot of the other guys writing comics, his works contain a breadth of current societal/economic/political issues (although feminists could arguably point out that Watchmen reinforced gender inequality and traditional sex roles). In this way, the characters of Watchmen interact in a living, breathing, complex world: a 'realist' world. Moore also enjoys telling two stories at once through the use of intertextuality: in a vein similar to Shakespeare, a minor sub-plot informs the major storyline (note Moore's usage of the fictional 'Tales of the Black Freighter' as well as the clippings concluding each chapter) Watchmen's enduring contribution to the medium was his intersection of the comic world with the real world. So many complex themes and plots appearing in today's comics (the morally problematic hero, the sympathetic villain, drug addiction, rape, etc.) derive directly from this great and important work that dared to imagine how superheroes would really fare in the present time.<br />It should also be noted that Dave Gibbons' art had a lot to with the boldness and brilliance of Watchmen: his clever use of close-ups/fades, morphing, and cut-away techniques hearken to mind the approach of a film director rather than a traditional comics illustrator. Gibbons ably brought to life the multifaceted world envisioned by Moore and in the process greatly opened up the possibilities available to the comics illustrator.<br />Almost twenty years later, Watchmen continues to astound readers and stands heads and shoulders above anything preceding or succeeding it. I am yet to read a single graphic novel that astounded me in its scope and originality as this one did. I cannot say more other than this is the single best graphic novel I have ever read.
B00006GA4C|5.0|Some records stand the test of time; others don't.  Grand Funk's Red Album passes with flying colors and a bass lick to the gut for good measure.  This record, their second and finest, was recorded in only two days during October, 1969.  It's as live as a studio record can be.  Indeed, on \\"In Need,\\" you can hear Farner stop playing guitar, then start playing harmonica, then stop again before coming back in with his guitar The band is in a groove throughout.  This is simple but powerful music.  Now, I've heard some critics talk about the band's lack of proficiency on the instruments.  No, Mark Farner wasn't Eric Clapton.  But then Grand Funk weren't aristocracy.  They were a blue-collar band from Flint, Michigan.  More importantly, they played together well and their sound was good.  Besides, Mel Schacher was a monster bass player.  I cannot say enough for the sound of this record.  It reminds me so much of the sound of live rock bands from that era.  Standing near their speakers you could feel the thunder of the bass and the crunch of the electric guitar.  So it was not only an aural experience but a physical one too. The music hit you in the middle.  That sort of sound seems to have been lost, either by technological development or by fashion I'm not sure.  In any case, this recording captures that old sound well.  The new CD version of the red album also includes two bonus tracks.  \\"Nothing is the Same\\" is labeled a \\"demo\\" but is sounds like a pretty fine song to me.  Also a bonus is an extended version of \\"Mr. Limousine Driver\\".
B0000C6E4D|5.0|i'm really surprised at many of these reviews. no this album isn't perfect, but it's unfair to expect anything to measure up to FTE, which as a whole is one of the most inspired albums by any artist of ALL TIME. afterglow is easily Sarah's 2nd best effort. as a whole the expression, passion, and beauty in the song writing and singing are at a bit higher level than Surfacing, and at a much higher and more mature level than her first two albums. yes it is short and could use at least one more song to round it out, and yes it's a bit overpolished, but those are nitpicks compared to the general quality and beauty of the songs that ARE there. i think time and perfect girl are among the best, with fallen being one of the best songs she's ever done. **if fallen happened to be on FTE it would be considered a classic**. if you like sarah at all don't be biased by so-so reviews. listen with an open mind - this is not to be missed.
B000000LZV|5.0|i am not a fan of punk, but this album is great. expansive and accessible, not all the songs here are punk anyway. the song &quot;cohesion&quot; is a great spanish guitar solo. and if you were ever wondering where they got the 'jackass' theme tune, it's from this album, the track entitled &quot;corona&quot;. beautifully mixing politics and everyday life together without any pretension is truly an amazing feat. and the songs last little more than 2 minutes, proving that less is more. this is really  amazing music, and you can see why the red hot chilli peppers dedicated bloodsugarsexmagik to minutemen's bassist, mike watt.
B000068FXX|5.0|The header of this review may seem a bit trite, but I can't help but express my sheer love of Supertramp's music. Roger Hodgson's sensual, reflective upper-register vocals happen to be seductive in a spellbindingly indescribable way, not to mention that his talents as a songwriter were quite nifty as well. And, on the whole, each contribution from the other members blended harmoniously to create highly enjoyable, poignant and memorable music.<br /><br />1977's _Even In The Quietest Moments..._ hasn't a single dud on the album - each track is memorable, well-executed, melodic and poignant, not to mention in simple terms, the music is just excellent ear-candy from start to finish. Main songwriters Roger Hodgson (vocals/guitar) and Rick Davies (keyboards/vocals) are in fine form, as to be expected, delivering convincing ear-candy for anyone willing to listen. In typical Supertramp fashion, each trade lead vocals on respective tracks.<br /><br />\\"Give A Little Bit\\" opens up with those wispy strums from an acoustic guitar, with Roger giving the listener a charming introduction with a vocal improvisation, before letting his own wispy singing float atop the atmospheric acoustic strums. Such a charming beauty that's really hard not to fall in love with. An amazing track that has aged well, and will continue to do so for many years to come.<br /><br />\\"Lover Boy\\" switches things up, as Roger takes a backseat on the lead vocals, and lets Rick Davies take on that responsibility. Roger himself offers a brief vocal appearance in the middle section of the track. Features elegant, quirky piano tapping, along with slight whimsical characteristics in the vocal delivery which lend most of this song an atmosphere of a theater musical selection. The track on the whole switches from Gilbert & Sullivanesque whimsy to rocker quite effortlessly, which gives the whole thing a sense of drama and utter excitement.<br /><br />The title track is a wispy, subdued, atmospheric and ethereal number, exhibiting a predominance in acoustic instruments. It bears a heavy resemblance to Led Zeppelin, particularly such Zeppelin tracks as \\"Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Going To California.\\" Roger's vocal mannerisms recall to mind those of Robert Plant, and the rhythmic mannerisms of the acoustic strumming alongside the ethereal backdrops brought on by the combination of keyboards and certain wind instruments contribute to this Zeppelinesque atmosphere as well. A very beautiful, pleasant track.<br /><br />\\"Downstream\\" features a lovely major 7th piano lick, while Rick Davies' unique vocals float atop the whole thing. Speaking of Davies' voice, it's not the best voice in the world, especially in comparison to Hodgson's voice, but it seems like an unique instrument within itself, which compliments the music very well. This track on the whole, seems like just a duet between Rick's voice and his piano.<br /><br />\\"Babaji\\" features Roger Hogdson performing at his usual best, with those romantic, sensual vocals of his. He has always reminded me of a Jon Anderson (Yes) with a slight hint of Freddie Mercury (Queen) in his voice. I possibly adore the man's vocals so much because the two vocalists that he remind me of most are, in fact, two of my favorite vocalists - one of them being my absolute favorite. Not surprisingly, Supertramp's music seems to have quite a bit in common with the two said bands in which the aforementioned vocalists originate. As for the track, the rhythm is bouncy, the piano tapping is quirky and playful, and added touches of flavor are added from saxaphonist John Helliwel in spots necessary for the extra ornamentation.<br /><br />\\"From Now On\\" has a bluesy, New Orleansesque tint in it's atmosphere. Rick Davies' vocals work especially well with this track: a mid-tempo, poignant number with John Helliwel adding larger touches of saxaphone to enhance the flavor of the track. The climactic point of the song, which ends in a gospel-like choral fashion is quite moving, and was an excellent addition to conclude the track.<br /><br />\\"Fool's Overture\\" is the grand 11-minute closer of the album. The elaborate arrangements and literary themes featured here harken back to the glory days of the progressive rock epic: in the vein of Yes or Emerson, Lake & Palmer, but not necessarily sounding derivative of either. Starts off quietly and smoothly before a brief voice sample appears, which eventually gives way to the bombastic, anthemic main keyboard sweep of the song. From there, Roger's sensual upper register issues out these dramatic vocal lines for a brief period, which are followed by windy sound effects. Then, the bombastic, anthemic main keyboard sweep reappears, and Roger comes in with these Jon Andersonesque vocal mannerisms, which swap with these sci-fi-meets-reggae vocal overdubs twice. After that, part of the main bombastic lick returns, and the track ends quite unexpectedly. It seemed as if the track had one more movement to go before it had ended - a recapitulation, so to speak, but, as mentioned above, it ended unexpectedly.<br /><br />The 70s produced such wonderful, artistic, imaginative, and original music, which for the most part, is sorely lacking in most of today's artistic output. I probably lean toward a schmaltzy disposition in general, which is almost indefinitely reflected in my tastes. If there's any truth to that, I bear no shame about it. Supertramp were such a glorious band, and their music is recommended to fans of 70s music, particularly for fans of such artists as Queen, Roxy Music, Electric Light Orchestra, Yes, Todd Rundgren, Elton John and the like, or for music fans who are romantics in general.k.    \\"Fool's Overture\\" is the grand 11-minute closer of the album.

1573301051|4.0|The point of this concert was to raise funds for the Save the Music foundation, and boy was it successful.  You can also tell which singers were there to truly perpetuate the cause, and which were there in diva-mode, to show off their egos...primarily being prima donnas.  Gloria, Celine, and Shania performed together, putting egos aside, to SAVE THE MUSIC.  Aretha and Mariah, on the other hand acted as prima donnas (I mean, just listen to their self-lauded comments throughout the concert).  Now to discuss the performances...<br />Those who keep saying Mariah and Aretha were the ones who carried the show were 45% correct.  Aretha, yes, she was a major performer and she did deliver the goods.  Amazing voice, still!  But Mariah had obviously become a horrible, horrible singer.  Anybody who says she still got a voice is deceiving him/herself.  I myself am a voice student (particularly opera, so I KNOW voice) and I know a wrecked voice when I hear it, and Mariah's voice in 1998 was shot to heck already, after years of abuse.  Her voice was coarse, rough, and even notes up to the tenor's high B flat showed strain, which is PATHETIC for a soprano such as Mariah.  Just face it Mariah fans, she got no voice anymore.  Even recent albums released never showcased power ballads anymore.  Instead you hear whispers and light head voice use.  That serves well in some songs, but we'll never hear power vocals displayed in pieces such as &quot;Vision of Love&quot; in her debut album.  <br />Shania and Gloria each gave rousing, upbeat performances of their respective songs.  And Celine, who still had a voice after singing professionally nonstop for 16 years, sang marvelously, showcasing her vocal prowess and interpretive skills.  Aretha, of course as the Queen of Soul tied everything together with her stage presence and larger-than-life voice.  <br />Overall, this is a fantastic concert ruined really by Mariah, NOT Celine.  Celine gives nothing but stellar performances.  Mariah is in it for the attention.  Worse, she doesn't even have a voice.  If you have the equipment, re-record this DVD yourself, taking out Mariah's poor performance and prima donna-laden comments.  (aretha's too, but hers aren't as bad as Mariah's).
B000002L7V|2.0|Ronnie James Dio's 1985 effort, &quot;Sacred Heart&quot;, is a bit too pop for me, a fan of &quot;traditional&quot; heavy metal (excluding &quot;nu-metal&quot;).  However, please understand that I am hardest on my favorite artists.  After his departure from Black Sabbath, Dio's first two solo albums were a success.  I think he may have tried too hard to compete with his first two outings.  The album does open with a rocker, &quot;King of Rock and Roll&quot;, which I have heard is a begrudging tribute to Ozzy Osbourne.  If there is an &quot;epic&quot; song on the album, it would be &quot;Sacred Heart&quot;.  The rest of the album is what I would call pop metal (I know that's hard to mention on a Dio review).  I think Dio relied too much on Claude Schnell's keyboards and catchy hooks/choruses here, which is a requirement for any pop metal effort.  Some of these choruses on the songs are, however, contagious, like &quot;Hungry for Heaven&quot;, &quot;Like the Beat of a Heart&quot;, &amp; &quot;Shoot Shoot&quot;.  &quot;Hungry for Heaven&quot; was actually a single released to support the flop movie &quot;Vision Quest&quot; (a bad flick about Greco-Roman wrestling).  Also, Jimmy Bain's bass is almost inaudible, and Vinnie Appice's drumming is rather reserved on most of the songs.  Vivian Campbell, however, still shreds well on guitar for most of the album.<br />The album cover is a bit cheesy, and it reminds me too much of a Dio-era Rainbow album cover.  Though I was too young to witness it, I have heard that the tour to support the album was amazing, complete with lasers, smoke, a huge mechanical dragon, armored knights, and wizards.  Overall, &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; is definitely one of Dio's weaker albums, receiving the least critical attention, along with his 1994 &quot;Strange Highways&quot; album.  But, it is an interesting departure from his traditional work and should not be ignored; If you bought this album, it would not be a complete waste of money.
1892005034|5.0|In November, 2000, I read the previous edition of this book...The quality of empathy I now am able to provide has enlivened my therapy practice, and meets my need for hope that I can contribute to the well being of my clients, and also connect deeply with my friends and family. The step-by-step empathy skills in this book are learnable by anyone..<br />This latest edition of Dr. Rosenberg's book has a completely new chapter called, \\"Connecting Compassionately with Ourselves.\\" It's about what he calls, \\"self-compassion.\\" He writes, \\"When we are internally violent towards ourselves, it is difficult to be genuinely compassionate towards others.\\" I enjoyed this chapter because it helped me translate my self-judgments into statements of my own unmet needs. I now see that when I am angry with myself it is because my actions were not in harmony with my values. Seeing things from this perspective helps me mourn my action and move into self-forgiveness by connecting with the specfic need I was trying to meet when I used a strategy that I now regret. I particularly enjoyed the section on translating \\"have-to\\" into \\"choose-to.\\" The exercise showed me how to locate the choice in what I do, by connecting with the need, want, or value each activity serves. I find I have more energy, more compassion when I experience choice in my life.
1573225517|4.0|It was like reading a 'Catcher in the Rye' written by Murakami Haruki. Which means I greatly enjoyed the book since I like both of all mentioned above. The only drawback is that it made me depressed about my relationship right now with my boyfriend, since I kept finding common factors with my boyfriend and Rob. Oh well, was a good read anyways.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This DVD is Firefly the way it was meant to be.  And, most importantly, in the correct order as it was meant to be!  This DVD set is a delight to all true Firefly fans who believe that Fox didn't give this show much of a chance to exist.  The quality is wonderful, the writing and direction and acting are all amazing, the special features are a delight to all fans.  Hopefully this DVD will be the fire of which the phoenix of Firefly can arise from, stronger and better.  Next up: Firefly the Movie!
0061015725|3.0|I always look forward to a new Michael Crichton book, but this one shows, in my opinion, how hard it is to write a compelling novel about nanotechnology. He gave it a good try overall but the characters are not well-developed enough -- even considering that characters don't have to be all that well developed for thrillers and science fiction.<br />Better to buy something else -- Jurassic Park if you have not read it -- and get Prey from a library.
B0000640SA|3.0|This movie might be one of the best i have seen in the last few years, but the dvd they put out here is cumbersome to say the least. Its packed full of &quot;extras&quot; but they're so hard to access that it makes the pain in looking for them out weigh any positives. They are burried in a quasi mental aptitude test. Yup, and im still, almost a year after buying the dvd, not sure if ive even seen half of whats there. So id HIGHLY recomend the movie but get the single disk version and save yourself a headache.

B00005YW4H|1.0|I don't even know if what she does would qualify as a whisper or if she just has a very alarming vocal problem, but I know about vocal performance and it is completely missing. You could think that the feeling would compensate this, until you realise there's hardly any feeling either. Regarding the music, what can I say, blatant wannabe attempt at jazz.
B000068CNX|5.0|I am still not at the point where I can recognize the bonus footage included in &quot;Friends: The Complete Second Season&quot; on DVD, but I can tell that the second season was an overall improvement on the first, despite the fact that the series did not put its best foot forward with &quot;The One After the Super Bowl Pars 1 &amp; 2&quot; (thumbs up on Julia Roberts, both thumbs down on Brooke Shields and Jean-Claude Van Damme).  Obviously getting Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) to the point where they would actually kiss was a key dynamic, but what made this a better season was that Monica (Courtney Cox) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc), the two weakest characters in the first season, were finally given something to do.  For Monica it was a romance with Dr. Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), the old friend of the family, while Joey landed the unforgettable part of Dr. Drake Ramoray on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and actually moves out of the apartment with Chandler.  Chandler (Matthew Perry) continues to crack jokes to ease all the pain in his life and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) sings &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; for the first time, but even as background for most of these episodes they both steal their share of scenes.<br />Best episodes from the Second Season: &quot;The One with Ross' New Girlfriend,&quot; but because Phoebe gives Monica the wrong &quot;Moore&quot; style hair cut (Dudley instead of Demi) more than Rachel discovering Ross is now with Julie the paleontologist; &quot;The One Were Heckles Dies,&quot; not only because the girl inherit his junk, but because Phoebe goes toe to toe with Ross on evolution; &quot;The One With Ross Finds Out,&quot; where Rachel protests too much about being &quot;over&quot; Ross; &quot;The One with the Prom Video&quot; and the killer moment when Rachel finds out what she did not know way back when and discovers Ross is her &quot;lobster&quot;; &quot;The One Where Eddie Moves In,&quot; where Adam Goldberg moves into Chandler's apartment and provides the best guest starring role of the season (plus the &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; video); &quot;The One Where Old Yeller Dies&quot; and Phoebe finds out why her moment never let her seen the end of the famous Disney doggie snuff film; &quot;The One with the Bullies,&quot; where Chandler and Ross go to toe to toe with a couple of bullies over the couch at Central Perk; and &quot;The One with Barry &amp; Mindy's Wedding,&quot; where the focus might be on Rachel as maid of honor at her ex-fiance's wedding, but the pivotal point is Monica and Richard breaking up over the subject of children (cross apply the irony and poignancy to this season's adoption plot line forced by Arquette's real world problems conceiving: is there anyone on the planet that more people would like to see pregnant?).<br />If the first season was a 4.0, then the second gets &quot;Friends&quot; up to 4.5.

B00005JKZV|1.0|I'll admit that after watching the Fellowship (the first half hour of which I enjoyed, after that I was praying for Frodo to die so my suffering could end) I told myself, &quot;Now I know how not to waste 6 hours in the future [by not watching the next two in the trilogy].&quot; But after all the glowing reviews from critics and friends, I borrowed the DVD of the Two Towers to give the series another chance. Perhaps I was just in a bad mood the day I watched the Fellowship and had taken my irritability out on the film... Unfortunately, Two Towers was even more horribly tedious.<br />First, the good - the cinematography is great and the CGI animation is excellent.<br />Second, third, and last, the bad - the characters are not at all compelling, the plot is pointless, and the entire monstrosity of a movie is so mind-numbingly boring that I had to start doing finances for some variety to avoid watching it.<br />I am completely baffled as to why LotR is so popular.
078681859X|4.0|Imagine a more Faustian &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; which transforms neatly into a magical conspiracy thriller, complete with theft, high-speed chases, and assassination attempts -- the first book of the Bartimaeus trilogy, &quot;The Amulet of Samarkand.&quot; It's well-written and the demonic lead is a treasure, but his human counterpart is a lot less endearing.<br />The djinn Bartimaeus is magically summoned by a young apprentice magician, Nathaniel, who orders him to steal the Amulet of Samarkand. He doesn't know much about it, but he knows that Simon Lovelace, the man who has it, has had someone killed to get it. He also has a personal motive -- Lovelace hurt and humiliated him, and his obnoxious, cowardly master didn't help him. Ever since, Simon has been plotting to get back at Lovelace.<br />Bartimaeus is peeved, but has to obey Nathaniel. It immediately becomes clear that the amulet is a lot more important than it looks -- and someone will kill to keep it a secret. Lovelace tracks the amulet to Nathaniel's house and attacks them, while Bartimaeus is captured and confined in the Tower of London. Despite their initial dislike, they must join forces, or Lovelace will use the amulet for an unspeakable crime.<br />An alternative universe with magicians as the ruling class is hardly a new idea. But Jonathan Stroud manages to make it fresher than before with a complicated British government ruled by magicians. Not to mention a rebel band of &quot;commoners&quot; (meaning: non-magic-users) who are sick of being treated like cattle. (That's something you won't see in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;)<br />Stroud is also a writer who can handle just about any words he tries. He switches freely between first person (Bartimaeus) and third person (Nathaniel) narratives. The writing is pretty detailed; not too much, just enough to make it all come alive. What's more, the constant tussling between Nathaniel and Bartimaeus adds a note of much-needed character tension.<br />The biggest problem with &quot;The Amulet of Samarkand&quot; is that Nathaniel (who spends much of the book being rather demanding and snobby) took a VERY long time to grow on me, and even as he does good things, you get the feeling he's not a really good person. Bartimaeus is, however, an amazing character -- witty, sardonic, irreverent and wry, looking on with annoyed amusement at the rest of the scrambling cast, including his fellow djinn and demons.<br />&quot;The Amulet of Samarkand&quot; is a solid, genuinely suspenseful fantasy with a sparkling title character and a rather annoying supporting lead.

B0000DD7LC|5.0|I can honestly say, this is the BEST CD that I bought in 2003. And I purchased several. Alicia's debut was no fluke, and this CD proves it. Every time I put in in my CD player, I play it through at least twice. Sometimes 3. It's just that good. Better than SIAM. R&amp;B at its best!<br />No matter what anyone says, Alicia has the talent, the spirit, and the voice to do many great things. This girl really loves music. Alicia's confidence and passion about her work really shine through on &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys.&quot; Add this CD to your collection and you won't be disappointed.
B0000039QA|5.0|This is not no Eminem or no Nelly ...... this album is Biggie Smalls. A classic. This album came out, sold very well..... just like B.I.G.'s other albums. But this one is the best.With Bone Thugs N Harmony, Notorious Thugs was a hit. It was the first song i heard from Life After Death. Notorious Thugs was the best hit from this abum, but in my opinon i like Ten Crack Commandments the best.While fliping thrue songs, i heard the beat for it, and it brought my attention. so i stopped and listened to it, and i came out to be one of my favorite songs in the world. This whole album brought my attention. B.I.G. is an influence. He has brobably influenced over 20 rappers. Not just rappers. Any music really. There is about mabey 5 artists the perfect talent.... the perfect voice... and Biggie is one of those artists. I am from the west side, but i still got the same amount of love for east coast. Pleaz listen to this album. R.I.P. Notorious B.I.G.
B000002H33|5.0|One can only think when listening to Master of Puppets how amazing this album truly is. All the tracks are great heavy metal power ballads that will make anyone bang their head when listened to. Metallica really pays off with Master Of Puppets and simply is their best album to date. I am very upset to see how less the band has matured from this album. Tossing the public the half decent, infact not decent at all St. Anger. Forget that trash and pick this one up. Ask any Metallica fan, this album rules above all and always will. Master Of Puppets truly is a great album.
B00005AQGH|5.0|This is a classic album. 10 out of 10. This was a great peice of music tupac made. This album had a large amount of hits. Such as the singals Hail Mary and To Live And Die In LA. When Tupac came out, i was a fan. When he sold All Eyez On Me, i liked him more. But now with this album, tupac is my favorite artist. There is more rappers. Dr. Dre, SNoop dogg, nelly, eminem. But non of those can take the place of tupac. There is probably only one person in the world with so much talent. He is such a gifted person. There is no one like this guy. This album is worth more than it is. If i could i would give this 1000000000000000000000000 stars. So it must be good huh? This album is such a classic. Tupac is dead right now, but his music still lives on untill this day. R.I.P. Tupac Shakur
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth is one of those great bands we all love to listen to when jamming. It is honestly shameful to call Opeth black-metal. Yes the vocals can seem to sound demonic and hell born. However Opeth's music is just like any other band and shows emotions and certainly shows that these musicians are quite better then the Nu Metal trash we hear about today. In certain songs, such as &quot;Harvest&quot; Mikael's voice soars over the beautiful acoustic guitar's and slow tempo. Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson does a brilliant job at producing this album, and has a nice vocal segment in &quot;Bleak&quot;. The title track, my personal favorite &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; is a nice heavy metal song. When I'm mowing my lawn, I often find myself breaking into headbangs of minute long outbursts. This whole CD overral is a masterpiece that must be heard to understand. Warning: If you don't like growling vocals or are bothered by them you might want to consider listening to a sample album version first.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Songs for the Deaf destroys any other rock album.  The pounding bass in the back ground and the amazing drums by Dave Grohl (who is probably the best drummer since John Bonham) is pure extascy.  I love this album because it is so damn different then all the other crap rock out there (aka Limp Biskit, AFI, Blink 182 to name a few) .  Ever since I listened to this album, I have gone and bought both of their previous albums and also saw them in concert.  Queens of the Stone Age crazy sound is simply amazing.  Songs for the Deaf is the best modern day rock album.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth shows again that they can make a good album no matter which direction they take to do it. Damnation certainly shows a much softer and melodic side of Opeth we have always seen, however on a full length album. I recommend this to any Opeth fan or any Prog music fan because it is pure brilliance. &quot;To Rid the disease&quot; is my personal favorite. Starting off with haunting melodic vocals over a acoustic verse which soon becomes a beautiful chorus really showing how great Mikael's vocals are besides his demonic growls. Buy this album please, you will not be disappointed.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Well, I bought this CD used recently, and had no idea about all the 'politics' involved.  However, speaking as someone who owns more than two Joy Division albums, I kind of like it.  It's been in my CD rotation for a couple months now.<br />The first track is kind of Mazzy Starish, which is cool.  But the rest is, yes, a rip off of Ian et al.  But hey, they closed up shop a while ago.  Why not enjoy something that obviously pays homage to their genius?  Even though they are making money off unoriginality, so to speak....it's actually pretty original if you think about it and actually listen to it a few times.  Go on, give yourself leave to enjoy it!
B00009W8N2|5.0|When first listening to Opeth's first album, I understood why it took them 4 years to conceive. The whole album beginning with the first track &quot;In the mist she was standing&quot; is incredible. The album starts off with a three minute guitar riff that will make any guitar player question his ability. Soon the album will progress into more heavy laden songs and finnally into a few instrumentals. I must recommend this to any metal fan around, you will love this album. I often find this to be their best album as well, definately give this one a look.
B00006IU73|4.0|I have given this album a 4 because of my own feelings, in all reality it deserves higher then a 5, however, some songs on this album I can't stand and I have to skip. Please mind the 4 rating, because this album truly does deserve a listen and is probably one of Porcupine Tree's best albums, the opening track \\"Blackest Eye's\\" starts of with a heavy riff of crashing guitars and soon trails off into a spacy, almost drifting guitar segement which could make anyone fall asleep. This song, along with \\"Trains\\" are my favorites on the album. This is definately a phenomena that must be heard, as Porcupine Tree isn't a band that should be taking lightly, Buy In Absentia, you will be very pleased.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Me and my Girlz love to get together and talk and dream about guys while listening to the Linkin boys. They are so HOT!!! And oh my are they talented, they really know how to play guitars!! The songs are SO hard to play.  I have been playing guitar for 2 months and I can only play half of the songs, I can't figure out how they move their fingers so fast.  Anyway I had the best time at our last slumber party listening to Meteora while painting toenails and eating cabbage rolls and cheese brodies
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle really shows new ground in this album proving Maynard James Keenan's statement that they AREN'T a side project of TOOL. I am extremely impressed with the music on this record especially, \\"The Noose\\" and \\"Gravity\\" both songs asking for repetance for the use of drugs and to be \\"lifted back unto the sun\\" as Gravity's headlining verse states. What a great way to show how a band today can progress, I wish more rock could be as mature and inventive like this today, I really do.
B000066NW0|3.0|Musicians such as Avril Lavigne and Good Charlotte have caught a lot of flack about being &quot;posers&quot; and &quot;wanna-be punks.&quot;   Wait, freeze-frame a second.  What's wrong with this picture?  Do any of you KNOW these artists?  Didn't think so.  How do you know anything about who she really is inside?  People are being so quick to label and so quick to assume that she's the worst singer in the universe.  Listen to the music, then judge.<br />That having been said, here's my review of &quot;Let Go.&quot;<br />The album has its definite high and low points.  Avril isn't the best songwriter in the universe, but can you really expect a 17-year-old to have heart-touching lyrics on her debut album?  She sings about typical, real teenager situations with a raw honesty that is sorely needed in today's music world.  Nevermind the fact that most of the songs are simple; that does not mean that they're nondistinguishable from other things, or just plain bad.<br />&quot;Losing Grip&quot; is an awesome way to start out the album.  Kelly Clarkson's &quot;Low&quot; definitely ripped off a bit of this sound, then I realize the same person helped produce the songs.<br />&quot;Complicated&quot; is one of two songs that I dislike on this album.  It's just...  well, I think it inaccurately portrays what the entire album sounds like.  When I first heard this, it was the first time I heard any of Avril's songs and it does not leave a remarkable impression.  So don't judge the album simply by &quot;Complicated&quot; or &quot;Sk8er Boi,&quot; as they are not the album's shiniest gems.<br />&quot;Mobile&quot; is awesome, and deals with having a whirlwind life and how hard it is to see friends whenever she's on the road, touring, or at photo shoots.<br />&quot;Unwanted&quot; and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; are bold chunks of Avril's mind, and I'm loving them! They're my favorite songs on the album.  I don't see how many people can refuse these songs.<br />The low points ofthe album are &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Naked.&quot;  Those songs just do nothing for me.  Other than that, she's a simple girl who speaks her mind lavishly and she's got some vocal chops as well.  The comparisons to Michelle Branch aren't really all that credible; they've got two completely different styles.  Michelle's voice is more whiny and her songs just don't have as much impact.  I can't explain it.<br />I recommend this album for anyone who's not taking things so seriously and can look past the stereotypes of &quot;punks&quot; and &quot;posers.&quot;  Focus on what matters, people.  It's really NOT that bad.  Almost enjoyable, I must say.  You would be surprised what happens when you give negatively portrayed albums a chance.
0679428895|4.0|Robert Harris has managed to interweave a fine thriller and an entertaining history lesson in his latest novel, &quot;Pompeii.&quot; The story unfolds over a three-day period, August 22-25, 79 AD....the days that spelled doom for Pompeii and its neighbor on the Bay of Naples, Herculaneum. A young engineer, Marcus Attilus Primus, has been sent from Rome to take charge of the Aqua Agusta, the great aqueduct bringing water to the communities on and near the bay. His predecessor as Aquarius, or chief engineer, has suddenly vanished. As the new chief takes charge, his path crosses that of Nuemrius Popidus Ampliatus, a former slave who has amassed a personal fortune and political influence; Ampliatus's independent, headstrong daughter Corelia; the great scholar Pliny, who is serving as admiral for the navy; and other vivid personages. Looming over them all is Mount Vesuvius, soon to rain death and destruction.<br />This is probably not an original observation about this book, but it's a worthwhile one--much like the story of the Titanic, we know the outcome from the beginning,  but nevertheless are swept up by the drama and driving force of the narrative. The author's careful research is evident, as is his skill in interweaving these details so as to add life to the story. These are vividly-drawn, fully dimensional characters who almost leap to life off the page.<br />Harris' story reflects a world almost two millennia in the past. At the close of the book, I found myself thinking about how much progress humankind has made in that span...and how little. The last couple of centuries have brought great strides in manufacturing, transportation and communication, yet the Romans enjoyed a standard of achievement and civilization that was not to be surpassed for centuries. We can be proud of many of our advancements as a people, though some steps--such as the abolition of slavery--have come very recently in the context of our overall history.<br />The labors of generations of archeologists have unearthed the buried remains of this once-thriving seaport. The skill of Robert Harris has brought its people vividly back to life.--William C. Hallrcheologists have unearthed the buried remains of this once-thriving seaport.

B000002HK4|5.0|This is a good song. Terry Hoban eats ass.
B0000A36J5|4.0|Just a clarification, I thought I made it clear that the problem with the statement about C.S. Lewis' atheism in the DVD was that it was unexplained and taken out of context.  I stated in the review that &quot;Tolkein was instumental in Lewis' conversion back to Christianity&quot;.  Clearly, to convert back to something, one has to be away from it previously.  Anyway, the DVD does not put Mr. Duriez' statement in context and it leaves the impression that Lewis was simply an atheist.  That statement, though gramatically correct, still imparts a false understanding of C.S. Lewis' beliefs.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Like most other Sarah fans, I was overjoyed to hear of a new Sarah CD. I own all her previous CD's and love them all. I've played them everywhere I go and single-handedly generated dozens of album sales for her CD's by playing them for friends and bragging on her to others. Her voice is amazing: you can have all your Celines and Whitneys and Mariahs. For me, Sarah beats them all. The richness of her voice is incredible, and her passion and emotion come through in every song.<br />Her lyrics are equally strong. At her best, her lyrics have the ability to say what you are feeling, but better than you could ever say it. The combination of lyrics, voice and her ear for melody combine to create an oftentimes spiritual experience for me when I listen to her. She is THAT GOOD. However, only one or two songs jump out at me on this CD after repeated listens, whereas her other material has drawn me in almost instantly. So what went wrong?<br />The lyrics are still good. Although not as good as some previous efforts, still better than 99% of other music lyrics out there.<br />Her voice is still excellent, but it seems that on previous CDs the arrangements in her songs were more sparse, allowing her voice to be the main instrument. On this CD there are too many layers of &quot;stuff&quot; and her voice is not allowed to shine.<br />The downside to me are the quality of the songs, the arrangements and melodies. There are few memorable melodies to draw you in. I don't care how good your voice is, if there's not at least a somewhat decent melody underneath, it's not going to go anywhere and the song is &quot;filler&quot; material. On her past CDs, she seemed to have an ear for catchy instrumentation, chord progressions and a deep well to draw on for such inspiration. Perhaps the well isn't as deep as I thought. I hope she rebounds on her next CD in 2009.<br />The sad thing to me is, Sarah McLachlan only makes a new studio CD every 3 to 5 years or so. Maybe that's the problem for me. This CD is good, but not great. Sarah has set the bar so high and my expectations were so high, based on her previous work, and now I know I'll have to wait another 5 years for her next CD.<BR>If you are a rabid Sarah fan, buy this CD. If not, preview it first so you know what you're getting into first.
0395925037|4.0|I am in the process of reading Mein Kampf and am nearing the end. I have found that the book is useful for the purposes of understanding Adolf Hitler as a person. I have also found out by reading the book that Adolf Hitler was not a hypocrit, and nearly all ramblings on did come to light. <BR> In addition, I felt that the most interesting thing about the book was that Hitler knew that in order to have a National Socialist State he needed to introduce his policies to every person by making them first nature to all Germans and so that they, particularly younger people, would know little different. In effect, it would be the uniting foundation to their existence, all sharing and striving for one ideal over personal greed. These are just the hollow ideas, not the reality as it turned out.
B000099T2L|5.0|OK FIRST OFF I YOU LIKE GOOD  MUSIC THIS IS DEFINITLY THE CD TO BUY. ITS STARTS OFF WITH YOU RUSHING FOR #2 (NAUGHTY GIRL) CAUSE WE HAVE ALL HEARD CRAZY IN LOVE AND THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH UHOH-UHOH-UHOH-OHNONO THAT WE CAN TAKE. FROM START TO FINISH THIS IS A GREAT CD YOU DANCE LAUGH CRY PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THIS IS PRT. II OF THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL (WICH WAS THE BEST DC CD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  BEYONCE IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST ARSTIST OF THE  YEAR AND IF YOU  DONT GET THIS CD YOU ARE  PLAYING
B00005JLFC|5.0|For anyone who thinks so, I do not believe that Barbra Streisand meant to be offensive in her brilliant movie Yentl. She is very passionate about this movie. To this comment \\"supposedly mis-treat women\\" ... I do not think that Babs meant for this to be directed to the \\"Jewish\\". (she herself is one of the first movie stars to be an openly Jewish woman, if not, the first!!) I think it was men in general at this particular time in history. Read pretty much any book, all men were like this. I think her point was just to exagerate it so we understood that this is what was happening!  There's no way that anyone can say that there werent Jewish men who were disrespectful to women! <br />I think we have to remember the period in which this movie was portrayed. I am very sorry to hear that a husband and wife were offended by this wonderful movie. <br />So what if Barbra decided to add some things in the movie (that werent in the book). Thats why they say \\"BASED on\\" hense the word BASED.<br />Take the Wizard Of Oz.. I have read that book. Very different to the movie! Most things were changed. That's just what happens in movies.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|It's weird. The people who like this album compare it with the recent DT albums, which arent good either. I can only say that this is not DT.
B00005ALP6|5.0|Audrey Hepburn stars in the film remake of Shaw's play, Pygmalion, in the role that Julie Andrews made famous on Broadway. Apparently the Hollywood bosses thought Andrews didn't have enough audience drawing-power and passed her over in favor of Hepburn. Andrews got her digs in when she won an Oscar for The Sound of Music.<BR>Anyway...<BR>My Fair Lady is a classic. No one other than Rex Harrison could possibly have played Professor Higgins so well; the part seems to have been made for him. The plot: on a dare, linguist Higgins sets out to take Eliza, a street urchin who sells flowers, clean her up and cultivate her, and present her to society as A Lady. It's a social experiment that succeeds only too well, as Eliza takes society by storm and captures the hearts of several men, including Higgins himself. Wonderful cameo roles with Colonel Pickering and Eliza's father, Alfred Doolittle. And wonderful timeless songs: Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man, I Could Have Danced All Night, The Rain in Spain, On the Street Where You Live, etc. It's more than a movie; it's an experience.
B00005JMGC|4.0|I'm opposed to all movies that start off \\"In a far away land...\\" and ends with \\"they lived happily ever after.\\" And this chick flick isn't a typical lovey dovey type of story, it actually turns the other way by having the main woman asserting her independence by not letting society make rules for her life. This is the main theme the director concentrated on. <BR>  Its a great movie to watch if you're a feminist, you like art (Julia Roberts is an art professor), and/or to take a friend/daughter/tormented boyfriend so they can see what strides woman have done and what we still have to do.
B00004R99M|5.0|Wonderful story of a nanny who comes riding on an umbrella into the lonely lives of two children to transform their world and that of the entire household with her whimsy, her magic, her love and songs and spoons full of sugar.<BR>Julie Andrews plays the magical nanny of the film's title; Dick Van Dyke with the rubbery face and legs is her clownish beau Bert, the chimney sweep. Ed Wynn plays the uncle whose waves of giggles carry him soaring up to the ceiling. Set in Victorian England, the pompous father and fatuous mother are transformed by Mary Poppins' special brand of love, compassion, and understanding.<BR>This movie was a blend of animation and live action, one which creator Walt Disney considered to be his crowning achievement. And then, of course, there's the music: A Spoonful of Sugar, Feed the Birds, Chim Chim Cheree, etc.<BR>This is one to own and watch over and over with kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, neighbor kids. Pass out the cookies and milk and sing along.
B0000DCGT1|5.0|I saw &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (son of Hard Tack who was the son of Man o'War) at the movie theatre 3 times, and have just recently bought the video.  Watching &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; at home on TV is the same as watching &quot;Titanic&quot; at home on TV.  Its great, but nothing like experiencing it on that huge screen with surround-sound.  The scenes where we first see the horses running wild through the wide-open spaces with Tom Smith watching them or coming up behind with his lasso - you had to see it on the big screen.  That's only one example.  There are too many to go into here.<br />I've heard a few people say that the movie is too predictable, or too corny.  Too predictable?  Its a true story!  In fact, the last race Seabiscuit won before he retired, the &quot;hundred grander&quot; at Santa Anita, was much more dramatic and exciting in real life than it was in the movie.  In the movie Seabiscuit just comes from way behind to win.  Actually, Seabiscuit got boxed in between several horses and Red Pollard had to take a very risky chance of trying to run between two horses when a small space finally opened up.  Pollard already had his badly injured, but healing leg to be concerned about.  But he took the chance, led Seabiscuit through that small space, broke out of the pack, and finally won the Santa Anita &quot;hundred grander.&quot;  That race was much more dramatic than the race against War Admiral (son of Man o'War), but I guess some people considered it anti-climatic since the race with War Admiral was such a national event.  I think the film-makers could have made the movie that much better by showing that last race exactly as it happened.  Then do the voice-over while Seabiscuit is in the winner's circle.<br />So, these people who say the movie is too predictable - its a real life story folks.  It really happened.  Sorry if a true story is too corny or predictable.
B00009TB5G|5.0|LOTR: The Two Towers is simply a masterpiece in every sense of the word. And Gollum is a crowning accomplishment for actor AND director. Just compare Gollum to some of the steaming piles of crap served up by Lucas in the last 2 Star Wars films. The actor- Andy Serwin- deserves a best actor nod as much as any actor out there. It is truly a revolutionary piece of work.<br />This film is the best of the trilogy in my opinion. The battle of Helms Deep was amazing- but even more amazing was how Jackson worked up a palpable sense of despair before the battle Even though we all knew they would win, watching that movie put you in doubt! Watching Aragorn comforting a young boy readying for battle - &quot;this is a good sword&quot; - as you can see his face breaking because he knew it was a piece of crap and this boy had no chance- was a capper.<br />Sure, Jackson took liberties with the plot, with Faramir, but so what? I'll leave it to Tolkein purists to complain. I've read those books over and over since I was 10 and the films are good enough for me!<br />PS- The extended flashback scene with Faramir, Boromir and Denethor is worth the price of the DVD alone...
B0000C6E4D|5.0|After her lengthy hiatus, Sarah McLachlan has returned with an album that picks up right where she left off.  Sarah McLachlan's Afterglow dovetails nearly perfectly with her 1997 release, Surfacing.  Afterglow bubbles over with McLachlan's trademark ethereal, reflective tunes, undergirded by her unmistakable voice.  <br />Lyrically, Sarah McLachlan hasn't ever connected with me as profoundly as she has connected with others (perhaps that's because I'm a guy)...  However, I've been taken with Sarah's atmospheric songs, stellar songwriting, beautiful piano weaves, careful album production, and perhaps most importantly - her dreamy, GORGEOUS voice.  I find all of these elements on this album, making it a disc I know I will continue to play and not forget.  It seems that a number of fans are disappointed with Afterglow, but since the album meets my expectations from Sarah McLachlan and follows her signature sound, I'm not disappointed at all.  In fact, I quite like Afterglow, and I'd highly recommend it to old fans as well as new.
B00005JMGL|5.0|I think this film was amazing. I love the actors & actresses chosen. I find their acting is amazing and many actors such as Peter pan, Jason isaacs is absolutely gorgeous, i have fallen in love with him!!I think the actress who played Wendy is positively beautiful and her acting is also amazing. I Love this film and their couldn't have been anything better done to it !!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Never before have I been drawn into a story such that I have been by this series. The matter of fact dialogue and funny turn of events keep the viewer totally engrossed. I was very saddened when the last episode finished and I was left stunned and craving more. The characters are believable and unlike many other recent shows, you really come to care about them. It would be a shame if this story could not be told. I sincerely hope that Firefly makes a comeback. If there is a movie (as rumored) I'd be there on opening night. :) Somehow, this series needs to go on!
B0000A02TZ|4.0|After finally seeing &quot;Animal House&quot; in its entirety for the first time, I now realize the cultural impact it's had in the 25+ years since its theatrical release. Many, many films, from&quot;Revenge Of The Nerds&quot; to &quot;Old School&quot;, have followed the &quot;Animal House&quot; formula, with varying results. Usually, the film that does it first, does it best, and I think that's the case with &quot;Animal House&quot;.<br />It's difficult not to appreciate the performance of John Belushi,<BR>in his first major role. As &quot;Bluto&quot; Blutarski, he is charismatic even while crushing beer cans on his forehead. By now, had he lived, Belushi would probably have graduated into more dramatic roles, like his &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; counterpart, Bill Murray. Of all the new actors that &quot;Animal House&quot; introduced, only Kevin Bacon continues to appear regularly in films. Karen Allen went on to co-star in the acclaimed films &quot;Raiders Of The Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;Starman&quot;, but has since seemingly dropped off the radar.<br />Director John Landis uses a lot of sight and sound gags to elicit laughs(I lost count of how many times I heard glass breaking), and he went on to use many of those same tricks in &quot;Trading Places&quot;, one of my favorite all-time comedies. It's too bad that neither the DVD of that film nor &quot;Animal House&quot; have the original theatrical trailer available. It's also annoying that Universal sticks multiple commercials for other films at the beginning of the DVD. Still, &quot;Animal House&quot; remains an enjoyable film that will, no doubt, continue to be a source from which other college-based movies will copy.
B00005JMF6|4.0|Gothika was a very interesting film. it was slo very scary. I actually have the same job as Halle Berry in the movie. I work at a hospital for the Criminally Insane, so Gothika was very interesting to me. It made me think, maybe the people i work with everyday aren't actually crazy, and their stories are true. Halle Berry did a fantastic job in this movie. It was very creepy and scary, well done and well acted. The only thing i wasn't quite sure of was the ending. I wasn't too sure what they were saying, but if what I think they are saying is true, then it really is good! fantastic movie
B00009TB5G|5.0|I recieved this DVD for Christmas- what can I say? I LOVE IT! In most DVDs, deleted and extended scenes are not incorporated into the actual movie, but in this version, they are! The new scenes are hilarious, and this edition is perfect for anyone- Tolkien lover or not! It includes 4 disks- 2 are the movie and 2 are Appendices. Peter Jackson- great job!
B000089RVX|1.0|Well, to close out another year, EVANESCENCE would be FAR from the best band of '03, in my opinion of course, but not those of dem' folks who fall for the corporate non-scence the music industry puts out.  Rocker CHRISTIANS.. Yippey!  Sorry kiddies, this music is so freakin' tainted.. It has $$$$ signs written all over it.  The pop scene needs a rest, the rap scence needs a break, country....haha, so why not add some &quot;depressing&quot; metal for the pop/rock radio stations?  Yeah, it is refreshing for those who have been use to CRAP, but now they are revived with ROCK CRAP...  The refreshing is &quot;the female persona&quot; with some little robot musician guys in the back (notice most evanescence pics focus on the gal).  Now, you tell me?  Is this not a great scheme to make money?  Kids will buy what is new, and  they won't think to explore real music. (Because we all know it comes out every few monthes, or under-ground bands don't sell out) Thus, the enlightenment of music only reaches a certain level that lasts maybe through the first 20 times that the song has been played on radio.  Those who say that the music is depressing ....have you ever heard of gloom metal?  Jesus, there is a difference between boring and depressing.  Don't associate the happy evanescene with the dark side of humanity...   Bands that make depressing music make it as an art and expression. Not a revival in the &quot;new age goth-kids of america&quot;.  Try Lacuna COIL kiddies, whom might I say, have been around as Lacuna Coil since 96'. Cristina Scabbia will eat Amy Lee alive.. Grrr. Evanescene did not, DID NOT, start it... they just adjusted it to their musical capabilities to help make $$$$. You don't after all, have to play well to be famous anymore...  &quot;BLACK&quot; is in, sad kids... Let Evanescene show you the way! (To the dark side of HEAVEN) or to the music distribution stores in the mall.Yes, Hot Topic too!  <BR>Ohh, and yes I have heard their music. (Almost anywhere.)I can't ever save myself from the music abuse. My family turns the radio on, AMY IS WAILING ON THE HIGH NOTES, Ugg!  It's like people take that cd to the bathroom and blare it.  Everyone needs to feel &quot;sad&quot; when they take a whiz. They are &quot;emotionally attatched to the &quot;new&quot; sound the media has gave them...  Another thing, they aren't true to the &quot;Christian&quot; name. (The one nobody follows because it contradicts everything they do.) They sing some songs about GOD, ohhh my!  Well, the money they make for the music industry may be donated to Samaritans Purse, and other christian crisis organizations. Hahaha! Religion is big business!  <BR>They lyrical content sounds like it is &quot;trying&quot; so hard to have the edgy metal gloom content, but can't quite make it because it is mimmicking other songs that are written about the &quot;dark, suicidal, black, lost, hopeless feeling of.........being dumped or falling in love?  Or maybe a dark attatchment to a boyfriend or maybe a gloomy infatuation with somebody.  Well, the whole LUV thing has been done in pop, and will be done in Pop-rock Evanescene....
B00005B4GU|1.0|Radiohead really lost the plot with this album. Thier collective ego's must be the size of the grand canyon to think anyone would want to listen to this. All i can say is if you want to be intellectual, read a book. Listening to self important avant-garde drivel like this doesn't mean you're a more complex and evolved being.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Not my normal type of movie but I have to say I enjoyed it.  Special effects were really good. Story was a little to typical and expected but all in all I really liked the movie.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This album was the biggest surprise of 2002 and maybe the most surprising album in the past 5 years. After the stale sounding Midnight Vultures i wasn't expecting much at all from this. But it hit me like a gentle sea breeze (excuse the pun). Sea change isn't going to bend any notions of music like Odelay or Mellow Gold once did. It's just a superbly crafted album of lush folk rock gently sprinkled with some gorgeous synth lines and strings. While Alternative music is going down the tubes, beck still continues to flourish.
0446608955|5.0|This book is beautifully written. While I was reading this book, I couldn't help but to cry. If you want something touching, you should read this one. You won't regret.
B000002MP2|5.0|this is the best green day cd out there. it has all my favorite green day songs. basket case, when i come around, and the rest. this cd you need to get. its the old school punk that kicks ass. this cd is better than there other newer cds, like nimrod and the cd that has &quot;brain stew&quot;. that songs tight. but this cd is still good. get it!, and uhhhhh.. yeah
B0000VAFO0|4.0|The movie was good, generally speaking. The pacing was acceptable and it had everything on it, action, romance, a good plot and all. But almost at the end of the movie something happens that it doesn't make sense at all and it made me loose interest in it.  Still I highly recommend the movie if you are looking for a variety of events.
B00005JM1F|1.0|I rented three movies-The Recruit, Feedback and this movie. <br />I LOVE Will on SNL..but this movie is so lame it deserves 3 thumbs down.<br />This has been my one and only movie review.<br />PS-the other two movies rocked. Espescially 'Feedback'. A b-rated movie with class.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|This movie doesn't follow any kind of logical sequence with the first movie's plot. I don't think it has a plot at all. It's true that is full of action but lacks logic. The special effects were awesome though. It's good to see it if you don't have anything else to do. I fear and wonder what revolutions might bring...
B000069AUI|5.0|They did themselves something of a disservice with Parachutes (their prior CD) in that it was so unbelievably good, their next release would be hard pressed to not pale in comparison.<br />I'll admit to not being as good a critic as most because the first time I listened to this CD I was somewhat dissapointed and it lay on top of my CD player for a few weeks.  Can't remember what got it back in rotation at my house, but after a couple of listens the anchor songs (2, 3, and 5) pulled me sufficiently close to the CD that I was able to get collateral exposure to the other gems on this CD (every other song, literally) and soon became a junkie for this masterpiece.<br />I hope you love it as much as I did.  Kudos to these brilliant artists.<br />Enjoy.
B00004Z459|4.0|Alright, most people bash this CD, and I can understand that some songs get stail, but I am a fan of LP for how good their music is, and in songs like With You and By Myself, those are songs I like for their lyrics, as well.  And here's the thing:<BR>Lots of people are like me and like bands for those same exact reasons.  And people, you have to realise not everybody in the world lieks Led Zepplin, or ACDC, or Motley Crue.  I personally despise them all.  Liking a CD and the songs on it is based on your personal interest of what you like in the music, and in lyrics.  Sure, I am a fan on mostley the music only, but some of the lyrics are good too.  But they don't compare to the actual music, such as the ending music for Runaway (the guitaring) and things like that.  Then I hear bands like ACDC and Led Zepplin, and I hate them because I have a person taste devoted to newer aged music...like Eminem, Three Days Grace (I don't know how TDG are considered Pop Rock though, they are harder than LP sometimes), Blink 182, The Distillers, etc...<br />This was a good CD in my opinion because, once again, I love the music in it, and in songs like With You and By Myself I like the lyrics too.<BR>One final note: Anyone who considers LP Metal, or Rap-Metal, or Rap, or Hard Rock...well, you're wrong.  That's your opinion, but in reality, they are actually Alernative Rock.  That may be why so many of you hate them, because they are Alternative Rock, and not hard rock or heavy metal.
B00005YW4H|5.0|...I first heard her on a date about a year and a half ago at a real trendy Seafood restaurant.  Her chesty, seductive voice wrapped in near perfect Jazz rythm put me in a romantic trance.<br />The music amplified the quality of the date I was with and I believe is probably responsible for me spending way more time with her than I should have...  Alas, I'm not mad at Norah, no, to the contrary, I love her.  Seriously, I love her and would happily set myself on fire (in a non-vital area, under close professional supervision) for one night with her.  I'd only ask her to sing for me; and I'd happily, lovingly listen...<br />Enjoy.

B0000TB01Y|3.0|My friend saw Wicked in New York over Thanksgiving and told me that it was his new favorite musical and that I HAD to get the cast recording. Of course I was very excited about Wicked, the musical. The book is one of my absolute favorites! Gregory Maguire is one of the best authors I have ever read.<br />So I got the CD (for Christmas actually) And upon listening to it I was very disturbed. It turns out the musical is nothing like the book. In fact, the only similarities I can find are the title and the main character's names. This was a HUGE let down for me. <br />The musical does have it's good points though. Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth are amazing performers and completely raise the bar with their performances. Norbert Leo Butz has also been a favorite of mine since he appeared in Rent. So it was great to here him sing even if his part was all to familiar. The only big problem I have is the disneyification of the musical. Cop out ending and all. Plus, the songs are far too fluffy/poppy. There's no real substanance in them....<br />I read a review of the show on broadway.com and the critic noted similarities to the musical Aida and I couldn't agree more.<br />So if you enjoy Aida (which I must admit I do) and have not read the book Wicked, I completely recommend this recording. But if you are expecting a Sondheim-esc, dark musical that is similar to the book, you may be dissapointed. <br />So I give 3 stars, I enjoy fluffiness every once in a while, but not the fluffication of my favorite novel.
B00006879E|5.0|...because I've listened to it thousands of times!<br />I first listened to these guys purely by accident, a super cute college girl I was seeing dropped it in the CD player (we both had too much to drink and I was gunning for Chicane); before I could stop her, the first song &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; hooked me in with it's hip blend of Motown and Garage Band funk.  Never a big fan of the two on their own, the combination, fused together with modern rhythm, is fresh, fun, and brings a smile to my face every time I hear it.<br />The first few tracks are faster paced (all of them excellent) the fourth is slow (a bit commercial for my taste but damn, I still love it) five and six are perfect (track 6 being my favorite) and eight and twelve are great as well.<br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I do...
B000002UJQ|5.0|this cd is one of the best collections of music you will find anywhere. the pure emotions in these songs is breath-taking, and the music in itself is also incredible. &quot;no surprises&quot; is one of the most sweetly gorgeous songs by anyone ever. and i know this has now been said many times, but, &quot;supercooldude,&quot; whoever you are, i feel pity for you if you think radiohead is trying to &quot;copy&quot; off of such pathetic money-grabbing acts as avril lavigne and n'sync. yeah, there's some real talent. for all radiohead fans everywhere, &quot;we hope that you choke.&quot; anyway, buy this cd. you will not be dissappointed.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is by far the best album I've heard in a long while.  Stripped is definately a landmark in her career. Her talent and volcals have only hightened in strength and power.  Especially on songs such as &quot;walk away&quot; and &quot;the voice within&quot;.  No matter what negative comments may befall upon her or the gossip that is spread.  The only thing you need to look and listen for is the music.  She is an amazingly talented artists who I respect and adore.  Give this album a listen. I promise that you won't be disappointed.

B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie is very good, on account that I'm not the biggest teen movie watcher I thought that 10 things I hate about you was well put together. An all-star cast including, Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger and Larisa Oleynik. This movie has a few memorable moments in it that wont be forgotten easily. Such as when Heath Ledger began to sing in front of the soccer team, When Julia Stiles flashed a teacher (no nudity, damn!) When Julia Stiles dances to a little bit of Biggie at a big party or when Larisa Oleynik beat the hell out of this dude.<br />This movie is about a beautiful popular girl (Larisa Oleynik)  that isnt allowed to go out period, but when her father says that she may date as soon as her unpopular weird sister (Julia Stiles) begins to, a dude that has a crush on the popular girl pays this dude (Heath Ledger) a overall bad ass to date Julia Stiles, thats when things get crazy with Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles falling in love and two guys after Larisa Oleynik things heat up in this hilarious and clever comedy.<br />My mother bought me this DVD for christmas, I had seen the end previously on television but loved it anyway. Watch this movie if you enjoy teen movies, and for those that dont usually watch teen movies dont watch. I havent tried out the special features yet but I'm sure that they're fun!

B00005JLWN|3.0|What would you get if you crossed \\"Brave New World\\" with \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and shot it in the style of \\"The Matrix\\"?  A capably made second-tier sci-fi flick called \\"Equilibrium\\".  It's the post-apocalyptic dystopian near-future and, as always, the tyrannical authorities are to blame.  This time, they've decided that human emotion is the cause of all our social ills, so the population is doped up on mood equalizers and a priestly crew of gun-toting clerics enforce the dose.  But what happens when one of their own starts skipping his needles and questioning his role?  \\"Equilibrium\\" is a reasonably successful effort, especially impressive when you consider it was shot for a mere $20 million.  It's helped by a strong cast and a solid pace, but let down by the single factor that usually undermines dystopian fantasies of repression and rebellion: it's all about what's going on inside the hero's head.  That's easy to explore in a novel, but in film it's harder to represent.  Bale can really act, which helps, and Yeats, Beethoven and a puppy are all called into play, but it's never quite enough.  Writer/director Wimmer and the Weinsteins obviously decided that teenaged boys were this film's audience, and so were more intent on delivering ludicrous (though spectacularly choreographed) action sequences and multiple plot twists than on building interesting characters or emotional intimacy with the crowd.  It's doesn't help that Kurt Badelt's score is insistently melodramatic when what this film really needs are a few quiet moments of emotional engagement; more well-written scenes and less musical montage.  It's fun, but for a film about the importance of emotion over slavish obedience, it's a surprisingly formulaic and unmoving affair.  So long as he can resist turning it into a cinematic Norman Rockwell painting (e.g. the appalling \\"The Majestic\\"), Frank Darabont's new version of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" should show us all how it's really done.
B00004RF9I|4.0|The movie still packs a lot of punch, but has lost some of its emotional weight over the years.  Network presaged many of the changes that would occur in broadcast news in the 80's, as it became subject to the bottom line when it came to ratings. The humor is dark and biting but many of the scenes don't ring as true today as they did 25 years ago when this movie burst onto the screens.<br />Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is at the end of his rope, ready to cash it all in on prime time, but when his suicide date is announced, ratings leap and soon he finds himself front and center of a tabloid style news program that allows him to unleash all his pent up rage against the establishment, sucking the viewers into his rants.<br />Lumet deftly plays Beale's theatrics off the seasoned television producer, William Holden.  But, Holden is going through his own mid-life crisis and soon finds himself in bed with the frisky young television producer, Faye Dunaway, who has usurped him.  What might have worked as a one-night stand is turned into rather drab affair that doesn't help this movie much.  In the end, Holden is reduced to giving speeches, which doesn't really suit his style.<br />Mixed in is some darkly amusing scenes with terrorists, a Black Feminist Communist and an all too gullible audience that makes for the film's dramatic closing scene.  This film came as quite a shock in its time, given that Network News was still dominated by Walter Cronkite, but for those watching it for the first time, it would look like a period piece. Still, the performances are riveting, particularly that of Peter Finch, which makes the film worth watching again.
B0000DJZAH|3.0|The whole Who \\"deluxe edition\\" release effort has been a mixed bag, especially this Tommy set which is missing a couple of important elements.  In contrast, the Live at Leeds set was released previously with a remixed and upgraded package that was terrific.  The later Leeds deluxe set could be justified because it made the entire concert available in a cleaned up format with the complete Tommy on Disk 2 and decent liner notes (the bootleg version of complete Leeds was sonically uneven but was, at least, chronologically correct - \\"Tommy\\" did not end the show but was the middle core of it).  The Who's Next set, while the first disk was interesting but not as well chosen as the remixed single '95 release, was justifiable because of (finally) releasing the Old Vic concert tracks in pristine form on Disk 2.  And the liner notes were informative and worthwhile.  <br />Tommy, on the other hand, was never released in enhanced form, just a mid-nineties remix that was good, not great.  The jump to a deluxe set disappoints in several ways: the remix of the original tracks was great, in either format, but to make the argument for a two disk set the additional material needs to expand the artistic vision of the work.  Here, the second disk seems somewhat hashed together yielding little insight into the creative process.  The unreleased tracks were either undistinguished instrumental tracks or inferior releases of out takes already released on other sets.  For example, Cousin Kevin Model Child is a pale copy of the one on Odds and Sods and the Townsend demos are presented in better context in his \\"Scoop\\" series and seem tacked on here to fill time.  The Beatles anthology series did this better.  However, finally getting the frantic track \\"Dogs, Pt. II\\" on CD is welcome.  <br />The liner notes and booklet offer little insight into what was going on with the band at the time and is too photo heavy - the set is not really for casual fans so extra photos are not such a draw, more information is.  I expect notes to include some info on each track that is a little more personal than date, time, and studio, - none here.  So two out of three elements for a kicking deluxe set are a no-show, in my humble opinion.  Blown opportunity, too bad.
B00008HCCF|4.0|Norah Jones seems to have filled a void in the music industry, recalling past female rock singers/songwriters such as Carley Simon and Rickie Lee Jones. There really isn't much that is new here, but Jones does have a style all her own that is very pleasant to see and hear. The music seems to come from within and flow effortlessly outward to a public that appears to have grown jaded with teeny boppers like Britney Spears. While I don't imagine Jones will displace Spears and her ilk, she certainly provides for a refreshing alternative on the airwaves, and hopefully will encourage other young women songwriters to follow suit.  \\"Come Away With Me,\\" would be an apt description of this DVD. It provides for a nice musical flight of fantasy and even a few improvisations, which show that Norah Jones has the whole world in front of her.
B00005JMCN|2.0|Seabiscuit is yet another example of how Hollywood (in this case, Universal Studios) takes a nice story, having the potential to be a really nice &quot;family&quot; film, and turns it into an adult feature. I lost count of the number of irritatingly-blasphemous foul words used! As it usually goes with most movies, these words did absolutely nothing to enhance dialog at all. Discerning parents will probably want to keep their children away from this one.<br />The DVD's packaging was another sore spot. Instead of getting the usual chapter insert and liner notes with the disk, Universal Studios decided that the purchaser would rather own a &quot;barker&quot; sheet for Buick! Yes, even you could win a new Buick Rainier! How poor is that?

1400049628|5.0|Ok, I'm a conspiricy nut, and I love zombie movies, so I picked this book up, and read it in a day. It was a great read, but sort of creeped me out. I picked this book up in the bookstore (on the end caps), so I didn't know this was supposed to be humor. I had this nagging feeling like the author was really serious, but I thought no book could have been published like this, could it?<br />Well, I finished the book, with a short list of notes I needed to look up (the historical records), and lo and behold, the first one brought up the book listing under humor. Had me fooled! But this book still made me paranoid, and it will make you too! Good read!
078681859X|4.0|The book had a nice approach--First person, some historical footnotes, take from the \\"demon's\\" point of view.  The star wasn't the magician for a change.  No significant blips in logic or pace.  Very nice tempo.  In a few places, the young apprentice wizard gets to do too much, which is a problem, since the author's use of this character is a bit weak.  Overall, one of the better new books and new authors that I've read.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The movie's a class act.  Be careful if you decide to remove the Alliance/Atlantis paper cover off the storage container (Canadian purchase).  The distributor (?) partially glued a sales ad on the outer shell of my copy.  <br />When I tried to remove it (only partially glued), the paper tore apart.  Adhesive is VERY difficult to remove.  Tried oil (no luck), then alcohol, and then finally nail polish remover.  Damaged finish & artwork on dvd storage shell.  Thankfully, DVD's okay.  Cover just looks terrible!<br />When \\"Fellowship\\" came out, similar label applied; easily removed!  What happened?<br />F.Y.I.  Great movie though.  Be sure to check out its Easter Egg.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I got the t.A.T.u. CD, I really really loved it. I had heard All The Things She Said and Not Gonna Get Us on the radio and stuff before, but I wanted the whole album and it was everything I expected and more. 30 Minutes is my favorite song on the CD. I've cried while listening to it before, it's just so beautiful. I also like Clowns and all the other songs on there as well. It's a wonderfully mixed album, put together so it flows from song to song, keeping your attention with interesting lyrics and catchy melodies. My friend and I even dressed up as them for halloween...=D (I was Lena, she was Julia...) yeah I definitely think they're awesome and I can sometimes relate to their lyrics so, in my book, this was an excellent album.
0385504209|5.0|In a nutshell the book is about a massive coverup by the Church, i.e. Christians and in particular the Catholic Church.  Constantine the Great apparently and conveniently decided to leave out New Testament books in which Jesus was portrayed as a mere mortal.  Da Vinci and others believed this and sent signals of their beliefs as code in paintings, music, etc.  For example, look at the Last Supper painting by Da Vinci.  The disciple sitting to right of Jesus surely looks like a woman, not John.  Who is this person according to Da Vinci?  None other than Mary Magdelene!  Furthermore, Da Vinci and many others believed Mary was the wife of Jesus and bore his (their) child.  What's amazing is that author brown backs up these beliefs with historical facts.  I didn't believe it myself at first, but do as I did...go to google and do a search on photos of the recent restoration of da Vinci's Last Supper.  Look at the so called man sitting to right of Jesus (left when looking at print).  That is NOT a man, that is a WOMAN sitting next to Jesus.
067101756X|1.0|Make that very disappointed. The author's version of Roswell events is contradictory and inaccurate. He states that much modern technology (lasers, stealth, particle beams, integrated circuits, night-vision) was pirated from a crashed alien vehicle. If the spaceship had stealth technology, why did it light up radar screens for days prior to the crash? If these advanced beings wanted to gather intel on our nuclear and rocket sites in Nevada, why did they do so with low level flight as opposed to orbital listening (as we less advanced humans do)? If the ship crashed at thousands of miles per hour and was largely undammaged, why did it expell its crew? Supposedly, the MPs shot one alien with M1 rifles, but the M1 doesn't fire in the way described in this book (I know). Supposedly top security was imposed, with threats by MPs to the little girl of a plumber at the air base (I don't believe it), but the base commander authorized a press release about a flying disc. Supposedly, the technology remained under wraps, slowly released through secret deals with security-cleared private companies. Not true!! The first laser was demonstrated at Columbia University in 60. The integrated circuit appeared at Texas Instruments in 58. As for the aliens themselves, as a physician I can say their described storage and autopsies don't remotely reflect medical knowledge or procedures. For example, lungs don't store air like a camel's hump stores water. They bring inhaled gasses air into contact with special membranes and capillaries so exchange can occur. Corso's being \\"has combined lymphatics and circulation\\". That would be like running sewage and drinking water through the same pipes. The simplest injury would lead to sepsis. Corso claims to have seen the aliens decomposing in fluid in crates days after their high security transport but before their autopsy. Hello! Autopsy subjects are kept refrigerated, not slipped directly into formaldehyde. Corso sees them when he sneaks into the storage site after all of the armed men who made the delivery and did the threatening have left the crates virtually unguarded. Yeah right. I don't know what really happened at Roswell. Neither do the authors of this book.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Well, I'd like to give this album 5 stars, but I feel it's lacking. Kid A has a reason to be bizarre and stuff. It seemed to be telling a story set in the future. The future world was very bleak, and the music fit perfectly with the whole theme. But Amnesiac is just...I don't know. Don't get me wrong, this album has its high points.<br />Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box - Pretty good song.<br />Pyramid Song - I had heard nothing but praise for this song before i bought the album, but I have to say I'm a little bit dissapointed. I mean, its good and all, but it doesnt really junp out at me like I was expecting.<br />Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors - Great beat. I'm not going to pretend I know what the purpose of this song is, though.<br />You and Whose Army? - Another pretty good song.<br />I May be Wrong - Nice guitar, but the vocals seem really awkward.<br />Knives Out - I really like this song. One of the highlights.<br />Morning Bell/Amnesiac - I think this version is better. It seems more like how the song should be.<br />Dollars &amp; Cents - I don't know. Kind of weird. Doesn't really do anything to me.<br />Hunting Bears - I actually kind of like this one. Short and sweet, nice guitar.<br />Like Spinning Plates - Another good one. Souns like some of it was recorded backwards. Nice effects.<br />Life in a Glass House - Pretty good closer. Could have been better, though, I think.<br />Overall, this album was good, but a bit of a let down after Kid A.
B00008NRI8|3.0|A seemingly great movie from the excellent Marc Lawrence, starring the lovely Sandra Bullock, along with the ubiquitous Hugh Grant. Could you think of a more perfect film? I can. Miss Congeniality is one of my all-time favourite movies, Sandra Bullock is my favourite actress, and Hugh Grant . . . Who doesn't like Hugh Grant?<br />But this film is a movie too far. There's nothing original about this film. OK, it's pleasant enough to watch. But there's nothing new, it's not thought provoking, and both Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are getting very overly typecast in their roles. And they're not doing anything to stop themselves being typecast. I own quite a few Sandra Bullock films, and she's the same in every single film - the girl next door who's a major klutz, and always gets the guy in the end. Hugh Grant is the exact same. Apparently, his role in Bridget Jones's Diary was more of a \\"bad guy\\" role. I don't think so somehow.<br />Anyone could have thought up this story. No offence to Marc Lawrence, but he needs to expand his ideas a bit, and not choose predictable storylines. You know Sandra & Hugh are going to get together at the end of the film, despite all the obstacles that are thrown in their way (in the shape of Alicia Witt). They start off hating each other, and finish the film madly in love. Now, where have I heard that one before?<br />Hugh and Sandra make a good couple on-screen, and judging by their antics during the extras, make a good couple off screen. Which has sparked many a rumour about them actually being a couple in the press. But they just get on extremely well, and you laugh watching them not being able to look each other in the eye without laughing and ruining the take.<br />The extras are pretty basic. You've got a great looking commentary, featuring Marc Lawrence & Sandra Bullock (they made a great commentary for Miss Congeniality); a documentary; the theatrical trailer (you see the whole film just watching this); and a bloopers reel thing. You get some interesting comments from the stars, including one that I want in writing from Sandra, saying that now she's done this film, she feels she can put this genre to rest. I think that's not before time! (She's also remarkably frozen around the face area for a 39-year-old).<br />It's an average film. It's watchable. It passes the time. That's about it..

0385504209|1.0|I found this book to be deceptive, pandering to our incessant search for moral loopholes.  The author has taken old myths and repackaged them for a reading public that has very little experience with history.  The melding of fact and fiction was clever and misleading, leaving us breathless with anticipation for the next tricky twist.  If you read this, please do yourself the service of investigating the fact/fiction that serves as the base for this novel.

B00006AUIG|2.0|OK, This movie has gotten an average of 4 stars. DON'T FALL FOR IT! This movie STINKS!!!!! I made the mistake of purchasing the DVD after constant raves by friends and the majority of Amazon reviews. I guess I was too lazy to go out and rent it..I could have saved 15 bucks! I was expecting something like &quot;The Ring&quot; or &quot;The 6th Sense,&quot; but this movie is far from their league. I was expecting to get creeped out, but I spent most of my WASTED time WAITING for something to happen! I'm just surprised that I didn't fall asleep like some of the more right-on reviewers of this movie. You may not agree, but I do urge anyone to RENT before you decide to buy this one. HUGE disappointment!

B00004Z459|3.0|After listening to Hybrid Theory, I understand why Linkin Park maintains the huge following they do. The music is more often than not catchy and the lyrics, as trite as they may be to some, are pretty relatable for a certain age group. <br />While I've seen numerous people call Linkin Park THE band of the new generation while others dismiss them as nu-metal posers who are only contributing to the downfall of modern rock music as we know it, I can't help but fall somewhere in between. For one, there's no way one can claim this is the best new band around. In the (nu)metal arena of recent, System of a Down beats the living hell out of Linkin Park. Likewise, if you want a deeper emo band, go check out someone like Sunny Day Real Estate. On a sheer creative and melodically provocative level, go with Radiohead. I can't, however, recommend a rap artist of the past half-decade; what can I say?- I'm not that big a fan of the genre. <br />So, you compare this to something like Slipknot, and it seems panzy. Lyrically, you're certainly bound to find more convincing and affecting angst elsewhere. Nonetheless, I find it partially succeeds in all the different areas it attempts, and I commend them for that.
B000002J3W|5.0|As a child of the 80's, I love glam-metal hair bands and continue to listen to my favorites on a daily basis. Skid Row has always been a favorite of mine and, while Subhuman Race is very different from their first two albums, it is absolutely one of the best CD's I own. Heavier? Yes. The songs keep coming one after another. This isn't glam by any means! \\"Breakin Down\\" is my favorite song and I agree with the person whose review said it should have been released as a single...it would have blown us all away!
6302453356|3.0|Steven Spielberg's Hook is a fun-filled adventure. Peter Pan (Robin williams), has grown up! But when he discovers that his two children have been kidnapped by the evil Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) he is forced to return to Neverland, and with the help of Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) and his faithful Lost Boys, re-discover his childhood memories and rescue his kids from his old enemy, intent on destroying him.  This film is very enjoyable and is the kind you would purchase on video, due to its indefatagable pleasure.  It is true that this is not one of Spielberg's finest films, and when compared to his epics such as Jaws and Schindler's List, it is very weak.  However I feel it is worth watching if only to view Dustin Hoffman's first class interpretation of J.M. Barrie's classic villian.  Bob Hoskins is also excellent as Hook's right-hand man, Smee.  Although this movie lacks many qualities that would make it a &quot;great film,&quot; Its funny, enjoyable and well-acted.  The fencing battles are well-presented and the 15 minute action scene at the end of the movie is as exciting as anything you will see.  All in all, Hook should be perceived as no more then what it is: An enjoyable family movie.  Nothing magnificent as far as the film industry is concerned - but certainly worth checking out.
0767836324|5.0|Hook is a great adventure that should be seen by all generations. Dustin Hoffman IS Hook, nobody could do a better job than him. All the acting in this movie is superb! Steven Speilberg is an awesome director. The only movie I can think of that was a terrible Steven Speilberg movie was A.I. and that's because it was going to be done by Stanley Kubrick(I'm not knocking Kubrick, but A.I. was a terrible movie). So if you haven't seen Hook you will definitely enjoy it!
015670160X|5.0|\\"Orlando\\" is a fictional biography whose subject in the beginning is a sixteen-year-old boy in the Elizabethan era and in the end -- three hundred years later -- is a thirty-six-year-old woman.  This is not a novel about transsexuality, as such a premise would indicate, but it is a statement about sexual identity and gender roles in English society as only an author like Virginia Woolf could make, territory not even the brazen D.H. Lawrence could traverse with much confidence.  It is a lyrical tour de force in which Woolf displays her considerable talent for subtly describing moods and scenery, but most surprisingly, it demonstrates her sly sense of humor and satire.  <br />Orlando's gender alteration is naturally the central event of his preternaturally long life, but his aging only twenty years over a course of three centuries is certainly no less bizarre.  To describe the circumstances under which he becomes a woman or explain the logic by which he ages so slowly would be giving away too much in this review, nor would it really help to recommend the novel to one who is not yet persuaded to read it, so I will be silent on that account, saying only that these outrageous devices fully succeed as vehicles to explore Woolf's theme of femininity with respect to English cultural and historical frames of reference.<br />The novel examines the effect of gender alteration on Orlando's amorous and professional capacities.  As a young nobleman in the Elizabethan court whose interests are swordsmanship and poetry, he is engaged to an aristocratic Irish girl, has a torrid affair with a Russian princess, and meets a silly woman who, resembling nothing so much as a hare, calls herself the Archduchess Harriet.  After serving as an ambassador in Turkey, Orlando becomes a woman, joins a band of gypsies, and returns to England where he (she) must handle the legalities regarding his dukeship because of his new gender.  As a woman, he manages to gain the romantic attentions of famouswriters like Pope, Dryden, and Swift before eventually marrying and having a son.  Some surprises ensue, but let it suffice to say that Orlando is not the only androgynous character in the novel.<br />An underlying, and highly controversial, implication is that every human being harbors aspects of both genders, mainly psychological, but Woolf goes so far as to make them physical in order to press the point.  Although the idea may seem tame now, \\"Orlando\\" may have set a precedent for cross-gender role-playing when it was first published in 1928.  The novel is very much ahead of its time; it has a sort of nonchalant sophistication that characterizes the type of magical realism that was to become a large part of European-influenced literature throughout the rest of the twentieth century.  My admiration for Virginia Woolf only increases with each novel of hers that I read, and \\"Orlando\\" is in my opinion the best yet.
0805047905|5.0|This is my son's favorite book.  The drawings reel him in every time.  We have story time every night before bed and this is the first book that he grabs and also the last book that he grabs.  He is now 14 months and can say each animals name in his own little way.  I strongly urge every parent to get this book.
0385508417|5.0|Loved it! I laughed out loud at the frenzy. The end brought me to tears. I was touched and quite entertained by the novel.<br />Thanks Mr. Grisham!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I don't want to bother wasting about writing why the film was excellent - it was. But to understand it at all, unfortunately you must read the &quot;Philosophy of Time Travel&quot; book on [...] . Otherwise, like &quot;Sheriff Kabany&quot;, you may get entirely the wrong end of the stick with this film. <br />This film is well worth seeing, and if you actually want to understand what the film was about, then read the &quot;Philosophy of Time Travel&quot;, or look at the iMdB forums.
B000068CNX|5.0|I am just a huge fan of Friends, so I totally love this dvd set.  I have every season on dvd so far, and every single one makes me laugh histerically.
0679731377|5.0|Many have said in these reviews that the fragmented nature of this book make it a difficult read.  I found it the opposite...the different settings, tones, styles, and characters in each chapter made the book a dynamic experience, and the way Barnes takes two or three main themes and weaves them so effortlessly throughout all of the chapters is incredible.  I found the book a joy to read, never knowing when a little nugget from a previous chapter would pop up in another chapter/story in some totally unexpected way.  The &quot;history of the world&quot; obviously isn't linear or traditional, but it's a fun exploration of themes, emotions, and trends that Barnes sees as common throughout history.  Great read.
B00009MECF|5.0|This is the most accurate depiction of dope addiction I've seen (drugstore cowboy too).  From sticking a cutoff straw in a bag for a toot in the highschool bathroom or lockerroom, to the sick daydreams, to the fiending, the pure exileration of copping bags, to the allure of the needle.  I saw this movie in 97 and I havent seen it since.  Definitly not a movie you will want to watch over and over.
B000002UAU|1.0|People often offer the opinion that the artwork was the major breakthrough of this album. I agree.  It couldn't have been this music.
B00003XB8K|4.0|Enigma 3 is a master-piece. Pure genious. I have not one word bad to say about this CD. Perhaps, maybe, that it was a tad short. Bit the length of the CD is definitely made up by the superb blend of ambience with the electronica world.<br />Cretu, even though you left the Gregorian chants out (which was a mistake), you have evolved Enigma into a new age of enlightenment. Push the limits and Vive le roi, were great tracks. Cretu's voice enhances, and doesn't hurt the flow of the music.<br />Listen to Enigma: The Screen Behind the Mirror, alone or with a loved one. Well worth getting. A happy Enigma Fan.

B00005QCVY|5.0|It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go. Now before we start breaking out into song, let's focus on what the Christmas holiday means to all of us. For younger children, this is the time to be away from school and enjoy all the wonderful presents they have begged Santa for over the past four to five weeks. For the more adult crowd (at least most of them), Christmas is the time to gather with family and friends, swap stories and memories, and hope they don't get a necktie or socks as a gift. The festive yuletide season is also the time when the greatest films of all time are shown across millions of televisions sets across the country and possibly the world as well. You have your comedies like A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation, the cartoon treasures such as A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and those delightful classics like White Christmas and The Bishop's Wife. But none of these can hold a candle to Frank Capra enduring theatrical triumph, It's a Wonderful Life. Amazingly the feature wasn't considered a Christmas film until its repetitive showings in the 1970's when the copyright on the film went up. Now it is basically considered a near crime for this film not to be seen at least during this festive time of year. Quite amazing to see how a total box office dud can rise over the years to be not only the greatest Christmas film but one of the most enduring classics of all time.<br />The story follows a man who is at the end of his rope and how he discovers that he really has bigger purpose in life then he had originally thought. George Bailey is a good man who has never accomplished the goals he once set for himself as a young boy. Growing up in the little town of Bedford Falls, George dreamed of venturing out into the world and visiting many different and exotic places without a care for anybody else but himself. Unfortunately luck does not seem to be on his side as every opportunity he has to escape the little town ends with him in the same place he has been for all of his life while others get to enjoy the life George wishes he had. Now in charge of his father's loan office, George Bailey faces one of the greatest challenges of his life. Uncle Billy has lost the $8,000 that the loan office carried and Mr. Potter, the richest and stingiest man in town, has issued a warrant for his arrest. George now contemplates taking his own life until his guardian angel shows him the world as if he was never born and it's a more frightening situation then he had ever imagined. The story for It's a Wonderful Life is quite a simple premise and yet it has to be one of the most inspiring and insightful plots in motion picture history. No other film in recent memory can claim it has pulled off the same premise as wonderfully as Capra's classic has.<br />Though there are many memorable performances in It's Wonderful Life, the overall emotional support lies on the performance of only one man, James Stewart. It was once said of director Frank Capra that Stewart was his first and only choice for the role of George Bailey and that shows in his emotionally driven performance in the two hour feature. Jimmy Stewart showcases a wide range of expresses from his frustration when Uncle Billy loses the money, till exasperation when he stands at the bridge contemplating whether to kill himself or not, to his exuberance at discovering he is able to live once again. James Stewart has to be one of the most treasured performers ever to come across the silver screen and no more so then in this film. What makes this feature even more special is the fact that this was the performer's first feature film since coming back from his service in World War II. Jimmy Stewart should be revered not only for his dedication to his profession but to his country as well.<br />Overall, It's a Wonderful Life's message of necessity and good nature of man kind rings no harder in the minds of movie-goers then it does today. Plenty of classic holiday films have come along over the years including such favorites as The Santa Clause, The Grinch, and the recent smash-hit, Elf, but none of them can ever come close to the staying power of Frank Capra's crowning achievement. The truth is that the messages expressed in the film go way beyond the holiday season and can be enjoyed during any time of the year with as great of amount of enthusiasm as if the Christmas spirit was all around. Granted the film has been labeled overly-sentimental but if anything that is more a greater compliment then anything else one can say about one the true treasures in cinematic history.
B00000JLWW|1.0|I have great respect for movies.  Like most of you reading this review,i have whitnessed both timeless classics and the sort that has you reaching for the sick bag.  Unfortunately &quot;Titanic&quot; definately fits into the latter catergory.  Which is a real shame because I appreciate and respect James Cameron as a director - I think he is brilliant, But no matter how hard I have tried I can not bring myself to consider this, a good film.  Its so bad you are actually looking forward to the ship's demise at the hands of the iceberg, for the hope of some excitement!  Jonathan Ross put it best when he said, &quot;It sank..... There, I have just saved you four hours of your life.&quot;  Infact coming to think of it, the mear fact that you are reading this review, tells me you must have thought about parting with your money for this atrocity.  Dont!  You can do better, have some standards, please!  Im sure you have heard countless tales of how this movie is &quot;so amazing.&quot;  Do you know why people think that?  Its certainly not the idea that this is a good film.  Its the fasination of the chemistry (which isnt all that great anyway) between the two protagonists.  Come on!  Dont you get out anymore or something?  All you have to do is walk down the street and you will whitness that kind of &quot;bonding.&quot;  In conclusion &quot;Titanic&quot; is a piece of poor, romantic, trashy, rubbish.  And the fact that this film was awarded with anything othere than a sick bag just proves that the hollywood film critics really wouldn't know a good film if it slapped them round the side of the face.  Should you buy it?  Actually, come to think of it, it is worth buying just to stare and laugh at the cover, then burn it - otherwise, stay well clear.
B00005JLXE|4.0|20th Century Fox has had tremendous success with a previous superhero film, so it was no wonder that they decided to go ahead and start up another franchise. In 2000, X-Men, based on the famous Marvel comic-book superheroes, opened to $54 million and finished with nearly $160 million at the domestic box office. With this success, the trend of superhero films began. Fox has decided to create a film based on another superhero after the tremendous success of Sony's Spider-Man in 2002. Though the character of Daredevil is one of the lesser known comic-book superheroes, Fox is hoping that big names stars like Ben Affleck and rising star Jennifer Garner from ABC's Alias will help bring in a big enough audience to recoup the film's $75 million budget. The studio is also hoping that by placing the film in the month of February, there will be very little competition against the action flick. But will the film version of Daredevil be accepted by the American audience or will the film be blinded by its own hype?<br />The story centers on the life of Matt Murdock. His father, Jack Murdock, is a famous boxer who has fallen from his golden days. One day Matt finds his father robbing a man to make a living for his son and runs from his father. As he runs, Matt gets involved in an accident that robs him of his ability to see. But the chemical that took his sight gave him in exchange a radar-like super sight and heightens the abilities of his other four senses above most normal human beings. Despite his handicap, Matt helps his father rise back to his old form but when his father refuses to take the fall during a fight, he is killed. From that moment, Matt dedicates his life to protecting the innocent and creates the secret identity of Daredevil. Matt's life is complicated enough as a lawyer during the day and Daredevil at night but things become more complex when he meets the beautiful Elektra. As things begin to heat up between Matt and Elektra, the Kingpin has plans for both Elektra and Daredevil as he hires an assassin Bullseye to take care of them both. The story for Daredevil is probably one of the most well-developed comic-book adaptations in quite awhile. It was a wonderful idea to start the film off in the middle of the story then back track to see what events led up to the opening sequence then finish the film off from that moment. It is so rarely done so well in most films today that it was a great delight. The only problem that can be seen with the plot is that some moments can only truly be understood if one was a fan of the comic-book series but those moments are few and aren't of huge importance to the overall effect of the film.<br />The cast for Daredevil is very well put together and most, if not all, seem to work exceedingly well portraying their character within the course of the film. Ben Affleck, who has starred in such action flicks as Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and The Sum of All Fears, is definitely becoming a rising star in Hollywood especially as he seems to be taking more serious roles such as this film. Affleck portrays the character very well and seems to have fun with role as well. Jennifer Garner, who appeared in Catch Me If You Can in December 2002, does a much better job at showing her acting ability on the big screen then the previously mentioned role. Some would prefer that there be more character development with Elektra but outside of that, there really isn't much to complain about. Colin Farrell, who is making appearances in a lot of films throughout 2003, is absolutely amazing as the villain, Bullseye. He does a wonderful job at creating a character that will freak out the audience, which is what his character is supposed to do. Farrell creates a wonderful character that is humorous and frightening at the same time. Despite some criticism, Michael Clark Duncan is great as the Kingpin. It can be said that there could have been someone else better for the role but Duncan, who is usually know for his dramatic roles in such films as The Green Mile, does a delightful job despite that.<br />Overall, Daredevil continues the trend of delightful film adaptations of comic-book superheroes and rises above all its predecessors. The story was fabulously well done and ends in a way that leaves the audience guessing at what happens. The ending should build much anticipation for a Daredevil sequel if there is to be one. With the good there is also the bad. The slow motion techniques used in the fight sequences of the film got annoying after awhile and seemed pretty pointless and unnecessary within points of the film. Another problem with the film was the time length. The feature felt too short and more could have been explained with the course of the film but better to leave some things unanswered for the sequel. In the end, though, those small problems with Daredevil seem trivial. Daredevil is delightful treat and goes beyond the expectancy of most films released during this slow period at the box office.

B00005LOUP|4.0|\\"The more the Grinch thought, \\"I must stop this whole thing!<BR>Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!<BR>I MUST stop this Christmas from coming!<BR>                                                            ... But HOW?\\"<br />Every child, if they were brought up properly that is, has grown up with the short stories created by Dr. Seuss. Stories ranging from The Cat in the Hat to Yertle the Turtle to The Lorax with their delightful creatures and clever situations have captured the imaginations of not only the younger generation but the baby boomers as well. So is it any wonder that Universal Pictures, the studio that gained the rights to the classic tales, rushed two of the famous author's most famous works into production, The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas? The Cat is an easy sell since the concept has never been put on film but The Grinch is a bigger challenge. The challenge the live action feature faces is the 1966 television cartoon classic, which has become a staple of the Christmas holiday in the United States, and therefore comparisons between the two would be highly criticized among fans. Will the teaming of rising director Ron Howard and famous comedian Jim Carrey change all perspectives on the holiday treat? Only one thing can truly be said: Universal executives clearly have guts for at least attempting this.<br />The story focuses on the magical city of Whoville and the hermit-like citizen who plans to ruin the holiday rituals they care so much about. Everyone in the city of Whoville loved celebrating the holidays but one they loved the most was Christmas. All the houses are covered with lights, the streets are lined with decorations, and the stores are flooded with Whos wanting gifts for their loved ones. It seems everyone is filled with the Christmas spirit except for The Grinch. Living up on Mount Crumpit, The Grinch has despised the citizens of Whoville and their \\"Whobilation\\" and decides upon a plan to steal Christmas. Disguised as Old Saint Nick, he will go down into the city, take away all the gifts and decorations, and dump them on Mount Crumpit. But there is one little girl who believes The Grinch does have a good heart and hopes to change his ways before it is too late. The story for The Grinch works out amazingly despite the lack of material from the book from which the film is based. Considering the short story doesn't go into the details of The Grinch or any other characters presented, it was quite ingenious for Howard and company to develop the back story that they did. If they hadn't, the feature would have been a lot shorter then it was and wouldn't have been worth presenting on screen.<br />The cast for this take on a classic Seuss tale is relatively small, which is to be expected, but those that do have significant roles do a wonderful job at presenting amusing characters that may or may not have been seen in the Christmas legend. Though Jim Carrey may not have been the most obvious choice to play the title character, it has to be said that Ron Howard made an excellent decision after what has been seen on screen. Carrey, who had fallen from his comedic status thanks in part to the disaster known as The Cable Guy, has brought himself back to the mainstream audience with delightful and disguising character. Everything he does comes off with such comedic timing that one forgets about anybody else who could have filled the role. Taylor Momsen is absolutely adorable as Little Cindy Lou-Who and fits the character captured the story perfectly. At times she does seem a little too cute for her own good but that is a slight squabble compared to the rest of her performance. Her reactions come off perfectly with Carrey's exuberant performance. And Anthony Hopkins gives a stirring performance narrating portions of the film. At times, he slips into his Hannibal Lecter-like creepy voice but only in the appropriate areas. Obviously the younger audience will not get the slight reference to the thriller but adults will get a rise out of it.<br />Overall, Howard's version of The Grinch exceeds even the cartoon classic in its entertainment value but will it be an enduring classic? Not entirely. This film could have been an absolute disaster if Carrey had not been cast as The Grinch and Howard had not helming the project but luckily everything worked out for the project. As entertaining as the feature is, not everything works for it. The song sung by Taylor Momsen near the beginning could have been easily cut since it had really no reason to be placed in the film in the first place. Another problem was the kind of humor that was used. Sure, a butt joke here and there would be entertaining and funny but at times the film goes a little too far and some of the gross-out-humor gets annoying and just plain disgusting for the age group that this film is aimed at. A younger audience shouldn't be prevented from watching this but parents should take some caution for some scenes that the younger children will probably question about. Outside of those small problems, How the Grinch Stole Christmas proves to be an enduring holiday tale once again that doesn't fail to catch the imagination of the public, no matter what age they are.

B00003CXB4|5.0|\\"The time is out of joint; O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!\\"<br />William Shakespeare's most famous and most highly regarded play, Hamlet, is extremely difficult to pull off, not only on stage but on the big screen as well. Some have tried with success (Kenneth Branagh, 1996) while others are just completely disastrous in their attempts and miss the total meaning of the tragedy (Mel Gibson, 1991). Education is of high importance and, as adults, we try virtuously to teach our children the classics at a younger age then we learned them. But in the case of Hamlet, could such a film, aimed at children, pull it off without overwhelming its core audience with too much emotion and violence? In a way, The Lion King succeeds but where it fails in this attempt, it scores bonus points for its originality and sheer escapism. It is quite amazing the film even made it to completion considering the numerous re-writes and complications but, some how, this small animated film has been able to pounce its way into our hearts for more reasons then ever thought possible.<br />The story centers on a young lion cub as he journeys to find himself on his way to becoming king. Simba has it made easy. His father, Mufasa, is king of the Pride lands and he is next in line to the throne. Everyone gives him plenty of attention, maybe a little too much for his taste, but, in general, the royal subjects feel he will follow in his father's footsteps. But not everyone is happy about this including Mufasa's shady brother, Scar, who believes he should be king. Scar soon sets out on a plan to kill Mufasa, frame Simba for the murder and take control of Pride Rock. Everything goes according to plan until Simba returns years later to dethrone him and take his place as the rightful king. The story for The Lion King is amazingly well done and borrows several memorable scenes from William Shakespeare's Hamlet including the ghost of Hamlet's father saying \\"Remember\\". And despite, in the end, being significantly different from the famous tragedy, The Lion King manages to be extremely entertaining by making us laugh and cry; both at the same time in some instances.<br />Who ever thought a more wonderful cast could be put together without ever seeing the actions and reactions of the actors themselves? Or maybe, looking at the well illustrated animals up on the screen, we are. James Earl Jones's booming voice feels all too natural with the character of Mufasa and brings much dramatic emphasis to the character during the scene where he talks to Simba as a ghost. Jeremy Irons is decisively chilling as the villain, Scar, and gives a voice performance of an accomplished veteran actor. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are a magnificent duo as the comic relief of the film, Timon and Pumbaa. Quite amazingly the two are able to work off each other so well that the comic talent is seamless. Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick take on the same role but obviously in different periods in the character's life. But despite that fact, they both do an amazing job with each showcasing plenty of emotion in their voices.<br />Overall, The Lion King is Disney's and traditional animation's most magnificent triumph that has yet to be surpassed in quality and overall satisfaction. The wonderful work completed in The Little Mermaid, Beauty &amp; the Beast, and Aladdin has all led to the spectacular and beautiful art work of this film. The hand drawn animals are just absolutely amazing and Disney Animation's best work that, unfortunately, will never be surpassed. There are few things to pick at about Disney's The Lion King but they are evident in certain areas of the film. Such would include the, at times, all too cuteness of the characters as well as the short time length. Based on what was showcased in the film, it felt like there could have been a lot more but that is actually more of a complement then a complaint. With traditional animation on the way out, as it wouldappear, The Lion King is a saddening example of what this genre had achieved and how high it could have gone had computer animation not become the new medium.

B00005JM4Z|2.0|When the original The Fast and the Furious opened in theaters back in 2001, it looked to be just another action flick to keep teenagers happy at the movies until the next big hit entered the multiplexes. But The Fast and the Furious became a much bigger then anybody expected, especially its distributor, Universal Pictures. The original film, which cost only $38 million for the studio, ended its run in theaters with over $110 million. The surprise hit of the summer became an even bigger surprise on DVD. The film became one of the largest selling DVDs in the year it was released. So with these results in hand, it was a no brainer for Universal to make a follow up. Unfortunately things didn't go the way Universal would have liked it. Rising-star Vin Diesel, who got his break out role in the original The Fast and the Furious, wanted a much bigger paycheck then Universal was willing to pay. So in the end, he ended up dropping out of the project. After Diesel dropped out, Rob Cohen, director of The Fast and the Furious, also dropped out of the sequel. But since Universal still had Paul Walker, the other star of the original, they decided to go on with the sequel without them. Will the risk pay off for Universal or will this high-octane thrill ride run out of gas?<br />The story goes that street racing is a big thing in the city of Miami. Watching tricked out cars race up and down the street and seeing who crashes and who crosses the finish line is a huge thrill with the people of Southern Florida. One of the big stars of the street racing scene is Brian O'Conner, who last time we saw him was racing out in Los Angles with Vin Diesel as an undercover cop. But since he let the criminal go, he was forced to leave the police department. When he is caught by the police, he is recruited by them to track down a cruel Miami import/export dealer. When O'Conner doesn't like the partner the police team him up with, he recruits an old friend, Roman Pearce, to help him track down the dealer so they can get their records cleaned. The story for 2 Fast 2 Furious is one of the most ridiculous ones pulled out of a movie. It is certainly as worse or even more horrible then the one for the original film. Some elements are ridiculous crafted into the film and some of the chases scenes are set up in a way that are too predictable. The absence of director Rob Cohen is clearly obvious with the sequel. Though the original wasn't a movie masterpiece, Cohen had at least some consistency. This film lacks that very dearly.<br />The characters of 2 Fast 2 Furious are, for the most part, just stereotypes. The rest that are not, don't do a great job acting through this tired script. Paul Walker, who didn't receive too many fabulous comments about his acting, or lack there of, in the original film, doesn't do much better in the follow up but one can see improvement. The only one in the cast that shows some sign of rising acting talent is Tyrese Gibson, who plays O'Conner's ex-con buddy, Roman Pearce. Tyrese brings a lot of well needed humor is this film that is, for the most part, fairly dry. Most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning. Devon Aoki who plays Suki in the film isn't given much outside of the look badass and hot at the same time argument. She has no important lines and really doesn't do much with her role in the first place. She is basically there just for show. Same goes for Eva Mendes, though her character obviously places a more important role. But on a technical note, her character really doesn't do too much. The rest of the cast, like it was said before, isn't worth mentioning.<br />Overall, 2 Fast 2 Furious is not much of an improvement from the original but did we really expect it to be? Without the badass charm of Vin Diesel and the consistency of Rob Cohen at the helm, the project suffers greatly. The story is tired, dry and too predictable as the film progresses. For what was accomplished in the film, if anything at all, the film could have been wrapped up much quicker then the two hours it ran in. Nothing really stands out to take of big note within the film outside of the rising acting power of Tyrese Gibson. The film focuses too much on the scantily clad babes and the adrenaline powered cars to hear how ridiculous the script actually sounds. When they finish talking their \\"street lingo\\", the lines they pop out sound cheesy and dry. But one does have to admit that with all the problems the film suffers from, the racing scenes are very well done. The special effects, as impressive as they are, still look pretty fake, which is pretty obvious. The charm of the original, if that was possible for some, was the realistic racing scenes. Most of those in the sequel are done on computer with only the actors placed in motionless cars against a blue screen in order to add the CGI later on. This was possibly the biggest disappointment of the film with nothing else expected from the sequel. The month of June looks bad enough with four horrible duds opening up next weekend but with a start like 2 Fast 2 Furious, there is only one thing to say: Disney and Pixar should make a real killing with Finding Nemo this month.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only discovered this series this fall when it first appeared on Space channel, here in Canada. To my dismay, the show had been cancelled months ago! I've been frantically looking for any episodes I can get a hold of since. This series re-invigorated my love for sci-fi which dropped somewhat after the end of Star Trek Deep Space Nine and Voyager.  I guess a part of me still hopes that the series starts up again (not just the big screen movie that is coming in 2005). Definitely a good buy for any sci-fi fan like me - good actors, plot, writing, and humor mixed in.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|The summer season is once again upon us at the box office and the major movie studios have a hell of a one planned this year. Though it had been typically taboo to open a major tentpole feature prior to the four-day Memorial Day weekend, times have changed with The Mummy, Gladiator, and The Mummy Returns posting numbers in the realm of $40 - $70 million the first weekend of May. That weekend officially became the new starting point for the summer season when Spider-Man blew the competition away with its $114.5 million opening weekend take in 2002. The summer season once again kicks off with a comic-book adaptation, this year with X2: X-Men United, the highly anticipated sequel to the 2000 original. The comic-book adaptation genre has re-emerged in the past year or two to become the latest rage now amongst the major movie studios, all of which hoping to come away with an exciting, and financially successful, new franchise in their hands. With Daredevil, which opened earlier this year, proving to be a modest success at the box office, one would think that X2 would have no problems but then that person would be slightly off base. After its opening weekend, the original X-Men film slowed down significantly but not so much so that it failed to be successful. Could that be the same with this film? With an expanded production budget and an enormous marketing campaign, X2 will definitely need a good running start if it were to be as successful or more so then its predecessor.<br />The story picks up right where the original X-Men film left off with Magneto confined in prison and Professor Xavier, along with his team of mutants, fighting to protect both human and mutant kind alike from outside forces that threaten them. The war between men and mutants, which had been discussed heavily in the original film, seems to be drawing closer to actualization as moves made by certain individuals have created conflicts that will become of greater concern to everyone as time progresses.The latest confrontation comes in the form of the attempted assassination of the president by an unknown mutant assailant, which gives William Stryker ample opportunity to enact a special mission to infiltrate Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted. Though he manages to capture several of the students within the children, he isn?t interested only in them but rather he has his sights set on all the mutants on the planet. The X-Men must now unite forces with Magneto?s rebel band of mutants to fight for their share of the world and to prevent the destruction of all mutant kind. The story for X2: X-Men United is exceptionally well done and exemplifies vast improvement from the original film which divulged too much into character development and concentrated less on action sequences. The only problem is that this film suffers from the same problem that plagued Daredevil earlier this year in that it contains several story elements that would not be as easily understood except by devoted comic-book fanatics.<br />Most cast members from the original X-Men film have returned for the highly anticipated sequel and they exhibit an attitude in their recurring roles of comfortability, which makes their performances all the more enjoyable. There is no doubt in anyone?s mind that Hugh Jackman is Wolverine ? plain and simple. He is able to present such a roguish and high octane persona on screen that it is almost eerie how he is able to successful slip into the role so easily. Patrick Stewart once again presents a magnificent performance as Professor Charles Xavier, as he had in the original film. Despite not being featured as much as before, Stewart still plays an essential part in the whole story. Ian McKellen gives an absolutely chilling performance as Magneto. He plays out the role so well that you might actually believe he is that character much like he did with the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings series. Out of all the new additions to the stellar cast, Alan Cumming is quite possibly the biggest highlight in the role of Nightcrawler. Cumming successfully provides a character full of emotion, which was a pleasant surprising considering many had expected the character to be for mere special effects purposes rather then the more in-depth approach that was given.<br />Overall, X2: X-Men United exceeds all expectations not only by successfully kicking off the summer with an exuberant bang but by vastly surpassing its modestly disappointing predecessor. Although the film as a whole was nearly perfect, there were some minor things to pick at. First off, there were several members of the cast that were pointlessly added to the film, most notably Kelly Hu?s Lady Deathstrike. She never really did anything for the film except the final fight sequence with Logan but other then that there was nothing for her to do. There are rumors that she may have an expanded role in the third installment but when it comes to this film, she could have easily been left out or cut back at least. Cyclops, who appeared briefly in the beginning and the end of the film, was another character that seemed to have been pointlessly added to the feature. Secondly, it would have behooved Bryan Singer to have eliminated an action sequence or two as there to have been too many of them strung together, despite their choreography being nearly perfect. And lastly, the ending, though magnificently done, will confuse many movie-goers not familiar with either the comic book or cartoon series. But perhaps a better explanation will be given when X3 hits theaters in 2006. X2 gives an exhilarating kick-off to the new summer season and sets the bar pretty high for all those to follow.
006016848X|5.0|I had to write when I saw the number of angry frustrated reviewers. So many people expecting a book on such a general broad topic not to generalize. <BR>I'm a woman, and let me just say woman to woman, if you are looking for a book to solve all your problems or totally help you understand the male mind, or totally give you all the flaws of men and all the wonderful things of women, (to either demonize or glorify either gender) then you will hate this book because your expectations are insane.<BR>If you want a book that can help you learn to control or manipulate the opposite sex, or make you feel you are always right and validate you- again stay away!!<BR>Second off, if you are against the very possibility that men and women can have actual gender differences that we are born with (not learned) you will also hate this book. I doubt a feminist would like this book- hence all the \\"misogynist\\" name calling flung at Mr.Gray. Don't even bother to pick it up if you think we are all the same we just learn roles. This book is for those that have already caught on to the fact that we are different in a \\"general\\" way.<BR>Also- If you are fearful of men or women- or have been deeply hurt to start with- you might HATE this book.<BR>Third, if you have someone in your life who is frustrating and manipulative or is doing really bad things, don't expect this book to be the one to point all that out about your opposite sex mate or to help you solve it.<br />What this book does give is very practical information on gender differences that is not super elaborate. After being married for a few years it was clear to me that there were some basic things I didn't \\"get\\" about men, and ways we were miscommunicating. I got this book and I learned so much helpful things that are very simple and basic. Years after reading this book I still go back to it. It emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of different genders. It shared with me things that I never knew that when I checked out for myself proved to be very accurate. Yes it is simplistic, this is-again not some deep therapy- \\"I'll explain every detail to you\\" book, but for a simple basic eye opening book-- I loved it. I hope his other books prove just as helpful/insightful as this one. I will give it to my daughter before she ever gets started dating. It helped me so much in my relationship to speak my husbands language and for him to speak mine.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Liked the original, both story and effects.  The effects have been copied since by many movies and were good in this one.  But since for the 2nd and 3rd movies effects weren't going to be groundbreaking, the story had to be good.  It wasn't.  More confusion, contradictions and giant gaffes of incontinuity -- poorly edited, bad screenplay and just plain boring!
B000056VJ7|5.0|1977's \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" is a grand masterpiece of theatrical rock bombast. In a year when punk and disco were in heavy rotation, this album astounded listeners with its intricate blend of hard rock, 1950's pop, and irresistable Broadway melodies. Composer Jim Steinman successfully made this musical formula popular in mainstream America, paving the way for symphonic bands like Dio, Blind Guardian, Symphony X, and Rhapsody. Singer Meatloaf, meanwhile, is the Pavarotti of rock & roll! Weighing over 300 pounds and flashing a tuxedo and a ruffled cravat, this Texas underdog shattered the physical mold of the record industry. With an almost operatic singing voice and an acting background to match, Meatloaf adds to Steinman's lyrics a beautiful melodrama that no one else can imitate.  The 9-minute-long \\"Bat Out of Hell,\\" with its squealing metal guitars and intense piano keys, is meant te be sung from the perspective of a leather-clad vampire. \\"Hot Summer Night\\" and the jazzy \\"All Revved Up\\" are bold and balsy pop tunes about high school romance. \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" is a contemporary psalm that's given a subtle hint of gospel; the background's violin strings and horns create an aura that drifts along the wind like snowflakes. \\"Two Out of 3 Ain't Bad\\" is a unique acoustic ballad about a broken relationship. \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\" is the quintessential duet; the vocals sung by Meatloaf and Ellen Foley (not to mention the play-by-play by Yankee star Phil Rizzuto) incorporate hysterical sexual overtones.  All I can say in the end is that \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" MUST be included in one's own collection. If you are interested in the 1970's, I recommend you purchase this CD, along with Alice Cooper's \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" and Kiss's \\"Alive!\\"
B00005JM02|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite movies of all time i love it so much. it is the best. you u dont buy it you are a sucker and a loser too. this movie rocks the socks off every dvd evrknown to man kind.this movie will have you laughing so hard you might die of it.the movie could have been better if it was longer but other wise it would be more perfect.this movie is so genis the people who made must have invented the world. they have got to be god but grater than god but there is no other greater sourse.the movie is funnier than funny.hilarious. super hilarious you know great funny. great humor.doria is so funny she is so great.
B00008EY9G|4.0|This movie for me, was going nowhere, but like many thrillers today I just had to be patient and see where all this blood and screams were leading to. It all paid off in a excellent conclusion. I never expected this to be a physcotic thriller but it was and it all took place in a guys mind as he was in real life one-by-one killing each of his different personalities. It played itself well in his mind as a group of strangers met at a hotel acciendently and seemed to connect through some strange way as each person was mysteriously dropping down and dying by an unknown killer. It mangled itself in confusion and wonder but it all wrapped back up again when questions were answered and you though, wow. The reason I gave this 4 stars was the very ending of the movie when you found out the real killer. One of the man's personalities and he forms into the killer. It was strangled and twisted but still I was left very entertained and very thought consumed.
B000002LR6|4.0|I noticed a moajority of these tracks were quite repetetive. The first track being 3 minutes of the pure same beat. It's a good beat. but they pick about 4 seconds of line and repeat it.<br />Second... this album is really really short. each song being like 2-3 minutes long.<br />But one thing. the guy on Psalm 69 sounds like me in 8th grade. That was weird
B00005JMGL|5.0|I've never read the story of Peter Pan.  I've seen the Disney version, of course, and we even did the play when I was in elementary school.  It always seemed like a \\"boy story\\" to me, full of adventure but not substance.  The main characters were Peter Pan and Hook.<br />Then last week my friends dragged me out to see this movie.  Wow!  This story is really about Wendy!  How cool!<br />If you've only seen the Disney version, well, like so many other powerful stories, they watered it down and removed most of the power.  This is a story about that shock time in a girl's life, when you are just becoming a woman. And in the late 19th century, that is likely to mean the end of your freedom to be who you really are... especially if you are an active, imaginative girl like Wendy.<br />I also think this movie is good for the Peter Pans among us... all those guys who don't want to grow up, but don't understand why their girlfriends keep leaving them.  If they can understand why Wendy can't stay in Neverland, maybe they might understand why THEY need to grow up in order to be with grown-up girls.<br />This movie is NOT good for very small children.  I think it's going to be a little scary for the under-7 set, especially those little kids who can't seem to deal with ANY darkness in their fiction.  Hook is menacing in couple of ways I think they'll find both incomprehensible and disturbing.<br />Good movie.  See it.  Bring your 10 year old (and up) daughters.  Now I think I'll go and read the book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've just scanned through the 313 (as of the start of this posting) reviews of the Firefly DVD series.  By my count there were but 8 negative reviews (2 or less stars) and 2 middling (3 stars.)  Over 96% of the reviewers here enjoyed the series enough to rate it, overwhelmingly, 5 stars.  <br />Also, at the start of this review, the DVD is #13 on Amazon's current \\"Top Sellers\\" list.  It's moved up 5 slots in as many hours.  Clearly, this is an excellent series.  Which begs the question: Why the *heck* did Fox cancel it?!  I mean, what the crap were they thinking, gorramit!  Those ruttin' stuffed suits  have their heads jammed so far up their fouth points of contact that they can't understand how lack of advertisement, constant preemption, episode shuffling and general abuse and neglect of even the *best* series on television (for which I believe Firefly is a definite contender) will *obviously* result in low viewership.<br />!                        !                     !<br />As you can tell, I liked this show, but to give you some perspective I'll tell you that I am a definite Sci-Fi fan, but I'm very demanding.  I won't watch any piece of luh-suh with laser guns in it for very long unless it's got good acting, a decent plot line and just the right amount of special effects.  For instance, I didn't get into B5 (much to my chagrin) because I felt that the acting in the first episode was very stilted and that there was a lack of chemistry amongst the players.  (I know, I missed the boat on that one.)<br />Also, I'm not a Joss Whedon fan (well I am *now*.)  I'd seen a few episodes of Buffy and Angel, and liked 'em well enough, but not so much that I'd set aside time to watch them.  Firefly would have been set in stone on my schedule (had they kept it at a regular time.  Had they kept it.)  This show had it all, great acting and chemistry.  It's hard to believe that the cast hadn't already been working together for years.  Excellent writing and developing story.  Oneof my peeves with SciFi series is that they tend to string you along (i.e. Voyager) and just when you think something wonderful or dreadful has happened, at the end of the episode, they're right back where they started - nothing changes.  From the few episodes I'd seen of Firefly, and having listened to commentary and interviews, I *know* that would not be the case.  *This* story would have evolved.  It also had great special effects that weren't overstated.  The focus of this series was the characters, not explosions and laser blasts in space.  Also, I must say that I was initially very skeptical of the Space/Western fusion, but Whedon didn't just pull it off, he made a new genre in my opinion.  <br />If you want quality TV, buy this DVD Set.  I'm hoping beyond reason that it gets put back on the air.  Heck, I'd buy cable again if it did.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|So the story behind this CD is that the Beatles were making an album that was true to their Rock N Roll roots.  This was to be a pure album with no fanfare or hoopla; they were just going to &quot;Let It Be&quot;.  In making this album, however, the Beatles nearly killed each other, thus it was never released as it was meant to be.  This new release is the album that was originally meant to be.  Although I feel &quot;Let It Be Naked&quot; is done very well, it is hit or miss with all of us Beatles fans.  After thirty plus years of listening to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, it is understandable that many find it difficult to compare this one with that.  In my opinion, however, some of the songs in this album sound incredible when not weighed down.  Across the Universe, for one, is just simple Lennon chord strokes with an Unplugged feel to it.  Let It Be and the Long and Winding Road finally does Paul justice without all the background fanfare.  If you like unplugged and true heart and soul albums, you're sure to like this one.<br />On a side note, this really should have been released with the DVD that is to be later released.  Seeing the film before listening to the album would have created a much more nostalgic experience for all Beatles fans to help us all understand why &quot;Let It Be&quot; was never made as it should have been.<br />Hope this helps your decision . . . .
B00005JM02|3.0|For me the movie did not match up to monsters inc. in terms of overall content.  I think it is visually amazing.  However, the dialog and overall plot of the film was not as entertaining.  The first time my 2 year old watched it she became frightened by the sharks and the fish with the \\"light\\" that attempted to attack nemo's dad and dory.  She requested that we turn it off.  You may want to wait a little later to introduce this film.
B00005JM20|4.0|I took my kids, ages 12, 10, and 8, and got my money's worth just watching them laugh hysterically.  It is a very cute movie and innocent (potty jokes aside)--won't have to mute or fast forward this one to watch it with the kids like so many other movies.  Rowan Atkinson's slapstick is a real pleasure, and I swear the man's face is made of rubber!  I appreciate something I can show to my 8 year old and my 75 year old mom at the same time--and so completely enjoy it myself!
B000089RVX|5.0|I do believe this is one of the best albums of 2003.  The singer actually has a great voice and the sound is great.  The music has an intelligent twist (what else would you expect with a band named Evanescence  -- that's a high dollar word).<BR>This CD is worth buying.
B0000931OG|5.0|Blur return with one of their best album,an most evolutionary,and this for a band that never did like the conventions and molds of the &quot;Britpop&quot; genre. though Graham Coxon,one of the founding members and perhaps next to Peter Buck the most underated guitarist of the last 20 years,is gone for the mix(something tells me he'll return though within the next two or three albums,I don't think he'll be gone from the band fdor too long),Damon Albarn picked the guitar,is synthsizer,and a sampler,and he and the 2 remaining members of his band of bandits created a roaming,roving exploration of Albarn's tastes and styles. Oddly devoid of the power-pop signatures of songs like &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;,&quot;Charmless Man&quot;,and &quot;Country House&quot; and the bluesy and poppy signature ballds like &quot;Coffe and TV&quot;(which features some of Graham's absolute most brilliant guitar work,on acoustic and the 2 amazing electric solos),&quot;End of the Century&quot;,and &quot;For Tommorow&quot;,it is even greater now without those things,no matter how great they are. Albarn still can bring the rock,with the synth-punk &quot;Crazy Beat&quot; and and the all out punk of &quot;We got a File on You&quot;,which take you back to Gorillaz's pop-punk sounds on several of their songs,and the memorable,though total unintellegable &quot;Punk&quot; and Blur's &quot;Beetlebum&quot; and &quot;Song 2&quot;. But most of the album is spent in classical-format ballads simliar to &quot;The Universal&quot;,only without Graham's classy and glossy guitar riffs and just straight piano work,and exploring world-beat and world-jazz music a la` Sting's solo career. The funky,jazzy,beat laden rap of &quot;Brothers and Sister&quot; sticks out like a sore thumb,and the sparse,drum heavy world-jazz ballad &quot;Out of Time&quot;,probably the most potent and poinant song on the whole album,is lyrically and musically a masterpeice. The songwriting is still in classical Albarn style not really inyour face but highly intellegent when you get it,kinda reminiscent of Thom Yorke. It's a song that as I translate is about how people are so usy anymore they fail to see the world around them until their time gets small and it's too late to enjoy it..it also sounds like a great breakup song. And Albarn shows that he has musical abilities outside the realms of keyboards,synths,and samples buy pulling out a memorably and hummably hollowbody semi-acoustic solo that rings and jangles and gets lodged in your brain,arguably the best pop guitar solo all year.<br />Damon's clear,thick accent still shines brilliantly as he bounces from rock,to jazz,to electronic\beat music like the opening track &quot;Ambulance&quot;,and classical piano ballads like Battery in your Leg(the only track on the album to have Graham on it,who plays a really kinked up guitar the likes of whgich you've probably never heard) and the two &quot;Song&quot; songs. And the entire thing makes you think about the musical landscape of the world,the lyrics,Albarn's state of mind when recording this thing,and where not only Blur and Britpop music can go from here,but the musical scenary as a whole. Simply great album,and if I have to wait 4 more years to get another one,I hope it's worth it just as much.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I don't understant these negative reviews I've been seeing on this product!<br /> &quot;Voyageur&quot; is an absolutely amazing experience and is by far their greatest album since their debut album from many years ago. In a lot of ways, Cretu made a very smart move by veering away from their trademark Gregorian chants and into a much more ethnic sound with some ambient techno-dance sounds in the arena of Eurodance.<br /> The title track is a blissful experience with tight beats and mystifying ambient sounds. You will find yourself bobbing to the strong rhythm. The best song on here is the closing track &quot;Following The Sun&quot;. This is a very powerful and edgy song that reminds me a lot of &quot;Return To Innocence&quot; with the production styles of &quot;Silence Must Be Heard&quot;.<br /> &quot;Voyageur&quot; is a spectacular album and is a brilliant achievement in taking on a totally new style while maintaining Enigma's personality. I am not dissapointed one bit with this album.<br /> The album packaging is a bit odd, having a bizarre booklet shaped in a circular way, in the round case below where the CD itself would go when put away. The front cover has really cool artwork painting but there's no way to replace it should the CD cover break for any reason so I can't say it's the best packaging idea but it's at least original in style.<br /> &quot;Voyageur&quot; is a must-own and tell these negative reviewers to shove it!!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Just as with the sound tracks to Fellowship and Towers this one is not something I can use while working since it demands concentrated listening with the intensity of the score. I can use it while driving since that doesn't seem to cause any interference in my driving (see \\"The New Brain\\" on the relationship between using music versus audio books while driving!) I love the music but have to listen to less intense things to get work done. So far for me the Harry Potter soundtracks - or actually anything by Williams is great for that.
B00005JMGL|3.0|\\"Peter Pan\\" is a beautifully done movie. The effects, first of all, are amazing, and very tasteful. Director P.J. Hogan could have opted for gosh-wow edge of your seat exsplosive special effects throughout the film, but instead opted for effects that were still breathtaking, but just a little more subtle, and this gives the movie a graceful, seamless look to it.  <br />The characters have all been very well cast, from Wendy (Rachael Hurd-Wood, who acts with surprising maturity for being so young) to Peter (Jeremy Sumpter, who stays very much in character the whole film). But the most remarkable character is Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs). <br />Isaacs' Hook shows us a completely different side of a character who many of us previously thought was totally evil. While Peter and Tink get on the audience's nerves, Hook gives us a layered portrait of a villain who really wouldn't be all that bad if someone just gave him a chance. In him, we see a tortured, embittered soul, who is constantly conniving and plotting Pan's demise. The film shows us two reasons for this, giving the character a nice bit of depth that was not previously there. Reason one: Pan cut off his hand and fed it to a crocodile. Reason two: Hook is lonely. He has nobody who cares about him whatsoever. Pan not only has the Lost Boys, but he has brought along Wendy Darling, a teller of tales, and her two brothers (adorably played by Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell). In fact, Hook is such a fascinating character that when Pan and his sidekick Tinkerbell (Ludivine Sagnier, being more annoying than I thought was possible even by fairy standards)come in to save the day, you feel like they're ruining the fun. Isaacs' Hook had me so impressed that I was secretly rooting for the bad guy to win. <br />Other notable performances: The Lost Boys, and even a few of the pirates, provide several funny moments. Slightly(Theodore Chester) probably gives some of the best lines of all, and John(Newell) and Michael(Popplewell) also have several funny scenes.<br />\\"Peter Pan\\" is an artful, tasteful movie, and is certainly worth a look for these reasons alone, but unfortunately, when good finally triumphs over evil, you leave the theater wondering if there couldn't have been some compromise between the two forces.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Character development, building stress of the conflict, all of this is done to perfection in TTT.
0156027321|5.0|if you want to read a book that will change your view on life... read this!
0553812173|5.0|&quot;Mane of Chaos...Anomander Rake. Lord of the black-skinned Tiste Andii...who has looked down on a hundred thousand winters, Who has tasted the blood of dragons, who leads the last of his kind, seated in the Throne of Sorrow and a kingdom tragic and fey...a kingdom with no land to call its own.&quot; - Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon<br />So Steven Erikson introduces one of his major characters. This series is quite simply outstanding, grandiose, magnificent - the word epic is often used as a cliche but if ever a series is worthy of being called that, this is it. It's staggering in its scope.<br />Erikson's narrative style is to throw you in the thick of the action with minimal background information. This can be quite disconcerting when starting this book - you just don't, and won't, know what the hell's going on. You won't understand how magic works, what a Warren is, where the Malazan empire actually is and what the hell is a Tiste Andii anyway?? <br />It'll be like that for the first hundred pages or so. Keep up or be left behind. You'll find yourself rereading various passages, trying to glean some tiny seed of understanding. It can be pretty frustrating, not knowing a damn thing about anything. But Erikson gives you enough teasing glimpses of quality under the survace for you to feel that understanding is just around the corner if you keep perservering with it, even if you don't initially understand what's going on - Erikson's world is incredibly rich in detail and history, and this is slowly revealed as you get further into the book. <br />And the more this world - and the storyline set in this world - is revealed the more and more impossible it gets to put the book down. The originality is quite amazing, and it's a MAJOR rush when you start to piece things together. Everything starts to fall into place. It's called approaching comprehension - and it creeps up on you, till you get to the last page of the book and realise that you can't wait to go backto the bookstore to get the second in the series, Deadhouse Gates, just so that you can find out more about this world and the people who live in it. Then when you finish that you'll want to get the third, Memories of Ice. And the fourth, House of Chains. And the fifth, Midnight Tides. And so on and so on...and the best thing? It gets better and better and better as you get deeper into the series - if ever there's a world and a series to lose yourself in, it's this one. Not only that, the rereadability quality of this series is amazing - better than anything else I've read before. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Vampires rocked.  I read some of the reviews.   I see so many people complaining how \\"weak\\" the vampires were.  Look at Viktor, look how strong he was.  He fought with the werewolf towards the end then stabbed him with his sword.  People say there was no blood drinking.  Twice you see blood going into Viktor, once to awake him and once to regain his physical appearance.  I can't wait for the sequels.  Great movie!!!
B00005LLK8|4.0|Jamie Bell's acting talent is quite obvious in this debut.  My only problems with this film are that the director seems to try too hard to prove there is no connection between being a ballet dancer and being gay (true enough), and that the heroine, the ballet instructor, is nowhere to be seen in Billy's moment of triumph.<br />I couldn't have understood the dialogues without the aid of closed caption.
B00000JLWW|1.0|This is one of the most appallingly bad big-budget Hollywood films of the decade. The film leaves no trite cliche un-used. For something worthwhile along the same (White Star) line, I suggest picking up a copy of 1958's A Night To Remember (Criterion Collection). Fact beats pedestrian fiction every time.
0517201658|2.0|Meant to be an elegant, thrilling, enthralling story that would span the lives of a family over three generations, &quot;The Thornbirds&quot; begins in in 1915. The Clearys are living a harsh life in New Zealand until their fortunes are changed when a wealthy relative in Australia decides that they are to inherit part of her prosperous farm. When the family travels to Australia, they meet Father Ralph, a stunningly handsome and intriguingly mysterious priest who lives near their farm. Maggie, the only Cleary daughter, falls deeply in love with Father Ralph. He longs to return this love, but as a priest, cannot. This complicated love is the basic theme of the book; the many troubling issues that plague Maggie and the rest of her family are interwoven as well.<br />In some ways, it's ironic that this book just didn't do it for me. &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of my favorite books, and to many people, &quot;The Thornbirds&quot; is a similar type of book. Both novels are long-winded, elaborate sagas, each filled what are supposed to be intriguing and unusual characters and grand settings. But most of these criteria are exactly what I felt was wrong wtih &quot;The Thornbirds.&quot; The long descriptions (there was one description simply of Australian wildlife was FOUR pages long) were for the most part ineffective here. Occasionally, when one was to introduce a character, or explain someone's psyche, these long descriptions were necessary. But more often, they were just a pain. I often found myself bored by the profusion of information, and felt that the author was &quot;describing&quot; just because she enjoyed doing it.<br />In addition to simply boring passages, the whole book felt very &quot;uneven.&quot; In &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; each chapter seems exciting and the book flies by. In this novel, there were there were entire parts (the book is arranged in sections) that were tiresome descriptions of everyday life. I will say that McCullough describes love scenes superbly, but reading 704 pages for a few fast-paced passages, a couple of interesting psychological revelations, and little bit of hot romance does not seem like a good trade-off.<br />Finally, the characters just don't inspire. To use the same comparison, Scarlett O'Hara of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is everything a character should. Cliche yet fresh, goddess-like yet human, harsh yet vulnerable, and supremely unpredictable and unconventional, she was always worth reading about. Yet in this book, the characters seem kind of distant. Father Ralph and Maggie don't jump off the pages, they just &quot;stay there.&quot; This might be becuase they aren't very inspiring-they both stay in pretty much the same place (both mentally and physically) and wither with love for each other for their entire lives.<br />I know I'm literally one of millions of people to take this view of &quot;The Thorn Birds,&quot; but it's really what I think. Dull description, relatively few truly interesting parts, and unspiring characters make this book not a long and wonderful epic but simply...long.s love scenes superbly, but reading 704 pages for a few fast-paced passages, a couple of interesting psychological revelations, and little bit of hot romance does not seem like a good trade-off. <br />Finally, the characters just don't inspire.

B0000DZ3IG|4.0|A delightful soundtrack from a lovely and fun film (that I have seen four times!). Not going to repeat the many highlights mentioned in other reviews (though I will say Joni Mitchell's 2000 version of Both Sides Now is the reason I first went to see Love Actually and for me is the high point of the soundtrack), but I will mention that Bill Nighy's (aka Billy Mack) &quot;Christmas Is All Around&quot; is indeed included on the CD (though currently not listed in the track list on this site).
0800177177|2.0|The biggest disaster in this film is having Mr. &quot;excellent!&quot; playing Harker. Keanu Reeves comes off as the buffoon he is with his horrible &quot;accent&quot;, and he sounds like Bill (or is it Ted?) trying to pull off an English accent. Bad move. Throughout, he seems somewhat clueless as to what to do with himself, being devoid of any emotion. Even when he sees a younger Dracula in London, his reaction is rather lacking. He just comes across as stiff and uninteresting. He should have been cast as a tree, then he would've won an Oscar.<BR>Gary Oldman's take on the &quot;old&quot; version of Dracula is not too impressive, either, though he's pretty smooth as the younger Dracula. I think it's mostly due to the unconvincing make-up job on him.<BR>The special FX as well, though clearly experimental in some scenes, was helpful in damaging this film's credibility. For example, I understand how they were trying to make Dracula's shadow have a life of it's own (when Harker first arrives), but at certain times when the shadow and Gary Oldman were supposed to be in sync they were waaayyyy off. I can't believe that the director didn't see how poorly it looked. It is THAT bad.<BR>And when the coachman reaches his ever-lengthening arm to help Harker into the coach (good idea), Keanu is clearly on some sort of platform which lifts him upward and inside (bad idea, because it's so obvious). <BR>Originally, I was looking forward to seeing this, but it was a real letdown. I suppose if your standards are low and you aren't too analytical, you could enjoy this. Of course, Anthony Hopkins is the only actor here that really keeps this from being a total write-off.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Watching Mildred Pierce became (somehow) a Christmas Eve tradition for me a few years ago. A classic battle-of-wills story, you can't help cheering for Mildred when she tells her scheming, selfish daughter &quot;Get out before I kill you!&quot; (the little tramp comes back though). Great fun and melodrama.

B00005JLSE|3.0|Although Chicago was esteemed by many critics and viewers, my own personal opinion is that it was good but not great.  The film is filled with outstanding musical and dance numbers.  The acting was better than i thought it would be, and i was very surprised to see the intricate detail that went into the making of this movie.  However, i felt that it did not deserve the award for best picture at the Oscars. It has a very cheap plotline that reflects the gradual downfall of our society's moral standards.  It says that is ok to kill, lie, cheat, and use anyone to get what you want.  It gives the impression that our one true goal in life should be to become rich and famous and that we should do anything we have to to get it.  It is a cheap rip off of much better musicals such as:  &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; &quot;Phantom of the Opera,&quot; &quot;Fiddler on the Roof,&quot; etc.  In my opinion this movie was not all it was cracked up to be.

B000089RVX|2.0|The mixture of different types of vocals is not quite achieved in this album; the hard musics are too hard in opposition to beautiful musics like &quot;my immortal&quot; or &quot;hello&quot;.

B00005V3Z4|4.0|I read many of these reviews before purchasing Donnie Darko, and it did not help me very much.  The overall sense I got was some people thought it dull and pointless, others imaginitive and intriguing.  Finally, I bought it, and was not disappointed in the least.  While the basic concept of the movie could have been presented in a short time span, the emotional feel leading up to it could not, which is one of the things that makes this movie good.  I noticed few acting flaws, which surprised me after reading other customers' reviews.  I found myself chuckling at some parts, thinking at others, and near tears at the rest.<BR>     It was put best by another reviewer who said either you will love this movie, or you won't.  If you are not sure about it, rent it first, and if you truely enjoy it, you'll buy it anyway.  If you don't, then you've only wasted a few bucks.
B00005JLSE|3.0|Seems to me that this musical should not garner all the high esteem that it has, since the plotline is suspect and the acting is well, limited?<br />The rest is raunchy 1920's flapper girl, gin run culture. Oh, yes the songs are done with gusto, but who would assume for a minute that they would be done as opener for Sound of Music?<br />Our culture is ripe for such, highlighting the lowlights.  As one reviewer put it so well, this is overproduction, which starts to grate on one's intelligence and taste.  The bright lights and blaring tunes with suggestive sensuality laden is all apprapo to our times, but wait, there are a few of us who agree, this is not what we give five stars for.
B000002BVN|3.0|At a time when Michael Jackson comes across as the most schizophrenic personality ever in showbiz, it isn't so surprising to find the same tendancy in his albums.<br />'Blood On The Dance Floor' is as hybrid as a record can ever be: not really a new album (but containing no less than 5 new tracks), not really a compilation (but featuring most of his latest hits in remixed versions), not really a soundtrack (though featuring two songs from his short movie 'Ghosts'), it's hard to figure out exactly what to do with this album.<br />The new material stands out as some of his best ever stuff (&quot;Morphine&quot; and &quot;Superfly Sister&quot;, for instance, are pure funk-rock jewels, and the other three are equally good) while the remix material features what is (to me at least) some of the worst crap ever officially released under MJJ's name!<br />I can't really say: go for that record, nor can I discourage you from buying it. It's for you to decide. But if you do, chances are you will prefer one half to the other one and program only a handful of songs.
0385504209|5.0|This book is an interesting read! I am not a very religious person, mainly because modern christianity just doesn't make sense to me. I understood why after reading this book. The story is a good one. I feel like the characters and their actions were a little too predictable but I found the knowledge of religion and history in the book to be extremely fascinating. I learned things that I wasn't aware of which have spurred me on to read more about the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and the Knights Templer.  Fascinating material!
B00005QGAV|3.0|When you know that Michael Jackson actually recorded 35 songs for Dangerous before he took it down to 15, you can only wonder what he and Sony had in mind when they released this so-called &quot;Special Edition&quot; that has nothing special to it apart from a &quot;remastering&quot; that will only satisfy those fans with very expensive stereo systems and a well-enough-trained ear to tell the difference... Come on, this was Bruce Swedien at the helms, Michael had the best technology available anywhere on the planet for mixing and mastering, what can you do to make it sound any better?<br />Early announcements stated that this was to feature three bonus songs... As it is, there is none, not even a single interview or rare demo. So I'd call this a rip-off, and you would do well to stick to your initial copy of the record if you already have it!<br />Additional songs to this album (many circulated among fans) included &quot;(2 Much) Monkey Business&quot; (a fantastic mid-tempo classic), &quot;For All Time&quot; (a ballad), &quot;If You Don't Love Me&quot; (an unpleasant 1960s-sounding number that even Michael disliked), &quot;Serious Effect&quot; (great song including rap by LL Cool J), &quot;Earth Song&quot; (later included in 'HIStory') and &quot;Someone Put Your Hand Out&quot; (which was later used for Pepsi's promotion on the radio).<br />Until Sony gives us the Special Edition we deserve that has at least three of the above, let's not bother! Besides, this is far from being MJJ's best release. Overproduced and often pretentious, it lacks the magic and innocence of the Quincy Jones years.
B00013F35I|5.0|Yes, finally! After 30 years as a recording artist Bruce finally releases a complete concert  from beginning to end that we can have with us for posterity. Although he has maintained a consistently high level of audio releases over the years, his video releases have been at best fair to middling. The history of his video releases begins with his video anthology, which contains some phenomenal concert footage, (Rosalita, Thunder Road), but contains way too many cheesy made for MTV videos. I still cringe when I see that Dancing in the Dark video. He went on to release \\"Plugged\\", which was made for the MTV Unplugged series, in which his back up band was not the E Street Band, but the most generic group of musicians imaginable playing to the lamest studio crowd I've ever seen. After that was \\"Blood Brothers\\", an excellent documentary chronicling the recording of new music for a greatest hits album with the newly reunited E Street Band, and then finally \\"Live in NYC\\" which consisted of edited footage of a 2000 NYC concert. Unfortunately through the editing process, we only get part of the picture of the Springsteen concert phenomena on Live in NYC. <br />Now we have \\"Live in Barcelona\\", an amazing performance from 2002 in front of what has to be one of the most enthusiastic crowds I've ever seen. For us American fans it gives us a look at his European audience, who seem on average younger and I would venture to say as devoted a following as any fans you could find between Boston and Philadelphia. This concert has it all, from the heart wrenching ballads of \\"Empty Sky\\" and \\"You're Missing\\" to moments of pure joy like \\"Waiting for a Sunny Day\\" and \\"Ramrod\\".  Oldies like \\"Spirit in the Night\\" are included with his new stuff along with everything in between. We also see the ultimate performer, usually singing and playing the guitar, sometimes playing the piano, sometimes on top of the piano and other times with just the microphone, hamming it up like Tom Jones, all the whilewith a smile on his face that can light up a stadium.<br />The filming is well done with the right mix of close-ups,  audience shots and full stage shots, and the sound is good, although I did notice a difference between the first and second disk. That didn't bother me though, in fact the poorer vocal mix on the second disk gave it a more authentic arena concert sound. <br />My only criticism is that he didn't do something like this sooner, like in 1978! Although he is still the greatest performer in the world, at 50 years old he is obviously not in his prime. I hope one day they'll dig up a concert from the vaults, back when he used to jump on top of the speakers, tell those great stories and sing Backstreets with an added improvised verse that was different every night. Nevertheless buy this DVD! If you want to see the quintessential American rocker, who combines the charisma and showmanship of Elvis, with the poetry of Bob Dylan and backs it up with the \\"greatest little house band in the land\\", this is it. One day when I have grandchildren and they ask me, \\"what was Rock N\\" Roll?\\" I'll put this DVD on for them.
B00005QGAX|4.0|As opposed to the Special Edition of 'Thriller' (whose bonus tracks were edited) and that of 'Dangerous', which is something of a rip-off, the special edition of 'Bad' presents three full-length bonus tracks : the Spanish version of &quot;I Just Can't Stop Lovin' You&quot; (released only on the Latin American market at the time -- thank God, the inept French version was shelved!), &quot;Streetwalker&quot; (great song, but which kind of duplicates the atmosphere of &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; and even fits the video clip better) and &quot;Fly Away&quot;, one of MJJ's best ever ballads, which is presented here in its short version (the long version soon served as a basis for sister Rebbie Jackson's version, who unfortunately spoiled it with her mediocre singing).<br />Quincy Jones' personal insight and anecdotes (sometimes barely audible), are nice additions, though they kind of spoil the album's listening pleasure and ought to have been featured on a separate bonus CD instead.<br />Now I can't help thinking it wouldn't have cost Epic/Sony and Jackson a great deal more to add more unreleased tracks, or at the very least the extended versions of &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;The Way...&quot;, &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;. Disney's &quot;We Are Here To Change The World&quot; would also have made a nice addition, considering the fact that &quot;Another Part Of Me&quot; was already on the album, and that Captain EO is no longer featured at any Disney center in the world... But let's not spoil our pleasure, 'Bad' is Michael Jackson's most coherent and timeless opus, and this new edition is worth your money.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|I must disagree with the naysayers regarding Annie Lennox's contribution to this soundtrack.  The song is powerful and Annie's soaring vocals perfectly capture the bittersweet farewell to dear friends departing, Into The West.  Out of her range?  No way.  This beautiful and perhaps slightly unconventional track provides a fitting finish to Shore's tremendous score.
B000002LJA|5.0|How can one of the greatest Black music albums ever be listed as &quot;out of stock&quot; by Amazon? Who can be so blind as to not leave this record out for sale on a permanent basis?<br />Well, if you haven't heard this album, you're simply missing a rare treat. Quincy Jones is one of the most influential artists in music ever, period. He single-handedly launched a wide range of highly-gifted artists and arranged/produced albums for many artists that still hold out as the best in their careers. Since the 1970s, his solo projects are a way for him to showcase tons of talent, old and young, blending together and taking up new vocal and musical challenges.<br />And this is precisely what this record was all about. More than an album, it is a testament to the greatness of Black music. Quincy has gathered here the greatest amount of talent any money has ever bought (or will ever buy, for that matter, since many of them have passed away since) : respectable old-timers like Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis or Ray Charles, and, nearer to us, George Benson, Al Jarreau, Barry White, Bobby McFerrin or Chaka Khan, share their many talents with rising stars such as Take 6, Al B. Sure, El DeBarge, Siedah Garrett, Tevin Campbell and even a cast of first-class rappers such as Ice-T, Kool Moe Dee or Big Daddy Kane. By comparison, the next project, &quot;Q's Jook Joint&quot;, for its almost equally incredible line-up of artists, is not half as good as this.<br />For &quot;Back On The Block&quot;, Quincy was sold on rap by his son, and he wanted this album to reflect the passing of the flame from the old to the new generation and the blending of all Black music, be it gospel, jazz, African, funk or rap. He has largely succeeded... But more than this, he simply has produced one of the greatest and most dense bodies of work of these past 15 years, which will stand the test of time as one of the late 20th century milestones.<br />So, Warner Bros., you can dobetter than this &quot;out of stock&quot; label, right? This album is part of our common musical legacy, it should be made available again with no further delay!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|She's done it again.  This album is amazing.  Don't just take my word for it, look at all the other reviews, when i wrote this all the reviews gave her 5 stars.  I didn't buy her last album as i didn't really like Fallin' but when i heard other songs such as Girlfriend and A Womans Worth I regreted not getting it.  When i first heard You Don't Know My Name i didn't really like it until i heard it a couple times.  This girl can not only sing but she can also play the piano! My favorite song on this album is Karma, it's amazing.<BR>Keep up the good work Keys!
B00005QGAZ|4.0|If E.T. actually existed and if he came down to Earth and asked for a sample of Earth music, what albums would you pick? Undoubtedly, 'Thriller' would be part of the list, and not just because it was the biggest selling album of all time, with 46 million copies sold worldwide (more now with this Special Edition). Quite simply, 'Thriller' is quintessential because it combines perfect singing, perfect production, perfect songwriting, perfect dance music and perfect ballads.<br />This doesn't mean that Michael Jackson's best work is there, far from it (though I believe &quot;Billie Jean&quot; to be one of the best songs of the century), and you'll find better dance numbers on 1979's 'Off The Wall' for instance. No, it's just that 'Thriller' is the perfect combination, a summary of what quality in music should be.<br />Sure, the style is a bit dated in places (&quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; or &quot;P.Y.T&quot; and even &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; sound old!) but face it, this record will get you dancing, loving, smiling, just the way a record should. The impeccable lineup of musicians (prominently the band Toto and the Brothers Johnson) doesn't hurt either...<br />Releasing a Special Edition should have been any fan's dream, but as it turned out, I felt a little cheated by this. First of all, there are only three bonus tracks, the rest being interview clips with Quincy Jones. Though I do not deny the value of such testimony and insight as his, it will come as no surprise to anyone if I say that there is nothing more annoying than having to skip the talking when you listen to an album. This is certainly not the kind of stuff you want to hear everytime you listen to a record! It would have been wiser to feature a bonus CD with the interview, and leave the main CD for music, if only for the sake of continuous play.<br />Moreover, apart form the voice-over session to &quot;Thriller&quot; by MJJ and Vincent Price (a rare treat, which even includes a left-out verse), the other two bonus songs are incomplete: Not only &quot;Someone In The Dark&quot; (from the E.T. project) is just the opening version, but Quincy's voice overlaps the music's intro, and therefore the song is useless by itself; as to &quot;Carousel&quot; (previously known to fans as &quot;Circus Girl&quot;), it is a two-and-a-half minute edit version (the original recording is more than THREE-and-a-half minutes long)!<br />Besides, the official fanclub announcement in France stated that this edition would also include the song &quot;Starlight&quot; (the first version of &quot;Thriller&quot;, with different lyrics and no monsters), but this just never happened... With all the great extra songs left out from &quot;Thriller&quot; in 1982, such as &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Can't Get Outta The Rain&quot;, &quot;Hot Street&quot; and even the McCartney produced, early solo version of &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, there was plenty of material for a better release than that. Or is Sony waiting for Michael's demise to capitalize on his unreleased work, of which they have tons?
B00007E8V4|3.0|We all know by now that Steal This Album! is not a new album by SOAD, but tracks that didn't fit in with Toxicity.  The major problem with this album is that each song is so different from the last one that you're going to be hard pressed to find anyone who likes every song (or most of them, anyway).  My favorites are Innervision, Boom! (not b/c of the message; I'm not a Democrat), I-E-A-I-A-I-O, Pictures, and Highway Song. These are the songs that really get my psyched!  I just like the way they sound (even though I-E-A-I-A-I-O is quite weird and has no point).  I really hate 36 (way too short) and Roulette (they don't utilize all their instruments here; that's just f*cking stupid!  A song w/o drums just sucks ass!)  Most of the other ones are too weird.  SOAD can send a strong message when they choose to, but they sometimes just throw words out there.  It works in some songs, but Chic N' Stu is way too out there!  However, I commend them for the risks they take, and they sound unlike any band in the genre.  I would actually rate this album overall a 2.5, but some of the songs are definitely 5 star quality.
B0000TAZBK|1.0|This CD-set was originally described as including the &quot;limited edition&quot; of the last sscore, including a bonus DVD. It turns out it did not include this, but only the &quot;regular&quot; release - and is therefore overpriced.<BR>Not only it was sent to those who had ordered it without informing them - and when I wrote to complain about it, the answer assumed I has misread the description - but the comments about this mistake that were present in the review pages have been removed.<BR>This is not the excellent customer service that I have come to expect from Amazon. I hope it does not happen again, and that as proof of good faith commentsd like this are left intact.
B00000099Y|4.0|I think this review will have both Tool fans and Tool haters angry with me.  So screw me, I don't care!  Tool generally isn't heavy metal, but at times it can be.  The darkness and anger are essential to Tool's art, and those of you that don't seem to get that need to get it, like RIGHT NOW!  I am so sick of that being the reason why people rate it low!  Also, the tracks take time to understand their message (print out copies of the lyrics and follow along; it helps).  If you have a short attention span, then you will HATE this ablum, for Tool is meant to build on you over time, with layers of musical colors adding to the tracks' suspense.  Their lyrics are deep and contain a great deal of philosophy and theories on such topics as armageddon and false martrydom.  It is refreshing to hear a band make meaning through their lyrics, and having the best drum licks in the entire universe doesn't hurt, either!  Wow, Danny Carey, you are a GOD!!!  Eulogy, Aenema, and Third Eye are the greatest tracks on the album, possibly in the history of music (but that's tough to say!)  My only problem with this album is the tracks on the album that are not actual songs, and the fact that there are too many of them.  Only if you are a dire Tool fan will you enjoy them.  Though they probably are on there for a reason, I buy albums to hear music, and tracks like Useful Idiot and Innermission are not music.  I will reiterate the fact that Tool's lyrics and music are not catchy, and they are not supposed to be!  They captivate you as you listen on, but it will take a couple of listenings for one to hear everything Tool wants you to hear.  Although Aenima as an album is not perfect, requiring you to skip around to find the good stuff (hey Tool fans, I like Tool too, but you really do have to consider the album as a whole here!), the tracks themselves kick so much ass that I would recommend this album, and Tool for that matter, to anyone who loves rock/alt. metal.
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|I have never been more disappointed in my life. From Mer de noms to... NOTHING! It just seems to go on forever. If you are hoping for masterpieces like &quot;Orestes&quot; and Judith&quot; don't look to this album. I see why people just download their tracks. This was a waste of 17.99.
0783225903|3.0|I don't like weird films. The bizarre and drug-induced type of haze has never interested me. \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" and such strange films are not my cup of tea. I recall reading Franz Kafka's \\"The Metamorphosis\\" in the 10th grade -- I wasn't a fan of its odd narrative. I understood the point of the story, and Kafka is admirable and honorable, yes, but I just don't enjoy his writing.<br />And \\"Brazil\\" has the Kafkaesque narrative drive that I just don't appreciate. I looked forward to it for quite some time with much anticipation -- Robert De Niro in a supporting role with Jonathan Pryce, directed by Terry Gilliam (\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\"), and co-scripted by Gilliam? A real treat!<br />I was wrong.<br />I found \\"Brazil\\" to be startlingly unfunny, quite flat, and very strange. This is the same type of \\"crazy\\" film I put in the same category as a mess like \\"Toys\\" or other such films. As I noted before, there's a very fine line between genius and stupidity. I guess I never crossed the line.<br />I find myself often agreeing with the nation's most popular critic, Roger Ebert, whom I have talked to in the past. We both share a love for the truly underrated and great comedy \\"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\\" and his choice to add it to his Great Movies List -- among such other classics as \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"Citizen Kane\\" -- made me feel only greater respect for the man. With as many readers and fellow peers as he has, putting a 1980s comedy starring two mainstream comedians such as Steve Martin and John Candy may seem like a risky decision. (But he saw the genius of the film, like me and many other loyal fans.)<br />Ebert has been my primary influence as a critic, and though he's been coming under attack for \\"overrating\\" films lately, I realize that he grades on a more commercial scale than I do, and as great movies are rarer and rarer nowadays, he is hard-pressed to find truly great films. I doubt whether he would have given \\"xXx\\" 3/4 stars twenty years ago.<br />Why am I bringing up Roger Ebert into a discussion about \\"Brazil\\"? Because Ebert and I seem to share much of the same taste. He gave \\"Brazil\\" 2/4 stars. I agree with his analysis very much, although I gave \\"Brazil\\" 3/5 stars, only because I enjoyed a handful of scenes. I recommend it with a bare minimum of enthusiasm.<br />You may love \\"Brazil\\" if you enjoy pointless films with shallow psychological metaphors and so on. I found it pretty dull, and torturous to sit through at times. I didn't laugh once. Isn't it supposed to be a dark comedy? Well, it's dark.<br />The story is about a worker named Sam Lowry (Pryce), who exists in a futuristic hell and is sent into a downward spiral after becoming caught up in the affairs of a mysterious dream woman (Kim Griest) and a couple of mistaken identities involving a man named Harry Tuttle (De Niro).<br />The beginning of the film is fairly good, with good atmosphere and visual effects, but Gilliam soon takes us into the mind of Lowry halfway through the film, and it turns into a grim psychological thriller with a bunch of dead ends and forgotten ideas. Sam's dream sequences, which have him dressed in an angelic armor with big white-feathered wings, are beautiful to look at...but what else are they good for?<br />The film features an all-star cast, including Bob Hoskins, Ian Holm, Michael Palin, and of course Mr. Robert De Niro (who is second credited but does nothing but three or four brief cameos in the film). I suppose I wanted more humor and sense from this movie after seeing Gilliam's work on the Monty Python series of films. Now, I will freely admit that I saw the European version of \\"Brazil,\\" which reportedly varies from the original US theatrical cut in a number of ways. There is an added sex scene, the ending is different (no clouds), and there are at least five scenes added to the version (it stands at some 140 minutes compared to the 131-minute US cut). So with that in mind, perhaps my analysis of \\"Brazil\\" is somewhat flawed. If the dream sequences are different than the US sequences, perhaps part of the effect has gone.<br />In fact, there are supposedly somewhere around 30 versions of the film out there, including a \\"happy\\" version aired on network television in the States (it reminds me of \\"Gremlins 2,\\" when the announcer claims that \\"Casablanca\\" is now complete with \\"a happier ending.\\"), and a 97-minute \\"Love Conquers All\\" version, handled carefully by Gilliam and available for the die hard fans on the soon-to-be-discontinued Criterion Collection DVD.<br />I have to ask myself, though, whether or not all that really matters. Some added scenes and altered dream sequences couldn't be too terribly different from the US version, can they? Right?<br />\\"Brazil\\" is a film I would have to see again to form a solid opinion. Ebert saw it twice and still disliked it, but it's the type of film like \\"Adaptation\\" that I may enjoy the second time around since I'm fully prepared for what is about to happen and what it all means. But as it stands right now, I can't say that \\"Brazil\\" is anything more than a dizzying journey into a world reminiscent of a hellish nightmare, and I feel no great urge to see the film again.
B000001A3H|5.0|A While ago, my friend gave me a copy of Blues for the Red Sun. The first time I listened to it, I had no idea what to think. It was psychedelic and heavier than almost anything I Had heard before. Now, nearly two years later, I don't believe there has been a week that I have been able to keep this album off my stereo. Blues for the Red Sun spawned a genre, kudos also to Fu Manchu and Monster Magnet, but Kyuss really started it all. Kyuss never got the respect it deserved.<br />I personally disagree with the &quot;Wheelchair Assasin&quot;. Any of the three Queens Of The Stone age releases couldn't hold a candle to Kyuss. QOTSA is a good band but will never be an equal to Kyuss(I admit that they have already sold more albums but so have many other lackluster bands). The other solo excursions are better too. Brant Bjork's solo release &quot;Jalamanta&quot; is another masterpiece, but much more laid back and mellow.  John Garcia's project, Unida, put out &quot;Coping With The Urban Coyote' in 1999, which is in the same vein as Blues for the Red Sun. Even Alfredo Hernandez and Bjork's band, Ché, released &quot;Sounds of Liberation&quot;, and that too tops QOTSA.<br />Also Reccomended: <BR>Monster Magnet - Spine of God<BR>Fu Manchu - The Action Is Go<BR>Nebula - Atomic Ritual<BR>Orange Goblin - Coup De Grace(features some guest vocals from John Garcia)                <br />Bottom Line: Simply Amazing, worth checking out if you are a fan of Black Sabbath and/or seriously heavy distortion.
6305897786|2.0|A book collector is hired to determine the authenticity of a book allegedly written by Satan. If this Roman Polanski horror vehicle helped finance his subsequent &quot;The Pianist&quot;, well then, so be it. It is a rambling, increasingly tedious and superficial suspense thriller starring Johnny Depp, whose one-note negativism as an unscrupulous bibliophile doesn't contrast well with the overall dullness of the film. The lead lady's bizarre supernatural powers look like a paraplegic Peter Pan on training wheels.
B000002HEP|5.0|On their major-label debut, The members of Kyuss do not dissapoint. However, they thought it would be a good joke to lump the songs together into nearly 20 minute &quot;movements&quot; so there are 4 songs on the album. The track listing above is wrong, it really is:<br />1.Gardenia/Asteroid/Supa Scoopa And Mighty Scoop<BR>2.100 Degrees/Space Cadet/Demon Cleaner<BR>3.Odyssey/Conan Troutman/N.O./Whitewater<BR>4.Lick Doo<br />This album is just as good if not better than Blues For the Red Sun.  Nick Oliveri, their bass player left before the recording started and the new bass player, Scott Reeder, changes the sound slightly, so it is hard to compare to their second record.<BR>The Album seems much heavier and more developed Than it's predecessor. The album booklet even has instructions: Listen Without Distraction. Which I reccomend following.<br />Also Recommended: <BR>Sheavy - The Electric Sleep<BR>Sons Of Otis - Songs For Worship<br />Bottom Line:<BR>Excellent LP, as expected from the Desert Rock masters, but only buy it if you can stand sitting through a whole album.
B00006AW2J|3.0|While there is no denying that this is arguably one of the best Rolling Stones records, if not one of the best records period, I was really disappointed with the SACD mix offered on the disk.  I have a JVC 8030 receiver and a Pioneer 563 DVD/SACD player, all hooked up to Polk speakers.  As a benchmark, Pink Folyd's Dark Side of the Moon in SACD was almost a spirtual experience.  Although I am a big Pink Floyd fan, the Stones have always been my #1 band.  I can remember getting into fights in grade school over who was better the Beatles or the Stones.  <BR>Anyway, I was psyched to be able hear songs like &quot;Salt of the earth&quot;, &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, etc. in the new format.  Man was I disappointed.  First off you only get sound out of your front three speakers...Are they kidding?....I felt totally ripped off..The sound quality was no better then the original CD released years ago.  I'm not sure who is in charge of the pre-Sticky Fingers material, but they seemed to have released all the old material on SACD. My guess is that it is all lousy. Hopefully when Mick and Keith release the new material, they will do it right.
B00005JMCW|4.0|\\"Freaky Friday\\", a remake of a 1976 film starring Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster, was on my list of movies to avoid when it came out in the summer of 2003 - too cute, too predictable, too formula, etc. As it turns out, though, it's rather good and often quite funny, thanks in large part to Jamie Lee Curtis' over-the-top performance and to Mark L. Waters' fairly sophisticated direction. Its target audience is girls aged ten to sixteen, but it is a movie adults can also enjoy. <br />This is the story of Tess [Curtis] and her teen daughter, Annabell [Lindsay Lohman]. Tess is about to remarry and Annabell is in the rebellious stage. The tension between the two, as well as between Annabell and her kid brother, seems rather typical. One night at a Chinese restaurant an old woman casts a spell on mother and daughter. The next morning each wakes up in the other's body. They spend a `freaky' - and hilarious - Friday, each experiencing what life is like for the other. Tess has to go to Annabell's high school, and Annabell must go off to her mother's office. Each must put up with the other one's boy friend. Kid brother, of course, doesn't know which end is up. <br />Like most movies of its type, \\"Freaky Friday\\" sometimes runs perilously close to the schmaltzy and the sentimental, but each time it does, a funny line or physical action pulls it back from the edge. Again, much of this is due to Ms. Curtis, who is one of our funniest, cleverest, and most underrated actresses. I doubt we'll be seeing her name on Oscar's list of Best Actress nominees, and that's a pity. She is one classy actress.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I'm here to give an OPINION about this CD and a little about britney. Everybody has their own and you may or may not disagree with mine. :) I have been debating on wether or not to do a review since I first listened to the music on this cd and after reading all the other reviews I thought what the hell... If anybody hated Britney spears music so MUCH before, it was me...Stil hate the old stuff..then she busted out with slave 4 u and the boys remix..I thought hmmmm she's starting to do different stuff and I STILL wouldn't give it a chance. Not only can this cd be accepted by an older audience but by clubbers as well. I love trance n techno and she has a couple of songs that have those beats. I love all music that will make me wanna get up n dance and this cd had more than a couple of tracks to do that for me. I mean if britney were to go and make the same kind of teeny bopper music like before..I would be like damn o well and just keep the in the zone cd and go back to watching britney make sappy ass songs. I like her new style to be honest and I hope she keeps making music that makes you wanna go to the club. Teeny bopper love songs are overrated anyway. My favs on this album are &quot;touch of my hand&quot;, &quot;outrageous&quot; (loove r kelly), &quot;toxic&quot;, &quot;breathe on me&quot; and &quot;i got that boom boom&quot; gots a good hip hop feel to it. As far as britney's voice goes.. yeah it could be better and it will never be like Christina's but what the hell..as long as I'm feelin the beats of the music and wanna dance to it and also feel what she's saying, then I'll have fun listening to it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Almost half the reviews have something about Stripped or Chritina's voice. Ok so Britney's vocals aren't upto her rival's mark but at least she doesn't talk ill of Christina. I lost all respect for that woman after she said all s*** things she thought of Britney. <BR>In the Zone is a good album and here are the ratings of each song<BR>MATM - 9/10<BR>Boom Boom - 9/10 (Get lost ying yang twins!)<BR>Showdown - 10/10 (lovely beats)<BR>Breathe on me - 9/10<BR>Early morning - 3/10 (Sucks bigtime)<BR>Toxic - 10/10 (best song, lyrics)<BR>Outrageous - 10/10 (extememly cathcy)<BR>Touch of my hand - 9/10 <BR>The hookup - 10/10 (Catchy, funky song)<BR>Shadow - 11/10 (Great ballad)<BR>Brave new girl - 10/10 (Love this one)<BR>Everytime - 12/10 (one word - Awesome)<BR>MATM (RRDK mix) - 9.5/10 (cool mix)<BR>Great Dancy CD. You forget that you're listening to Britney till Shadow. I know she's changing her style because majority of the people don't like bubblegum pop and go with hip hop. I feel sort of sad to know that. I was very sad when I listened to Stripped too. It's not like these albums suck but I really LOVED the old Britney and old Christina a LOT!! I wish this was still the late 90s where pop was 'in'. If either of them release a bubblegum pop album now, they're sales will go down the garbage drain. That's why they won't do it. I wish they could release such an album for oldtimes sake. <BR>Anyway, this album is good. I hope there are more ballads in her next album.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Man am I glad I didn't buy Alien Legacy cause this box set blows Legacy out of the water.  I love all of the Alien film the first 2 being my favorite.<br />Alien: 5/5 This movie started it all I love both the Theatrical cut and the Directors cut.  The DVD transfer is perfect and this movie is probably the most suspensful one in the series.<br />ALIENS:  5/5 This movie is probably my favorite in the series.  It has a lot of action and has a great storyline.  Believe you can watch this over and over and never be bored with it.  This DVD includes both the theatrical cut and the SPECIAL EDITION in I like the special edition a little bit better cause it helps develop the characters a lot better.  But the Theatrical Cut is just as good.<br />ALIEN 3:  4/5 Why does nobody like this film I like it both the theatrical cut and Extended cut.  Yes this movie is a little boring at times but that don't make it stink.  The DVD transfer is good for this film.  If I was you I would stick to the Theatrical cut that is my favorite version of the film even though the Extended cut explains a little more about Ripleys situation.<br />ALIEN RESURRECTION:  4/5 I like this movie a great deal, it has a lot of action in it.  The clone thing with Ripley is a little hard to believe but that is just minor cause yet once again Sigourney Weaver did a great job as Ripley.  I like both versions of the film.  The DVD transfer is good as well.<br />This a wonderful box set over 9 discs and 50 hours of Documentry footage in which is really interesting.  This set should last a good month or too.
B000002HAJ|5.0|Hard to believe it's been 10+ years since this album was released.  I first purchased it on cassette in 1992 and later on CD when the cassette literally wore itself out.  To me &quot;Wish&quot; is the last, really good album by this group, with later efforts like &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; badly missing the mark.  Often mis-classified as a Goth band, I rather think Robert Smith and The Cure simply tap into the quiet veins of sorrow and tragedy that run through every human life.  It's not a bad thing, it's not a Goth thing, it just is.  And while &quot;Wish&quot; is punctuated with occasional uppy songs like &quot;Friday I'm in Love&quot;, the pieces that really soar are (of course) the sad ones: &quot;Apart&quot;, &quot;Letter to Elise&quot; and the epic &quot;To Wish Impossible Things&quot;.  I once told someone that The Cure is the greatest break-up band of all time, and I stand by that assertion.  &quot;Wish&quot; is a grand demonstration of everything that makes The Cure great, right before things started to go downhill.  I've since heard rumors that The Cure are no more, that &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; is their last hurrah.  If so, I choose to remember &quot;Wish&quot; as their last, best effort.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I Actually Did Not like Britney at ALL, but My Friend got me the new CD. I listened to it And by the second time i heard it, I Just loved It. It's a very clubish and funish album. I Haven't heard any of her other cd's, But this is a very good album. It makes you want to dance. My personal Fav's are:<br />Breath On Me<BR>(Ive Got That)Boom,Boom WIth The YING YANG TWINS<BR>Toxic<BR>Touch Of My Hand<BR>Outrageous<BR>Shadow <BR>The Hook UP <BR>and Brave Girl and the rest too.<br />Overall, The CD was worth That Money. Get It!
B0000039LE|5.0|&quot;Halloween&quot; is one of those movies you can never be not scared of, no matter how many times you have seen it. Michael Myers is the ultimate masked killer, and can easily be preferred over Jason and Freddy Krueger. With his slight head turns and emotionless, white mask, he can create an eerie atmosphere even without the director's help. He is just the creepy looking! Jamie Lee Curtis is excellent as the terrorized babysitter, Laurie Strode, as she creates a feeling of realism with each of her lines. Donald Pleasence is equally great as Dr. Loomis. The script here is written for maximum intensity and suspense (most notably the last scenes in the film) and is much better than the junk we see in Friday the 13th and other such rip-offs. John Carpenter and Debra Hill do a marvelous writing job. Carptener's music is jolting and electrifyingly scary, and his direction can live up to that as well. This is the ultimate horror experience. Some good sequels follow this (but of course, not part III).
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Blah blah blah...whine whine whine...these guys aren't original. Whatever. Rock musicians have been borrowing from each other for ages, and Jet continues the tradition in good form. A rip-off of the Detroit-Duo? Hardly. They've got two different sounds all together. Both great. Both different. This argument between The White Stripes, The Strokes, and Jet is the same as the one about The Beatles The Rolling Stones and The Who....are we noticing a trend here folks?<br />When it comes down to it, I for one don't realy care. I wouldn't go as far as calling them genius, but they're pretty darn good, relatively talented musicians, who are doing nothing less than playing good ol' fashioned rock'n'roll. In the days of over-produced pop, i.e.: Christina Haguilerra, BS, and that American Idol crap, I'm glad to hear some real music for a change.
6304288433|4.0|Respectable sequel to the smash hit &quot;Halloween,&quot; has Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence and a few others reprising their previous roles. HALLOWEEN 2 is sometimes very scary and frightening, but never as suspenseful as the first (almost however). One of the reasons it isn't as suspenseful is because there is quite a bit of explicit violence displayed on-screen in this motion picture. One of the scenes that shows this is much more graphic than the original is the sequence where Michael forces the nurse's face into the jacuzzi tub in the hospital. Otherwise, this sequel is very good and as good as the original. The musical numbers are from the original score by John Carptener, thus are effective and eerie. However, they are not done by Carptener himself - Alan Howarth does the score for this film and it is just as good as the original's. Debra Hill also returns with Carpenter to write the script for this sequel, and the script is very good and lives up to high expectations of a sequel. It's full of frightening scares and tense moments. Basically, it takes place the same night the original ended, and Laurie is admitted into the hospital. Michael follows her there and begins stalking the empty corridors of the hospital. Dr. Loomis discovers a secret about Michael and Laurie which I will not spoil if you haven't already seen this film. Scary and very close to being as good as the original...just a little more graphically violent, which spoils it a bit.
B00006EXL5|5.0|If you are one to listen to music for originality then this is the band for you. It has a unique sound that is much more diverse than anything else i have ever listened to before. The vocals stand out with a pop-like tone and a raspy since of belonging for the music. I think this has to be one of the best cds i have heard before and i would advise many many people to give this album a try just for the creativity alone. My chemical romance rules more than alot of other bands out there that make lots more money!
B000002JOH|5.0|This album has been imitated but nothing is like an original. this album put PanterA on the map..FOR GOOD. my favortie song on this CD is track 10 &quot;By Demons Be Driven&quot; this song is one of the best death/speed metal songs ive ever heard. with vinnie and dimebag matching speeds. this whole album is amazing. the best PanterA album i think.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|...I really liked this movie.<br />In fact, I approached viewing this film with a somewhat cynical view myself, largely because I had heard so many negative comments about the film, ranging from critical reviews to discriminating banter from various radio personalities and talk show hosts.  From the very first moments of the film, to its cliff-hanger ending, I was engrossed, and completely satisfied with the second installment of &quot;The Matrix&quot; trilogy.<br />The premise of this story is pretty much a linear sequel to the first film.  Six months have passed Neo (Keanu Reeves) discovered that he is the &quot;One&quot; who can overthrow the machines that control the matrix and enslave humans to power their very existance.  Now, powerful and unstoppable, he returns to the matrix to continue his quest for the freedom of Zion.  Plagged by visions of events yet to happen, Neo is forced between serving humanity and protecting &quot;Trinity&quot; (Carrie Ann Moss) his one, true love.  <br />When word reaches Zion that the machines have begun to burrow towards the human refuge, Morpheus leads Neo and Trinity back into the Matrix in an attempt to stop the attack before it begins.  <br />The movie, which is packed full of the same breath-taking surreal special effects that made the first movie such a huge hit with fans world-wide, does not have the surprise of the first movie.  Though more elaborate, the effects are no longer  ground-breaking, as they have been seen in a variety of other films (Charlies Angels, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and to the directors credit, the effects serve the story instead of replacing it.  Still, they are dazzling, sometimes leaving the audience (or at least this viewer) wondering, &quot;how did they do that?&quot;<br />The story is tight, and a consistent continuance of the original Matrix narrative.  The original cast returns, expanding on certain characters including &quot;The Oracle&quot;, Smith (who is now operating outside the scope of the agents in the matrix), Trinity, Morpheus, and even Neo himself, who is now a sort of &quot;Superman&quot; within the Matrix.  The cliff-hanger ending leaves the story standing mid-field, awaiting the arrival of &quot;Matrix: Revolution&quot;.<br />So, despite the many negative reviews I've heard, personally, I think that &quot;The Matrix: Reloaded&quot; is a worthy successor to the original &quot;Matrix&quot; and a great film on its own.  Unlike so many sequels, this movie succeeds by expanding on an idea with a continuance that is both seamless and fresh, not re-hashing old ideas by creating new ones.  Watch it with an open mind and I think you will be more than pleasantly suprised.<br />-Scott Kolecki
B000002JNJ|5.0|This album has it all. memorable, skull crushing riffs, blinding speed, great guitar and bass tandem and one the greatest drummers of all time. lets not forget the real cowboy from hell heart and soul of Pantera Phil Anselmo. this album is a must-have for metal listener. the best song(s) are Primal Concrete Sledge, Cemetary Gates, and the classic Domination. but whos to say that those are the only good songs on the album. it got 5 stars for being a complete album and a couple of songs. go out and buy it, you wont be disppointed.
6300251330|3.0|This is a bit of a misunderstood sci-fi flick ' not flawless, but worth a second look. <br />In a floating space station near Saturn, we meet Harvey Keitel's character, Benson, or 'The Captain'. Or is he really somebody else? In the first few minutes, he murders a pilot preparing to transport special cargo for a remote colony on Saturn's third moon. Taking the dead pilot's place \\"Benson\\" braves the rings of Saturn and arrives on Saturn 3, where Major Adam (Kirk Douglas) and the fetching Alex (Farrah Fawcett) are developing hydroponics-grown food for a struggling Earth. It's not just work for Adam and Alex, and Benson's arrival disrupts the family unit that the two have made for each other. Adam came to space to escape Earth (which we're supposed to assume is made unpleasant perhaps by pollution, war, over-population or some other contemporary problem unchecked in his distant future). Alex has never known Earth, which only highlights the apparent generation gap between her and Adam. Benson begins desiring Alex well before he actually gets around to his purported mission, and he figures that Adam's age gives him the edge (monogamy is frowned upon back on Earth, he tells her). It turns out that Benson has come to construct a robot to replace the team's now obsolescent half - Adam, and into that job, he throws himself full steam. Benson is so obsessed to complete the menacing robot which will replace Adam that you begin to wonder which of the trwo obsessions really rules his dark soul: Alex or the robot. When completed, the vaguely humanoid machine stands about 8 feet high, moves convincingly and menacingly robot-like and is topped with an incongruous thing that looks like a desk lamp. Called Hector, the robot's CPU is a large clear can containing what looks like human brain matter. Not talkative at the outset, the machine (a model ominously called a 'demigod') picks up fast when linked into Keitel's brain through a remote sensor Keitel implants into the base of his ownspine (a striking precursor to the decades-newer &quot;Matrix&quot;). Unfortunately, the neural link also gets the 'bot past the firewall of Benson's soul, and we learn through the robot a dark thing or two about Benson - notably that he failed a probably important course, likely one meant to protect a burgeoning artificial intelligence from the mind of a  natural-born psychotic. Unsurprisingly, the machine not only becomes psychotic as well, but decides that Benson is an obstacle to be replaced much as Benson had planned for Adam. Soon, Adam and Alex are on the run from Hector, learning to quickly duck in and out of hydraulic doors and weave through cramped ventilator shafts. <br />This was a pretty slim flick which gets more mileage than it should out of Farrah Fawcett. Her character is vulnerable and compulsively dependent throughout the movie, never displaying the resourcefulness that Sigourney Weaver had established for a new generation of sci-fi heroines in 'Alien' (which came out the year before). Alex has to be the last female character to faint out of fear in a sci-fi film. We never get an insight into Keitel's character either - obsessed with both Hector and Fawcett. The two can't both be paramount in his mind. You get the idea that to Benson, the robot is just a means to get Alex; but there are scenes when Keitel tries to get into the robot's head, making it a more substantial part of his own psyche. It's incredible to think that Martin Amis had anything to do with this story which, among other things, is strikingly unsurprising. (Case in point: when first demonstrated, Hector crushes a can Benson had ordered the robot to give Adam. There isn't a person on the planet who couldn't guess Kirk Douglas's response: 'I'm glad you didn't tell him to shake my hand.') <BR>On the plus side, the visuals are nice. The sets were obviously influenced by Alien at the time, but today look more like a cross between the drab utilitarian interiors of that film and the older way-out futurism of visionary artist Chesley Bonestell (the space station, ships and star-scapes recall the famous artist's vision) and the thin story will keep you watching - just not that much. But above all, the real attraction is Harvey Keitel - who speaks in a very precise accent. It's Keitel as you've never seen (with a cool euro-looking ponytail) or heard (his voice was dubbed) him before.  Even if Keitel's character is too vague to drive the story, he's still fun to watch (and hear).  You know that the robot will go for him first, and his loss is what kills this film as much as his presence gives it a life that (like the robot) it doesn't really deserve.
B000002UAO|5.0|I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend.  I'd consider myself a &quot;Beatles-junkie&quot; and have most albums.  I had overlooked this particular one though.  Now I've listened to it several times and love it.<br />Now reading these reviews...it is obvious that at least one person is a complete and total moron.  To say that the Beatles are a &quot;ripoff of Oasis???&quot;  Obviously either written by a child or somebody with absolutely no clue to the fact that the Beatles pre-date Oasis by over 25 years.  Musically and lyrically the Beatles are far superior...especially if you consider the fact that the group was so far advanced for their time.
0195073401|5.0|This is a really good book for those who are taking graduate courses or comprehensive exams in Microeconomics. It covers almost everything one needs to know about microeconomics and can be used as a reference book. It sure gets into technicalities too, but one has always the option to skip them and focus on general ideas. Still some knowledge of Calculus and Optimization is needed (this is a graduate level book). If you want to start Microeconomics (for those with engineering or science backgrounds) This may not be the first book you want to start with. Sure you may handle the math, but you will fail to master the concepts. An easier more intermediate book is recommended for these people. <br /> <br />The coverage of Consumer and Firm Theory is very good. Graphs and discussions are galore. The book tries to present every degenrate case so that you have been exposed to all problems. The Walrasian and General equilibrium chapters follow the same. It also covers topics on Social welfare and intertemporal decision making too. The chapters about Incentive and Mechanism design are good with some reservation.  <br /> <br /> Only that the \\"Game Theory\\" section is not the best you can find. Some complementary text is recommended for that section. <br /> <br />The practice problems at the end of the chapters are normally difficult but educational. Spending sometime on solving them broadens understanding.
0345452577|3.0|There is no such thing as a bad Jonathan Kellerman novel, but some are better than others.  This standalone presents a number of problems.  The protagonist is a close approximation of Dr. D, but with few of his more attractive traits.  Dr. C is too tentative, too young, too soft.  The plot is interesting and complex, a nice variant on an old theme, but with no interesting twists and turns.  Finally, the setting is fictitious, so we lose some of the texture and local color associated with Kellerman's best work (e.g. BILLY STRAIGHT).  Having said that, the narrative is lean, the story interesting, the writing always expert.  I didn't devour the book, but I returned to it whenever I got the chance.  This would be a top book if Kellerman were not a top talent who always raises our expectations.  Read it, but wait for the paperback.
B0000DZEA1|3.0|The soundtrack is very good, and there are some really memorable tracks.  Minas Tirith/The White Tree is very good, as is the thunderous and ominous Minas Morgul.  The Ride of the Rohirrim is good too.  I was very disappointed though that the track from the trailer is not on there, and extremely disappointed that the spectacular music from just prior to the Rohirrim's charge was left out.  That music combined with that scene was just awesome, and while in the &quot;Pelennor Fields&quot; track you can begin to hear them building to it, it gets cut off and never put back.  Very disappointing.  And the end track could be better too...a pretty song but a bit grating.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This was Bon Scott's last album (I say album, because CDs weren't around in 1979), finished shortly before he died, and it is probably the best AC/DC album of the Bon Scott era.  Every song is good, my favorites being the title song and the final cut, Night Prowler.  The digital remastering makes the music even better, if possible.  If you're a rock fan and you don't like this album, you don't know what rock is.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Got it over the holiday season after hearing so much about it and I consider it a CLASSIC!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Very well done, excellent camera angles, very good sound quality...a must have for any Cher fan.
0802130208|5.0|Word is the Hollywood Suck Machine plans to turn this brilliant book into a movie. I have a little bit more faith in the taste and decency of movie makers since Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy became something that was the opposite of crappiness. Nevertheless, I'm nervous because A Confederacy of Dunces is something, like The Beatles and my Momma, that you DO NOT mess with.<br />This book is ridiculously good on so many levels. Take, for instance, the main character:<br />Ignatius J Reilly is a colossus, a hypochondriac misfit Everyman put upon by a boozy simpleton of a mother and a cast of goofs incapable of understanding his worldview. Not to mention, he's funny as all get out and simultaneously absurd and real. Toole writes this guy so well that you could imagine him waddling into your bedroom, with a storm of stench laced with the scent of stale tea bags trailing behind him. <br />He's a momma's boy in a low-rent New Orleans neighborhood, a homebody who passes harsh judgment rooted in Medieval authoritarianism on crappy pop culture, modern politics and the dupes who surround him. He is plagued by panic attacks, hypochondria, indigestion and the memory of his long-dead dog, whom he remembers more fondly than his late father.<br />Tragic, right? Yes, but somehow John Kennedy Toole was able to turn this sad sack into a hilarious buffoon of a blowhard. <br />If he were real and living in the 2000s, Ignatius would be like one of those nerdy blogger guys who sit at home, fashioning themselves as a know-it-all talk show host, spewing venom and judgment on a world that doesn't hear them.<br />Ignatius is like a lot of dudes you know. He sits around talking about all the big stuff he's doing: Writing a &quot;manifesto&quot; that he thinks could be made into a movie one day, trying to start a political movement, becoming a voice for the great unwashed. But for all his passion, his short attention span and his half-baked attempts to put his big plans into actioncauses him to constantly defeat himself.<br />AND THAT's JUST ONE CHARACTER!<br />Toole, who was a white dude, does justice to the book's only black protagonist, Burma Jones. Somehow, this uneducated janitor/vagrant comes across as smart and insightful without being a dupe, a clod or what Spike Lee calls &quot;The Super Dooper Magical Negro,&quot; the prototypical Hollywood and literary Black character in White stories who saves all the White people with mystical Voodoo insights or all-out magical powers (see most Coen Brothers' movies or Steven King books for examples of this phenomenon). <br />As far as the movie version of A Confederacy of Dunces goes: The rumor is that Philip Seymour Hoffman or Jack Black would play Ignatius. Both would be perfect, but to be believable even these chubbies would need to gain like 75 pounds to do Toole's king fatty justice. Also, Steven Soderbergh is behind the project. He's like the Midas of Hollywood, so as long as he's doing it, it could be done right.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I've seen the show and listened to the CD. The CD does manage to capture some of the excitement and energy of the show but misses a great deal of the story line. I think a more informative booklet would have taken care of that. Still, a nice document of 2 extraordinary talents (Menzel &amp; Chenowith) at the height of their collective powers. Perhaps the only disappointing performance was that of Joel Grey. Where some saw charm I saw mugging. Where others saw &quot;classic musical theater style&quot; I saw a sleepwalker. I'm sure I'm in the minority on this, but that's the way it goes.<br />While the music can be uneven, it's not a horrible score and there are moments that are quite good. It's certainly a score that needs to be listened to a few times. Then again, I really like the score to Children of Eden, so maybe it's just that I like Schwartz' work.<br />To those folks get upset because the musical doesn't always follow the book.... Get over it!! Have you ever read the source material for The Sound of Music? Cabaret? The King &amp; I? <br />Let me assure you, though Isherwood is a fascinating writer, for pure entertainment Cabaret has I Am A Camera beat by a mile. As for the King &amp; I... the writings of the original Anna are awful; I mean really awful. The Von Trapp story, while pleasant, isn't exactly the stuff of musical theater legend. The shows began with the ideas of the writers but developed in ways that are more appropriate for the theater.
B000002HK4|5.0|This falls right were Dream theater was at their peak. Better than Images and Words, because they had not found their feet since the departure of the their former singer. Better than Awake because if is more complex and not all fast distortion. The real stand for everyone is the 23 minute epic Change of Seasons. But the covers and meddles of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd(two of my other favorite bands) are fantastic. Although the covers sound exactly like the originals, save the vocals of Labri. The drumming is superb and as always Pettruci pulls the solos of beautifully. James Labri's voice is extremely volitile sometimes beautiful and serine, and sometimes screechy of flat and ear peircing. If you don't mind a vocalist that tries new things than by it emidiately, if you don't that's your choice but try it anyway
B000002IP1|5.0|Whether you are a big fan of Phil Collins, or you thought Phil Collins was just some ridiculous 80's phony popstar, I would recommend you give But Seriously a listen. Of course, if you are a fan, then you probably already have heard this album a thousand times and agree with me, but if you are the latter, you will be surprised at how intense and how artisitic this album is.<br />Up until 1989 Phil dominated both TV and radio airwaves with his suave and cool music videos and songs, ranging from the sweet rock coolness of In The Air Tonight to the bubbly pop of Two Hearts. But Seriously gave Phil a new credibility. Here he is more than just that, he is a perfectionist artist.<br />The first single showed, for the first time, Phil Collins singing a different tune from his past hits, a song about the poor and homeless, Another Day In Paradise. The song became a worldwide anthem that year sparking repeated airplay and earning the grammy for best song. For many, this song is the highlight of the album. But in truth, its just one of a lot of hightlights. Actually, the entire album was the highlight of the moment.<BR>The maturity of That's Just The Way It Is, Father To Son, and All Of My Life can easily cast over Another Day In Paradise. The sweet love ballad Do You Remember?, which appears in the soundtrack of Nicholas Cage's 1990 bomb Fire Birds, is deliciously good. The chilling rock epic I Wish It Would Rain Down that features guitar work from Eric Clapton dawns as a remarkable highlight on the album. Colors follows in the theme of Another Day In Paradise as a moment to give a thought to the poor and homeless. The album's closer Find A Way To My Heart, another track that was featured in the soundtrack to the Nicholas Cage flop Fire Birds, is an excellent pick for the closing of such a genuine album. The song opens up with some really cool electronic sounds and then slowly escalates and progresses into one big bang of a song. <br />Phil Collins still is around today, still making music but nothing as good as But Seriously. You might still think his earlier stuff from the early 80's was amazing, but seriously, this is Phil Collins' best album!<br />A+
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wow- I was really impressed. I haven't really listened to britney much lately because her older stuff sounded kinda childish and pop-ish. But I was really surprised. I got the Cd for christmas -bc I liked the song with madonna and expected the rest of the CD to suck - and just be typical britney - but it's not. It's got alot of different sounds and better beats on it. I would definetly recomend this! It's worth the money - most of the the songs are really good - and not the typical teeny bob stuff she was putting out.
B00003CXPD|4.0|I was surpirised to read that in many american reviews the accent was mistaken for IRISH! as a proud citizen of the north east of england i would like to confrim that it is a strong GEORDIE accent which originates in Newcastle and has traveled to Durham.the film is very moving and shows how times were hard in the mid 80's during the iron lady's government.Jamie Bell is fantastic an thoroughly deserved his BAFTA,for which he beat the mighty Tom Hanks!. Once you get past the over used F~~~ word it is a joy to watch, the sound track is brilliant. Just dont expect anything to be sugar coated, its not that kind of film.
0451191153|5.0|This was the most interesting book I've ever read. The greatest part of it was the way the author seemed to mock her readers: by totally agreeing with her philosophy, arren't you just as bad as Toohey's supporters. On the other hand, if you don't agree with her concepts, then you're actually more of a second-hander than the average human because you don't even know that the kind of power Toohey got was the exact type of thing that happens today. As a high school student I know well that her portrayal of the public is right on, because we live in a world where people strive to emulate their fellow man, but why do all kids have to wear the same name brands, and why do modern buildings need Reniassance or Classic style? Why is it that we seek happiness through the acception of our fellow human beings, shouldn't happiness come from inside of ourselves. In the end, isn't your own body the only thing that is truly yours? I don't agree with everything in the novel, I believe in an ordered society and in religion, but how can we have a wonderful society without great individuals to contribute to it? This novel was a wonderful piece of work, written in the extreme to clearly convey Rand's philosophy, I found it thoroughly enjoyable.
B000000W6F|5.0|For anyone who is willing to call Smashing Pumpkins just another angsty rock band of the 90's, Gish without a doubt proves them completely wrong. The musicianship on this album is stunning. The originality of the music is outstanding. Far from the grunge trends of the time, Billy Corgan (one of the most underrated guitarists of recent) combines his psychedelic guitars with Jimmy Chamberlin's amazing drumming flawlessly. This, along with Nevermind and Siamese Dream, is a key album of the early 90's that everyone should own.
0060934913|4.0|I just finished this book and agree with everyone else; it's a good page-turning read.  My husband used to work in a restaurant and everything he ever told me about the goings-on in the kitchen was confirmed with spot-on precision in the book.The author is pretty honest about himself too--full of ego, testosterone and a jerk to boot--and then makes humble admissions about his own shortcomings in his chosen profession.  It would have been nice to find out whatever happened to his parents and brother and how they view his success; and how/where he met his wife,  but maybe he's saving that for another book.
B000089RVX|3.0|Okay, now this is an interesting album. In a genre that is predominately run by male vocalists, here stands Amy Lee, a woman with a hauntingly beautiful voice that adds a sense of creepiness to the songs. I'll admit it, this CD gains extra points with me because of this. There aren't many alternatives to this if you want a harder rock (or something like that...classifying this album would be hard and pointless) album with a woman lead singer who has such a beautiful voice. But don't get me wrong, her voice goes surprisingly well with the music, and I couldn't imagine it any other way. Her voice adds a new dimension to the music bringing it a very eery feel that I think works well. This album is not without is downfalls though, so let's break it down:<br />The good about Fallen:<BR>There are some good songs here, and some of them are most certainly very catchy (their first single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is a good example). &quot;Going Under&quot; is a fairly good track that makes it apparent as to what Evanescence plans to do. With power chords dropping in immediately and a piano softly playing in the background, Amy Lee makes it apparent that her voice is an added instrument in the sense that it creates such an effect through mood-setting and that she is very much to be taken seriously. &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is the first of their songs that I heard, and it's just plain catchy. I think this is one of the best tracks on the album and melds the back-up vocals in well with a good back-and-forth delivery on choruses. &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; shows some cool string work at the beginning and throughout, but starts to sounds pretty similar. Then we get a break with &quot;My Immortal.&quot; This is a good song: a very slow, piano-driven song that just is quite brilliant. It also breaks up the monotony and pulls them out of that trap. &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is another stand-out track, with some nice lyrics and vocals. I just love it when she breaks from her normal singing and screams in the background, &quot;I want to die.&quot; &quot;My Imaginary&quot; is also a good song here with good instrumentals and just a good &quot;feel&quot; to it. It tends to stand out because of the use of various other instruments in the background. &quot;Hello&quot; is another slower song that changes the pace of the album. This isn't as good as &quot;My Immortal,&quot; but I like it placement in the album and it's got a very beautiful sound to it with the piano in the background. Lyrically, I'm not so impressed with it, but then I let her voice just become an instrument and I'm more satisfied.<br />The best thing about this album is Amy Lee. She does an excellent job with a haunting voice that sets the mood perfectly. Some of the songs are also very catchy, while others show some heart-felt emotion. And I love the use of an orchestra in &quot;Whisper.&quot; That's a nice touch that really made that song.<br />The bad:<BR>A lot of the songs begin to sound pretty similar, especially after a few listens to the album. I mean, when you get into the later stages of the album, we're just starting to hear the same stuff again. It's not BAD; it's just not exciting now, nor is it as good as the beginning stuff. There is some musical diversity spread throughout (the orchestra on the last track for instance), but not enough to keep my interest for too long. Lyrically, I have some complaints on some of the songs, but I guess I can't expect ground-breaking lyrics with every band, so I won't complain too much about this (besides, it's only a sporadic problem here). As much as I love Lee's voice, the taste of what else she might be able to do (from &quot;Tourniquet&quot;) leaves me wanting more diversity that I know she could delivery but doesn't. However, I still love the vocals here, so it's not really a downside so much as leaving me wanting more. My main complaint is that the songs are simply not varied enough to keep my interest for too long. I'll listen to it, then it'll be put aside for a while (a long while), then I'll give it another few listens and do the same thing. It just doesn't have the staying power I wish it did.<br />Overall however, this is not a bad album. With unique vocals and some catchy songs, it won't bring down your collection, but I'd suggest sampling some of the songs and listening to them a few times to see if you get bored with them easily. If so, you may find this won't keep your interest. But man, her voice just goes so well with the music.<br />Overall rating: 65/100
B0000CEB4V|5.0|When I stumbled on this DVD it seemed to good to be true. It isn't. As it turns out, its better. Impeccable performances, beautifully edited. Clapton, Lynne, and Preston rule the roost during the entire concert. Sir Paul comes in at the end, but is just plain overshadowed. No wonder he was a bit snarky. He wasn't allowed to finish his ukelele version of &quot;Something&quot; (Eric takes over and just soars!). And then Eric and Jeff follow and just *kill* with an extended version of &quot;Wah Wah&quot;. This, by the by, was George's best &quot;Paul can be a royal pain&quot; tune. Sir Paul meanwhile is relegated to noodling along on the piano on the far side of the stage.<BR>This was indeed a concert for George. Peace, my friend, wherever you are.
B000089RVX|5.0|Great cd all around.  Amy's vocals are perfect and the band sounds great.  'My Immortal' shows that even a rock band can belt out a beeautiful ballad.
B00008OLYN|1.0|yes opeth is an original band but also very boring and extremely overrated.<BR>avoid this band.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|It's kind of an average performance for Sarah.  I definately expected it to be alot better.  'Fallen' was the only song that really jumped out at me the others were...dare I say it....blah?
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I was so excited to recieve Britney Spears' new cd for Christmas, but after listening to the whole thing I only liked about 2 or 3 songs and was very dissapointed. Britney's new cd &quot;In the Zone&quot; is very different than her past 3 cds and I guess she is trying to come up with a new sound. However, her new sound isn't working, because if you look at the charts, even Hilary Duff's album (whom I didn't like as well) is doing better on the charts than Britney's and it has been out longer. I think Britney is losing her touch and has gone from attempting to sing to moaning and whispering.She should also never co-write any songs again because those are the ones that i couldn't stand at all on her new cd.

B00006879E|5.0|I borrowed the cd from a friend, and i love it! i'm definitely going to get a copy for myself. The last song on the album (my favorite) &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot; is great, i love this song! Overall the album is really good, i don't really have another group to compare them to... but the cd is mellow yet funky... melodic... has nice lyrics...and just an overall great sound!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|in 10 years this will be the only version available. do you really think there will be a surround-sound mix made of the original album?<br />is paul going to sing &quot;when im 64&quot; to the queen when he's 64? or to madonna?<br />now that he's &quot;won&quot; the &quot;winding road&quot; argument, he's getting everyone involved in his next fight: &quot;yesterday&quot;. look, paul, write some NEW great songs, &amp; leave the &quot;lennon-mccartney&quot; agreement you made with John alone! remember how anthology 1 was strictly chronological? then anthology 2 had &quot;im down&quot; moved up [to put a rocker earlier in the sequence, and not, i'm sure, to put a paul song in amongst the five or so opening john songs]. then anthology 3 was totally messed up [can't have all those george demos in a row now can we?]. first he'll get people to agree that &quot;yesterday&quot; should be &quot;his&quot; [or AT LEAST &quot;mccartney-lennon&quot;], then just watch! everything is up for grabs. will you give george co-credit for &quot;eleanor rigby&quot;? [the &quot;ahh, look at all the lonely people&quot; bit was his.] how about donovan for the last verse of &quot;submarine?&quot; it's a slippery slope, my friend.<br />paul is a fantastic musician. however, he'll be the last beatle standing most likely, &amp; he'll finally be able to say: &quot;I AM the beatles! maybe i'll put out a new beatles album! i can play all the parts! John was the straight one! I was the wild one! I really WAS the walrus! did i mention stockhausen? carnival of light?!?&quot; poor paul, confined to revising the beatles myths, &amp; with so much to offer!<br />ps: the original version of the song &quot;let it be&quot; was orchestrated by george martin with the beatles full approval and NOT phil spector. you see what confusion all that whining creates? if you dont want to be known as the &quot;straight one, obsessed with PR&quot; then stop acting like it!
B00009TB5G|5.0|the best film of this age has been released and is sure to go down as the best ever. The Lord of the rings is truley the Lord of the screens.
B00005JMFR|5.0|To fully understand the trilogy you must watch \\"The animatrix\\" and play the video game \\"Enter the Matrix\\" remember when reloaded began, a young boy came running to Neo saying how Neo saved him, how he got him out. In \\"the animatrix\\" it shows that, it shows the ship that they got messages from, being destroyed. \\"Enter the Matrix\\" shows the transformation of the oracle, Capt Niobe retrieviving information not mentioned in the movies.   I think \\"Revolutions\\" was a great movie but, it did leave alot unanswered, and this is not and ending if you remember the conversation of the artitect and the oracle, this is merely a \\"hold up for a while\\" until we bring something else, it's not a finish. It's a must see movie!
0385504209|5.0|Wow! I have not read a book that kept me glued to edge of my seat as much as this book. I couldn't stop thinking about it even after turning the lights off. Absolutely recommend.
B00005QCVY|5.0|This ethereal film does what all movies should do: promote the love of one's family, community, honor, principles, and most importantly, one's self. The movie emphasizes on how we all touch each other's lives in ways we will never know. It's a great Holiday movie to watch with your family or loved ones. It's also a great self-esteem boosting flick for those nights when you feel down.<br />Jimmy Stewart is absolutely phenomenal and in the movie he represents the good in all of us. He tries to save his little town, Bedford Falls, from the evils of Mr. Potter who represents the evil in all of us.<br />&quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is truly a wonderful movie and a genuine classic. It will reinstate hope and cheer back in your heart as it makes your eyes tear from the goodness of Bedford Falls; the kind of goodness we all wish existed in our world today. I highly recommend it with all my heart.
B000002KHH|4.0|The Sabs get tighter and more lethal on their second slab.  I first heard this (as a then-rabid Kiss fan) from my girlfriend's uncle in 1979 and just thought &quot;WOW!&quot; at the heaviness.  Since then, I've had it in several forms of LP, cassette and now CD.<br />The first album was history-making in its own right, but it was much more reflective of the improvisational jamming of the time, at which Messrs. Iommi, Butler and Ward of course excelled.  This is a much tighter album, with more actual songs and less jamming (&quot;Rat Salad&quot; aside).<br />Tony Iommi proves on every cut that he is probably the most underated guitarist in heavy metal - a style he virtually invented.  For all the praise (rightly) heaped on contemporaries such as Blackmore, Beck, Page and Townshend, he deserves at least equal recognition.  Crushing power chords and fluid soloing are both well within his grasp (nobody does it better than he), as is mellow jazz-type noodling (&quot;Planet Caravan&quot;).  Not bad for a guy missing part of his fingers, as even Ozzy has admitted.<br />Geezer Butler and Bill Ward defined the heavy metal rhythm section.  Geezer is the real lynchpin with his four strings alternately thundering, singing and scaring throughout this album.  Bill Ward has often said that his drumming is more of an orchestral accompaniment to Tony's rhythms, and that is most certainly true.<br />This is an essential album for any serious student of HM music.  Those who know Ozzy Osbourne for his '80s albums and current TV persona need to hear this to know where he came from.<br />And Ozz himself?  He's no singer (which he admits), and for that reason this album loses a star.  However, I have to admit that early Sabbath would not have happened without him.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I decided to hold off reviewing this beloved epic until I have seen it in its entirety and now that I have I confidently and enthusiastically cry out a big WOW for the most impressive epic film ever made.<br />Every single aspect of this film is infused with Peter Jackson's (director) ingenious and exquisite vision. The colossal production is very evident throughout the trilogy and the mesmerizing special effects are exactly that ... mesmerizing. Filming this epic in one shot was perhaps the most brilliant idea Peter Jackson had for this film. Over the past three years, every December fans take off from where we left off the previous year without feeling a discrepancy here or there in the characters, the landscape or pace. It's as if we were suspended in the no-time zone for a year after year ready to experience the magic of the Ring.<br />The ensemble cast is magnificent as well. I cannot pick favorites (even though I loved Sam Gamgee) for that every single actor did an outstanding job depicting his/her character and together they played an ethereal symphony Beethovenian in caliber. J. R. R. Tolkien's characters represented the full gamut of human nature and Peter Jackson was able to recreate that on the screen with stark detail. From the peace-loving, innocent hobbits to the evil and sinister Orcs lies the perpetually confused, unpredictable man. The epic in a way represents the microcosm of life: a perpetually peculiar battle between perceived good and perceived evil.<br />Fall from grace, confusion, dilemmas, hard decisions, community strength, courage and triumph are some of the many underlying themes of this universally adored work of art. Some people have dismissed this film as a \\"fantasy flick\\", but in reality it is an epic with an incredible impact like that of Ben Hur's, Spartacus' and Gladiator's combined!<br />This film is one of my all time favorites and I do recommend it to all.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I remember listening to this when I was about 9 or 10. I loved it, and still do. My favorite tracks are What's My Name, Gin and Juice, Serial Killa, For All My N's and B's, and Murder Was the Case. Snoop's latest album is good, but not as gangsta as this, because the Neptunes had to interfere.
B00009TB5G|4.0|i absolutely HATE the fact that both extended LOTR editions split up the movie on two discs. That's absolutely absurd. The Gladiator DVD has TONs of material on both discs, so the technology is definitely there. DVD's can hold way more than 3.5 hours that the movie is. Other than that annoying trait that's obviously not going to change (because they can charge more for 4-discs than 2), this is a great edition that fills in a few more blanks that the theatrical version had to have to fit into studio preferred time limits.
B00005JKC3|5.0|It's getting easier to get worked up about superhero movies, when independent directors get interested in them - including X2 and Spider-Man. And Hulk has Ang Lee - who injected a new cinematographical vision and a new vision of his superhero, made them more interesting instead of standard Hollywood clichés. <br />The Hulk is Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), scientist, who becomes a green super-powerful hulk when angered. The back story to Banner is much more interesting than most superheroes. His father, David (Nick Nolte), worked for the US government. But when his plans for human experimentation were rejected, he experimented on his own DNA. When he has a son, his scientific curiosity overrules the moral problem of giving birth to a dangerous mutant. A series of not quite specified events lead to David Banner being imprisoned by the US Army for more than thirty years. <br />Bruce Banner is genetically pushed to research the same areas than his father has. He has an ambiguous relationship with Betty (Jennifer Connelly), his laboratory partner. An evil military corporation in cahoots with the government is trying to acquire their research by all means necessary. But when Bruce is involved in a laboratory accident irradiating him with gamma radiation which prods his mutant genes into action, all hell breaks loose as he becomes Hulk. Betty's father, a high-ranking military officer, eventually gains custody of the green behemoth. <br />As I wrote before, Hulk is a mix between the movie Invincible and the Hulk character - retaining the Hulk character while telling it in a fable-like manner. Hulk is told like a comic book. In some scenes, the cinematography is arranged like a comic book : there is fast cutting from &quot;picture&quot; to &quot;picture&quot;, you see two things happening at once, or two, three, five angles of the same thing at once. A scene melds into another, a backdrop literally drops, a victim stays suspended in the air as he is engulfed in flames. True, the fast cutting can be detrimental sometimes. And the techniques don't always work. But I would say that it never impacts negatively on the movie, and on the whole it works. <br />The story and themes revolve around the relationship between father and child, especially between Bruce and David Banner. Betty trusts her father compulsively even though he cannot sustain human relationships. David Banner is obsessively concerned with his genetic research, but has a tender, if twisted, concern for his son. Critics have pondered on the Freudian themes of these relationships : I didn't see such themes per se, although it is implied that father and son are ultimately two sides of the same coin. As we see in a climatic ending, David Banner is concerned with destroying their enemies, while Bruce doesn't want to take responsibility for his unwanted powers. <br />The original Bruce Banner was an intelligent man, but as the green behemoth he seemed to lose all humanity, to become an unthinking brute. The Bruce Banner in &quot;Hulk&quot; is truly an ubermensch, an Objectivist hero. He fights against the military and military agencies - at first to survive and help his girlfriend. He is an intelligent scientist and a powerful being capable of compassion. While during the movie his two sides are not integrated (he ponders that being Hulk is &quot;like a dream&quot; where he has little control), at the end of the movie we see that he is finally integrated and confident in his abilities. <br />Hulk is a revolutionary, progressist movie in many aspects - it sees genetic research and scientific progress not as a Frankenstein but as a valid means of revolution. It also has anti-imperialist and anti-American overtones. It's quite incredible that this movie even got made, let alone as a major feature. I can't really describe the long climatic ending which ties all this together, because that would be a major spoiler, but be warned that it will force you to re-evaluate the movie in an important way. <br />There has been a lot of criticism, and some praise, for the Hulk model. From a distance, the model is good, but it's from up close that it really shines. With more than a hundred layers, the model appears realistic, the skin moves with touch, and moves around with more than a thousand independent muscles. Ang Lee's goal was to make people forget they were looking at a computer model and, while I can't say it worked completely, it certainly succeeded to some extent. The other actors are also excellent, especially Connelly, who can always bring intelligence to her roles. <br />Director Ang Lee is a Buddhist, and inserts a couple of references in the movie through David Banner, which was fun. In the end, what really sells Hulk is not only its heroic themes and its deep character analysis, but that it keeps a total depth of story and character while the cinematography transforms this great movie into a comic book. Truly stunning. <br />The DVD opens with non-skippable ads (including, ironically, one for Bruce Almighty). That's unfortunate, but unavoidable. <br />Most of the criticism against Hulk is that it is too sophisticated. Well, if you think that's a bad thing, you shouldn't be watching movies. You should be watching flickering images on screens - well, blockbusters made by formulatic directors. All those critics are idiots. <br />It's interesting to me that great things happen when more &quot;arthouse&quot; directors deal with more down-to-earth material - Tarkovsky and science-fiction, or Bergman and the Dark Ages, for example. Ang Lee has definitively succeeded in pushing superhero movies to the next level. And it is certainly great science-fiction : while it's supposed to take place in the present, the technologies are superior to our own, and the technology takes an integral part in the plot and themes, and so Hulk is definitively science-fiction in my book.
B000088E6D|5.0|Mr. Buble has such a delightful and charming voice that it makes me so happy to have found his CD.  I saw his interview on 60 Minutes or Dateline or some News show and was impressed with his intelligence, attitude and devotion to the classics.  Hopefully he has just started on this journey and will continue to create some wonderful music.
B00008EYA5|5.0|Ok so maybe there have been tons of shooting action movies recently. Who cares its entertainment. Its one of those movie to buy because u can watch it over and over again, and it's still fun to watch
B00000JGOJ|5.0|This is the movie I always recommend, no matter who asks.  My teenaged daughters and their friends have enjoyed as well as my friends and co-workers.  I have watched this movie many times and find a little something more each time.<br />The story appears at first to be a series of unrelated stories that   begin and end aburptly, leaping from one set of characters to another randomly.  Gradually a pattern begins to emerge and connections begin to appear, some I anticipated but others caught me totally off guard.  The various relationships - couples, parent/child, siblings, in-laws - all ring true.  These are characters that draw a viewer into their lives.<br />It would be difficult to say who 'stars' in this film. The cast is packed with well-known actors, Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Connery, Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid, Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart and Madeleine Stowe. All give stellar performances but none dominate the movie or distract from the story.      <br />There is no violence, some profanity and sexual situations but nothing graphic or excessive.  The only flaw I see in this gem is after having nearly every character in this film repeat the line about \\"talking about love is like dancing about architecture\\" why did they change the title from the original 'Dancing About Architecture' to the very forgettable 'Playing By Heart'?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched a few episodes of Firefly during it's TV run but never really got into it.  I thought it showed promise, but it's Friday time slot and periodic preemption meant I didn't see much of the show during it's TV run. I can't say exactly why I decided to get the DVD set, but I am very, very glad I did.<br />FOX's second biggest crime against Firefly (the first being lacking enough faith in the show to give it a fighting chance to find an audience) was their totally random episode broadcast order.  On the DVD set, you can trace plot threads and watch characters grow and change.  The rules of the Firefly 'verse are clearly shown up front in &quot;Serenity&quot;, rather than at the end of it's TV run, so things make more sense.<br />But is it any good?  In a word, &quot;yes&quot;.  Most ensemble casts take a season or two to really come together as a believable &quot;family&quot;, but the very talented cast click from the first episode.  The stories are intriguing and well written (again, the proper episode order makes a huge difference), visually, both the show itself and the CGI are beautiful and the dialog is packed with patented Joss Whedon humor.<br />My biggest concern when buying the set proved to be unfounded.  The series only ran half a season and was unceremoniously dumped by FOX, so how many dangling plot threads are there and (shudder) did it end with an unanswered cliff hanger type ending?  &quot;A few&quot; and &quot;no&quot;.  The characters are deep and unlike on most shows, not every bit of information you need to know about them is spilled in the first 20 minutes.  As such, you do have some questions you wish the producers and writers had been given time to answer (and probably will in the movie currently being discussed over at Universal), but nothing that takes away from the overall saga.  The ending of the series itself is very satisfying and leaves you wanting to spend more time with these characters, just as any good TV show or movie should.<br />Just think of it as a 15 hour film that is ripe for a sequel (or two, or seven).  Although it is complete unto itself, it still provides lots of room for future growth (after all, Joss was planning for this to last a few years).  For what you would normally spend on +/- two DVDs, you get 15 hours of very re-watchable primary content, plus some decent extras and good commentaries).   If you took the time to read this review, you are obviously thinking about buying it.  Do it and you will never regret your decision.
0553577123|1.0|Lets just start out saying, if I could I would give this book 0 stars.<br />Recently, I had to read this book for school. Trying to get through this book was phisicaly painful. There is no plot what-so-ever. She just skips from one topic to another.<br />This book is so boring and dry, that the most intresting part might be when she talks about peeling potatos.<br />If I could I would burn all of the copies of this book, so people don't have to go through the hardships I did.<br />If you have at least one brain cell, you won't buy this book.
B00003CXI0|5.0|As soon as the Harry Potter books arrived on bookshleves across the world, ready for retail, they were a legend. Why? It's quite simple, really. The key word is escapism. Children would love to be Harry Potter, sent away from their parents at an early age and then rescued by a giant and flown on a motorbike to a castle that teaches children to be the world's best witches and wizards. Unfortunately, however much of a classic these works of fiction are, every child is disappointed at the end of the day. But hey! Fiction is fiction, and it should stay like that. Harry Potter's parents were killed by Voldemort, an evil satanic wizard, and he is left to live in a cupboard with his bullyish cousins, the Dursleys. However, Hagrid rescues him well and takes him to the place of his dreams: Hogwarts School. Fighting through the toughest adventures possible, with an added touch of friendship and future romanticism, such a film entertains, and yet brings positive emotions to the viewer. Beautiful music by John Williams accompanies; and what's more, special effects are carefully used to really bring the viewer into the film himself. A brilliant, high budget movie, suitable for any ages, and certainly resemblant of the books themselves, this movie must be awarded five stars. A great work of fiction; I hope to watch and read the stories again and again. Fantastic.
B0000CAQ27|3.0|I loved this album on the release date...then I got off the caffeine high and over the initial hype!!  We've all heard \\"Trouble\\", which I REALLY liked in the beginning but now it's starting to get old.  \\"Oh My God\\" is Pink's sex song according to the bonus DVD.  It's good, but it would be a total snoozefest if it weren't for Peaches' dirty rap!  \\"Tonight's the Night\\" is sort of a mediocre mellow version of \\"Get The Party Started\\".  You just have to be in the right mood for this one.  \\"Walk Away\\" is reminescent of Avril Lavigne or Michelle Branch's \\"The Spirit Room\\".  It sounds like it belongs on the next major teen movie.  Everyone's heard \\"God Is A DJ\\"-much better than her first single!!  \\"The Last To Know\\" is an excellent in-your-face uptempo.  \\"Waiting For Love\\"-a classic!!  It's a take on classic rock, but with Pink's own original touch to it!!  \\"Love Song\\" is a beautiful, personal ballad about Pink finally finding \\"the one\\"! Now, \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\" is just a terrible song!  It's too repetitive with no musical or vocal variety.  Sounds like a reject from \\"Can't Take Me Home\\".  The remainder of the tracks are mediocre rock songs.  They make Pink look like she's trying a bit too hard to emulate classic rock music!  Perhaps, Pink should take her own advice and not \\"Try Too Hard\\".  Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate a good rock song.  But not when it sounds like everything else I've heard before!!  For example, the chanting of \\"we don't want to go home\\", in \\"Humble Neighborhoods\\", reminds me of the classic rock song with the chant \\"we don't need no education\\".  I'm not sure of that song's title, but everyone should recognize it immediately!!  Overall, a very mediocre album.  \\"Try This\\" cannot even compare to the more emotional and personal feel of \\"Missundaztood\\"!  Makes me wonder if Pink is starting to lose her crowning touch.
B000000WFF|4.0|&quot;Spiceworld&quot; is not as good as &quot;Spice&quot;, but much better than &quot;Forever&quot;. It's a fun album to listen too.<br />1. Spice Up Your Life - This song is okay. It tends to grind on the nerves a little for some reason, and a little on the dull side.<br />2. Stop - This is a great, fun song to listen to. One of the best on the album. Everything about this song is catchy.<br />3. Too Much - My second favorite Spice Girl song. It's a pretty song, and never gets old. The girl's voices are great here, and everything about it is great.<br />4. Saturday Night Divas - This song is an alright song. Not the best, and not the worst. It sounds like a disco type song, but also sounds like a lame filler for the next song &quot;Never Give Up on the Good Times&quot;.<br />5. Never Give Up On the Good Times - This is another great song on this album. It has a great beat and is much better than &quot;Saturday Night Divas&quot; which should have been left off the album. The lyrics are good, and it's fun to listen too.<br />6. Move Over - Worst song from the Spice Girls. I hate it.<br />7. Do It - This is a pretty good song. It's catchy as well and a good song to recover to from the mess of &quot;Move Over&quot;.<br />8. Denying - Another great song. It sounds different from most of their songs on this album, with a funky type of beat.<br />9. Viva Forever - Another good song. It's a sleepy song, and can lull you to sleep for the girls sound great on it.<br />10. The Lady Is A Vamp - A horrible closing song. Should had been left off the album, and the girls sound terrible.
B000002NBY|5.0|This album, after nearly 20 years, is still fresh musically and brilliant lyrically.  The collaborations with other top-notch musicians (Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Adrian Belew, Linda Ronstadt, ect.) add to the texture of the album and make this sound like a soundtrack of diverse community.
4789004546|5.0|This book is about as good as a language book can be. Ten years in Japan, I can still trace my fluency to what I read in this book. Concise, clear, relevant descriptions and examples. Arguably the most informative book written for any language.
B0000CFWZA|1.0|how is it that these creed-clones are able to make a sophomore album?!<br />the music is boring and clichee.  kroeger is an egotistical ass not worthy of your money.<br />what a waste of plastic
B00000JGHM|5.0|Okay, you have Pacino and De Niro.  Brilliant detective vs. brilliant criminal.  Reminiscent to Mann's early film Thief (James Caan, 1981), the bad guy (De Niro) wants to retire from his life of crime and finds the perfect woman with whom to share his life. While De Niro tries to complete his personal life Pacino's charcter's personal life is falling apart.  Both realize their priorities, but this crime is getting in the way with a life of its own.<br />Great action throughout the movie.  However, the best movie shoot-out ever filmed makes this a must-see.  Did the real-life bank robbers in the infamous North Hollywood shoot-out (1997) see Heat?  It was like life imitating art with a similar tragic ending. This is one film that truly delivers on its title.
B00005U122|5.0|I only have one thing to say. Pink Floyd is dead, people who buy this dvd buys a roger waters dvd not a pink floyd dvd as you can see on it. So please don't make your evaluation comparing it with Pink Floyd but make it only by itself. And by itself , although pink floyd sounds better, this dvd has a great quality.
B000002GBK|3.0|Arthur was the first album I ever bought. I was instantly hooked on this outrageous rocker with his blend of classical and rock synthesizer playing. I thought Arthur was the best record ever released.<br />I was 15 at the time. My opinion, like my waistline, has changed over time. Arthur still sounds magical to me in parts, but overall I think it's been surpassed by at least 10 other Wakeman offerings, and probably dozens more from the same genre by other artists. It sounds heavy and repetitive in contrast to the brilliance of Journey to the Centre of the Earth and Six Wives, and the lyrics and vocalists, well, less said the better. <br />However, I still get a kick out of listening to it. The opening and Title track is the best as far as I'm concerned - a great theme, simple yet memorable. Lancelot is a fresh take on the opener, Guinevere would be more enjoyable without Ashley Holt groaning over it, and Merlin is a great Moog track which should be shorter. The Last Battle is narrated over keyboards and choir rather like Journey and has the best feel and genuine exploration of the Arthur theme of all the tracks. <br />Galahad is fairly forgettable, and I think the whole idea peters out several times, possibly due to Wakeman's health at the time (he wrote it in hospital recovering from a heart attack.) There are moments of individual brilliance, but overall not one of Wakeman's best.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm saying that, and I'm a guy, but it only makes me more manly.  I'm a grad student at UCLA, and I just finished watching the whole Firefly DVD (I'd only seen two episodes before), and I'm now a diehard Firefly fan--just as hardcore as any other hardcore Firefly fan on the internet.<br />Thank God for you Joss Whedon!  After watching War Stories (&quot;No power in the 'verse can stop me&quot;) and after watching Objects in Space, I just walked around and basked in the glowing, inspiring feeling, and thought about how beautiful life is.<br />It's my second favorite show, after Buffy the Vampire Slayer--but I've already come to love River probably as much as I ever loved Buffy.<br />If the show continues in any form--a movie, a TV series, a book, or something else--and I pray to God that it does--then I will watch it religiously, tell all my family and friends to watch it, and generally spend a lot of money on it.  Hear that, all you TV and movie execs who are thinking of picking up Firefly!
B000002GBJ|5.0|To some people Rick Wakeman is flashy and self-indulgent. Well, that's why I love him. He's unique and nobody else sounds anything like him, which is partly why he will be remembered. The other part is that he wrote some damm good stuff, especially his first solo outing here. <br />There are six tracks which are supposed to interpret Henry 8's six wives. If you want them to, Rick. I don't go for this idea much, but it is brilliant music whosever musical portraits you want to put upon it, and it was certainly fantastic marketing in the early 70s - classically-influenced synthesizers with some old English history chucked in by a long-haired precocious prog rocker. Nice mix.<br />The six tracks are more than just keyboards for their own sakes - they are strong and complex compositions, well arranged with interesting timbral choices between the different instruments - lots of theme and variation, different moods such as jazzy pieces like Anne Boleyn and traditional organ arrangements like Jane Seymour (which is a little too Bach Toccata-like for me, but this was early in Rick's career when he was busting with classical influences.) <br />My favourite pieces are the three Catherines - the opening, Catherine of Aragon is mostly piano with some interesting rhythm changes (try keeping time to it). Catherine Howard is the one most people will know if they've ever been to a Wakeman or a Yes concert but this original version is very different from the one he plays these days with the Celtic jig added. I think his later versions are actually better, but it's still a good solid piece of music.<br />Anne of Cleves is the most unusual track - it almost sounds out of place amongst the more conventional compositions. It's the track that sounds most like a synthesizer exercise, but it's worth a listen (apart from the prominent split note near the beginning!) for the unusual time signatures (again) and the fantastic Hammond organ work and Bill Bruford's drumming together. Yes musicians abound on this album and it does have a slight Yes feel but it's definitely NOT a Yes album and definitely classic Wakeman. <br />I don't think time has worn this one out. If anything I enjoy listening to it more than I did in the past. I love listening to the old analogue sounds. I know nobody would be without digital keyboards these days but there is something about analogue sounds which can't be reproduced - they're more individual, less tinny and less predictable. I guess they were also a nightmare with going out of tune or not working but somehow that added to their individuality - you never knew what you were going to get, which did make for interesting live experiences. <br />Elton John said this album is in his top twenty of all time. Won't argue with him on that.
B000084T18|1.0|I can't believe how bad this is, considering Eminem and Dr Dre were the producers. 50 Cent can't rap - his delivery is monotonous and boring, and he mumbles his lines so that you can hardly make out the words he is trying to say. That's actually a blessing, for once you do make out the lyrics you realise that virtually every song is about how rich he is, how many girls he's slept with, or how he's going to shoot you. He has no ideas, nothing new to offer lyrically. At least you would've expected some dope beats from Dre and Em, but they don't deliver on this boring CD - the only semi-decent tracks on the album are &quot;Wanksta&quot; and  &quot;You Not Like Me&quot;, neither of which are available on the US version of the album, as 50 chooses to stuff it with filler from his own group, G-Unit. Terrible, stay away.
B000002GA8|5.0|If Rick Wakeman could be remembered for one piece of music only, I reckon this should be it. Simply taking on the idea of translating Verne's classic into symphonic rock was audacious enough but to succeed as well as Wakeman does is pretty extraordinary, considering his age (24) and that he did it solo - with some help from orchestrators.<br />Apparently this was recorded live because it was cheaper than carting an orchestra and instruments into a studio for a week. The record company was not convinced, but I think the live 'special event' feel really makes the album, and the performances are pretty good from all involved.<br />Musically, it's brilliant - the main theme is very strong, very simple and very classic but soon the trademark Wakeman synths make their presence felt and thereafter it's a great mix of Moog, electric piano, clavinet, Hammond and orchestra and choir. If there is a letdown it's the choice of vocalists - I keep reading that Ashley Holt is a brilliant singer, but I've yet to hear it. He sounds better suited to this album than others he has collaborated on but he still irritates the pip out of me. <br />The other downside to the album is the lyrics - sorry, Rick but you should have done an Elton and got yourself a lyricist early on. Rick even invents a new word, stupefication. However the cheesy lyrics don't really take much away from the album. The narration is excellent, not only David Hemmings' elocution but the script really brings out Verne's sense of wonder and the pioneering aspect of this very early travel narrative - after all in the 1800s nobody could say you COULDN'T find a vast sea inside the Earth, complete with sea monsters. In fact this narration seems to be one of the better interpretations of Verne's Journey, better than some of the films, anyway.<br />Wakeman's keyboards dazzle, but never dominate or threaten to derail the overall musical experience - highlights are the funky Hohner clavinet solos at about 13 mins (whoever saidWakeman was ugly on a Clavy needs their head read), and the sea monster battle at the start of track two, with lots of Moog lavished around it.<br />As far as the audio sound goes, it's a good remaster, sounds are separated nicely and you can even hear individual choir voices which I don't remember hearing on the original vinyl.<br />I think the strongest aspect of this album is the atmosphere - it's eerie, wondering, and feels like you're on a journey somewhere strange. <br />There have been plenty of marriages of rock and classical music over the years - this one will go down as the standard.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The whole band is in top form here, both as songwriters and musicians. I can't stop listening to this album. Overall, it's a fine-tuning of the sound of their last album; but there are also some pleasantly surprising moments where they successfully recapture the magic of their earlier sounds. The title track, for instance, recalls the over-the-top theatrics and occult themes of NUMBER OF THE BEAST; elsewhere, I hear shades of PIECE OF MIND and FEAR OF THE DARK. All of their classic sounds seem to be perfectly synthesized in one album! The production, too, is impeccable. The hard parts are very hard, and the beautiful parts--especially &quot;Journeyman&quot;, the album's closer--are very beautiful. My favourite, though, is &quot;Face in the Sand&quot;, which marries nice crunchy riffs with aching synths and dark, politically charged lyrics with a menacingly gorgeous melody. Though I naturally like some tracks more than others, there's really not a bad song in the bunch. Has Maiden broken any new ground with DANCE OF DEATH? Not really. But that's fine with me, because Iron Maiden has never sounded like any other band. (Plenty of bands in the past 20 years have, however, sounded suspiciously like Iron Maiden...)<br />Up the irons!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband and I were among the many that were so disappointed to see Firefly cancelled so quickly.  In fact, we have seldom watched the Fox network since.  We purchased the DVD set and have been watching them -- the series is even better than we remember.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this set -- you will find that you will watch them again and again.  We look forward to the movie and hopefully, many more movies with these characters to come.  This series is what regular tv programming should be about -- well written and well acted -- not just some clone of another show.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I would just like to start the review with a comment about the musical. Okay, here it goes... &quot;WOW!&quot; I am a huge fan of The Wizard of Oz and everything associated with it, so of course when I heard about this musical,&quot;The untold story of the witches of Oz,&quot; I HAD to get the soundtrack. I have listened to the soundtrack about three times through since I received it on Christmas. I will now go through song by song and review each one...<br />1. No One Mourns the Wicked<BR>     - The song starts off with power as the orchestra really shows off. The chorus also gives us a very good impression with their beatiful harmony as they proclaim &quot;Good News! The Witch of the West is dead!&quot; Kristin Chenoweth first introduces her beautiful voice with an opera sound. The switching back and forth between present and past is nice here. The song ends triumphantly.<br />2. Dear Old Shiz<BR>     -A nice introduction to the school. The chorus has great harmony here.<br />3. The Wizard and I<BR>     -I love this song! Idina Menzel really shines. She shows great range and gives us a lot to look forward to in the songs to come.<br />4. What is this Feeling?<BR>     -A very cute song. I really like it. I love the musical arrangement and the chorus's involement. Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel have some great harmony.<br />5. Something Bad<BR>     -A nice little song. Shows the faith that the citizens of Oz have for the wizard since Elphaba (Idina Menzel) assures Dr. Dillamond (William Youmans) that nothing bad can happen in Oz.<br />6. Dancing Through Life<BR>     -Wonderful! One of my favorties. Norbert Leo Butz (Fiyero) is great. He has a very nice voice. The rest of the cast involved in this song (Kritin Chenoweth, Idina Menzel, Michelle Federer, Chris Fitzgerald) are great also. The song has a lot of changes in the music and every cast member stays right with it and never skips a beat. The orchestra is awesome during the musical break. I dance along with this song everytime I hear it.<br />7. Popular<BR>     -OMG! Great!! Kristin Chenoweth is hilarious! Especially when she cracks her voice in the middle of the word &quot;Popular.&quot; It is so funny. She has the cutest little voice. Brings back memories of when she played the role of Sally Brown in &quot;You're a Good Man Charlie Brown&quot; singing &quot;My New Philosophy.&quot;<br />8. I'm Not That Girl<BR>     -Another great one from Idina Menzel. Very soft and sweet.<br />9. One Short Day<BR>     -A great song to show off the voices of the chorus as their voices blend very nicely.<br />10. A Sentimental Man<BR>     -A song by Joel Grey (the wizard). It shows his cute voice and gives us a little intro to what we will hear in his upcoming song &quot;Wonderful.&quot;<br />11. Defying Gravity<BR>     -Another one of my favorites. Both Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel shine again with their powerful voices. Also another triumphant end.<br />12. Thank Goodness<BR>     -I keep talking about the chorus but they are just wonderful and they are great here again along with Kristin Chenoweth.<br />13. Wonderful<BR>     -Joel Grey is great in this song. And funny! He is terrific as the wizard.<br />14. I'm Not That Girl (reprise)<BR>     -Kristin Chenoweth is very good. Very soft and sad.<br />15. As Long as You're Mine<BR>     -A great duet between Idina Menzel and Norbert Leo Butz. &quot;Wicked!&quot;<br />16. No Good Deed<BR>     -A showstopper by Idina Menzel. Very powerful and emotional.<br />17. March of the Witch Hunters<BR>     -A good song. Introduces the Tin Man and the Lion which is a nice tie back to The Wizard of Oz.<br />18. For Good<BR>     -Beautiful!! This is my FAVORITE song. Very touching and sentimental. Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel have great harmony on this song.<br />19. Finale<BR>     -A very quick and powerful ending to this musical masterpiece.<br />I strongly suggest purchasing this soundtrack. Go out and get it NOW!!! You will not regret it.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Underworld had some okay potential. Vampires versus Werewolves is an intriguing concept. And the movie has plenty of style. However, the director or someone else screwed up along the way. <br />This movie has no plot until about two thrids of the way through. The Vampires are little more than eurosnobs -- some with guns, most just lounging about in formal evening wear. An ancient vampire later says their clan has turned weak. What an understatement -- they lost all interest for me when they go running up stairs, guns in hand, and flahslights on their heads. Um, don't vampires usually see in the dark and fly and attack viciously with their fangs?!?<br />The werewolves are little more than a mob gang of long-haired muscled men.<br />After the plot develops, its a much better film, but until that point it's a total throwaway. Apparently, the director wanted to make a star of the lead actress' boots, because there's way too many shots of them landing from jumps and falls.<br />I hate it when people talk through a movie, but we all were cracking jokes through it because it was purely silly and there was little story line or dialogue worth paying attention to.
0060194995|5.0|One of the most outsatanding novels of the 20th century. The story is that of the Finch family-Atticus and his children Scout and Jem. The narrator is the precoscious Scout, a six year old tomboy and the hero is Atticus, a lawyer who teaches his children the right way to live in the face of intense presure from friends and family. Atticus answers every question that his chilren ask him directly and courageously. He not only talks the talk but he lives up to his children's expectations through his actions. <br />Set in the Deep South of the 1930's, the book touches on a large set of issues including closemindedness and racial prejudice. Since Ms. Lee was a Southerner who never ventured far from her roots,it captures the true essence of the South and not some 'corn pone' version of it.
0679879269|5.0|The Amber Spyglass in my opinion was better than the  first two books combined!! And to all those people who think Pullman is attacking God and Christianity let me corrrect you. He said in an interview that The Authority (presumably God) is not the Christian God. The Authority, Pullman said, is the god that all the murderers and terrorists blames on the things they do. Pullman said that if there really was a God who told people to kill and do things like 9/11 he should be overthrown. So as you see he is in no way attacking the Christian Faith. BUY THIS BOOK!!!!

The new villian the T-X. it is the first<BR>villian terminator that is a women and can do twice as more than<BR>the t-1000. I became confused however when I found out that the person from the seond movie Dyson was not really the one involved<BR>in creating skynet. It was one of the twists.

B000127LW2|5.0|I know that most people didn't like Voyager *my step mom* but it really was a great series. Even though Gene Roddenberry wasn't involved, I think it held up his ideas of the future perfectly. \\"To seek out new life and new civilizations...\\" these words were evident in every last episode of Voyager. A lot of people thought that the idea of a starship lost on the other side of the galaxy was too far off from the \\"Star Trek theme\\" but I think it was dead on.<br />The series starts off with Captain Janeway taking out Starfleet's most advanced starship, the U.S.S. Voyager, into the Badlands in search of a lost Maquis ship and ends up lost in the Delta Quadrant. Courtesy of the Caretaker, who then obducts a member from each crew; B'Elanna Torres the half-Klingon Maquis, and Harry Kim, Voyager's Ops officer. They are then led to a planet that is home to a race called the Ocampa where they meet Kes and the Kazon Ogla for the first time. Their guide in this strange new area of space is the talkative and resourceful Talaxian, Neelix. After destroying the Caretakers array to protect the Ocampa from the Kazon, Janeway and her crew of Starfleet and Maquis personnel, set out to make their way home. The journey will take 75 years at top speed, as they are 70,000 light-years from home. The two crews must work together along with Kes and Neelix to find a way home and never give up hope of reaching it.
B00006879E|4.0|I first heard about maroon 5 when I was watching Hanson on Jay Lenno, and I decided to check them out, and hanson was totally right, the band is awesome and all the songs on the cd are really good. I would tell anyone to listen to it, because it is just a great cd.
B00005JM02|3.0|This is a cute film, the animation is superb and the character of Dory is extremely clever.<BR>However in comparison to both the Toy Story films and even Monsters Inc I found this tale slow and only funny in spurts. The turtles were cute but nothing amazing or all that clever, we've all seen the surfer dude character before. The fact that they were sea turtles was amusing at first but got old pretty fast. The sea gulls were a highlight..Mine Mine mine! LOL<BR>The 12 step sharks were funny but a little lacking, and I wasn't offended by the American remark, I've heard pleanty of Americans make disparaging remarks about other cultures. And since this is an American film its nice to see us laughing at ourselves. <BR>Dory was fabulous, Ellen Degeneres was wonderful and the documentary  on the DVD with Jaques Cousteau's son was hysterical!<BR>I just wish Pixar could be more consistant; as it stands right now IMHO, only the Toy Story films and to some extent Monsters Inc are truly worth all the hype and praise heaped on them. <BR>Nemo, like a Bugs life had some extremely slow parts where the humor either just fell flat or the plot just didn't work. Much of the fish tank scenes left me cold.....ah well it was not horrible. But I would recomend Lilo and Stitch above this film as far as story and humor goes.
B0000C1733|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers has been around for a long time and I think that people who have just started getting into the band should purchase this album. It has all of their modern hits (with a few exceptional songs from the 80s and early 90s) There are only a few songs missing from this collection, one my absolute favorite: &quot;Can't Stop&quot; I was quite surprised when it wasn't on the album because its a huge hit. Some people, before buying the CD, might think that the two new songs that are on the album might not be the same quality as the other classic hits. Yet, they are very wrong. The two new songs on the album, &quot;Fortune Faded&quot; the single and &quot;Save the Population&quot; are great songs and I'm glad they are on this CD. It's almost like a little teaser to show what's ahead for the band. I can't wait for their new album to come. Overall, great album! Purchase it.
B0000931OG|1.0|This review is for the &quot;[Enhanced][Explicit Lyrics] version. I agree with sentiments that this is Blur's best album to date. But be warned that this is NOT an audio CD (as Amazon falsely labels it)- it's a &quot;copy-protected disc&quot;, meaning that it fails to meet Philip's Red Book standards for CD's and won't play in higher-end CD players.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney has growing up very fast, we can note that in this album. when i hear the firts songs i was in shock is amazing, the songs are the best of any album,
B00005NNMJ|5.0|I got this album in 84 after hearing the song Balls To The Wall on the radio show Metal Shop (anyone remember that show?). I own over 1000 cds and this album has always been in my top 10! Udo's vocals are a bit rough and may not be for everybody, but I will take real emotion and good vocal melodies over some pretty boy singer anyday. Wolf's guitar work is biting and superb. His solos bring tears to my eyes, especially HEAD OVER HEELS. Wolf is up there with Michael Schenker as one of the best European guitarists ever. Stefan (drums) and Peter (bass) help give this album it's BALLS. I think we are all heavily influenced by the first album we hear from a band (sentimentality), but this album IS their BEST! Followed closely by Restless and Metal Heart. GOD BLESS YA!
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Taking in account the audience Bruce is reaching out to in his liner notes, this is a 5 star album. It's meant as an introduction, and that's exactly what it is for new fans (or supporters as one writer put it).<br />As an old fan, I also wish the essential went much deeper. I knew I'd be disappointed when I ordered the album - but I wanted to learn one thing - Could the old songs be done on CD? Well, the answer is yes!!! The old songs were remastered for this CD and are much superior in sound than the CDs of the first four albums that are in the stores now.<br />I must say I was almost completely sucked in by CD1. The song choice flowed along perfectly until Hungry Heart spoiled the show. I guess the person programming the song sequencing was trying to maintain release order. It's not that I mind Hungery Heart, mind you, it just seemed outta place where it was sequenced, and woulda fit much better on the mish-mash that is CD2.<br />So, for my birthday, or for next Christmas, perhaps Columbia can allow the first 4 CDs to be remastered. It sure seems weird when live bootlegs sound better than official releases done in the studio.<br />So, the sound Promise is there, and I agree with another writer that the only true &quot;essential&quot; Bruce would be a release of all his albums =:-)
B000002672|4.0|At first when I got this album in 86 I thought it was just ok. But it started to grow on me. I found myself pulling more than half the songs off of it when making a 90-minute best of Accept tape. RUSSIAN ROULETTE, IT'S HARD TO FIND A WAY, WALKING IN THE SHADOW, MAN ENOUGH TO CRY, STAND TIGHT are all great. The only song I don't really care for is TV WAR but it's not bad. HEAVEN IS HELL sounds a little like BALLS TO THE WALL but it still rocks. I would put this album just behind Balls To The Wall, Metal Heart, and Restless and Wild.
0385474547|5.0|I did not know about this writer until I heard Toni Morrison in a radio interview recently praising this novel. Since I hold her in high esteem, I would try any writer she recommended. Apparently I'm a little behind the times since according to the information on the front of the book, there are \\"more than 2 million copies in print.\\"<br />The action of the novel begins in Nigeria a few years before white missionaries brought Christianity and accompanying colonialism to that part of Africa. The central character is the very complex Okonkwo, a tribal leader with many strengths and weaknesses. He is therefore not unlike many of us, at least in part. He is ambitious, sometimes cruel to his wives and children, fearful of failure but also at times a very loving father.  For example, he struggles to be better than his own lazy father and worries that his eldest son Nwoye will amount to nothing and turn out to be just like his grandfather. He has no idea, of course, of what Nwoye will eventually become. Okonkwo has great affection for his daughter as well as for Ikemefuna, a young lad who is 16 when he comes to live with Okonkwo's family. One of the central tragedies of the novel has to do with what Okonkwo, according to the Oracle, has to do to Ikemefuna. Mr. Achebe, to his credit, shows Okonkwo with all his warts as well as the good and bad of Nigerian culture before the missionaries came.<br />As one would suspect, the white Christian missionaries don't come off very well.They go about converting the \\"primitive tribes of the lower Niger\\" with little or no regard for their customs and traditions. One has to ask if the Nigerians were better off before or after Christianity and accompanying colonialism?<br />One of the rewards of reading this novel is learning so much African folklore and sayings. In a delightful story, we find out why the turtle does not have a smooth shell, for example. Also, \\"There was a saying in Umuofia that as a man danced so were the drums beaten for him.\\" Finally, \\"Whenever you see a toad jumping in broad daylight, then know that something is after its life.\\"<br />The title for this novel comes from Yeats' \\"The Second Coming. Truly \\"the center cannot hold\\" for the tragic Okonkwo. You will remember him long after you finish this short novel. I guarantee it.r him.\\" Finally, \\"Whenever you see a toad jumping in broad daylight, then know that something is after its life.\\"<br />The title for this novel comes from Yeats' \\"The Second Coming.

B0000DD7LB|3.0|The first time I listened to all the songs, I hated the CD cuz it's a new style of Britney's that I was not used to. But after listening to it three or four times, I became interested. Out of the 13 songs, I would say about 5 or 6 are decent. So unless you are a hardcore Britney fan, I would not really recommend this CD, but it's ok. It's just a &quot;new Britney&quot; - new voice (for the worst), new style, new everything.
B000001GQT|5.0|Deutsche Grammophon did a wonderful job in digitally remastering this thirty-year old recording which features Richard Strauss's greatest orchestral works. Moreover, this recording also represents Herbert Von Karajan at his best. The conducting and playing of Also Sprach Zarathustra seems perfect and stunning. Clarity and luster always seem to be at the forefront of a Von-Karajan conducted orchestra, and here there is no exception. Easily a top-100 all-time recording.
1573228737|5.0|Affinity is more polished than Waters' previous award-winner \\"Tipping the Velvet\\".  While Tipping the Velvet was an epic of love and position lost and gained over a lifetime, Affinity focuses on a short period of time and two main characters.  The scope of this novel is as tight as a short story, with no trailing pieces left unresolved.  There is definitely a Gothic touch, with the dark brooding prison, the yellowish London fogs, and the black mourning clothes that the heroine must wear.  This book could be described as a mix of the mysteries of Sherlock Holmes with a Dickensian critique of Victorian society.<br />The story is about a Lady Visitor, Margaret, who begins visiting the women of Millbank prison because charity work should help get her mind off her dear father's death.  There she meets Selina Dawes, a spiritualist who is jailed for an assault that occurred during one of her seances.  There are many mystical things that happen in this book, and the reader is left to puzzle out whether to believe in the spirits or look for a logical explanation.  Margaret herself is a skeptic, not sure whether to believe in Selina's tales of spirit friends.<br />The ending comes as quite a surprise, and like the Sixth Sense or Fight Club, will have you paging backwards to look for the clues you missed.
B00005JM0B|4.0|My initial impression upon hearing that there would be a third Terminator movie was that it would be excellent, thinking that the majority, if not all of those involved the making of the first two films would be involved in making this third one.  Upon hearing that James Cameron and many others from the first two films would not be involved, some of those expectations were dashed.<br />When I saw this third film in the theaters there \\"was\\" an obvious letdown when considering that in \\"some\\" ways, the mythos that was established in the first two films seemed to have been forgotten.  Upon watching this film a second time, now on DVD, I've changed my opinion somewhat.  Taken as a whole, this film does extend upon the mythos of the futuristic battle between man and machine and gives an even greater impression of the \\"history\\" of events in the Terminator genre.  Where the film takes some hits is it's few too many attempts at brevity, which are interesting the first time but they're so clichéd as to actually distract from the overall enjoyment of the film.<br />Despite some of those misgivings about those \\"too many\\" trips to the humor well, I would still suggest to those that either saw the film in the theaters or have overlooked this film completely that they give this film an open minded viewing because in many ways it does develop the overall story of the Terminator!<br />What can one say about Arnold Schwarzenegger and his past and present performances as the Terminator; he brings the character back fairly well in this third film.  It is very interesting to see the T-101 model Terminator with a psychological profile but, as stated above, that is interesting but it also plays too heavily in the trips to the humor well.  <br />While Nick Stahl may be a good actor and may have done well in the other films he's been in, I thought his characterization for John Connor was more or less weak, they should've brought Edward Furlong in to reprise the character.  Claire Danes does a good job in her first action role.  The extraordinarily gorgeous newcomer, Kristanna Loken does an exceptional job as the Terminatrix, future performances by her should be looked forward to with great anticipation.<br />Jonathan Mostow does an acceptable job as the director of this film, given the script that he had to work with but one cannot help but wonder how different and that much better this film might've been had James Cameron taken the job.  The overall score for the film does an acceptable job in carrying the film along!<br />The Premise:<br />As we soon learn, Skynet, just prior to it's defeat sent back not two but three Terminators, The T-101 of the first film; the T-1000 of the second film and now the T-X Terminatrix of this third film.  The T-X Terminatrix is sent to terminate John Connor's lieutenants but to her great luck she not only finds one of the lieutenants in Kate Brewster but she also finds evidence that John Connor himself is nearby and becomes locked on him.  In comes Arnold Schwarzenegger as the latest T-101 sent to protect John Connor and his lieutenants and he is now not only a Terminator but also he's also a Terminator with a psychological profile, ready to dispense his \\"wisdom\\" at any time.<br />What follows from there is a very good Terminator movie that is entertaining but doesn't measure up to its predecessors.  I would still recommend it to fans of the series as it does do an acceptable job of advancing the Terminator story as a whole!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Feature film with 2 commentary tracks with the stars and the director<BR>-Movie and Video Game Trailers<BR>-Introduction by Arnold Schwarzenegger<BR>-Go on-set with the HBO Fist Look Making of Documentary<BR>-SGT Candy Scene - This is absolutely hilarious and should've made it into the film!<BR>-\\"Terminal Flaws\\" Gag Reel<BR>-T3 Visual Effects Lab:<BR>*Build Your Own Eye-Popping Action Sequences<BR>*Skynet Database of Weapons<BR>*Personnel Dossiers<BR>-Terminator Timeline<br />-Storyboards<BR>-Dressed to Kill<BR>-Toys in Action<BR>-The Making of the Video Game
B00001W9G0|5.0|These scenes are so well written - credit to the genius of arthur laurents - that any one of them could be taken out of context and make a great scene for an acting student. <br />The movie is shot beautifully and the score is a classic. (If a little repetitive at times)<br />The main reason to see this movie is for the great acting of Streisand and Redford. They are incredible.<br />Barbara has so many great moments in this - probably the &quot;phone scene&quot; is her best but so hard to choose. She is just great in this movie.<br />Redford is perfect - saying much more when he is silent than any actor does with dialogue.<br />The ending scene is a classic of american cinema - so sad and perfect. The most classic goodbye scene since CASABLANCA.<br />The documentary on this DVD is awesome. The interviews with Barbra, Pollack, the Bergmans, Hamlisch are great. The only disapointment is no Redford. The deleted scenes in this documentary are great and worth seeing.<br />I highly recommend this DVD.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I love this movie, I've already watched it 5 times and I can't wait to watch it again!!! My friend has already watched it over ten times! The best thing about this movie is that it it never gets old. Everytime I watch it, I feel like I'm watching for the frist time. And I have to admit that I really never knew who johnny depp was but after watching him as a pirate, I coudn't get enough of him!!!! He is a major sexy beast as a pirate even though jackass's johnny knoxville is even more of a sexy beast!! I think he's o.k./ hott in real life, even though I will admit He's hott in real life, I think he looks the hottest as a pirate!!! But his hottest look for real life is how he looks right now, from just playing the pirate, he still has that pirate look, I wish he could stay a pirate forever. But the movie is soo full of everything, that you can't gat enough of it or get enough of johnny depp as a pirate.I know this movie is going to win many awards, it's the number one selling movie and DVD!! Not only is the movie number one selling, anything from the movie or that has johnny depp is just about sold out, like posters and ect. This one store had to cancle it's orders of posters from the movie and johnny depp becuase it was soo popular. All I can say is that this is the best movie. And johnny depp is not onle hott but is halarious, in his role of a pirate. Just watch his every move during the movie and you'll crack up soo many timess, he is what makes the movie halarious! The summery that I think everyone can agree on, even if you didn't like it, is that this movie IS NOT JUST ANOTHER FASE RIGHT NOW, IT IS AN INSTINT CLASSIC. THIS IS THE KIND OF MOVIE YOU'LL BE TELLING TO YOU'RE KIDS ABOUT!!! I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT AND SEE THE INSTINT CLASSIC IN IT, FOR THAT IT REALLY IS AND DON'T FORGET TO WATCH JOHNNY DEPP CLOSLY, IN ONE OF HIS BEST MOVIES THAT HAS ALREADY GONE DOWN IN THE RECORDS AS ONE OF THE BEST. AND I GRANANTEEE YOU'LL LAUGH YOU'RE HEAD OFF WATCHING HIM. THIS IS THEMOVIE THAT WE'LL BE TALKING BOUT FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME , AS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!!!!
B00005JKN9|5.0|Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York is a flawed movie, but is still a masterpiece.  It is Scorsese's most imaginative and boldest work.  And the minor flaws that find themselves in this film make it even more endearing and show just how daring Scorsese was trying to be.<br />  New York City and the rest of America is built on blood and every one in it is part of one gang or another.  Gangs displays the virtuoso directing skills of a master creating a time period that is real and surreal at the same time.  The movie is set in the Civil War era, but one discerns from the outlandish costumes and the sets that this movie isn't just America as it was then.  It is America as imagined by Scorsese.  Our vision of the past is distorted by time, and why not allow that to come through.<br />  Scene after scene, Scorsese discribes how America as we know it was formed, much like an archaeologist, laying layer upon layer until you see just how much his thesis that everyone is in a gang is true.  The politicians are just as corrupt as the Natives and the Dead Rabbits.  Every group is an amalgamation of hypocrisies.  Bill the Butchers Nativists call themselves Native Americans but everyone in the group is of European origin.  The older generation of Dead Rabbits fought for their rights to the death in the beginning of the movie, but all but one of the key members became a willing partner with the Nativists.  And the government jumps ship from gang to gang depending upon who can get the most votes.  Everyone is corrupt.<br />  The movie ends gloriously bringing all of the different gangs together in one great battle.  Cutting from one group to another you realize just how much each gang is like the other -- America's future just depends on which one is the toughest not who's the most morally correct.  And in the battle you realize that the U.S. government is the largest gang of them all and the most ruthless.  The others use arcane weapons like knives while the American government employs cannons and guns.<br />  There are some flaws with the movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of the finest performances any actor has given in the past five years.  It's an outrage that he did not win an Oscar for this -- but, then again, they gave Ron Howard the Best Director over Scorsese.  But, Day-Lewis' performance is tarnished by the lack of abiltiy of his two co-stars.  DiCaprio is passable, but he loses and regains his accent throughout the movie.  Cameron Diaz, who may be great in a comedy, is miscast for this role -- she has the look but not the talent.  Her character seems flat and predictible.<br />  But, this, in no way, tarnishes Scorsese's achievement here.  His work here reminds of you the brash and instinctive director who made such landmark films as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver.  He is paving new ground and reaching for higher plateaus.  Whenever you are wandering through uncharted territory, there are going to be some mistakes.<br />  This movie, like most of Scorsese's movies, is one you have to watch more than once to really see what is going on.  The long, uncut scene, where Irish immigrants are taken off of ships, signed up to enter the army and sent to war on ships while there are coffins being unloaded off of the same ships is visual storytelling at its best.  Watch the movie and relish how Scorsese will cut from scene to scene to draw parallels.  Watch how he uses a fade towards the end of the movie to show just how the blood spilled is wiped away by history, but it's still the blood that built this country -- all of this with images without words.  Scorsese is a master and this is a masterpiece. It's flaws should be relished rather than criticised because the movie is by a visionary conquering new territory.mploys cannons and guns.<BR>   There are some flaws with the movie.

0316666343|2.0|Though the concept of &quot;heaven&quot; in this book was interesting and presented in an unsual manner, the rest of the book left me uncertain about the reason for writing it in the first place.  A young girl is brutally murdered by a neighbour and goes to heaven where she watches life go on for the people she loves and the man who murdered her. <br />Some of the details could have been edited out of the book, e.g. the description of the airport where the girl's mother arrives  to see her husband who had a heart attack.  She left the family 8 years earlier shortly after the death of her daughter.  This kind of useless details seemed to me to be &quot;filler&quot; as it offered no insight into the characters of the book. There seemed to be a lot of fillers in the book. <br />The part where the murdered girl enters the body of her living friend in order to be able to consumate a relationship she had with a young boy prior to her death was out of sync with the rest of the plot and the concept of the separateness of the two worlds. <br />The character of the dead girl's grandmother is well developed in the book.  She had a strong influence on the family and goes to live with them after the dead girl's grief stricken mother leaves the family. Yet when this character dies the author gives no details as to how, what, where and when. This seems like a loose end that needed some binding to the story. <br />To be fair, the writer's description of the way the various members of the victim's family grieve and the impact of sudden death on the community was true to real life experience. The fact that most murders are never brought to justice nor are the missing victims likely to be found compounds the reality of the world we live in these days. The book just did not deliver the punch it needed for me to recommend it to prospective readers.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is dubbed the best and most successful Disney movie (in my opinion Beauty and the Beast will always be the best).  While it is the biggest success Disney has ever made it isn't quite the &quot;Best childrens movie ever&quot;.<br />To those who gave it one star because of the excuse &quot;It's a kids movie&quot; my only questions would be, if you knew it was a kids movie why did you go see it?  Well, we all know Disney makes family oriented films and Finding Nemo is one of the better ones.<br />The movie begins where we see Nemo's mother and father.  Soon they're attacked by a shark and Nemo's brother and sisters and his mother are all eaten.  Not a nice start but the movie got better. I wasn't disgusted with it but it seems that Disney has parental death in ALL their hit classics!  We all remember &quot;Bambi&quot; right? And then of course there's the other one that stands out: &quot;The Lion King&quot;.  Even if we don't see it, the parental death is there (Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin had parental deaths but they weren't mentioned nor shown).<br />Aside from that the movie gets better.  Nemo's father, Mervin, after witnessing the death of his wife becomes scared of the ocean. Nemo, who is the only surviving child with a severed fin, wants to embrace the ocean.  But when Nemo is taken by a group of divers near Sydney, Austrailia, it's up to Mervin to find him.<br />The movie is pretty entertaining at times and funny at other times.  It is pretty heartwarming too.  Of course as the movie progresses we see a change in Mervin's character. He goes from being scared to being pretty brave.<br />There are other characters as well. Dory is obviously there to provide comic relief. She has a short-term memory problem but again, we see a change as the movie progresses. Actually, to be picky for a minute, when we first meet her, her short term memory is OVERDONE! Then they loosen up a bit as the movie goes on. Still enjoyable.<br />The voice talents are great! While Finding Nemo doesn't rise above Toy Story the movie certainly shows a lot of entertainment for younger audiences and family alike.  I loved every minute of this movie. Now when will Disney make a great, spectacular movie without parental death and BOTH parents make it thorugh the movie?e great!

Now when will Disney make a great, spectacular movie without parental death and BOTH parents make it thorugh the movie?
B0000VCZK2|5.0|...regardless of what you think of films three and four.<br />Okay. for the mathematically inclined:<br />We have nine discs. 2 for each movie , and one floater.<BR>At 75$, this puts each disc at $8.33.<BR>Now ignore that disc.<BR>Now each  disc costs $9.375<BR>Hate the fourth film? Ignore it and you have 6 discs and each film costs 25$<br />This assumes of couse, that the fourth film means NOTHING to you. At least you can see in the production featurettes just what in the heck they were thinking when they made it.<br />The great thing about this edition is its presentation of Alien 3. Belive it or not, David Fincher made a good film called Alien 3, but we never got to watch it until now. Please give this movie another chance, it really is a worthy addition to the series.<br />RESURRECTION, in my humble opinion, is another matter. I thought it was bad, but oh well. <br />This edition is a must for Alien fans, regardless of their feelings toward the latter films. The product is glossy and good looking, definitive and devoid of any bugs or glitches that I am aware of. The extensive pre-through-post production interviews are both informative and frank (the filmmakers acknowledge weaknesses and production tensions) and sometimes quite funny (the dog dressed up in the Alien suit was pathetic)<br />You already know you are going to buy this set, and I have nothing to say that would deter you
B00007K02F|5.0|This is my favorite version of the movie. I feel the actors portray the characters very accurately. In the book Jane had a very cool/calm/together demeanor and Charlotte Gainsbourg pulls this off beautifully along with her plain appearance. I'm a big William Hurt fan and feel this is his best work. To me, he IS Mr. Rochester. The only negative thing I have to say is the storyline strayed from the book... a lot. But we must keep in mind the book is very long and this movie isn't a big Hollywood creation. A smaller budget combined with time constraints force the writers to come up with a creative way to jam the story into 2 hours. I think they've done a nice enough job of making sense so those who've never read the book won't be left with too many questions. Those of us who are familiar with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre can fill in the spaces quite nicely with our imaginations. Recently I watched the A&amp;E version of Jane Eyre. It was done terribly and leaves me appreciating Zeffirelli's version even more.
B00008EYA5|4.0|Very realistic. I couldn't see that they used the green screen. The ending with the plan was really cool. The characters were not realistic. The movie has a good twist. Original plot. Bad script. Lot's of one liners. Plot moves quickly. Awsome rental. The time when they had a paintball war in the plane was neat.
0780622553|5.0|If you've even _heard_ of this movie, you'll probably like it. That's the kind of movie it is.<br />It was somewhat unfairly eclipsed by the Wachowski Brothers' _The Matrix_. The latter is a great movie and one of my favorites, but I suspect the Wachowskis watched _Dark City_ while they were turning their storyboard into a screenplay.<br />I can't tell you much about this one without giving away things that you really need to see in the movie. I can tell you that Rufus Sewell is a poor schlub who wakes up one day in a bathtub and finds out he's suspected of being a serial killer; that Jennifer Connelly is deadpan-delightful as his wife; that William Hurt is suave and Chandleresque as the police investigator on the case; and that Kiefer Sutherland does remarkably well for being cast very much against type. And that's about it.<br />At a broad and general level, I can also tell you that the mood is extremely dark, the tension is nonstop (in part because of the creepy soundtrack), and it's spooky as all git-out. And it plays with the question 'What is real?' as thoroughly as any film you've ever seen.<br />It is, in short, an extended noir-SF/fantasy mood piece. If that sounds good to you, trust me when I say you'll like it. This one's a mind-bender that will give you nightmares.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I've listened to the CD a few times now and concur with most of the reviews that give it less than 3 stars. I give it 3 stars simply because I cannot rate anything DT does less than that just because of who they are. With that said, there seems to be a LOT of mindless noodling of rapid scales by Petruci with no real direction other than speed. The whole CD is not like this but a good majority of it is. I/we need more than that DT. If it did indeed only take 3 weeks to produce, like others have already said...it shows. The guitar solos especially. The songs just are not that good. Nothing memorable after several listens. I own 90% of DT's stuff and enjoy most of it. <br />   I discovered SYMPHONY X about 2 years ago now and they have won me over bigtime. Their song writing is superior to DT imho. <BR>I cannot recommend them enough, if you like a huge, epic, thunderous, melodic, sweeping, hard and fast sound emminating from your speakers. DT can also be like this, but not on this CD. Maybe the next one. I do enjoy 6DOIT quite a bit, especially the title track/cd.
B00005JMFI|3.0|The first Christmas movies of the season comes with favorable critical reviews and stars Will Ferrell, so it's odd that the movie was disappointing to me. Regardless of the lightheartedness and PG rating, it never felt like Ferrell's comic talents really cut loose in this conventional fish-out-of-water/meaning-of-Christmas comedy. There are many laughs to be had, but the plot, which involves an adopted human who has been working at the North Pole as an elf seeking out his real family in New York, becomes painfully routine in its sentimental aspects. It's harmless but predictable and ultimately an exercise in what has already been done before. It's a routine feel-good movie with non-feel-good-movie star, but Ferrell plays by the genres rules, when it should be the other way around, but maybe I would have embraced it more if the guy behind me wouldn't have been flapping his jaws the whole time (*clenches teeth*). <BR>       While it is by no means a bad film, is it too much to ask for a movie to take some risks and do something different, especially when you have Ferrell to pull it off?
B0000CFW87|3.0|The first album was great, i wish he took more time to perfect the follow-up.
B0000DCGT0|3.0|This is the most boring film. It just didn't keep my attention beacuse it didn't move on quickly and because I am a fan of action movies. It was dramatic and the horseracing was very realistic. Tobey Migwire was the wrong character for this movie.
0790729601|4.0|If you like Arnold, you'll like this movie. If not, not. It's that simple.<br />This nonstop action-thriller follows the misadventures of John Kruger (Schwarzenegger), an 'eraser' with a secret witness-protection program who gets rid of all traces of a witness's previous identity. He reports to James Caan and he's assigned to protect Vanessa Williams as she rats out a megacorporation doing a dirty arms deal.<br />That's all you need to know, and it's very nearly all there is. There's some high-tech gadgetry, some not-altogether-persuasive CGI stuff, some humor, and a whole lot of hairbreadth escapes; there's also Robert Pastorelli in a terrific supporting role, and a brief appearance by a surprisingly menacing James Cromwell. But the plot in this one _is_ the action.<br />Perhaps the single most unconvincing portion is Caan duking it out with Schwarzenegger; in real life, Arnold would most likely have Jimmy for lunch. But Caan is terrific all the same (and if you like him, be sure to see _Rollerball_).<br />The whole thing is well produced and most gratifying to watch. If you like a good Arnold action-thriller, you may like this one better than _True Lies_.
B00005IC2H|5.0|BUY THIS ALBUM!  JUST DO IT!
B00005JM0B|2.0|I say the original Terminator movie when I was 12 years old, and it shaped my perspective of life and the world. I've never been so afraid and exited since.<br />I've refused to see T3 for a long time, for several reasons.<br />However, this christmas my girlfriend placed the DVD in front of me and asked us to watch it. <br />And I did yesterday.<br />To my surprise it was even worse than I expected.<br />Please don't support the stockholders attempt to ruin the Terminator-universe.
B000002NAK|5.0|I am a big Madonna fan and all , but this album is just plain horrible all the songs are really horid and resemble &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; or some other Broadway musical--dont waste your money on this crap if you are a Madonna fan, buy it if you are a musical fan
0780631684|5.0|Very freaky movie. It gives you that false sense of security like In the part when the car locks him in on the train tracks, but he gets out. You didn't think that a minute later, the train would run over a piece of metal and chop the guys' head off who was stuck in his car on the tracks. Original plot. Very good movie, but it is pretty fake. If it was remade today it would have been a lot better. Hard to do anything after this movie because you'll be scared that something will kill you that you wouldn't expect.
B00001MXXH|2.0|High school student Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) decides to take the day off from school and uses his superior wits to treat his best friend (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend (Mia Sara) to a good time.  I am astonished that this film has developed such a following over time.  It is a very slight story, not particularly funny, with a sappy ending and two truly annoying performances from Broderick and Ruck.  I didn't like it when I first saw it back in the 80s and it hasn't improved over time.  However, 256 (as of this writing) other reviewers have apparently taken this film to their hearts, so why listen to me?
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I am not a Britney Spears fan at all.  I bought this cd after I heard the song \\"Everytime\\".  I thought that this song was pretty good and that maybe the album would be good as well.Let me tell you that this cd is horrible! Not even a song with Madonna would make me listen to this cd twice. And actually I thought that the callaboration with Madonna was one of the worst songs on the cd.Britney says she wants to be taken seriously as an artist, but with ridiculous, mindless music like \\"Outrageous\\", as just one of many examples, all she is doing is adding to her <BR>over- sexed, talentless, brain-less Lolita image. This cd yearns to be techno/dance, but the final product is just an over-synthesized,over-produced sound that washes out the vocals, leading one to believe that is was done on purpose in order to cover up the fact that she can't sing.  If I could stand at the cd store and discourage anyone from buying this cd, I would do it all day and all night.  I hope she goes away sooner than later.
B000002552|5.0|When the Basement Tapes were officially released in 1975 (bootlegs from these sessions date back to 1968), the public discovered that Blonde On Blonde was not the final masterpiece of Bob Dylan's sixties peak. Dylan could do just about no wrong during this period and when he retreated to upstate New York, joined-up with his one-time touring band and simply kicked-back and jammed, another classic album erupted.<br />The laid-back atmosphere definitely had an effect on Dylan. The songwriter has rarely sounded looser, freer or more excited. He surveys traditional American blues and folk, creating clever, funny and unique versions of such staples as the traveling song (&quot;Lo and Behold,&quot; &quot;Goin' to Acapulco&quot;), the humdrum ballad (&quot;Clothes Line Saga&quot;) and the portrait of a crazy character or scene (&quot;Tiny Montgomery,&quot; &quot;Million Dollar Bash&quot;). Dylan sobers-up on the apocalyptic &quot;This Wheel's On Fire,&quot; the doleful &quot;Tears of Rage&quot; and the bitter farewell to the sixties &quot;Nothing Was Delivered.&quot; But irregardless of the mood, almost all of these compositions are top-notch.<br />While the Basement Tapes concluded Dylan's first peak, it kicked-off that of The Band, the five-piece who began as the backing band of Ronnie Hawks, was recruited by Dylan and became a major music force of their own in the late sixties. It is often overlooked that within the Basement Tapes there is that group's fine debut album (even a few of their demos, on which Dylan is not even present, are snuck in). Their song-writing careers get-off to a fantastic start with &quot;Ruben Remus,&quot; &quot;Bessie Smith&quot; and, perhaps the best they ever composed &quot;Katie's Been Gone&quot; and their voices always harmonize beautifully, but especially on the traditional &quot;Ain't No More Cain.&quot; Dylan even recognizes that they are becoming a strong, self-sufficient entity and allows them to take the lead on his &quot;Don't Ya TellHenry&quot; and &quot;Long Distance Operator.&quot;<br />The Basement Tapes is probably the best album ever made that was not meant for commercial release. It's a loose, fun, and crafty collection of Americana that features two of rock's most important artists on winning streaks.
B000089RVR|1.0|I give it one star for one good song!  What a disappointment from her last albume.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Very smart plot. You didn't think the killer was who it was and that they were all someones personalities. Not as scary as the ring, but it has some scary moments. I wondered how someone could think of something like that after I watched it. Looks very real and very cool camera angles. Makes you think when you watch it like clue
6305949980|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this. The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those deliciously twisted enchanting tales that no matter how bizarre, you love anyway. Tim Burton is a genius, and this I think is his masterpiece. Jack is one of the most enchanting heroes ever and all the characters are so charming, demented, and wonderful that it only reaffirms why I love Halloween most of all!
0380973634|3.0|In the field of Science-Fiction/Fantasy, there is no greater accomplishment than creating a unique and intriguing universe. Although well-written books, The Hobbit and Foundation are classics less for perfect prose than for the creatures, landscapes and societies they introduced. The appeal of the universe ranges outside books, though. It is why Attack of the Clones grossed millions on its opening day and why a lot of people know more about Marvel Comics than they do about any foreign country.<br />Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman is a pretty unmistakable attempt at creating a universe. The novel was Gaiman's first major project after finishing the acclaimed Sandman comic series (which could be described as his first universe, but is more of an amalgamation of Biblical scripture, Gaelic and other folk tales and the larger world of DC Comics). Because of Sandman's success, Gaiman is sometimes considered a new Tolkien or Asimov, but he fails to reach his potential on Neverwhere because, despite his ambition, his universe-creating powers at not at a prime.<br />The universe of this novel is London Below, a dark and outlandish world existing beneath the UK's sprawling capital. It is inhabited by a feudal aristocracy, lonesome warriors and a religious cult that talks to rats. After two ruthless mercenaries slaughter one of London Below's most prominent families, the only survivor, a young woman named Door (for her ability to open mystic gates), escapes to London Above, where reluctant yuppie Richard Mayhew takes her in. Joined by the mordant Marquis de Carabas and a grim female bodyguard called (get this) Hunter, Richard and Door journey through London Below to find-out who ordered the deaths of Door's family and why.<br />Gaiman is an outstanding writer who eases readers into the strangeness of London Below and keeps them reading with intrigue that unfolds at just the right pace. I was must admit I was entertained while reading the book, but I doubt it is one that will stay with me for long.<br />This is for two reasons. The first is that Gaiman is apparently used to pencillers supplying the visuals to his stories. The descriptions of London Below were never vivid or colorful enough to leave an overly memorable picture in my mind. The second is that Gaiman fails to completely develop London Below. We never fully learn how this society functions, what separated it from London Above and how its strange customs came to be. Perhaps Gaiman was considering a sequel that would explain such, but still Neverwhere does not lay enough groundwork for readers to fully connect to this universe.<br />Neverwhere is smartly written and highly entertaining, but for works such as this the creation of a memorable universe is the deciding factor and it falls short on that criteria. Gaiman's best post-Sandman work will probably be another project.
B00005NB8K|5.0|The Doors is with out a shadow of a doubt the greatest rock and roll film ever made! It tells perfectly what the late-great Jim Morrison went through and how he lived. This goes into the music and the L.A. scene in the late 1960's. Everything you ever heard about The Doors or Jim Morrison comes across in this movie. The Plot is very east to understand. You find yourself felling bad for Jim because of all the stuff he put himself through, but you also feel bad for the Band because Jim made it to wear Robby, John, and Ray couldnt play their music live because of Jims on stage anticks. I found my self hating Jims wife because if he wouldnt have met her he woulndt have done half of the stuff he did, so was really a bad influence. This is a whats gonna happen next film, and Val Kilmer pulls of the roll flawlessly
B00005JM0B|5.0|This is the best of the terminator trilogy. Cool to see that they couldn't stop judgement day. The part where arnold s. is on the train that is going through a building. Best action and special effect of any movie this year besides lord of the rings or the matrix. Unpredictable and smart.
0385504209|5.0|Loved it!  I would like to see the book in a movie- Indiana Jones style!  Could not put it down.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The guy below me who gave this album one star and said it has no good songs is a complete and utter moron. This same dude gave 50 cents album 3 stars but this classic only 1?? Shows how much he knows about hip hop: absolutly nada. Anyway, enough about that....here's the review for Pac's swan song masterpiece, the last album he recorded before his death.    The last year of Tupac's life was by far his most prolific. He signed to Death Row Records in September of 1995, only to be tragically gunned down just one year later. But his legacy would live on through his music, and today, he is the the biggest selling rap artist of all time, by far. This album, the very last one he recorded (many of the songs on his posthumous albums such as Until the End of Time & Better Dayz, although recorded on Death Row, contained mostly songs recorded from the All Eyez sessions, or after those but still before the sessions for this album....the Makaveli sessions were the very last ones he would do), is perhaps his best album ever and one of the greatest the genre of rap/hip hop music will ever see.    Although 2Pac recorded hundreds of songs during the last year of his life, the sessions for this album were legendary, and were a separate set done apart from all the other songs recorded during that last year. The sessions took place over 7 days (yes, the entire album was written, recorded, and completed in just 7 days) in August of 1996, just a couple weeks before he was murdered. About 20 songs were made, 11 of which made the final tracklist (\\"Toss It Up\\" was pre-recorded on earlier sessions). It was the final album which Tupac had hands on, and was released just two months after his death. Earlier in the year, he had released his double cd opus, \\"All Eyez On Me\\", which would go on to become one of the biggest selling rap albums of all time and establish 2Pac as a international icon. With the \\"7 Day Theory\\" (the album has many names, including \\"7 Day Theory\\", \\"Don Killuminati\\", \\"Makaveli\\", or just DK7), Pac wanted to make something completely different, something that would blow people's minds upon its release.    And it did exactly that in November of 96'. The album was very dark in nature, and far more abrassive and intense than its predecessor. The first song, \\"Bomb First\\", is one of his most intense tracks ever, and almost all rappers he had beef with at the time are called out. This song pretty much sets the tone for the album, though there are a few lighter moments, such as the penned love-letter to Los Angeles, \\"To Live and Die in LA\\". This was kind of a sequal to California Love, but much better written (it should be noted that Pac's songwriting on this album is IMMACULATE, evidenced not only by the album itself, but by songs made at around this time, such as Starin Through my Rear View, The Good Die Young, Smile, etc) and the emotion of it is undeniable. \\"Just Like Daddy\\" is a rather underrated song on the album, and is more a less a song he made dedicated for the ladies. Pac usually put one of these type of tracks on all his albums, and that trend stays the same here. \\"Toss It Up\\" is one of the few other radio friendly songs here. But thats about as far as it goes.    Anyone who knows Pac's music well knows he wrote deep songs all the time, but here, he truly writes some next level type cuts. \\"Blasphemy\\" is quite possibly one of the deepest songs ever penned in rap music history, in this song he raps about the corruption of religion and the pitfalls of life in the fast lane. The production is extremely dark, and the reggae-like chorus really gives this song a different feel. One of his best songs ever. Another very deep song is \\"Krazy\\"....this has a more personal feeling to it (kinda like something from the Me Against the World album), but like Blasphemy, it has a different sound to it. Pac raps more slowly on this song than usual, over a heavy piano loop with a electric violin in the background. The song has a very tragic/sad feel to it, and remains a gem on this album to many fans.    The most celebrated (and recognized) song on this album though, is without a doubt, \\"Hail Mary\\", which is considered by many rap fans to be one of the greatest songs of all time. Many fans of Tupac consider this to be his greatest song ever. Indeed, it is timeless, and its eerie church bells, dark keyboard production, and Pac's haunting lyrics through two amazingly written verses will leave you in amazement everytime you hear it.    I dont want to go into detail about all the songs, because each song here is quite simply a masterpiece in its own right (with maybe the stark exception of \\"Toss It Up\\", which is slightly out of place here). 2Pac had two classic albums under his belt before this one, but this is truly his masterpiece right here. Everything about this album is legendary, from the recording sessions which created it, the mystery surounding it concerning all the alive theories (He is dead if you ask me, but many people still feel otherwise), the cover, and the music itself.....all of Pac's albums have now become timeless, but with this cd here, he created one of the darkest, deepest, and most intriguing/mysterious rap masterpieces ever. The album reached #1 on the charts upon its release in 96' and today is still looked upon as a classic, and one of the finest hip hop has to offer. No hip-hop collection is complete without this album. A dark and brilliant cap to a spectacular career from the Elvis of of OUR generation. It is a MUST buy. ~ R.I.P. Tupac Shakur ~
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is the best CD ever!!!!!!!  So y don't y'all buy it already?  <br />Stripped Part 1-  I'll give it 9/10.  It's a hot intro and I like all the little MTV snippets they used.<br />Can't Hold us Down (w/ Lil Kim)- This song is alright.  It aint all that though.  I like the ending when she breaks down to her little dance beat.  I'll give it 8/10<br />Walk Away-  THE BEST SONG!!!!! She sings her ass off on this one.  It deserves 9/10.<br />Fighter-  I ain't never hear Christina sing to a Rock song before.  It's a hot song, so I'll give it 10/10.<br />Primer Amor (interlude)-  I kinda like this.  If u listen closely, its as if she's talking in a restaurant.  And the guitar in the background is hot.  And Christina's spanish is off da hook!  8/10<br />Infatuation-  Nice, hot, Latin flavored song- 10/10<br />Loves Embrace (interlude) - I love this little part of the album.  It has a nice, soothing feel to it- 10/10<br />Loving Me 4 Me - I LOVE this song.  It has that nice jazzy blues feel to it- 10/10<br />Impossible-  I kinda like this song, but its cheesy in the beginning with her talking to Alicia Keys.  7/10<br />Underappreciated-  Good - 7/10<br />Beautiful- well, what else can I say but &quot;beautiful&quot; - 10/10<br />Make Over - This is a hot 1970s Austin Powers type of song with that guitar feel- 10/10<br />Cruz-  With this song, I can just blare it and drive on a open highway with the top down and the car on cruise.- 10/10<br />Soar-  THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM.  I don't mean to be cheesy, but its so inspirational.  I would sing it to yall, but I have a terrible voice.  She's the only singer to pull this song off- 10/10<br />get Mine, Get Yours- Christina gets a lil freaky in dis song, talking about workin her like a 9 to 5- 8/10<br />Dirrty (w/ Redman)-  This is a hot song.  And STOP acting like the video not hot either!!!  Its a song u can blast in da club and everybody with shake their asses- 9/10<br />Stripped Part 2-  Not as good as part 1 - 6/10<br/>The Voice Within-  Another inspirational song like &quot;Soar.&quot; Only more suttle and not as &quot;Churchy&quot; as &quot;soar.&quot;- 10/10<br />I'm OK-  This song is ok.  Christina really gets personal with this one.  She talks about the bruises left on her mother's neck and how she was abused herself.  And the sound effects with the little girl crying, i can tell its from the movie &quot;Dolores Claiborne.&quot;- 9/10<br />Keep On Singing My Song-  I like this song.  Especially when she holds that 11 second belt!!!- 10/10<br />There is also a hidden intro!!
B00005JMCW|1.0|This movie has nothing going for it at all. It is not funny, dramatic, action, it just has nothing. Tries to be funny and the plot has been used many times before. The ending wasn't good and neither was any part of this movie. My favorite part of this movie was the credits because then I got to leave.
0671027387|5.0|From the start you are pulled into this book.  Just when you think you have it figured out- guess what, Wrong!  Husband started to read it and now he can't put it down.  Nice pace, easy to follow even when Brown is giving you high tech info.  Doesn't overwhelm with too many details that you forget why you are reading the book in the first place.
0553274503|5.0|This story makes you really appriciate things we take for granted like reading and writing. Charlie is a man who is .. mentally slow or retarded and he gets to write progress reports while a hospital does experiments on him to help him learn more. And he does. It really makes you happy because you feel like you are him,never giving up, life is a battle and you have to work at it. I think this is definetly something Charlie learns along the way.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I absolutely adore this film, and ever since the first time I watched it, I fell in love with it.  I've always loved the whole \\"cinderella-fantasy\\" concept, but seeing it in this type of sceenplay just stole my heart away...I plan to own a copy of this movie soon.  It has made my list of favorite movies ever....which only consists of 3 movies so far (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Ever After, and Breakfast at Tiffany's)
B00005JLSE|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of musicals, especially in movie form, but &quot;Chicago&quot; really blew me away.  It deserves every award that it won, and then some.  The story was exciting, and the movie flowed seamlessly from the diaglogue to the musical numbers.  Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta-Jones both reveal amazingly strong voices.  Zellweger's voice isn't quite as strong, but still quite good considering this is her first foray into singing.  One disappointment is that Richard Gere's voice is adequate at best.  He otherwise fills the role of Billy Flynn to a &quot;T.&quot;  Even if this isn't your usual sort of movie, give it a shot.  You won't be disappointed!
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|When Celine sings in French, I believe she does understand the lyrics. You bet: This is important! There is true emotion and real art in this CD. After all the Las Vegas very bad bad stuff and all these advertising tracks for Chrysler, this is good news. <br />Learn some French, just for this CD. You won't regret it. <BR>&quot;Tout l'or des hommes&quot; is so great, &quot;Des milliers de baisers&quot; is so emotional, so intense. <br />Enfin! Un bon disque! <br />Celine: You should really leave Vegas and stay in Paris for good.
B000001Y79|5.0|this was a first for me, liking a band with a ska sound, but I do not regret it. I still rock  the album today. Have fun hearing Gwens thoughts on being young, a woman, in a relationship and a breakup.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Alright, so Jet isn't the most original band ever sure they sound a hell of a lot like Oasis, The Stones, Stereophonics, The Beatles, and AC/DC.  But why change a formula that has worked well for ages, even if originality isn't their strong point Jet's Get Born is still a fun cd to listen too.  Let's keep in mind this is only the groups first cd i'd keep my eyes peeled for these guys chances are they'll develop a more original sound on their next album and blow everyone away, jet definetly have the potential to be rockstars.
B000007T1M|5.0|a stunning cd with very few low points this was the starting block from which toxicity and steal this album came. features some of the funniest songs, most policticaly charged and blindin metal i have ever heard, on a level with toxicity, iff not in sale figures but in quality of song writing and entertainment
0385474547|3.0|now, i see where achebe was going with &quot;things fall apart.&quot;  i understand that it is an answer to &quot;heart of darkness&quot; and it was good for what it was. <BR>here's the thing though...i didn't like either book.  &quot;heart of darkness&quot; was an awfully dense and boring 80 pages that took me forever to struggle through, and while &quot;things fall apart&quot; was an easier read, it was no more interesting or exciting.<BR>i read &quot;things fall apart&quot; in AP literature after having read &quot;heart of darkness&quot; and i think that that is most likely the only situation in which i can imagine reading &quot;things fall apart&quot; or &quot;heart of darkness&quot; for that matter.  neither are good books to sit down and read for fun or enjoyment, but as books to discuss in a class setting, they are fine.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Great album by a poet, rapper, writer and producer. Listen to the words and you feel everything she is singing. Rock on!
0425166805|1.0|This is pure pseudo-science, one that in spite of being thoroughly debunked over 20 years still manages to attract overtrusting and gullible readers. I have to hand it to this guy that such pure unadulterated fiction, although advertised as fact, continues to sell books.  Don't know the particulars as to why he was jailed for embezzlement, one would think that the revenues from this book alone would have made him rich for life.
B000000W3G|5.0|Okay if you bought the double album JUST to listen to Tonight Tonight and 1979, (well first of all you have problems for not liking the rest of MCIS), but only the hardcore Pumpkinfans should buy this one. All those demos and riffs that never made it out onto a SP album has been smushed altogether into Pistachio Medley. An incredible well done rock medley :) <br />All the singles are excellent, but its even cooler to get unreleased material on here too. For Example: Set the Ray to Jerry (1993 Siamese Dream Outtake that never made it onto Pisces Iscariot), and Mouths of Babes (a heavy song that should've been a single). Then you have the happier songs (Believe, Thirty-Three, Said Sadly), melancholic (Ugly, Cherry), covers (You're all I've Got Tonight, Destination Unknown). <br />But hey whatever mood your in, or whatever version of Pumpkin rock you crave, every aspect of it is covered here.
6305971935|5.0|I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was about 9.  It certainly piqued my interest in the paranormal, but at the time, I was unaware that the movie was based on alleged experiments by the US Navy.  It's a B-sci fi movie complete with silly exaggerations, decent special effects, general cheesiness and the inevitable romance that ensues - in this case between a skeptical Nancy Allen and a confused Michael Pare.  This movie is not to be taken very seriously.<br />If you are looking for mindless entertaiment, this is an excellent movie to satisfy your craving.  It may even spark an interest in reading further about the allegedly real Philadelphia Experiment.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|Dumb movie. I usually enjoy films with angelina jolie but I could not even bare to watch all of this. The techno music got on my nerves and all the afro- american men with funny lines was so predictable so it became boring. I saved myself and changed the channel.
B0000028SR|3.0|I first heard \\"Human Touch\\" way back in '92 when my dad got the album for his birthday.  I fondly remember thinking that \\"57 Channels (And Nothin' On)\\" was the coolest song ever in the world.  Hey, gimme a break, I was only 10! Still, I can't resist that bass line even today, and being a bit older (21! Where's the time gone?!) I now get the Elvis reference.<br />Of course, there's more to \\"Human Touch\\" than that novelty song.  The title track is one of Bruce's best songs.  Standout tracks include \\"Soul Driver\\" (so different from anything Bruce has done), \\"With Every Wish\\" (a great lessons-learned ballad), \\"Real World\\", \\"I Wish I Were Blind\\" (an earnest attempt to capture the pain of moving on from a relationship), \\"Real Man\\", and the lilting \\"Pony Boy\\".  <br />The production is in the same style of \\"Tunnel of Love\\" and \\"Lucky Town\\", very slick and clean, the typical sound of popular music in the late '80's early 90's.  Which is either a good or bad thing, depending on your taste.   Unlike on \\"Tunnel of Love\\" and \\"Lucky Town\\", there's no real theme to speak of on \\"Human Touch\\".  Like Bruce's earliest albums, it's very much a song based affair, rather than a concept album.  And also like Bruce's earliest albums, \\"Human Touch\\" has some pretty ordinary songs too, namely \\"Roll of the Dice\\" and \\"All of Nothin' At All\\".<br />I must admit that I have to be in the right mood to listen to \\"Human Touch\\".  At times it can keep me riveted, at others I am quite bored by it.  I guess that is really the mark of a great album, instead of a good one.  You never tire of the great ones.  Overall, whilst not Bruce's strongest work, or most memorable \\"Human Touch\\" is a solid rock album and one that any fan should enjoy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is so good... The characters become established as unique individuals immediately upon introduction. There is humor, wit (lots and lots of wit!!!), action, seamless special effects, drama, sci-fi elements and excellent acting. Every character is complex, mysterious, and credibly portrayed. The storylines are engrossing - you are never quite sure what is going to happen next. This is a rare series where the acting, writing, and effects all come together to create sophisticated and fun entertainment.  Those who like cliched sitcoms and tired hospital/law enforcement drama will not be able to keep up.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I first heard this album at a coffee shop I worked in.  It seemed like every customer that came in while it was playing asked me about it.  I bought it for myself just a few days ago.  I must have listened to it 5 times since then.  I just keeps getting better.  The first thing I loved about it was how eclectic the music is... it sounds like bluegrass, country, and something else I can't put my finger on.  Another thing I really respect about the album is that even though the music varies, the next song is never out of sync with the one before.   Tonight, after listening to it again, I paid more attention to the lyrics.  They seem to either tell a really good story, or else speak very personally to you and wherever you may be at the point of hearing them.  Either way, the lyrics are wonderful to listen to.  I feel like I'm going to develop a relationship with this album, you know the type.  And I can't wait to get my second Alison Krauss cd!
B00005QIPH|5.0|Wow what a debut. This album has such a unique sound I just can't explain it. All I know is each time I listen to it I got a huge smile on the face and lots of energy. This band makes you feel good and bounce around. What more could you want ? It's all good !
630438551X|5.0|Look, I'll admit I'm a Leo fan, and Claire is okay 2, but, C'mon, this movie was GR8!  The first time I saw it was when i was a little kid, about 7, and i thought it was crappy then.  But that was then and once i'd re-seen it, i thought it was terific.  the special edition DVD shows in detail how the main 3 scenes were shot (the gun scene, water scene, death secene) and I luv the interview section.  Baz Lurmann has out done himself.<br />The movie starts off with a TV report and ends with it.  Romeo first spies Juliet dressed as a knight and her as an Angel, smart move by Baz.  If u listen closely 2 the lines, u will start 2 not only understand the Shakspearian dialect but u will hear some things quiet easy 2 miss.  I also luv how they've based everything around the 'water barrier' as Baz describes it in the commontary (i luv DVDs with commontary) and the fish tank was guenious.<br />Look, i just want 2 say, if u r a Leo or Claire or Jesse Bradford or John Legessamo (i have no idea how 2 spell his last name) fan or ur just up 4 a good movie, this is the one 2 c.  and guys, this isn't what i'd descibe as a chick flick mainly because of the death of tybalt scene and the fight and gun scenes.<br />Well, i hope u all like it.  - Haylz
B00004VVND|4.0|In 1973, the well-known sci-fi author Michael Crichton made his big-screen directorial debut with a futuristic story that he also wrote entitled \\"Westworld\\".  With special effects initially reminiscent of (but not as good as) the 1968 classic \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", Michael Crichton created a fictional, futuristic resort populated with human-appearing androids that are managed by a human staff of engineers, computer programmers and technicians.  Operated by the fictional corporation named Delos, the resort features three \\"worlds\\" set in historical contexts as their names imply: \\"Westworld\\", \\"Medievalworld\\" and \\"Romanworld\\".  Each guest paid $1000 per day for the privilege of experiencing what it may have been like to live during one of those time periods.  Rather than pay a human staff to act out roles in the various worlds, the Delos Corporation decided to use realistic androids to portray wild-west gunslingers, medieval knights and various people who would have lived in Roman times.  The wonderful actor Yul Brynner (1915-1985) played one of the robotic wild-west gunslingers, and the guests included Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin), John Blane (James Brolin) and a banker (Dick Van Patten).  Alan Oppenheimer played the Delos staff supervisor.<br />Though \\"Westworld\\" was one of the more popular films in 1973 and is still loved today by many sci-fi fans (as well as fans of Michael Crichton), thirty years later the film comes across as being rather dated, in large part due to various flaws within its plot.  The most obvious flaws include the following: <br />1. Any computer-programming bug can be traced to its source and eliminated, but the Delos staff appeared incompetent.<BR>2. The construction of an inescapable, airtight room would never have been allowed by building inspectors.<BR>3. Acting in the film was mediocre at best, with the exception of Yul Brynner who did an excellent job portraying an android.<BR>4. The exterior of the transport used to take guests to the resort is never shown.  Instead, only the interior is shown, probably due to an inadequate film budget. <br />What makes \\"Westworld\\" still an entertaining film to watch thirty years later is that Michael Crichton's premise was good, but I can only rate the film now with 3.5 out of 5 stars rounded to 4 stars because of its flaws.  Yul Brynner's portrayal of the emotionless robotic gunslinger may have been the archetype for Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of the terminator android eleven years later in the 1984 film \\"The Terminator\\".  Michael Crichton was far more successful with some of his other films that include \\"The Andromeda Strain\\", (1971), \\"Coma\\" (1978, which he also directed) and \\"Jurassic Park\\" (1993).  An attempt to create a sci-fi TV series based upon \\"Westworld\\" in 1980 failed after only five episodes.
B000069AUI|4.0|&quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot; was the very first album I owned by Coldplay and it's now one of my favorite rock albums in my collection. I also own &quot;Parachutes&quot; which is another album I own by coldplay but I didn't like it as much as this one. I would also recommend Parachutes to everyone who loved a rush of blood to the head!<br />  I love how coldplay does their music. It can be loud and fast sometimes but other times it can be soft and slow like on &quot;The Scientist&quot; which is one of my favorites on the album. My favorite song on the album is &quot;In My Place&quot;. But I also like: politik, the scientist, clocks and daylight. The only reason I gave it 4 stars were because some tracks on the album were not as good as my favorites.<br />  I have been hearing that coldplay is supposed to sound similar to another rock group called Radiohead. I havened heard of them but since I loved a rush of blood to the head I might give them a try. It also is strange that coldplay was still unknown before they came out with a rush of blood to the head bacause I thought parachutes was pretty good. Anyway I recommend a rush of blood to the head and parachutes to all rock listeners.

014118213X|5.0|Howards End is a literary masterpiece of the \\"chick-book\\" genre.  The plot moves very slowly, especially in the first half, and is largely subservient to the subtle shifts in relationships between the characters, whose thoughts and feelings are often examined in depth.  Without spoiling any surprises, Margaret and Helen Schlegel are two independent young women in pre-war Britain whose lives are thrown into turmoil by a series of seemingly random interactions with the very wealthy and very conservative Wilcox family.  After a very brief tryst with one of the Wilcox brothers (during which Mrs. Munt provides some welcome comic relief) the sisters are stunned to find the Wilcoxes moving into their neighborhood.  A friendship develops between Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox, which though short, has long-lasting consequences.  In the second half of the book, Margaret is faced with the task of reconciling her flighty liberal-minded sister Helen with the very practical down-to-earth conservatism of Henry Wilcox.<br />It's only fair to point out that many men will find this novel melancholy and occasionally downright insipid.  The relationship between Margaret and her prospective husband is utterly lacking in warmth or even in humanity, and his decision about the disposition of the house around the middle of the book is so contemptible that one just wants him to go away.  Indeed none of the male characters are the least bit admirable, and only the hapless Leonard Bast is even sympathetic.  The obsession with a sense of place that is at this novel's core is neither sufficiently enchanting nor adequately believable.  And the final resolution has been roundly criticized by feminists who see the once-proud sisters settling into exactly the sort of lives that they hadn't wanted for themselves.  It's true that Margaret is able to convince her husband of the importance of the \\"inner life\\", but only at the price of his virtual destruction, leaving her, like Helen, caring for a helpless infant.  As to Forster's famous aphorism \\"only connect\\", the only characters who really unite on a spiritual level are Margaret and a woman who dies fairly early on in the story.<br />But for most women, this is one of the finest books in the literary canon.  Forster's language is superb, and his insight into the female mind is impressive, but what really sets this novel apart is its excursions into the philosophical concerns of modern society.  What responsibilities do the rich have to the poor, and how should these responsibilities best be discharged?  How do personal relationships fit into the context of a social order that needs leaders, builders, and entrepreneurs?  Is the unexamined life really not worth living, or does self-analysis too often result in dilettantism and paralysis?  Forster not only raises these questions, but debates them at some length, making this book a perfect choice for an English class or a book discussion group.  Guys, feel free to skip this one, although you can always give it to your mother.  She'll love it.ant.

076790592X|5.0|What A Sweet Book This One Is, well worth the read. I recommend it for everyone as it fits in so many catagories. Beautiful tribute.<br />I Also recommend: Nightmares Echo is my favorite for now,I know Why The Caged Bird Sings is my favorite of all time, and Meant To Be.
B000002NJS|5.0|You go girl. Time for reflective songs and techno beats. You think it sounds like a disaster waiting to happen but it works. Its Madonna, all the songs are true to her life and its all good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great show, terribly disappointing that it was cancelled so early.  There is so much more the show could have explored and done. I highly recommend this to any fan of sci-fi.
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|The Strokes are the 21st century's version of Oasis, in that they slavishly imitate their heroes without improving or even expanding the trails said heroes blazed.  Very simply, this album is neither original or good.  It's for sale if anyone wants it.
B00005LAGO|5.0|You know how your dad stopped listening to new music in 1972 or so after he got all those Beatles, Aretha, Neil Young, Marvin Gaye, Stones, and early Zeppelin albums? He knew that Bad Company and Foreigner didn't have anything to add. Lots of intelligent people quit buying records for a while after this band broke up. <br />The Pixies were a highwater mark that college rock still looks up to -- melodic genius drenched in bone-breaking noise. &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; rocks like Meet the Pixies. This CD gives you the excellent 8-song EP &quot;Come On Pilgrim,&quot; which includes the sublimely beautiful &quot;Caribou&quot; and seven other tooth-loosening hits. &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; is brilliant from end to end -- I caught my refrigerator repairman singing along to &quot;River Euphrates.&quot; &quot;Cactus&quot; and &quot;I'm Amazed&quot; are bedrock. And &quot;Brick is Red&quot; is my secret favorite -- an incomprehensible sing-song.
0679720200|1.0|I was forced to read this book and I still hate my teacher for it. Its about about a man who doesn't care about his mother dying, he doesn't seem to care that he hung around the wrong crowd and killed a man in self defense and he ends up paying for his carelessness. Good for him. I am still angry that I had to read this crap.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the extended version of the film because it really ties up all the loose ends that the theatrical version leaves blank.  With over 40 minutes of extra footage there is plenty of material to mention.  Although I am still disappointed by the major alterations Jackson made to Faramir's character and Frodo and Sam's quest, the extra scene showing the complex relationship between Boromir, Faramir, and Denethor is excellent and really sets a nice backdrop for the third installment.  The extended version also contains one of my favorite scenes from the Tolkien trilogy where Merry and Pippin drink the water in Fangorn forest and grow taller.  Another scene of interest is the one where Aragorn and Eowyn discuss Aragorn's true age and his association with the previous king of Rohan.  The theatrical release of the Two Towers was truly epic, but the extended version builds upon the epic nature of the movie and also includes a lot of material that makes sense of the storyline for those who haven't read the trilogy.
0393057658|5.0|If I find a book that interests me, I read it in about 3 weeks.  This one took 5 days.  I couldn't put it down.  If you are a baseball fan, even mildly so, you need to get this book. It almost made me an Oakland A's fan!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Before I get labeled as a moron, I will admit that I am a metal head at heart. This is only the second Dream Theater album I have listened to, other than Images and Words, which was too lovey-dovey-ish for me (remind you, I don't listen to prog-rock or whatever the hell is is). But anyway, just hear me out.<br />From what I have looked at, not many die-hard fans like this record. A lot of them totally dismiss the album just because they can't handle it. This is pure metal. When I listen to the CD I hear five amazing players (I am a guitar player and Petrucci is INSANE) beat the hell out of their instruments. It's ironic that it took a band that doesn't usually play that intense to show these nu-metal and death metal morons what metal really is. <br />Sure, this isn't typical Dream Theater. I'm a die hard thrash metal fan also disappointed by stanger and metallica's recent 15 years. But as much as you want it, Metallica will never release another Master of Puppets, and with Dream Theater, another Images and Words. <br />Each album of any band should be a little bit evolutionary and a little bit different, otherwise we'd end up with another AC/DC. A good album is one you can listen to over and over, and I must say this is one of them. <br />Some people will still totally dismiss my review, but maybe that's because I look at things as a musician. This album is an amazing piece of musical work. Now don't tell me that when you go see these guys live and they start playing one of these songs, you'll just stand there and totally piss on it. You people listen to a fearless band (them putting out a metal album), but yet you're too full of it to accept it. <br />Nothing's permanent, I'm sure you'll get another &quot;real&quot; Dream Theater album in the future. If not, you still got the old ones. So quit bitching.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I really love this album, angry, and introverted. not like lil pop ditties that were already heard a billion times.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Let's face it, most people enjoy watching a movie where a lot of stuff gets demolished or blown up, and the Hulk is no exception.  The scenes with the Hulk are absolutely excellent.  After hearing fans complain for months on end about how fake the Hulk looked, and how stupid the computer generated graphics were, I thought they did an excellent job of animating the Hulk.  In my opinion, this beats the alternative of painting Lou Ferrigno's skin green, dying his hair, and letting him play the Hulk once again.<br />There are a few downsides to this movie though.  I think the storyline requires a little too much brain power, and not enough entertainment.  Personally, I wish they would have let the Hulk smash and destroy more stuff, but that's not too much of a big deal.  Also, the extras on this DVD aren't that impressive.  Sure the interviews are informative, but there's nothing here that any fan of the series really doesn't know about.  I think it would have been better to package the DVD with extras that appealed to fans since they are the ones who constitute the population who will probably buy this movie.
B000002UB3|5.0|This album is by far the Fab Four's best!!! A treat from start to finish!!! A CLASSIC!!!
B0000E6XH3|4.0|OK, first a bit of background about me as a Daft Punk fan: although I first saw/heard Daft Punk with their Digital Love video while on vacation in France in the summer of 2001, I was very little intrguied by the anime aspect of the band's 4 hits off of Discovery; I can genuinely say that I liked Daft Punk for their electronic qualities, not the fact that their videos were anime (as some Daft Punk \\"fans\\" do). I own Discovery, Homework, Alive 1997, and D.A.F.T. (in the order purchased), as well as a total of 5 singles. Now, on to Interstella 5555...<br />The movie, in any respect, is excellent. Matsumoto has somehow been able to create a journey that not only fits as best it can with the accompanying Discovery soundtrack (as others have noted the music isn't perfect in matching the mood of the film at all times, but this is a near impossible task), but one that is wholeheartedly entertaining. The animation is simply beautiful, and the synchronization of the beat with specific events is stunning. Granted, I'm not an anime fan at all, so I really can't judge the anime, but the fact that I enjoyed the anime must mean something. The DVD, although it comes with original artwork of each character and karaoke, has only one other notable attraction besides the movie, and this is the Digital Love video which blends a 50/50 mix of original sketches with the actual video. Wonderful.<br />The only reason why I gave this DVD 4 stars, and not 5, is because it is really, really, really geared towards Daft Punk fans... and ONLY Daft Punk fans. No, scratch that, DISCOVERY fans. I know that with the release of Discovery over 30 months ago, Daft Punk fans were split into 2 groups, those who could tolerate only the tech-house of Homework, and those who could appreciate Daft Punk for moving on to disco-house/funk (as well a new group was added, those who just loved the anime videos, but this is irrelevant). This DVD is solely for the Discovery crowd, I should make that loud and clear. Aswell, if you're looking to get into Daft Punk, this is NOT the piece of entertainment to do it with; do yourself a favor, buy Homework, and start yourself off chronologically.<br />However, before my disclaimers scare everyone away, any fan of Discovery will be able to appreciate the more suitable ending to the story of the \\"Crescendolls,\\" and I strongly suggest that these fans do purchase this wonderfully produced DVD.<br />To sum it up in a few words: NOW I know what Daft Punk has been busy with for 2 years! If this is a sign for things to come, I can't wait for the remix compilation coming out in a month's time (1/27/04), \\"Daft Club.\\"
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna in the 80's .. my favorite. Put on your stirrups, with your bangle earrings, flouresent shoes and clothes and have a good time remembering when pop music was good.<br />Madonna was all about curly greasy hair, ripped clothes, necklaces and bangles and tights. Totally different from what she is now. And I love her that way.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|This album is typical Sarah Mclachlan from the get go, the moment you hear the first strains of track one, the current single &quot;Fallen&quot;, you know it's Sarah McLachlan without a doubt.<br />The album is strong with Sarah's usual breed of cruisy, melodic tunes, featuring wispy vocals and well arranged musical backing. As stated by many a reviewer here, it isn't better than 1993's &quot;Fumbling Through Ecstacy&quot;, but in truth, it's better than her last offering &quot;Surfacing&quot;. Above all however, and comparisons aside, it's a strong album in it's very own right.<br />Seriously, did we really want a rehash of previous albums anyways? Sarah has progressed, and though the tracks are nowhere near as haunting as those featured on her most favoured album FTE, &quot;Afterglow&quot; is a strong, well crafted collection of songs.<br />The first single &quot;Fallen&quot; is a delightful song, indeed a great track, but for me the stand out highlights have to be Track 2 &quot;World On Fire&quot; featuring a killer chord progression, and strangely uplifting backing meshed with darker lyrics. Track 3 &quot;Stupid&quot; which is the heaviest sounding track I've heard so far of Sarah's, and would be my choice for the next single release, thirdly, Track 8 &quot;Time&quot; is an absolute standout, simply a sweet and beautifully crafted song which leaves me with mental images of Sarah standing atop a mountain belting out the tune in a potential music video.<br />The lyrics on the album are quite confronting and do annoyingly weigh too much in the &quot;I'm a head case, beware of me&quot; field at times but the strength of the melody and backing is more than fair compensation for some dodgy song lyrics on certain songs.<br />The songs are lighter than FTE, falling somewhere between that and her previous effort, 1997's &quot;Surfacing&quot; in mood. Don't be put off by the negative reviews, this album is well worth a listen, &quot;Fumbling Through Ecstacy&quot; was Sarah's breakthrough album, a faultless collection of brilliantly haunting songs, but just because this new offering is not in the same league as FTE it does not mean it is in anyway a bad album.<br />If you're a fan don't be swayed by the negative reviews, get into a record store and have a trial listen before you make up your mind, but whatever you do don't ignore this album because of the many detractors reviewing the album on this site.Sarah's breakthrough album, a faultless collection of brilliantly haunting songs, but just because this new offering is not in the same league as FTE it does not mean it is in anyway a bad album.<br />If you're a fan don't be swayed by the negative reviews, get into a record store and have a trial listen before you make up your mind, but whatever you do don't ignore this album because of the many detractors reviewing the album on this site.

B0000CFW87|5.0|I was first exposed to Josh Groban on the last season of \\"Ally McBeal\\" when Josh made a second guest appearance on the (terrible) series. His character's mother had died. He lost his desire to sing while his father was pushing him to perform solo at his church. Hearing Josh's voice was like manna from heaven. He had a spectacular voice. I was surprised to hear a voice coming from a man as young as Josh was at the time which was roughly around 19, 20 years ago. I have been waiting to buy Josh's sophomore album and I finally had the money to buy it which I did. \\"Closer\\" is definitely an improvement over his self-titled debut album. On \\"Closer\\", Josh avoids the cheesy ballads that peppered his debut album. As cheesy as \\"You Raise Me Up\\" is lyrically, the song is still a beautiful song. Josh puts his heart and soul into the song. I know I have heard \\"You Raise Me Up\\" somewhere but I just can't put my finger on who I heard it sing it before Josh Groban. I just found out not too long ago that \\"You Raise Me Up\\" is on Secret Garden's \\"Once in a Red Moon\\" from last year. I thought Josh did a much better version. I was incredibly moved by the passion that Josh put into all of the songs but in particular \\"Mi Mancherai\\" (my personal favorite song) from the film \\"il postino\\" and \\"My Confession\\". Unlike his peers, Josh does not need flash and glitter to prove that he is passionate about his music. His incredible voice speaks volumes that he is the consumate artist. I have been listening to \\"Closer\\" non stop since I bought it. I can't wait to hear more music from Josh in the future.

B0000CD5FN|3.0|It's so sad about Joe Strummer. I'm nearly 50 and my son's 16 and we both love the Clash. That says a lot about Joe Strummer and company. There's nothing really weak on Streetcore, but nothing particularly memorable, with two exceptions. I like Ramshackle Day Parade, and Coma Girl is simply one of the best songs I've heard in the last two or three years. Powerful, anthemic, tuneful, transcendant.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is the only metal band I like. Metal to me always seemed A. extremely boring and repetetive (Metallica), B. too much mindless cussing (Limp Bizkit), or C. Mindless screaming and guitar mashing. But Linkin Park takes it to the next level. They capture the hardcore energy and emotions of metal, but experiment more with it, add a deeper meaning and just... overall make it SOUND better. Hybrid Theory will always be a classic in my collection, mainly because well, it rocks. This is just my opinion but I think Linkin Park is the best metal band out there.

0385504209|1.0|If there was a NO STAR selection, it would have been NO STAR. Interesting premise, incomplete research, hack author.  Overuse of adjectives, especially the word SENSED, thin plot line, absurd police chases.  Only humorous idea is he made the plot in France so it was the FRENCH police that are so inept.
0790729725|5.0|The mobster flick is one of Martin Scorsese's best films!!! And his best list is quite long!!!The story of Henry Hill is quite gripping and this film is headed by an all star cast that includes Ray Liotta,Joe Pesci(In his Oscar winning performance!),Robert Deniro,Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco,others include Michael Imperioli,Vincet Gallo,Samuel L. Jackson,Vinny Pastore,Paul Herman,Henny Youngman,Frank Deleo,Jerry Vale,Beau Starr,Mike Starr,Illeane Douglas,Tony Darrow,Frank Vincent,Peter Onorati,Chuck Low and many others!!!The DVD is great but, this disc is a flipper, which means you have to flip the disc mid-picture. But thats OK, because this films quite long, and you can have a small break if you want to before watching the other half of the film!!! The picture and sound of this DVD is great, and the only extras are two trailers and production notes,but still this movie and DVD get Five Stars!!! A CLASSIC!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The old folks doing some of these reviews are way, way too picky about their precious Beatles. <br />I'm 25 and I think the Beatles still deserve to be called the greatest band of the last century (that is, that completed their run within the 20th century). But what could be bothering them about this reworking of the Beatles' only mediocre album, except that they don't want to admit that it's an improvement?<br />The nonsense is cut out, and the glam overproduction removed. The tracks flow better, the vocals are stronger (what fool would drown-out Beatles vocals? *cough**philspector**cough*).<br />In short, if you haven't heard Let It Be yet (all you new Beatles fans), get the Naked version. You won't fall asleep, and you can even drive to it!<br />And to you &quot;old school&quot; whiners... get over it. Anything that keeps the Beatles fresh &amp; alive for a new generation, you should thank your lucky stars for it!
0783225792|5.0|This is Las Vegas mobster film is one of Scorcese's best!!! A three hours, its little on the long side but thats fine, it's such a great film, the three hours are worth it!!! Great performances from Sharon Stone,Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci!!!The huge supporting cast is also incredible!!! Great soundtrack!!! And whats really cool is the entire movie is on one dual-layer disc so there is no changing discs during playback!!!AWESOME Two Thumbs Up!!! A+
0385504209|1.0|I loved Brown's last book, DECEPTION POINT, and very much looked forward to reading THE DA VINCI CODE. Alas, this is one of the biggest disappointments I've suffered through in years. I agree with other reviewers about the many plot implausibilities. The prose throughout a lot of the book is stilted and wooden. The characters are all cardboard cutouts who serve as mouthpieces for Brown's (some say others') research. Protagonist Robert Langdon has zero personality, as does each of his supporting cast. Langdon returns from ANGELS &amp; DEMONS, a book I enjoyed, though it too, was marred by several huge implausibilities (Langdon jumps out of a helicopter from several thousand feet up, clutching only a tarp as a makeshift parachute, and survives his fall into the Tiber River, virtually unscathed). THE DA VINCI CODE is burdened with many similar groaners.<br />Previous to this book, Dan Brown couldn't give his first three books away (even though they were all quality). Then he signs a big contract with mega-publisher Doubleday, who props him up with a gadzillion-dollar promotional campaign, and touts THE DA VINCI CODE as the thriller to beat all thrillers. Of course, the sheep buy into the hype and flock to the bookstores to purchase this mediocre effort. I'm afraid P.T. Barnum was right about a sucker being born every minute. Dan Brown is capable of much better. He's proved it in the past.<br />One star for an intriguing plot and comprehensive research, zero stars due to the less-than-stellar writing and lack of character development. The guy I feel sorry for is author Lewis Perdue, who has written similarly themed novels and yet still labors in relative obscurity (Perdue even authored a novel in 1983 titled THE DA VINCI LEGACY. Hmmmm . . .).
B00003CXB7|5.0|This DVD is the ultimate version of this classic 1970 Robert Altman film!!! Disc one contains the WIDESCREEN version of the film with a second disc devoted to extras!!! A great package!!! AWESOME!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+
B00005JM02|5.0|I believed that finding nemo was not just an entertaining tale of a small fish in a big ocean.  i think it is a tale of courage and suspense.  But, it also portrays raw comedy just like it was meant to be.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|I was one of the Sarah fans who was first in line to buy &quot;Afterglow&quot; the day it was released, and the CD has lived up to my expectations and more. I adore every track on the CD, especially &quot;Fallen,&quot; which (like half of Canada!) I heard on the CBC a week or two before the CD was released. The CD is amazing -- a winner that has earned a spot on my &quot;favorite CDs rack&quot; along with Sarah Harmer's &quot;You Were Here,&quot; Nancy White's &quot;Momnipotent,&quot; and the soundtrack from &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; (Okay, I have slightly eclectic tastes. What can I say?)
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I was really blown away by this.  What a warm tribute to a remarkable person.  Outstanding music being played by outstanding musicians who were just playing for the love of music and their friend George.  Lots of poigniant moments, like Ringo singing &quot;Photograph&quot; (&quot;all I have is a photograph of you&quot;),  Clapton playing/singing &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, McCartney singing &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Billy Preston singing &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot; in gospel style, and much more.  It inspired me to blow the dust off my 6-string and try to play along.<br />Caution:  May produce chills and tears.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park is an amazing band--simply genius.  For all of those who disagree, you're very ignorant because I'd like to see you try to be ANYTHING close to these guys--talent/music wise.  <BR>This CD is very good....not as good as their 1st album though, Hybrid Theory.  That's simply amazing.<BR>But Meteora is different--it's not as 'hardcore'.  <BR>My favorite tracks are &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; (AMAZING, different song) &quot;Numb&quot; (who doesn't like this song?), &quot;Easier to Run&quot;, and &quot;Lying From You&quot;.<BR>They're all really good, those are just standouts for me.<BR>So pick up this CD today and you'll thank me for it :)
0767802470|3.0|The makers of this film did an amazing job.  Most of the movie takes place in a cramped submarine.  It feels very real.<br />I did not enjoy the movie very much, though, because the theme it explores, namely life on a submarine during WWII, is thoroughly unpleasant.<br />Things I didn't like:<br />- The first part of the movie is about the boredom of being on a submarine.  Since I think of movies as a form of entertainment, they ought to be very careful about spending an hour on the theme of boredom.<br />- The constant attacks on the submarine grew tiresome for me.  It does a good job showing how unpleasant it is to be under constant attack.<br />- The German crew shows more contempt for their own government than the enemy.  The fact that they say nothing positive about the Nazi government makes them more likeable and makes it more unpleasant to see them suffer.<br />- The ending was unpleasant.  I don't see how it added anything to the film.<br />I recommend this movie for people who think that war is fun.  It's a realistic movie that shows the boredom, tedium, and unpleasantness of war.  Those are not qualities I look for in a movie, but if you want realism this movie is first-rate.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|The same people that attempt to slice apart the Strokes by virtue of their 'unworthy' comparisons are the same individuals that are destroying rock and roll. Christ, the Strokes are rock and roll. When was the last time anyone heard anything so immediately accessible but also so intricately crafted and subtle? It's really simple. Either you like the music, or you don't. It's not incredibly important whether they sound like Television or the Stooges, or whatever. Who cares. How many people refuse to listen to the Byrds because they lifted some bluegrass melodies? It's good music, plain and simple and this is evident from the fact that the last mixtape I made had Rolling Stones, Strokes and Velvet Underground side by side. Yea, they do sound like that era, but that's a GOOD THING.
B0000AZAUM|5.0|The recording quality on this SACD is fine but, you have to crank it WAY up to get the maximum benefit out of it.
B00005UW7V|5.0|I know this film has had a lot of mixed reviews, but I actually thought it was awesome.  Especially the ending when he brings his mother back for 24 hours.  Stanley Kubrick's vision of ai was awesome and Steven Spielburg has put together a master piece.  The acting, especially by young Osment was outstanding.  A deep film.
B000068PQ0|3.0|Ok, first off, I am a HUGE Lips fan. They are my favorite band, and I think they should be considered one of the most creative and incredible bands ever. They've certainly come a long way since their 80's stuff. Lots of people like their noisy feedback-laden psych rock &quot;middle&quot; period best (&quot;clouds taste metallic&quot;, &quot;Transmissions..&quot;) and this is when they were wholly ignored. Then they sort of changed up their sound after ronald jones quit, and they've become critic's darlings. This album treads similar ground as &quot;Soft Bulletin&quot;, but is nowhere near as wonderful as that record (which is one of the best pop records EVER). It is mostly a quiet record, full of trippy blips and bleeps. The Lips take a stab at ambient music? Not quite, but certainly their softest release. Fight Test IS a rip off of Cat Stevens no matter how much they deny, but is still a fantastic song (why is this not a top 40 hit??). There are 3 or 4 very catchy songs, that feel like they should be radio hits in a fair and just world, 2 instrumentals (1 of which is good) and a few songs that are rather boring....Less than I would expect from a band of this caliber, and the album as a whole was a bit of a let down. If you're not yet a fan, and want to listen to fantastic, unique, creative beautiful pop-rock music, buy &quot;Soft Bulletin&quot;. If you're an older person and want to find out if anyone is making good rock music nowadays, do the same. If you're anything but a die-hard Lips fan, pass on this one and go buy &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; (Wilco), or &quot;Tiny Voices&quot; (Joe Henry), or anything by Joseph Arthur. Yoshimi, to be sure, is better than most anything you'll encounter on pop radio, but if you're a fan of good music, there are lots of better choices, I'm sad to say.
B00004TRD8|5.0|The extended version of T2 is a must for any fan of the film.  Not only does this contain all the deleted footage but is crammed full of info on the making of the film.  Every special effect is covered, inerviews with the Special effects artists and a compendium of info on the actors, the casting and even a story board of whole 2 hours.  Excellent value for money.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This CD is the best CD that i have purchased in 2003. Alicia has really outdone herslef in all her lyrics songs and beats on this track. The first time i heard this CD i was like &quot;WHOA&quot; play that again! Now when i listen to this CD i hear her speaking to all women and men alike that is truely in love with someone. She speaks on being dependable trusting and i got your back when things get rough. I say Alicia has put her foot in this CD.
630587493X|4.0|Robin Williams plays this robot brilliantly.  A look into the future but with a robot that can think!  Whilst the idea isn't new and some parts of this film are predictable and the ending is a little daft.  4 stars for its comedy.
B000092ZYX|4.0|2003 will go down as a fascinating year in pop music, what with coldplay, interpol and outkast all releasing gems. <br />radiohead's &quot;hail to the thief&quot; is one of the best with a curious mix of the electronic experimentalism of &quot;kid a&quot; and the guitar rock of &quot;the bends.&quot; the album grabs your attention from the first track and carries you all the way through with nary a lull. personal favorites are the building tension of &quot;sit down stand up&quot;, the wonderful bang of &quot;there, there&quot;, and the creepy quiet of &quot;the gloaming.&quot;<br />fans of previous radiohead albums will not be disappointed as the trademark poetic angst of the lyrics is in full force with the driving musical eclecticism of the music. newcomers will want to dig further into the discography.
B00005R62N|5.0|For 1979, this album exceeds all expectations.  From the opening track Exciter to the breaking riff of Running Wild this album makes you feel like your there.  Robs vocals are outstanding especially on the Ripper.  Other classic tracks like Victim of Changes and The Sinner makes this a special treat for all Priest fans.
1400034779|5.0|Precious Ramotswe inherits her father's cattle herd and sells it to start a new life.  The options are limited for a woman in Botswana.  She sets out on an uncharted course, opening the first private detective agency run by a woman.  At least in Botswana.  Mma Ramotswe is  a commanding figure.  She's stout, observant and reasons with precise logic.  She would have made a great politician.  Instead, she buys a house, an office, hires a secretary, installs a telephone - and sits down to wait for clients.  It seems she's likely to shut it all down within a week.<br />Instead, clients come calling.  The result is a series of vignettes of her clients' problems and their resolutions.  There are wandering husbands, rebellious teen-age children [are there any other kind?] and a missing, probably murdered child.  Justice, although never mentioned by either McCall Smith or Mma Ramotswe, is an important element throughout these episodes.  Justice and the value of being an African.  McCall is knowledgeable about Southern Africa and its people.  He imparts that understanding with marvelous skill.  His Scottish background never intrudes or distracts.  Except perhaps in one of Mma's more bizarre cases.  The Scots treasure their reputation for producing fine doctors.  One of Mma Ramotswe's mysteries is the occasionally inept doctor.  It is clearly the highlight of this superb book.<br />Mma Ramotswe, in establishing her unique agency, might be thought to have shed her personal life.  After all, she had a brief, unhappy marriage.  Men are to be watched, controlled, and manipulated in ways to prevent their wandering.  Yet, as might be expected, there is a man in her town whose value transcends the image dominated by wandering husbands or lovers.  He knows her worth and she his, but his stumbling proposal is rebuffed.  There's no strain on the friendship, however, and it becomes clear the two will be useful to each other in the future.<br />McCall Smith has accomplished something very special with this book.  It cries out for a sequel [of which there are now four] for many reasons.  It certainly shatters the long-standing image of the &quot;detective&quot; novel with its stacks of corpses, inept policemen and implausible characters.  Mma Ramotswe is simply a capable woman without special powers.  She focusses on the problem at hand, keeps distractions at bay and refuses to deal in absolutes.  McCall Smith's powers of characterisation, locale and story place him far above the traditional examples of the &quot;mystery&quot; genre.  He is compelling reading for anyone.

B000002HMH|5.0|I don't understand the reviews saying this album is poppy cause I seem to be listening to something else here.  This album in my mind was theri last.  The tracks are catchy and as for the track 'the house that jack built' one word comes to mind, awesome!
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park simply put: SUCKS. Although an immature choice of words, it's true. Power chords, uncreative lyrics-it's the same mediocre &quot;music&quot; over and over again. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone with the ability to hear. But If you're a Linkin Park fan, go ahead, indulge yourself in this horrible slop of crap again.
B000002B7O|5.0|This is by far Ozzy's best album.  The late Randy Rhoads blisters through with the opening track 'Over the Monutain' and the album continues throughout with the same energy.  Flying high again has an excellent tapping solo and is ahead of it's time. I can't recommend the re-mastered version as the bass and drums have been sunstituted so that Ozzy and Sharon can earn more money, and this makes the album sound wrong.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Absolutely love Sully's vocals and lyrics and the drums and bass cannot be beat. The tribal feel of all their albums leave me wanting more and more. Fans will not be disappointed and those new to the band will go get the other albums. You a fan? You need this for your collection.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This has with stood the tests of time quite impressively.  All the episodes have a witty story behind them and the Spanish waiter Manuel, is just brilliant.  Sheer classic!
0385493622|5.0|Top 5 books ever.  In a nutshell, just good story telling...
B000006Z1X|5.0|Breath taking guitar work, excellent songs, especially Will You be Home Tonight, Stripper and the Wire and the Wood.  Anybody who thinks Vai doesn't play with feel and Malmsteen does, must be having a laugh.  As for the previous Alacatrazz albums, avoid, cause they feature duller then duller Yngwie J Malmsteen repitive fret work and the songs are stupid.
B000089RVX|5.0|2003 belonged to Evanescence. They are one of todays most popular rock bands, their cd has went triple platnum, and even got a teen music award under their marvelous belt. However, this album isn't the usual formula to triple platnum success, what with most of the Top 20 Charts being flooded by rap and r&b. Their music concsists of 2 smooth ballads and quite a bit of good quality rock peices.<br />  Their music is not what most people would find possitive or up lifting, which wouldn't usualy add up to their success. The cd is driven by lead singer Amy Lee and guitar driven by ex-band member Ben Moody. They were first introduced by Dare Devil's soundtrack with the song \\"Bring Me To Life\\" which quickly grew success with it's fast rock beat. But the album is also accessorised by smooth piano ballads with \\"My Immortal\\" which was is also on the Dare Devil Soundtrack.<br />  The CD would not be too pleasant if you are expecting pop music and fun teeny-bopper peices that you would hear from Good Charlotte or boy bands such as N*Sync or Back Street Boys. However, if you are wanting honest music with a good meaning this CD could quite possibly be the CD you have been waiting for
B000002B7S|3.0|There is only one track on this album that is awesome and thats the Title.  As for the rest of this album, one word - cr*p.
B00005JKC3|5.0|It is obvious a lot of effort went into this production.  It's not perfect, but those not suffering from A.D.D. will be pleasantly surprised.  The story is a little confusing, but certainly plausible in a comic book world.  The CGI Hulk was incredible.  Movement was a little jerky when he initially jumped, but overall the effects were outstanding.  When a bomb hits the house and he gets blasted by the shockwave a split second later...well you'll just have to see it to fathom the awesome effect.  His encounter with the tanks have some of the best scenes in science fiction film history.  The confusion surrounding the climax towards the end was the only disappointment for me.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|When this film was first released it blew everybody away.  The follow films were dia, but this is by far the classic of the pack.  A must!
B000059XUT|5.0|Toy story is the first animated feature and one the best animated film of any kind. Disney's discontinued single dvd features great picture and sound. I don't know if all this disney sending films back to the vault is a scam for later release. I guess the film is also availbe with toy story 2 with a bonus disc, because frankly there aren't any bonuses on this disc. This single disc of the film can still be found in some stores, but it keeps on getting harder to find it. It looks like amazon still has some too.<br />Toy story proved to the world the art that could be created from cg animation. Unfortunatley integration of cgi into live action and animation continues to be sketchy at best. Even big films like lotr has many obviously fake shots. On the other hand animations that rely on soley cg graphics are extremely effective, got to love finding nemo. Really only humans come across as unrealistic in toy story and animation has continued to do a better job in that category. The film is a wonder of anyone who remembers a childhood filled with a wide variety of toys. Toy story's fantasy world of toys come to life is so effective because the toys are based on real children's toys. The film's best scenes make use of the practical abilities of the toys. So much charming humor resonates from these scenes. Like spirited away the fantasy world is totally realistic in its own terms and visually a wonder. Toy story has one up on spirited away because it has a strong narrative due to woody's jealousy of buzz. Sure the film shifts to a standard villian, but having woody as a flawed personality makes the character so much more alive. The sequel is good, but as i remember i liked the orginal better.<br />Picture quality on the dvd is flawless and beautiful. Presented in original aspect ratio 1:77:1, limited black bars for small tvs. Still i remember kiki's delivery service as the best looking dvd print, but toy story's is perfect, if maybe a little soft. Sound is magnificant wonderful bass and separation and extremely clean. A top above the call of duty sound track in 5.1. <br />Extras are a problem, i belive a three pack release had some stuff, but this one doesn't. Only pixar's early cgi tin toy short is included and its not that great. <br />Toy Story is a wonderful film for all ages that brings glory to cg animation and Disney's discontinued dvd is stunning in picture and sound, but lacks any extras of value.<BR>Recommended to buy before they are gone or until we find out what disney plans to due with its stored catalogue.
B000000WF0|1.0|The rest of the album is boring.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I thought it totally &quot;Impossible&quot; for anyone to sing this song with such robust flavor.  Ms. Aguilera has won herself another critic of great reviews.<br />You go girl!!!!
B00003CXRP|5.0|Tom Hanks plays the part of a standed man on a remote island brilliantly.  Throughout the film you are suspended as to whats gonna happen next?  Will he survive?  Whats he gonna do now.  Tom Hanks is a first class actor anyway and this certainly merits 5 stars.
B00013F35I|5.0|What a great show!  Forget what everyone's saying about the sound quality and look at the performance itself.  No one connetcts with his audience like The Boss.  And he still is The Boss, probably even more so than ever after seeing this show in person.  You gotta love the guy - some criticize the simplicity in his style, some say he's not a great musician - so he goes and adds some great new parts to his songs, like the guitar in Darkness, and gives a nice new touch to it. Or, take his piano playing on 3 songs. Or, listen to the great vocal performance he gives on Empty Sky - it was really beautiful. I think he does these little things just to show his critics he can do all the cool music tricks but what's really important, what matters most is the music, the connection, the feeling. <BR>    I really liked the Rising album when I got it, but this show takes all its songs to a new level.  The Rising song itself was huge.  The lighting was key, the mood was perfect.  Same for Lonesome Day.  Then, the way he silenced the crowd so he could deliver that beautiful rendition of Empty Sky showed how his music truly speaks for itself.  Without saying a word about 9/11, he gave everyone affected by and lost that day a fitting tribute. That's exactly what I love about Bruce.  He is America and he is humanity at the same time.  And it was so evident that night in Spain.
B00005221L|5.0|Another Arnie film that kicks.  This film has great effects and the story is good.  The follow up film wasn't bad either, but this was the better of the two.  Scary.

B00007G207|4.0|Sometimes, directors should leave well enough alone. <br />Cinema Paradiso in its original version is a lovely, funny movie about a boy growing up. It is one of those movies that can be seen again and again. <br />The director's cut is a mess that clutters up the original story with a totally unnecessary subplot, turns one hero in the movie (Alfredo) into a monster and the other hero (Salvatore) into a stalker. The editing is such a botch that end of the movie becomes meaningless. Had this version been released in 1988, the movie never would have won the Best Foreign Film award. <br />This new version is a textbook case of why directors should not recut their films.
B00005QCVY|5.0|They will be playing this film a thousand years from now.  It's message is timeless and because of  alifting on rights can be played over and over again on television.  This is by far one of the best films ever made.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a sad, sad story of a progressive, well written, well produced show that got booted way before it's time.  Fox television's decision to give the show the worst 'Real Estate' in prime time (Fridays at 8 PM), it's pre-empting by other shows and sports events, not playing the episodes in order and their refusal to promote the show beyond a few commercials surely contributed to it's low ratings.  It was hard to find and confusing to watch.  Never the less, critics praised it, and anyone who watches it (at least everyone I know, including my wife, who is not a Sci-Fi fan) loves it.  This show is a Greek Tragedy.  You could easily say this was the Star Trek for the next Millennium, a sci-fi 'western' that mirrored Gene Rodenberry's idea of 'Wagon Train in space'.  Not to say that the creator, Joss Whedon, was inspired by Star Trek, not at all.  Firefly is more liberal, and more relatable to the real world.  What shines is the cast and the writing.  The ingredients and settings are only slightly out of the ordinary, and in the hands of any average TV creator, would end up being bland and boring.  But the characters in Firefly are so well cast and the episodes so well written, that they stand out as real and tangible people who are cast together on this small ship for a purpose. <BR>The story takes place 500 years in the future, where a civil war has just ended and Capt Malcolm Reynolds has gathered together an eclectic crew to take on jobs in an old freighter ship called Serenity, Firefly class.  The ship is one of those So-Ugly-But-Cool, Hang-In-There-Old-Girl, She'll-hold-together, Rely-On-In-A-Pinch Flying buckets that everyone is so glad to see come over the horizon, that it's no wonder Whedon considers it the tenth character on the show.  Always low on fuel, its like the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars, it's destined to become a lovable freighter, and not a high tech ship of exploration.  The difference in characters of the human class is staggering.  You have a Two soldiers, the Captain and his second hand man...err woman, Zoe.  Zoe's husband Wash, who is the pilot.  A mercenary, Jayne, which is a great contrast when played by the muscle bound, 6'2\\" Adam Baldwin.  A registered companion, Inara.   Kaylee, the spunky young mechanic who loves her ship, but is obviously too young to know better.  A Doctor and his Sister, Simon and River, who are being pursued by the Alliance due to River's extreme mental intelligence.  And to add wisdom, there's Book, a holy man of the time who seems to be searching for himself.  The dynamics of the characters add to instructing personality studies and contrasts.  They find themselves with nothing in common and sometimes, everything in common when they need each other most.  The possibilities of this show are endless and Fox foolishly dropped it without giving it a fair chance.  The DVD contains all episodes including three that never aired.  The sound and picture quality are superb and the bonus features are great.  Everyone should give this show a chance, to see it for more than just the Sci-Fi aspect, more than just the space adventure, but as a study in character interaction as well.  If it gains popularity like the original Star Trek, maybe we'll be lucky and there will be a 'Next Generation' version in twenty years.
0385504209|3.0|The suspense in this book makes it riveting in parts. However, one should remember that it is a work of fiction. Undoubtedly, when you mix reality (e.g. names of famous historical figures and the existence to the Church)with fiction, a book becomes controversial. As I read, I actually felt like making marks in the margin where I thought the author was not making too much sense or was simply wrong. For example, claims of pro-feminine aims on the part of  the Knights Templar (an exclusively male organisation!)are certainly suspect. In addition, the assertions relating to male-female influences/relations before the time of the Church are clearly seen as incorrect if one has a knowledge of BC world history.<br />The book appears to assume a significant degree of credulity (as opposed to 'imagination') in the reader, which is unfortunate as it makes the reading experience less pleasurable. One needs to remember that although containing many factual snippets, this is primarily a work of fiction. Keep the brain in gear while reading this book.
B000002WU9|5.0|Im writing this review in December 2003 and I have yet to hear an album with such detailed lyrics and original production. Raekwon has an ability to paint vivid almost cinematic pictures with his rapid fire delivery. It might be a hard album to follow for those who are entertained by made for radio beats and unimaginative repetitive lyrics. It might also be a hard album to follow if you have difficulty spelling (Ghost).Buy this album if you're tired of spending your hard earned money on albums with beats and rhymes that could be put together in two weeks to please record labels and want to hear something that obviously took a lot of effort and originality.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|I got the 3CD set for christmas this year and was thrilled.  I had owned the first two (The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers).  I am a big fan of the Lord of the Rings, not only the movies but the books also.  Since my first two CDs were stolen I was really happy to get all three back.  <BR>   The case they come in is really nice and lookes great on the shelf. The trading cards that come with it are really great and if you are a fan you will love them.<BR>   Howard Shore is a great composer and I love all of his work. If you liked the movies, even if you're not a huge fan, you will love these CDs!! :)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Santa brought the DVD series to my stocking and I just finished watched the Pilot episode. Truth be told, I was a fan of the show when it first aired and was very disappointed in Fox for cancelling.  A series like this takes a moment to relax into the roles and create the plot-lines which keep us coming back. (Take a look at the first episodes of Star Trek Next Generation in comparison to season 5 and beyond -- horrible.)<br />What made this series for me was the ensemble characters (perfect save one -- I'll mention later) and the dialog.  Fresh, novel and totally without genre peer, this DVD series brings a smile to my face.  Its nice to relax with crew.<br />For me, and this is more of an indictment of the series as a whole -- and perhaps why it took a killing blow -- I think the &quot;girl in the box&quot; was too flighty, too annoying and just hard to watch. I think this was the most crafted element of the series -- everything else felt natural. Imagine the rest of the crew going adventure to adventure without the &quot;girl in the box.&quot;  Too bad we won't see that plot line run its course.<br />Highly recommend this series.  If you've not seen it, take a $32 gamble, you won't be disappointed.  Just wish there were more to see.
1573229725|1.0|Just because a book is by Sarah Waters (and she usually writes with more literary sense than many other lesbian authors) does not make it good literature, or even a good story.<br />I was so happy to find this book - imagine a lesbian plot line with more than a short afternoon's read!  By the end, I was so disappointed.<br />Yes, there are many twists to the plot, but I'm sorry that I wasted my time plodding through to the end.  If you want a good &quot;miserable-read&quot; with a bit more action, try the Lemony Snickett's series in the Young Adult section
B000003N7R|4.0|Duke and Trane play it sweet this time, no big orchestras, no avant garde explorations. Two of the greatest ever playing together, perhaps there is too much to expect from this meeting. 'In a sentimental mood' and 'my little brown book' definitely live up to anyone expectations, to me, the best versions of these 2 classic Duke songs. But there is also a fair amount of jams that do not quite live up to the hype. Not among Trane or Duke greatest recordings or essential, but still, a nice listen.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban is a singing phenom in today's world of &quot;entertainers&quot; (i.e. those who claim to sing but really can't). His enunciation is flawless, and his command of the music is powerful. The balance on this CD between contrasting repertoire is very, very good. I especially enjoy &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot; because it shows Mr. Groban's sensitivity in musical composition, as well as in musical performance. Compared to his debut album, this album focuses on Josh Groban, the soloist, which makes for a work that proves that even without well-established singers with whom he sang duets (such as Andrea Corr and Charlotte Church), he can hold his own. Much more powerfully, too, I might add. Finally, the musical back-up for all of the pieces is masterfully blended. The classical guitarist, violinist Joshua Bell, and pianist Josh Groban (!) each lend an integral part to the pieces, singing out in the instrumental interludes but murmuring softly under Mr. Groban's voice. All in all, this is a musical work that should appeal to both classical music enthusiasts and pop music devotees.
055357342X|3.0|So I loved the first two books of this series. I read this third installment in a couple of days (with not quite enough sleep). I will admit that I was emotionally involved and kept on the edge of my seat for most of the 1000+ pages, but I cannot in good conscience give this more than 3 stars. <br />I echo those who have given three or fewer stars in saying that there are some serious flaws with this series. My biggest gripe is that there is no way it should be taking this long for the friggin' plot to move ahead. I mean what has really happened in nearly 3,000 pages? (For the love of all that is good and right in the world can we get some better editing here?) People get killed, women raped and all in all the decent people just have bad luck. I could bear it in the first two books because I did really like the characters and I figured that things would pick up. . . hey maybe even a sibling or two could get reunited or Arya might jump off the road to becoming a murderess . . .hell maybe one of the old gods could suddenly appear and bite off Cersei's head. . . but did it? NO! It might as well have read the second book again . . except lots of main characters die here so i guess it wouldn't have been quite the same. <br />I'm definitely going to fork out money for the 4th book (the trade paperback version though) but if I&quot;m going to invest my time (and sacrifice sleep) for something I want to get something out of it. Thanks for all the character development  (and page after page of the same intrigue and history) but can we have a significant change in the situation here? Pretty please with sugar on top? If not, I think I'll have to move on. . .
B000002U88|5.0|THE DISTANCE is another great Bob Seger album. Several songs, especially \\"Even Now\\" and \\"Roll Me Away\\", stand out, and there are some other ones here that are also very good. There is more filler here than on BEAUTIFUL LOSER, NIGHT MOVES, LIVE BULLET, STRANGER IN TOWN, or AGAINST THE WIND, but overall the quality is very high.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I absolutely love &quot;Firefly&quot;! But Fox has done it again.  First, the tv network sabotaged the excellent work of Joss Whedon by tampering with the sequence of the episodes in its Fall 2002 airings. Now the Home Video division has placed several episodes out of sequence on the make-up dvd offering.  In the series, the first two episodes form the pilot, 'Serenity', which gives viewers initial exposition and sets the tone for the series, as well as introduces the nine key characters who form the crew and passengers of the Firefly-class starship &quot;Serenity&quot;.  Well, Fox tv decided not to air that pilot, but instead to air several episodes out of sequence in an attempt to grab audiences with action and mystery.  The result was a confusing and bewildering mess, which those of us astute enough to investigate, learned was network flubbery of an outstanding work of theatrical art.  When FOX attempted to cut its losses by reneging on funding the back nine episodes of a complete first season, and tossed out a few random episodes and the Pilot as the series finale, the result was a slap in the face to the sci-fi televiewing community.  When news of the dvd collection complete with the unaired episodes came, it was encouraging in that maybe now we could see the entire show the way it was intended to be seen.  By and large, mission accomplished.  The video is crisp and allows us to see the detail and remarkable craft of the technical aspects of the production, even without high definition tv, and to see the detail with exquisite clarity, especially in freeze frame modes, a dvd specialty. Additionally, the acting is superb, and the chemistry among the performers is extraordinary! The commentary adds to the enjoyment immensely.  BUT, once again, FOX erred in the sequencing of the product! The first two discs of the four-disc set accurately follow the sequence of events and the flow of the story as it unfolds.  However, for some indeciferable cause, probably not a reason, they have inserted the penultimate episode at the end of the third disc, and the finale at the beginning of disc four, leaving two other episodes disjointed and lost at the end of the set.  Hopefully other viewers will have done the necessary research prior to viewing the set, and observe the correct sequence.  Others will get to the end, watch the special features at the end, and realize that &quot;The Message&quot; was the finale, not &quot;Objects in Space&quot; and possibly feel cheated, once again.   For those who watched the original run and were thoroughly confused until the pilot 'Serenity' aired, seeing it again will be a welcome start to re-visiting what should have been one of televison's brightest moments.  Hopefully, this box set will re-ignite the flame of the Firefly fans and whet the appetite sufficiently to ensure the successful completion and presentation of the planned feature film due in November.  I have enjoyed the stories tremendously and highly recommend this set with the recommendation that you watch it in the order it was intended: Start with 'Serenity' on disc one and watch straight through disc three, and then stop after &quot;War Stories&quot;; go to &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; and watch it and &quot;Objects in Space&quot; on disc four; then watch the last two episodes, &quot;Trash&quot; [last on disc three], and the series finale &quot;The Message&quot; [first on disc four].  This is the way the show should have aired, and, if so,  it would likely still be airing today.  Thanks, Joss, for the great vision, and I'm so glad we can finally share it with you.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|Being a large Pink Floyd fan, I went out and bought this dvd before renting it, that is the biggest mistake I ever made.<br />I own all their other dvds, but this has hit in all time low in my whole dvd collection.<br />First of all it is not even a concert (lame), it is a all day live recording in the ampitheater. The cut away images are realy stupid. There is no good guitar playing, just alot of noisey slide work. Mostly drums. Way to much high pitched noise. Most of the time it seemed as though were just trying to make as much noise as possible. In one song they even have a dog singing. This dvd does not sound anything like the Pink Floyd I love (including Syd). It is just a disgrace, echoes is the only half way decent thing.
B00005YW4H|5.0|First off, Norah Jones' voice is so sweet and gentle, she can sweep me gently into dreamland even if she sang nothing but covers of tunes by Twisted Sister. That said, she can take a great country tune like &quot;Cold, Cold, Heart,&quot; do a rendition word for word, but put her out spin on it, with absolutely beautiful results. Her soft voice retains the angst that Hank Williams gave it, but adds an almost heartbreaking playful aura to the tune. <br />Those familiar with the songs spun on the airwaves are probably most familiar with &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and &quot;Come Away With Me.&quot; These are not the only stand out tunes; this entire CD is solid, especially &quot;Seven Years&quot; and &quot;Nightingale&quot; (one of the tunes on the CD penned solely by Jones). <br />&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is not an album to play in the car when you are on the verge of nodding off, because these gentle tunes will relax you to the extreme! If you've had a stressful day, or are too wired late at night, this is one of those rare albums that will induce relaxation--- not because there is anything mundane about Norah Jones and her choice of tunes; her delivery is gentle, comforting and mellowing. <br />It's easy to see why this CD has stayed a hot seller and garnered critical acclaim. I already look forward to Norah Jones' next release!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Pros:<br />1) More story and depth than the first Matrix movie<br />2) More and better fight scenes and special effects than the first Matrix movie<br />3) More development of the &quot;Matrix universe&quot; - how the Matrix works, etc.<br />4) More humor than the first Matrix movie, particularly with Merovingian<br />5) Agent Smith is a much more wickedly cool bad guy than in the first Matrix movie<br />6) You actually get the feeling that Neo and Trinity really care for each other, not just this &quot;you can't be dead because The Oracle told me I'm supposed to fall in love with you&quot; BS.<br />Cons:<br />1) Some of the action sequences went on way too long and got in the way of the plot<br />2) The plot doesn't make much sense<br />3) What the HELL was the Architect babbling on about? Was his goal just to confuse Neo into going back the other way, or to keep Neo occupied long enough to keep him from rescuing Trinity?<br />4) Generally a lot of ridiculously overblown BS... but don't ALL of the Matrix movies have that?<br />Overall, while this isn't exactly Requiem for a Dream or The English Patient, it's still a lot better than just two hours of mindlessly blowing stuff up (like that godawful piece of crap Swordfish).
B000001OAA|5.0|&quot;Stupid Girl&quot; rocks and Garbage lays the seeds for a flourishing career in music. Shirley Manson has an excellent voice and really shines on this record.
0676973779|4.0|the book itself is very interesting, as told by Pi, the teenage boy from India.  growing up with animals(dad is a zookeeper), had to learn to deal with tiger on a lifeboat for 200 some days. the story was told smoothly, some parts are no doubt gross ( he told us how he kill fish, and turtles).  but once you are done with the book, you feel a sense of relief.  i have to say, I fall in love with the tiger, and Pi.  no doubt you would too.<br />Pi also shared his view on a lot of things, such as the zoo, animal.  it really makes you think the way the world works.  i only give 4 stars, cuz the book does go into graphical details to make it believable, and i find it it's too much
B000089RVR|5.0|Hey, anyone who puts in David Boreanaz in their video automatically gets high praise! Good job, Dido!
B00009ATIX|2.0|The argument for Solaris is that it is an intelligent, though provoking literary movie based in a science-fictional context. One reviewer calls it a \\"taut psychological experience that will leave you breathless.\\" It is not. It is simplistic and unchallenging. The emotional connection between Clooney and his wife is never convincing enough to produce the conundrum of circumstances that are portrayed. I did enjoy the movie. It was beautiful to watch and the performances were excellent, but it simply is not psychologically, emotionally or intellectually intense enough to justify the slow and drawn out pace. It had potential, but comes up short.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|The girl has a rude &amp; condescending attitude. She thinks she is all that cause she can stroke a few keys. She complains about Britney &amp; Christine, but all she has to do is look in a mirror and see she is no different than the rest.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I not only watched the film, but everything else on this DVD in one sitting... it was that captivating!  I had really enjoyed the book, but my initial decision was to skip the movie when it was in the theatres this summer.  I didn't think Toby Maguire of Spiderman fame would have much interest for me in a story like this.<br />Well, tonight was slim pickings at the rental store so I picked this one up.  Wow.  Not only was I wrong about Maguire (he is excellent in this role), but I should definitely seen this on movie screen to get the full effect of the racing closeups, etc.  <br />This movie made me laugh, it made me cry, and most importantly, it made me think.  Some people might think this movie was cliche-ridden or corny (&quot;some people just need a second chance&quot;) or too boring, but my answer to that is:  go rent your typical American escapist fare and remain shallow and clueless.  That leaves a copy of great movies like this on the shelf for me :)
B000127LW2|3.0|I definitely recommend purchasing the first few seasons of VOYAGER. The early episodes are fun, especially those involving Sesk and the Kazon. The Vidiians are also a great villian and the show was not as \\"preachy\\" as it got in later seasons. The only downside to the show is the Doc and Neelix (2 hammy actors in the vain of Data). I'm looking forward to Genvieve Bujold's deleted scenes as the captain. That alone is worth the purchase price. Enjoy VOYAGER when it was fun and before it became the 7 of 9 show.
B000002JOH|5.0|This is one of my favourite CD's. It is Pantera's best album. My favourite songs on here are A New Level, Fu--ing Hostile, This Love and WALK... This is Heavy Metal with good Chorus' and a GREAT Guitarist, Dimebag. Vinnie Paul is a good Drummer too, and Phil's lyrics are splendid. Bassist sucks...on one of these songs... Pantera make the BEST headbanging riffs I've ever heard. This is truely a Metal Masterpiece.
B0000UJL96|5.0|The sixth film featuring the original crew is a true highlight in the world of Trek. Just as times were changing in the late 80s with the advent of TNG as well as worldly events as the fall of the Soviet Union and teh Berlin Wall, Trek seized the ideals and crafted a well written and acted film. The Klingon homeworld is in danger and the entire race is on the brink of becoming extinct. It is up to the Federation and Capt Kirk to work out a peaceful way for them to relocate and draw up an alliance that will have lasting effects. Enter new characters such as the vengeful Chang, Vulcan nymphette Valaris (played marvelously by future Sex & The City star Kim Catrall) and Iman as a shapeshifter and Kirk is in for the ride of his life. The film is very political and in such, this is where Trek is at its best. Mixing politics with action and not being too \\"preachy,\\" this is what Roddenberry envisioned.
B00005JMGL|3.0|I was disappointed when this film ended.  The film ends when Wendy, John, and Michael return to London with the lost boys, instead of continuing on to what would have been the epilogue scene.  The movie people decided to behave lazy and cut off the epilogue scene, which was an extremely important part of the story.  After all, they did say that this version of Peter Pan was supposed to be fully realized.<br />The reason why I am saying this is because I know they were thinking about this scene while making the film.  The reason why I know they were thinking about this scene is because in the first place, the character Jane and the actress portraying her were on the cast list.  The actress who was supposed to play Jane was a little girl named Sophie Wyburd (she is a London-born actress who appeared in \\"The Hours\\" as Nicole Kidman's little niece Angelica Bell). P>Oh, the grown-up Wendy, by the way, wasn't listed on the cast list in the first place, but what would have been nice was if Saffron Burrows had played the grown-up Wendy in that epilogue scene, considering the fact that she narrated the film so wonderfully (and, towards the end of the film, told us that she was Wendy).  I know she would have been all right because she has been in some films in the past.<br />Well, anyways, kudos to the film's lovely narration by Saffron Burrows, richly beautiful art direction/set decoration, top-notch special effects, fine cinematography by Donald M. McAlpine, soaring music score by James Newton Howard, and ESPECIALLY an extraordinary performance by newcomer Rachel Hurd-Wood in the pivotal role of Wendy, which I honestly think is one of the best performances ever put on screen.  I could hardly believe that this was her first film.  She has the acting chops of a seasoned veteran and has shown me the true Wendy.  Rachel's ability to express depth and sweetness captures the essence of the story.  She couldn't have done any better.
B0000C8AVX|4.0|well, i'll start this off by saying that this is really where dylan went from folk to rock, and it was a glorious transformation. it starts out with the classic subbteranean homesick blues. then it goes into she belongs to me, which is also an very good song. maggies farm is a classic as well, and is rather humorous. i'm not a big fan of love minus zero, which is the only reason this gets 4 stars. i really like outlaw blues alot. its a little bit lesser known than some others, but its great. on the road again is another one i'm not a big fan of, whcih is another reason i subtracted a star. i love the beggining of bob dylans 115th dream, where apparently his band doesn't start. but besides that its  a great song anyways, with some very good lyrics, but you'd expect great lyrics, because its dylan. mr. tambourine man is of course one of dylans classic songs, and very whimsical and great. gates of eden has for some strange reason always sounded like a stones song to me. its a real good song, and its a great acoustic number. it's alright ma, i'm only bleeding is one of my favorite dylan songs ever. i love the guitar in it, and of course dylans lyrics are very very poetic in this one. its all over now, baby blue is my favorite dyaln song. it sounds very sorrowful, and having a feeling of loss, and its just extremely moving.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I am also a die-hard Dream Theater fan.  In fact I have been to see them live twice this year.  Awesome!  When I heard about the realease of this album I was very surprised though.  They have been touring like crazy for over a year now and the material on this album reflect that--a tired band who seem to be taking out some frustration on their respective instruments without invloving much musicianship.  They tend to put much more time and effort into producing great albums.  I don't get that same feeling here.<br />For once I would love to see what this band can do as a much more stripped-down version of themselves (ala Alice in Chains-Jar of Flies or Opeth-Damnation).  Give Portnoy a basic 5 or 7 piece drum kit, Petrucci an acoustic guitar, Rudess a real Steinway piano, and see what happens. I know they could make some great music this way.  Their previous albums certainly show they can make great music.  <br />I would recommend you buy this album simply because it is Dream Theater.  Heck, the worse DT album (which this is) is better than most of the metal out there right now anyway.
0792841859|5.0|Wow Gene Hackman is almost crazier and violent in this than he is<BR>in Unforgiven and The French Connection(both in witch he one an<BR>oscar).This is by far his best,He played a redneck but a fair <BR>man and he was also caring but at times was a sadistic s.o.b<BR>watching him man-handle these Ku Klux Klan bastards and help the<BR>black people that are suffering is great and Hackman is really<BR>likable and Willem Dafoe,R.Lee Ermney,Brad Dourif,and the heart-<BR>less Michael Rooker are all also great and make the movie complete.Beleive it or not,this movie is rewatcable.
B000003TSP|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers about &quot;Dummy&quot;-but listening to this it is the sort of record that sets a mood and can create the mood--dark?-yes-but in a way that illuminates one to just feeling-the moment-it is there if one chooses to embrace it-the filtered vocals and the menacing beats draw you into this walk of aural mysteries and in listening you may figure out a few of your own--not the &quot;softest&quot; of listens-but sometimes you just gotta go with the slow bloodletting of ones' soul-either the artists or your own-you decide which path to take.
B000002JR8|5.0|The beast is unleashed with a vengeance on this one.Coming off<BR>their prior effort witch was landed on the #1 spot on the bill-<BR>board charts and more mainstream approach.We'll thats all gone<BR>here it's Phil with his throaty raw vocals mixed with screaming<BR>guitar solo's and pounding riff's,fast double-bass drum assaults,<BR>and a rythimatic bass lines.This cd is brutal and wicked with<BR>Stronger Than All being fast paced thrash song for about a minute<BR>than it breaks down into a metal classic with a ripping solo.I<BR>also loved Hard Lines and Sunken Cheeks way better than Gates or<BR>Love,it's fast through the verses than breaks down during the<BR>chorus and gets a solo as well.Use My Third Arm,Shedding Skin,5<BR>Minute Alone,Slaughtered,and Thereos Of Rejection are the best.<BR>Hell even Planet Caravan is good.Pantera really out did themselve<BR>-s on this one.The only one that kicks more ass is their very last effort Reinventing The Steel.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is an amazing CD.  Its beautiful melodies and creative song approach will not dissapoint you.  I can't stop listening to this CD.<br />If you are one of these fuks who hates this CD... i dont know what you're on, but you obviously have some serious issues because this album blows my mind. <br />lets keep giving this album 5 star reviews so we can bring it up to an overall 5 star rating.
B000002JOH|3.0|This is not a good cd,it's actually pretty good songs like This<BR>Love,New Level,By Demons Be Driven,Mouth For War just about every<BR>tune is good except the repetitive Walk.And this cd can get old<BR>really fast and at times can seem kind of weak.But it's overall<BR>good but not a huge step up from their debut Cowboy's From Hell<BR>(also pretty good).They stepped it up a notch on the later cd's<BR>like Far Beyond Driven and Reinventing The Steel because those<BR>cds are loud,fast,raw,and brutal everything Pantera should be.<BR>This cd would be alot better for people who are into the nu-metal<BR>scene with bands like Korn,Disturbed,Godsmack,e.t.c because this<BR>album is not really loud and raw.But it's still good If you're<BR>into heavier stuff like old Metallica,Slayer,Slipknot,Chimaira,<BR>Killswitch Engage then stick with the later Pantera cds.Dimebag<BR>get's some killer solo's on here though....
0425170349|5.0|Fans of the character of John Clark will enjoy this novel, although we see an older, wiser Clark now...not the cool, efficient field agent we've come to know.<br />Clark is chosen to lead a secret, multi-national anti-terrorism task force.  Well manned, well funded, well equipped, and able to act when other countries cannot, Rainbow is the world's greatest hope in the ongoing war against terrorism.<br />But Rainbow's skill and resolve will be tested by an unparalleled amount of terrorist activity.  Some of it is personal, and nearly all of it is related.  But the biggest threat is yet to come, one so horrible that failure is not an option.<br />This story, while very engrossing, does not have the typical, multi-layered plots we see in other Clancy books.  It's a more lighter read, but has enough cool gadgets, genre jargon, and intense plot to remind you it's a Clancy novel.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This album was amazing, it showed Zeppelin at their finest unlike the scattershot project \\"The Song Remains The Same\\". After listening to this it made my jaw drop at how good Zeppelin is live. Songs like \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" and \\"Dazed And Confused\\" really show how much of a guitar master Jimmy Page was, plus Robert Plant's vocals were amazing and Bonham and Jones kept the rythm alive. \\"Moby Dick\\" shows the greatness of John Bonham with his massive 17 minute drum solo. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is an awesome medley of old blues songs that should get anybody up and dancing. \\"The Ocean\\" is probably my favourite song,it rocks hard here, more then on its release on \\"Houses of the Holy\\". My favourite part on this album was the violin bowed section on \\"Dazed And Confused\\", there is an effect where Page makes an echoing sound from speaker to speaker, and sometimes his guitar sounds like it's roaring like some giant dragon leaving his lair. All and all I think anybody should like this album. My only problem is the lack of songs, there was about 25 songs from each show there could have been a lot more songs included. Buy it!

B000002KKC|5.0|Well this cd, is well different in a fleetwood mac's world of music. Still it has great songs the thing that i looked as experimental was Lindsey's songs. Even though people really think it's not Mac's best, it quite actually is, if u look between the lines. Maybe the only flaw is it's kinda of long and some songs are short then they are long and another flaw is that Lindsey's songs seem to be a continuiation of one to another. Even though it's a good thing it can be reapetituve. Anyways buy the album it's an album you should not miss out on.
B00008CLOA|5.0|we all have defining moments in our lives, moments when something is so eye opening that you know that your life has been changed forever. i will never forget the first time i heard this album. lying on my buddies living room floor, feeling alot higher than i really was, listening to &quot;dark side&quot;. about 10 minutes into the record [this was 1973], i realized i was in the one of those defining moments. the instant awe i felt was rather overwhelming. i insisted on hearing it again. nobody complained. we heard that record at least 5 times in a row. i credit &quot;dark side&quot; with molding the love of music that i still embrace to this day. my musical tastes pretty much run the gamut of modern music. my favs at present include zero7, brendan benson, and cracker, but all get my respect because of &quot;dark side&quot;. it remains, has it has since 1973, the greatest album i have ever heard. many efforts have challenged this position, but &quot;dark side&quot; wins every time. i would like to recommend a very loving tribute to DSOTM in the form of &quot;dub side of the moon&quot;, a recent release from the EASY STAR ALL-STARS. it is a reggae version of the entire album. and well done indeed!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Get this album.  Even if you don't own any other White Stripes CD's, do yourself a favor and give this one a listen.  These two have taken garage rock to an explosive level.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah Mclachlan has long been one of my favorites. Many people know that this album comes after the death of her mother and the birth of her daughter.  In my opinion, this is not meant to be a neatly crafted pop album like those previously, particularly Surfacing.  It is rather a meditation on life, what has happened to her in the previous years.  If you listen closely to the lyrics, they show a new found sense of self, a new resealance, a new faith in life.  My favorite of the disc is number 7, Answer.  &quot;If it takes my whole life, I won't break, I won't bend...It'll all be worth it, worth it in the end.&quot;  For me this song means that all my struggles and my faith in my God is worth it.  It's insprirational.  This is an album of astonishing clarity and beauty, depth and grace.  Her songs have been better... but the overall feeling of listening to the entire album has not changed...she is an original and with Afterglow she proves that through hardships comes hope. A masterpiece in this new world of pop candy and overstated beats. A great reflection on life.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|...I'm not much of a fan of Hollywood formula action flicks, but this one had many more redeeming features than most:<br />1.  A True Babe---in Charlize Theron, who is not only blonde but actually beautiful in a unique way (most Hollywood blondes are blandly homogenous) and can actually act.  Marvelous eye candy.<br />2.  Somewhat interesting characters---the computer nerd is pretty stock, but the others are somewhat original, esp. Handsome Rob, who's just hilarious.<br />3.  Somewhat original action scenes---how they dislodge the safe in Venice, and then the armored car in L.A., was rather neat.<br />4.  Unusual choice of Cool Car---I'd expect Porsches, BMWs, Ferraris...but never the Mini-Cooper, which looks the Communist-era East German Trabant, a little box on wheels.<br />5.  Competent dialogue---most action flicks are full of clunky, hackneyed lines that just make you feel sorry for the poor actors who have to deliver them with a straight face.  This screenplay in contrast seems to have been written by actual junior high school graduates.<br />Now my dislikes:<br />1.  Plot gets more than a little unbelievable towards the end---namely, why didn't our heroes just as easily wack Edward Norton's character themselves at the end, instead of paying off the Russian mob a huge chunk of loot to do it for them?<br />2.  Why does Charlize Theron get to keep her clothes on in this movie?  What a crying shame, especially considering she didn't in &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; which was geared to far less of a predominantly male audience.  Wait...could it be the PG-13 rating, which would allow in a lot more prepubescent moviegoers?<br />3.  Cheesy product placement.  C'mon, a world-class professional hacker typing away at a DELL laptop for Pete's sake???  Yeah, right!
B00005U122|5.0|Great show, show awesome in surround sound, Rodger is on top of his game.<br />Until \\"Delicate Sound\\" is released on DVD this is as close as your going to get to a Pink Floyd concert on DVD.
B00005JMTN|5.0|----<BR>Don't be fooled.  \\"Big Fish\\" is not the classic want-to-be \\"surreal\\" tale with random psychedelic elements.  \\"Big Fish\\" is not a movie that \\"tries to hard\\" to be different or bizarre.  \\"Big Fish\\" is *real*.  It embodies much more than what it may seem at first glance.<br />After a somewhat decline during his last movies (since his masterpieces \\"Edward...\\" and \\"Ed Wood\\"), Tim Burton finally decided to explore two more realistic subjects: first; a father-son relationship and second; the story of ones life.  \\"Big Fish\\" is left to the viewer to be understood, analyzed, and interpreted.  Like any other film, the final interpretation lays on the viewer.  However many directors are often biased and leave little room for personal interpretation making their own.  Burton, on the contrary, leaves a universe for multiple interpretations.  One can wonder how he managed with such a solid plot. Nonetheless, he succeeded.<br />The beauty of the profound subject, the imaging, the style, and the meaning and purpose of \\"Big Fish\\", makes it a film to be remembered by many generations to follow.  Tim Burton has delivered a masterpiece like never before: a landmark in US filmmaking.<br />5/5 - \\"Big Fish\\" is huge.
B00006F1LX|5.0|The initial release of the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; soundtrack was every bit as innovative as the film itself; after it was released to generally positive reviews everyone suddenly had to have snippets of film dialogue interspersing the songs featured in (or inspired by) their movies and Quentin Tarantino completed his video store clerk's revenge by being able to credibly claim to be influencing not only film for the last half of the 1990's but also film sountrack production as well.<br />The only trouble was that the original soundtrack CD, a complete blast to listen to under any circumstance, wasn't nearly as complete as it could have been.  Most of the music from the &quot;Jackrabbit Slim's&quot; sequence was left off (most notably Link Wray's classic &quot;Rumble&quot;, from the &quot;uncomfortable silence&quot; bit, made even more noticeable due to the, uh, uncomfortable silence).<br />This re-issue (sorry, &quot;collector's edition&quot;) of the soundtrack, timed to co-ordinate with the re-issue of the previously bare-bones &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; DVD  in 2002 goes miles toward correcting this oversight, providing signature songs instantly recognizable from their respective scenes in the movie (assuming you've seen the movie as often as I have) and one, the Brothers Johnson classic cover of &quot;Strawberry Letter #23&quot; that I can't seem to recall from the movie to save my life...but it too is a welcome addition, completely in place with the rest of the songs.<br />It would have been nice to have added a couple more splices of film dialogue as well, but that's a piddling request in light of the very-badly needed material that finally makes its way onto the disc.<br />As for Tarantino's 16:09 &quot;interview&quot; that takes up the second disc, chances are you've heard it before...there really isn't much new ground broken here (although the revelation that &quot;My Sharona&quot; was QT's original choice for Ving Rhames, uh, &quot;love scene&quot; was pretty interesting), as Tarantino made sure to milk his status as Hollywood's &quot;flavor of the month&quot; for all it was worth back in the day to ensure we all understood his love for all things '70's and the manner by which his movies find their way out of his (no doubt vinyl) record collection.  The second disc could very likely been put to better use than this, but of course it IS completely separate from the proper soundtrack itself so it's not as though it actually interferes with your enjoyment of a great soundtrack CD made even better the second time around.y interesting), as Tarantino made sure to milk his status as Hollywood's &quot;flavor of the month&quot; for all it was worth back in the day to ensure we all understood his love for all things '70's and the manner by which his movies find their way out of his (no doubt vinyl) record collection.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok let me start off by saying that I have NEVER been a fan of Britney, I have always thought she was trying to be Madonna.  Then this cd came out and Madonna was on it so I had to buy it.  Thinking that it was going to suck, I found myself singing along.  Now I find myself only having her cd in my car, well not when my friends are in there, but non the less it is in there.  Every song on it rocks, well not so much the second one.  Toxic is the bomb along with MATM!!!  So go get it.
B000001EYW|5.0|I believe that Still Waters is nearing the Top 5 list as my favorite Bee Gees album.  I absolutely think it's fantastic how they created this compilation because of its emotion and a song-you-don't-want-to-miss type aspect of this CD.  <br />Alone is the start of great music with its up-to-date style atmosphere, but it's a traditional Bee Gees song that never fails to please.  Robin's voice talents can be deeply shown in this song. I Surrender, I'm not sure -- it's not interesting as its steady and somewhat unchanging tune doesn't captivate me.  Barry has a good memoriabilia type voice when at the beginning at the song which did interest me, but the song just dragged on for me.  Now, I Could Not Love You More, this is the real Bee Gees type ballad/calm song that will be hard to NOT listen to.  I like Barry's and Marice's chorus in parts of the song--it shows a lot of emphasis towards the song.  Still Waters Run Deep, I really like this song too.  Again, it's more like the Bee Gees real music your listening to--right on target--I also like Robin's addition into a segment of the song -- unique.  My Lover's Prayer is probably one of my favorite songs on this album.  This song will remind you alot as a mix of &quot;Reaching Out&quot; from Spirits' and &quot;Too Much Heaven&quot; -- you seriously cannot skip a second of this.  Barry, Robin, and Maurice all blend their falsetto voices with a gladfully returning tradition to this song -- reminds so much from Spirits Having Flown album.  With My Eyes Closed didn't capture my attention like the other ones did -- it's OK, but it's not like the rest of this exceptional album.  Closer Than Close -- it's a bit far off in the woods for a Bee Gee's song -- it's different, but oh well--respect them for trying.  Same for Closer Than Close -- they put another song that sounds different, to me, because it has an unfamiliar plan to the song.  I Will is a great uprising.  The atmosphere of this song sounds 80's style --I like the way itsounds, and it is very intriguing.  The three Brother's voices blend in and will make make you listen to every single sound of this song -- it's that great.  Obsessions has great lyrics and entrancing emotions you shall not miss -- this song becomes increasingly better--the song accumulates into a very powerful, synthesising conclusion.  Actually, that might be my favorite on here too.  Miracles Happen and Smoke and Mirrors are emotional pieces of music that are perfectly arranged and I absolutely praise the way each song is orchestrated.<br />This album has to be one of the top 5 favorites of mine.  Its emotion and extreme potential in instruments, arrangements, and most importantly, the voices -- absolutely wonderful..  <br />Trust me, you won't regret getting this CD.  You'll love it.
0385504209|5.0|I bought this book after reading the first chapter on Amazon.com. I was hooked, after the first two chapters.  I could not put the book down, my husband would have to remind me to come to bed.  I have since recommended it to many members of my family and friends, and they all have had the same reaction.  This book will be one of my all time favorites.
0061015725|2.0|As usual, Michael Crichton begins with the most fascinating science and ethical questions of our time, and a great idea for story, and churns out a book in poorly written prose.  The characters are two dimensional at best, there are some inconsistencies within the plot, and the rhetorical cliches could only be perfect for, you guest it, a B movie script.  Once a gain, a brilliant idea degenerates into scenes better suited for action movies than educated readers.
6300215814|5.0|What a terrific vehicle for Audrey Hepburn's quintessential charms. This lovely and giddy romance adapted from Truman Capote's novella casts Hepburn as the urban sophisticate Holly Golightly, a lovely and wacko neurotic living her many gentleman friends. George Peppard, a writer who is supported (ahem) by a controlling older woman, is Golightly's upstairs neighbor. When their friendship turns to love, their tiptoe relationships with the moneyed people who support them is thrown off balance. Did you know Henry Mancini's haunting Moon River came from this movie? Perhaps I did, once upon a time, but I'd forgotten. At any rate, actors, score, screenplay, and especially Audrey Hepburn's charms combine to make Breakfast at Tiffany's a great movie romance and an insider's peek into the world Capote knew as few of his viewers do: the world of chic, high society bohemia.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I feel that &quot;In The Zone&quot; is her best album to date!! She has taken a turn away from the bubble gum pop and is getting more serious with the content and texture of the songs. I enjoy the whole album!! Definitely worth the Money!!
B00009Y3S9|5.0|The tempestuous story of the life of Frida Kahlo, Mexican flamboyant and surrealist painter, and Diego Rivera, her brilliant womanizing husband. Salma Hayek is perfectly cast in this sumptuous film that chronicles her own revolutionary behavior, not just politically but also sexually, especially given the era in which she lived. Beautiful cinematography renders a crippling trolley accident vividly real on the screen, while turning a trip to NY into a cartoon-ish sequence. <BR>Wonderful.

With a mixture of magic and poetry, secrets and good-witch schticks, she injects all who cross her path with a bit of her well-intentioned wizardry. Then she realizes she herself is in need of some serious fixing, and the plot thickens...<BR>Utterly wonderful, utterly delightful. And Amelie herself (ooh, those eyes!) is most irresistible of all heroines.

0385504209|3.0|I really enjoyed the book's premise and set up during the first half, but the last half was a bit of a let down.  I actually found myself correctly guessing some of the clues to riddles chapters before the characters did - and I have no pedigree in mathematics, religion, or code breaking!  Not to mention some of the plot twists that seem rather borrowed.  I had that sinking feeling of knowing exactly where the story was headed, pages before I got there.  The characters were bland, and the author could have used several hundred more pages on character development.  I frankly didn't care all that much about these characters.<br />Given the public's general ignorance about history, I'm both hopeful and wary about the popularity of this book.  Hopeful that people get interested in the underlying history and do their OWN research, but wary that they may take this fictional work as historical fact.<br />Also, I'm not all that religious, but couldn't help feeling that the author has one hell of an axe to grind with the Church.  Clearly, he is not a fan.  I imagine devout Catholics would have problems with this book.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|So here we have it finally after the long anticipated 6 years, Sarah returns with a work of art. Although i do agree with most, FTE was an album that could possibly never be lived up to again. Her latest attempt 'Afterglow' was surprisingly not as powerful as her previous,although, very moving still lacking in some parts. For the first time since I've been a SM fan i found myself skipping past tracks on this album on my first listen.After I gave the album a second listen I must admit I did grow to love each track. I must say that 'fallen' was a very well written beautiful song that I'm sure anyone could relate to. my second favorite would have to be 'stupid' for its more 'in your face' attitude. In a nutshell i must say that i am convinced that sarah does not have the knowledge on how to compose an album of bad taste. Don't let the bad reviews get you down. If you have always loved sarah's work than i guarantee you will love this aswell.
0553212443|5.0|This is a truly remarkable story.  Though this is a Christmas<BR> story, there is no religious thing and it reminds us what truly<BR> important is.  You can find out your own heart warming<BR> Christmas memory with Scrooge.  Furthermore, it encourages us<BR> to start fresh without hesitation and tells us that it would<BR> never be late to carry out Christmas spirit!

0446608955|4.0|Yes, it WILL make you cry. A short &amp; sweet love story, one that tv shows &amp; movies are made of. Inspite of the traditional &amp; predictability of it, it's a good book. The characters are likable as well.
0385504209|1.0|The Da Vinci Code is a perfect airplane book: not terribly well written, but a good read that keeps you engrossed for a short time.  Its incredible popularity seems to be the result of a media blitz (some 10,000 advance copies were circulated to the media prior to its release -- an unprecedented number).  However, Dan Brown's supposedly meticulous research is riddled with holes.  Furthermore, his theories about Christianity and the Catholic Church are downright wrong -- and offensive, I might add.  Others are simply lifted from the work of others.  Perhaps he is jumping on the bandwagon of Church bashers left over from the recent abuse scandals involving priests.  This book has been billed as a cerebral thriller that offers a history lesson to boot.  This could not be further from the truth.  There is little if any original information in The Da Vinci Code.  Read this book if you must, but please do not substitute it for accurate Church history, art history and original philosophical theory.  Instead, refer to real scholarly works -- NOT a work of fiction -- and then draw an informed conclusion.  Dan Brown seems to have a virulent anti-Christian agenda, and it is about time people stood up and took notice of it.
0425188809|5.0|I read this book years ago- but it still sticks out in my mind as one of Koontz's best. Pure mystery &amp; suspense mixed with a little horror &amp; the supernatural. Are the events in this book likely- no, but was it an enjoyable read? Yes!

0385486804|4.0|I would like to comment on two separate points in this review.  First, Jon Krakauer's writing and telling of the story; second, a brief comment on the main character.<br />Krakauer does a fine job of bringing the reader closer to an understanding of Chris McCandless.  The style of writing flows well and I was spellbound and could not put the book down until I read it straight through.  Although it is obvious that Krakauer is biased in favor of McCandless (in his beliefs and actions), the book is well written and extremely enjoyable.  Krakauer seamlessly weaves into the story his personal experiences and shows that he is the perfect person to present the story to the reader.  He succeeds in getting the reader to become absorbed into the tale as it unfolds.<br />Now, on to the actions of our &quot;hero.&quot;  While I admire and respect McCandless for some of his beliefs and his amazing travels and triumphs over adversity, I feel that he was immature, ignorant, arrogant and just plain stupid in regard to other things.  His unpreparedness to enter the wilderness (not really wilderness since he was so close to others), his lack of understanding of nature and of his immediate surroundings, and his absolute refusal to accept advice from others reveal his childlike immaturity and simplistic approach in his quest for truth.  As I say, I respect him for what he &quot;wanted&quot; to do and achieve, but the way he went about it showed that he was a complete fool who had very little understanding of the Nature that he so adamantly loved.  Examples of this are going into the woods with no maps, no compass, no axe, improper clothing, insufficient food, the wrong type of rifle, no knowledge of how to preserve meat and a ridiculous feeling of invincibilty.  <br />I feel badly that McCandless died in the manner that he did, but unfortunately, his death was his own fault and not an accident.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I bought this DVD after seeing The Two Towers in the theatre and thinking there was something missing.  There was.  It was added back in for the special extended edition.  I love this movie.  I love the books, too.  I know that some of the things in the books were left out of the movie, but come on.  Do you really expect people to sit in a movie theatre for seven hours at a time?  <BR>I would say that Peter Jackson did an excellent job with this movie.  It beats the crap out of the animated version.  Right?
B0000AMRJC|3.0|Brian De Palma's &quot;Scarface&quot; is a violent, expletive-filled bloodfest that, in the years that have passed since its 1983 release, has attained a cult-like following, especially with the gangsta-rap community. It's unfortunate to think that no film in recent memory<BR> has had a more negative effect on the society of America, especially the younger generation, than &quot;Scarface&quot;. Yet the 20th anniversary edition DVD seems to celebrate it, with a segment featuring hip-hop performers talking about how much the film has influenced their lives and the music they make because of it. <br />The film itself is marginally above average, saved only by Al Pacino's inspired performance as Cuban refugee Tony Montana, who defects to Miami and gradually gains the status as one of the world's largest cocaine dealers, until his excessive lifestyle does him in at the end. This is the only DVD I have ever had to watch with the subtitles ON, as most of the dialogue, while spoken in English, is generally undecipherable. It also stars a young Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira, the girlfriend of a rival druglord who eventually marries Pacino's character, though there is not one ounce of believability that she loves the guy- we never really see a courtship between them, then suddenly, one day, they tie the knot. <br />The soundtrack, supplied by Giorgio Moroder, is among the cheesiest I've ever heard, and the story by Oliver Stone(of course)tries to fit way too much into the film's near three hour running time. As a result, the plot feels rushed- of course, one way to tie up all the loose plot ends is to kill everyone, which is exactly what happens. &quot;Scarface&quot; is not the worst film I've seen, but it's no &quot;Godfather&quot;, and what makes it so appealing to gangsta-rappers is something that mystifies me.
B0000A1RJI|3.0|I missed seeing Pirates in the theater last summer but just rented it on DVD and enjoyed it quite it a bit.  I also thought some of the tunes in the movie were captivating enough to buy the soundtrack.   Big mistake.  Although the good tunes are still there the production quality of the recording is simply the worst.  Within a minute of putting it on for the first time I checked my amp, receiver, cables, and speakers to see if something was screwed up.  Luckily nothing was wrong-but that's a problem.  How did those responsible for producing this recording render the sound of a studio orchestra to utter crap?  And yes, I know it's an action-movie sound track but at times there is so much distortion that it's impossible to recognize the instrumentation being used.  And the percussion is so overdone that it sounds like a drum and bugle corps contest complete with football stadium acoustics.  In an age when so many great orchestral recordings are made there is no excuse whatsoever for such bad production.   I can see why practically everyone likes this soundtrack because the music is so sweeping, dramatic, and moving.  However, I am even more shocked that so few complained about the pathetic sound quality.  Best not to play this one on a decent stereo-its sounds far better on a boom box.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I own all four of the previous seasons, all of which I purchased for $30 or LESS, but as much as I love the show I won't be buying this season at retail. Hopefully the good people selling at eBay will be more realistic. Two discs for the price of four? HA, NO.
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|Realmente que existe mucha decepcin debido a la falta de imaginacion de esta banda que probablemente se sobrevaloro con el primer album que ralmente tiene como 3 o 4 temas muy buenos y los demas aceptables...... para haber sido el debut me parecio buen disco pero  no a niveles a los cuales se les llevo. Actualmente existe una carestia de nuevos talentos que propongan algo nuevo o por lo menos que reinventen algo la verdad que este segundo disco no me parece que haya tenido algun sentido de salir a la venta, pareciera como que son los materiales ineditos que tenian reservados.....en fin. Y para esto se tardaron tanto en editar un disco ? realmente que sera la ultima vez que considere a este grupo&gt;
B000053V7Q|5.0|I have seen plenty of musical performance documentaries and &quot;That's The Way It Is Special Edition&quot; is far better than any I have ever seen.  The picture quality is brilliant and so is the sound.  The wide screen edition is magnificient because of the excellent camera work.  Each shot looks artistically well done. Because of this wide screen format, you can see Elvis in relation to others very well. The viewer really learns who Elvis is by seeing him first hand singing with his band.  This version of the film is a hundred times better than the old one not only because of the better picture and sound but because it also takes a lot of the fluff out like the old interviews by the audience and replaces it with more Elvis never before seen. I would recommend Elvis That's The Way It Is Special Edition to anyone who loves rock n' roll.
B0000DJZ9T|3.0|Coldplay is one of the best bands out on the scene today, however the director of this concert should never be allowed to film another live performance again.<br />The video editting of the concert is really bad.  The director does not allow one camera to hold a shot for more than 4 seconds; it quickly blasts from camera-shot to camera-shot.  You can't even focus on a particular member of the band for more than 4 seconds because of the quick camera changes, odd zoom and camera angles, and the constant &quot;arty&quot; out-of-focus shots.  I want to be able to peacefully watch Chris Martin play the piano, but I barely can because of the weird camera angles and constant switch of cameras.<br />Coldplay is a great band, but I would have loved to have a concert that was filmed as a basic/ordinary production and not having the director trying to be all &quot;arty&quot; and do neat camera tricks, it's annoying.<br />In any case, the band is great, they played great.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Operatic.  Mythic.  Epic.  Leone's \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" is the ultimate Eurowestern:  pastiche-pervaded and postmodern.  Fonda, in his best role, plays the cold-blooded killer.  Bronson, never once registering a flicker of fear across his iconic features, plays the Man With No Name.  Jason Robards is the bandit.  And Claudia Cardinale (the Italian hottie from Fellini's \\"8 1/2\\") plays the lady.  Part revenge tale, part commentary on how technology and business tamed the lawless west, \\"Once Upon A Time...\\" is a genre film that looks like an art film:  the endless deep focus foreground/background juxtapositionings make DePalma's compositions in \\"Blowout\\" look amateurish.  The film contains very little dialogue.  Most of the film is told via the slow unfolding of deliberate and ritualized visuals--which also helps lend a pronounced art film vibe to the proceedings.  <br />As the commentary points out, the film references approximately 100 different westerns (including most of the best work by John Ford):  \\"High Noon\\", \\"Shane\\", \\"The Iron Horse\\", \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\", \\"The Searchers\\", \\"Johnny Guitar\\", \\"The Violent Men\\", \\"Duel in the Sun\\", \\"Stagecoach\\", \\"My Darling Clementine\\", \\"The Last Sunset\\", and so on.  <br />Interestingly, the shot in \\"Barton Fink\\" where Barton looks at the painting of the beach as the sound of sea surf mixes up seems to have been lifted from a scene in this film.  <br />The disc's commentary is of interest, and features Leone's biographer, John Carpenter, John Militus, Alex Cox, Bernardo Bertolucci, and others.  Bertolucci--along with Dario Argento--helped assemble the original treatment of the film.  Bertolucci talks about how he was heavily influenced by the French New Wave's passion for referencing genre cinema, and how he, Leone, and Argento sat down and screened every Western classic they could, and then--like Godard in \\"Breathless\\" and Tarantino in \\"Kill Bill\\"--littered the tale with as many genre homages and allusionsas possible.  <br />The three short documentaries on the second disc are noteworthy and feature talking heads with the same people from the commentary--as well as others--and point out the many merits and facets of the film. <br />Definitely one of the best DVD releases of 2003, and absolutely essential viewing, as you will be dumbstruck by scene after scene of brilliantly framed vistas and visages--and the plethora of rich and revisionist American western characters and situations.<br />Buy or rent it today!
079284078X|3.0|Director Richard Fleischer derailed the Conan movie franchise by making the 1984 &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; much more of a campy adventure than John Milius did with the original 1982 &quot;Conan the Barbarian.&quot;  However, for this 1985 Conan spin-off of a Robert E. Howard inspired creation, the warrior-woman Red Sonja.  In the title role is the statuesque model Brigitte Nielsen, making her film debut, with Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Kalidor, the Conan-clone who plays a pivotal supporting role in that he usually only shows up to save the film's heroine.  However, given the idea that Red Sonja has been given her warrior strength to avenge the murder of her family and her own violent rape, the idea that a man has to keep bailing her own clearly runs against the character's ideology (and you just cannot ignore that sort of thing when the title character has been empowered by the gods as long as she keeps true to her vows and avoids sex).<br />Arnold is a more engaging character this time around, which is rather easy since nobody is as sullen as Conan, and this is the first time where you really get a sense of fun in one of his movies (his serious resume at that point was the two Conan films and the first &quot;Terminator&quot;).  The problem is that by the time he first shows up the best part of the movie is over, and for every decent moment provided by Arnold there are three or four scenes with Ernie Reyes, Jr. as the annoying Prince Tarn, reducing the movie to something like &quot;Home Alone&quot; with swords.  The plot for &quot;Red Sonja&quot; involves a quest for a giant green orb and an evil queen (Sandhal Bergman), which makes it a lot like &quot;Conan the Destroyer.&quot;  Indeed, the worst thing I can say about this sword and sorcery effort is that it made me like the Conan sequel a whole lot better, which is not whatt I was hoping for at all.<br />One of the reasons we are surprised by how bad of a film we are watching is that the crew includes cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno and art director Danilo Donati, who usually worked with Federico Fellini, and the music is by Ennio Morricone, who did all of the epic scores for Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns.  I know that neither one of those two celebrated directors would have touched this project, but one of their assistant directors could have turned in a more competent performance that Fleischer.  &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; remains the best Sword &amp; Sorcery film to date, and with his two entries Fleischer gets the lion share of credit for sending the whole genre right done the tubes.  Milius is planning a King Conan movie for 2005, so there is hope, but those faintly flickering flames have gotten really small in the last twenty years.cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno and art director Danilo Donati, who usually worked with Federico Fellini, and the music is by Ennio Morricone, who did all of the epic scores for Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns.

B00000J048|3.0|The base pieces of this toy are a bit stiff for my kids' little hands to put together. Also, the pegs that hold the gears onto the base are a bit tricky, but will build good fine motor skills if not discarded in frustration. I was just as entranced by this toy as they were as we played with it together for the first time. The brightly colored decals are trippy and fun. And learning that gears transfer energy they supply to move other gears of various sizes \\"on down the line\\" is... priceless. *grin*
B00001ZWTT|1.0|Where did &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; go so wrong? It teams &quot;Men in Black&quot; director Barry Sonnenfield with Will Smith, Kenneth Branagh and Salma Hayek, and the only question afterwards is: Were any of them fully awake when they signed on to this royal stinkbomb?<br />Someone is kidnapping top scientists, and two US marshals are being sent to find out who and stop them from ... well, doing whatever it is he's kidnapping the scientists for. Capt. James 'Jim' West (Will Smith) and Artemus 'Artie' Gordon (Kevin Kline) soon find out who it is -- the evil Dr. Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), a freaky genius with no legs. (Seriously, he has no legs) His intention: Take over the USA.<br />Are our heroes going to stop him? You betcha. Especially when they learn that President Grant (also played by Kline) is a target for assassination, because Loveless wants to restart the Civil War. (Yeah, whatever) So West and Gordon accompany the beautiful Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) to Utah, where they hope to stop Loveless once and for all.<br />Like &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,&quot; &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; has lots of high-glitz anachronisms. The big difference is that LXG's anachronisms actually made a tiny amount of sense. &quot;West&quot;'s anachronisms just seem like cheap draws to draw in the action fans -- the big droopy metal spider being among them, and the extremely intricate train (complete with whirling pool table). Unfortunately, that sort of stuff is only fun the first time.<br />When Sonnenfield is good, he's very very good. Here, he is not good. The level of stupid jokes and idiotic slapstick is mind-boggling, and the few attempts at character development (like West talking about his past) fall flat on their faces. Not to mention the scantily clad women, who crop up constantly wearing little more than dominatrix-lite lingerie.<br />Smith and Kline seem to be giving it their darndest, but they're up Bad Script And Chemistry Creek without a paddle; they really don't seem to know what they're doing. Kenneth Branagh is apparently supposed to be joyously hamming it, but he seems more like he's giddy after a few whiffs of pot. Salma Hayek is reduced to walking around in pajamas that display her butt. She really has nothing more to do.<br />&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is one of the movies you look back on and wince about. It wasted the director, the lead actors, and the audience's money.

0896760839|5.0|...you find something on amazon.com that you wished you could have purchased nearly a decade ago, if only you had known of its existence? I bought this book for my sister-in-law. Alas, I no longer make costumes, but it was very hard to not just shelve it at home for later. I'm such a bad person, but this is such a beautifully done book, even though it's already coming up on 10 years old.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|I've been to every Rush show that's come through Atlanta since 1980 when Moving Pictures changed forever the way I heard music and inspired me to buy my first electric guitar.  In October I saw firsthand what this band is capable of... sheer musical bliss!  The Vapor Trails tour was unbelievable and unquestionably the best concert I've ever seen and heard including all previous Rush shows.<br />So of course when I opened this CD I expected something reminiscent of what I'd experienced in Atlanta just a few months ago.  What a disappointment!<br />While the set list is good, the sound is terrible.  I've heard bootlegs recorded from the upper level hidden in a jacket on a 1983 Panasonic tape recorder that sound better.  The overbearing crowd noise ruins this CD.  The only track worth listening to is Vital Signs which wasn't even recorded in Rio.  If the whole album had the sound of that song, this would be a 5 star review and I wouldn't be wanting my money back.<br />Bottom line...Rush owes it to their loyal fans to recall this CD and re-release it with a mix representative of what they've spent the last 30 years mastering.
0385504209|4.0|After having read numerous reviews of the book, both positive and negative, I have come to the conclusion that most readers are simply missing the point.  This is a work of fiction.  It is meant to entertain.  Maybe the ending could have been more satisfying, maybe the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, and just maybe the characters could have been insomniacs and didn't need sleep.  No matter.  Dan Brown succeeded in creating a story that grabbed the attention of reades worldwide, and whether you enjoyed it or not, you purchased it.  Literature is like anything else...very subjective depending on whom is reading it and for what purpose.  Therefore, it is quite offensive to me that so many &quot;pseudo-intellectuals&quot;  feel they have wasted their time with this novel and seem to believe that any intelligent person would abhor this novel.  Again, a work of fiction is meant to entertain the masses, and if readers are interested in a fast-paced novel with some inetersting information, they should read it.  It's entertainment and nothing more.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Execs at HBO - release Season 2 or your going to lose a whole lot of potential customers. <br />I've already forgotten half the plotlines from the first season and people who have already seen Season 2 on HBO are already talking too much about it - giving away key scenes and surprises.  In fact, all you have to do is innocently wander on to the web and you can already see characters who are no longer on the show - further giving away the story...<br />The longer it takes, the less and less I care if you guys ever release the next season.  Obviously - I'm not alone with these feelings.
B00008PW2D|1.0|Die-hard Sex and the City fans should be too sophisticated to succumb to this ridiculous price point for what cannot even be defined as a full season. I, like many of the viewers who have posted their own comments, am a completist, but rather than round out my collection of the previous four seasons with this so-called fifth one, due to the unfortunate manner in which HBO is trying to commit highway (or should I say Fifth Avenue) robbery here I am furious enough to consider auctioning off what DVDs I've already purchased. HBO should be ashamed. This really brings new meaning to the phrase (Home) Box Office Poision!
B00005JM1F|5.0|For those of you who enjoy Adam Sandler and comedies which start well but end up choking on themselves in an attempt to deliver a positive message at the end, look elsewhere for a movie.  &quot;Old School&quot; is one of the best comedies I've ever seen, along with Animal House, Rushmore, Zoolander, Caddyshack etc.  The cast which includes Will Farrell, Vince Vaughn (who plays a wise-ass better than anyone) and Luke Wilson is fantastic.<br />I won't spoil the plot for anyone except to say that if you can get by the wedding and reception scenes without laughing the whole time, stop the movie and go watch Tele-Tubbies or Barnie because you can't handle anything more and won't &quot;get&quot; this movie.  If you like Will Farrell, you'll love this movie.  If you enjoyed Swingers  and Vince Vaughn, you'll love this movie.  <br />Rent this movie.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Let me begin by saying that of the two Sigur Ros albums, I can't choose a favorite...they are both excellent, but to my ear quite different from each other.  I would characterize Agaetis Byrjun as the more orchestral of the two, using fuller, more sweeping arrangements.  There is also more use of ambient sound effects.  It's also, in spite of the darker cover art, the brighter and more optimistic of the two.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that this evokes in me the beauty I might imagine in Heaven.  Yes, there are some dark places here, but overall, this is a very comforting work to listen to.<br />Probably Pink Floyd's album Meddle is one of the best comparisons--especially to &quot;Svefn-G-Englar&quot;, which seems to have been heavily influenced by &quot;Echoes&quot;.  Although &quot;Svefn-G-Englar&quot; is not an epic on the scale of &quot;Echoes&quot;, it manages in its own way, the same kind of relaxed beauty found in the opening and closing sections of the Pink Floyd song.  The classic rock influences also show in Sigur Ros' reliance on more traditional instruments rather than allowing it to be completely synth-driven.  The Hammond organ is clearly audible in &quot;Svefn-G-Englar&quot;, and the Rhodes electric piano is featured in &quot;Hjartad hamast&quot;.  Also, the haunting backdrop common to most Sigur Ros songs is not created by a synth, but instead by an electric guitar played with a cello bow.  Jonsi's voice, rather than conveying any message, is an instrument in and of itself, even higher than Radiohead's Thom Yorke, and perhaps at times even more melodic.<br />While it is all quite good, my absolute favorite tracks, without a doubt, are &quot;Staralfur&quot; and &quot;Hjartad hamast&quot;.  A gorgeous piano riff in &quot;Staralfur&quot; serves as the backdrop to a beautiful string section.  This is the sort of work with which I would love to be greeted in Heaven--especially the final great orchestral solo.  &quot;Hjartad hamast&quot; is a very interesting combination between a melancholy-seeming blues-influenced piece and a sequence so beautiful that it evokes a sense of flying.  In light of that section, even the more brooding sections no longer seem so dark.<br />Other highlights include the percussion work on &quot;Ny batteri&quot; and the piano on &quot;Vidrar vel til loftarasa&quot;, as well as its innovative orchestral outro.  The last two tracks seem to move in a less orchestral direction that foreshadows the work on ( ).  &quot;Avalon&quot; even takes on a somewhat minimalist approach not unline Talk Talk's later work.  Lately, this album has even been a comfort in trying to deal with a recent loss.  Others' perception of the music may differ, but the overall effect of this album is to uplift.  While I love both Agaetis Byrjun and ( ), I must grudgingly admit that this is probably the strongest of the two.
B00002E233|3.0|Since the huge success of JAWS....how many countless shark horror movies have come out? 8 or 9? Well they all suck...none of them are really worth mentioning or remembering. Except this one. Suprisingly this is a good moive...even though it is a direct take from JAWS. Still it delivers its fare share of truly frightening events and what not. <br />Scientists on a research base in the middle of the ocean are studying on how to make a shark more evolved or to see how its brain really works and it back fires and instead, they made the sharks smarter, and quite larger than normal sharks. It involves 3 and now everyone has to try and escape the large confinment. They cant call for help because a strom has interfered with all signals and the place is sinking fast when a rescue chopper crashes into the thing. <br />Very good even if it is a mirror image of greater movies. I highly reccommend JAWS to this but if you have seen JAWS and are interested in more shark movies, this is the next onthe recommendation list being that it is the 2nd best to any other out there.

B00004TDTO|5.0|IN the mid 70's, every man woman and child who lived next to a beach and went in it every day suddenly thought about what lurked in the misty waters.  Jaws is such a horrifinly real movie that there is no argue to why it was such a big success and still is. It takes a good movie to clear the coeans for pretty much close to a year and even beyond. <br />In a small mcommunity town bodies are being discovered on the beach pointing to shark attacks. Nothing is said because the 4th of July weekend is coming and buisness with surly die if talk or a giant shark is rumored, so its kept under wraps by the mayor and sheriff. Still bodies continue to pile up and a reward is offered for who ever can bring in the shark. So this takes 3 mean on a trip into the sea to come face to face with the shark that has haunted the town. Now its man against nature in this all out fun ride.<br />Very good adaption from the book and it will surly make you think about swiming before you step into teh ocean again. Did for swimming what Psycho did for showers and TCM did for meat eating. Very good movie.
0471381985|2.0|There is simply not enough value in this book to justify using it.  I'm sorry but words like Alta Vista and Cisco just should not appear anywhere in a value investing book.  Period and discussion over.  At least not up to the present.  Maybe in the future but I doubt it.  Also there is way too much verbage to describe much of nothing.  The modern budding value investor would be better served by other book including Security Analysis by Graham.  A lot of detail is missing here and much of the analysis leaves one wondering if the authors know what value investing really is.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This is a MUST see movie for those who like to hear uplifting stories.  The acting is great also, and the scenery.  Filmed in Ky horsefarm country, and other US locations.  Highly enjoyable film with a true story line.
B000089RVR|5.0|Life for Rent plays on many emotional levels for me. Its stark view of relationships is both touching and real. Many of the things she is expressing we all have felt at one time or another. Layered into this sadness is the lush and hypnotic acoustic/electronica blend that draws me into a dream-like haze. There isn't anything I can really compare Dido to and that's a good thing. She is refreshing, honest and sometimes a little discomforting but surrounded by the lushness of the music, you can't help but love it.

0553801511|5.0|Not quite as good as the first one of this series, there was almost too much history and not enough substance, but it is still an excellent, absorbing read.  I kept trying to put it down to do something else and couldn't because I kept wanting to read.
B00005JMGL|5.0|This version of Peter Pan was simply breath taking, not an exact remake of the original movie, and yes the epilogue is missing, where Peter comes back only to find Wendy grown up with a daughter named Jane, whom Peter teaches to fly and take off to Neverland. I have a feeling that we will find this in the DVD 8^).  I recommend this movie for the child or the child at heart who too will never grow old.  Peter Pan is a family hit, again.<br />The scene where they all recite \\"I do believe in fairies! I do! I do!\\" truly echoed through the theater, as I am sure as was intended.<br />Bravo, Bravo.
0553582445|5.0|Not since my teen years have I stayed up until 6 am to finish a book, and I honestly didn't know how late it was, I was THAT caught up in the story.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|This is, and will alway's be the greatest gangsta epic <BR>of all time. This film was so awesome- astounding and <BR>well-crafted action, beautiful filming, and a amazing performence by the very talented Al Pachino (The Godfather Trilogy, Heat). <BR>The saporting cast which included Michelle Phifer, Steven Bouer, F. Murry Abrahms, and Robert Logia was also exceptionally good. <br />What i felt made the film so good, was that it was such a reallistic film (at certin points anyway's...), and <BR>the action was all there (it wasn't godfather or once <BR>upon a time in america...which were both great movies no <BR>question...)...and the very over the top performances <BR>were able to keep your attention going.<br />so see this film...it must be seen...trust me, <BR>you won't be disapointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|From the first trailers to my recent purchase of this series on DVD, it was love.  This series could easily be a replacement for Babylon 5, and if the movie is done as well as the tv series in regards to writing, character development, special effects et cetera, it will be a box office smash.  I love this series, and fervently wish someone would pick it up and bring it back.  With just a little bit of advertising, (Which Fox notoriously didn't do) it could attract a following as big as bab-5.  If you like sci fi series, buy this one, you will love it.   You also get your monies worth, for 35$ you get over 12 episodes...plus the 2 hour first episode, Serenity.<br />5 stars, Excellent.
B00005JMCT|5.0|This movie was good couldnt beat 1 or 2 but it was still good. Stifler isnt the same he was back in the day from the old films but he still is funny and makes it worth watching.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I am a fan of Scream, but I hate movies like I Know what you did Last Summer and The Blair Witch Project. So I was glad they were making a movie that spoofed on them. The Smiley Faced Scream is definately the funniest part of the movie. He makes several appearences and never fails to make you laugh. The toilet humor and the (down there) jokes will make your head hurt...because of how hard you'll be laughing. Just think if they made a \\"Scary Movie\\" spoofing on Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The acting was okay, yet it had flaws, but that made the movie better. If you are one of those people who don't like cuss words, toilet humor, (down there) jokes, and private parts of the human body being shown, stay far from this movie. <br />About the DVD: The DVD release of this flick was pretty darn good. It had a cool Behind the Scenes clip, and some pretty good additional scenes. It has some DVD-ROM features I forgot about. It has very good picture and it is widescreen. This would be a perfect addition to any DVD collecters collection. You have been warned!
0385504209|4.0|It seems most people love it or hate it, but I would say it's somewhere in between. The novel is a great thriller and kept me reading on, particularly for a good handful of riddles to keep us thinking. The highly-researched mystery of the Grail is a good introduction to people less familiar with the historical theories on early Christianity and even leaves a good start for how to do more research on the subject.<br />Certainly, it is not flawlessly written- Dan Brown insists on repeating information rather than trusting the reader to catch everything the first time and is unfortunately fond of cliches. Still, the fast pace and intriguing treasure hunt made up for it all.
0446608955|2.0|Ok... i thought that the story was written pretty well, hence the 2 stars. But the plot is literally ripped off from another story! The book is called LOVE STORY and it's basically the same concept:<BR>1. Rich guy falls in love with not so wealthy girl<BR>2. Girl only lives with father since there is no mother<BR>3. Rich guy has a bad attitude in the beginning and a bad relationship with his father<BR>4. Girl get sick and dies from the same disease that Jaimie Sullivan has!<br />The only difference is Jaimie and Landon are in high school, and the couple from LOVE STORY are in college.
0375703764|5.0|Its a shame to see such intelligent people so readily discredit themselves by declaring that this book is plotless or pretentious. Its a shame to see people uncomfortable that they might enjoy the same thing as the trendiest bohemian hipster at NYU. Of course, as soon as a book reaches that type of individual, it becomes the &quot;really intellectual&quot; reader's responsibility to dismiss it as postmodern flash. Now...surely not everyone is going to enjoy reading this book. And I'll admit that when you strip away all the things that make this book unique, you are left, essentially, with two somewhat derivative tales. But that can't feasibly be done until you've experienced the book. The book is thrilling, intriguing, funny, sad, and overwhelmingly strange. But above all, it's fun to read. So pick this book up and let it absorb you...you'll find it a rewarding experience. That is unless, of course, you can't stand the fact that so many people have now read it, and that it is to the point of underground trend. If that bothers your poor soul, then go find something deeper in the recesses of modern art, or you can just resort to the classics. No one can criticize or label you for reading some Mark Twain, or Hemingway.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this album. A devout Ben Harper fan, this is my first foray into the world of Jack Johnson and I am so excited to hear more. This is one of the &quot;easiest-to -listen-to&quot; albums I've ever had the pleasure to hear.
037542217X|5.0|Another little burst of delightfulness from the world of Precious Ramotswe, her husband to be Mr J. L. B. Maketoni and their assistant Mma Makutsi. Here there are all sorts of new developments. J. L. B. is over his depression of the previous book but problems are arising with the behaviour of Puso, the younger of their adopted children, which is becoming stroppy and difficult. Then there is the nasty development of a rival in the detective business, flashy, male, ex-CID and publicly quite contemptuous of the female competition. J. L. B.'s difficult apprentices remain as oversexed as ever but one of them gets religion. It is he who proposes \\"Learn to Drive with Jesus\\" as a name for the new business venture Mma Makutsi proposes to embark on in a bid to save her floundering finances. In the end however she gives up on the driving school idea and proposes to address the worrying lack of typing skills among her male compatriots. Meanwhile Precious and J. L. B. are getting a bit concerned that their enterprising assistant may be lonely and thinking how good it would be if she could find herself a man...<br />What with all this excitement there isn't much time for being a detective and indeed the whole detective business is somewhat sidelined here. Two cases nonetheless come Precious' way, the most substantial of which is no mystery but simply a commission to track down some people the client wronged many years in the past to whom he now wishes to apologize and make amends. This central story of a middle aged man, Mr Molefelo, and his search for personal redemption, needs a very sure literary touch to keep credible and interesting. But McCall Smith's touch is very sure indeed and it is entirely credible and rather moving. As is the whole of this supremely readable book.
0425163407|4.0|This may not have been my favourite Kay Scarpetta, but I still enjoyed it to the point where I didn't want to put it down.  I find that Dr. Kay is getting more and more human with each book, and that's a good thing!  In my estimation though, Ms. Cornwell dwells too much on the homosexual angle with each book.  This leads me to question Lucy's authenticity since she seems less and less real with each book.  I think the books would be improved without her character.  Ms. Cornwell tries too hard with her, and it shows.  But Kay, Benton and Marino are real characters.  In this book we don't see as much of Marino and that's a loss.  The story is intense and gripping, and the tension really doesn't ease up.  The book deals with biological terrorism, and that is certainly a hot topic right now.  For those of us Scarpetta lovers who love a tense and gripping tale with lots of forensics, this book does not disappoint.

0425180638|5.0|I've had a complicated relationship with Cornwell.  I think her first four or five novels are just great suspense thrillers.  But her Scarpetta series became increasingly bleak and tortured and I gave up on them after Point of Origin, which seemed to be chock-full of obtrusive personal mannerisms, and didn't even bother to read Black Notice.  Someone gave me The Last Precinct and I only started reading it because I was bored -- and almost put it down after the dreary first 100 pages.<br /><br />But around 125 pages in, Cornwell stops concentrating on Scarpetta's damaged psyche -- some of the criticisms here of the psychologizing are valid -- and resumes doing what she does best, deftly-plotted forensic mysteries.  The book came alive and was incredily suspensful after that point.  I made the mistake of reading it when I was alone at home and was often so afraid I couldn't move.  Cornwell has the unique ability to absolutely jolt one upright with surprising plot developments.  Last Precinct has several such moments and the plot hangs together in a very believable, if dark way.  This is a superb thriller and I heartily recommend it.  It's also clearly part of a series - Blowfly, her next book, continues the story.<br /><br />So I highly recommend this book.  One piece of advice: Cornwell more than any other suspense writer needs to be read in sequence.  If you are thinking of reading a Cornwell, start with her excellent first novel Postmortem and read them in order of publication.  Last Precinct is not comprehensible to those who don't know Point of Origin, although I didn't read Black Notice (Last Precinct starts minutes after the dramatic conclusion of Black Notice).
B00005JMFR|5.0|Despite inevitable criticism by some, this movie was a perfect addition to the other two in the trilogy.  There was not a part of the movie where I hesitated to watch the screen.  The action is superb and I am constantly impressed by the ability of the creators of every part of this movie, from the storyline to the amazing fight scenes!  It's fantastic!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I grew up listening to Johnny Cash on our family ranch. This album isn't anything like the early stuff, with the patented &quot;voice of God&quot; vocals that made Johhny Cash famous.  This album showcases an aged voice that is full of life experience, pain and hope.  The rendition of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters,&quot; with additional vocals by Fiona Apple is truly amazing.  I also enjoyed &quot;Personal Jesus,&quot; with John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on acoustic guitar.  Johnny Cash and producer Rick Rubin have left a wonderful legacy with this album.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|People doesn't seems to like change, so there were lot's of people that didn't liked this CD. I think they're missing the point. ToT is harsher, harder, heavier than any DT previous releases, but it is still as good technically and musically. In every DT album we've seen this DT's heavier side, but DT fans aren't traditional metal fans, many of them aren't even metal fans, they like it mellow, they probably were skiping the heavier tracks on the previous CDs... In this one, they won't be able to do that,  cause every track is a masterpiece of progressive, heavy, aggressive metal... Petrucci plays as usual (which is superb) but you won't find mellowness now, only harsh riffs all around... This is a different CD written from a different perspective, and it is a great CD, just DT heavier than before. I gave it 4 stars because I found something to be missing on this release, which were not on Awake, Scenes Of a Memory and Images and Words, their best releases to date, even though track 1: As I Am is one of their best songs ever.

So here's the message: even if the human race is faced with a large and growing population of genetically superior humanoids, it's nasty and bad to think ill of them or be afraid that they might someday erase and replace you, because that would be, well,like, discrimination and bigotry. And they seem really nice, most of them, just misunderstood and feared by mean human people.<br />And why are there no Neanderthals left? As the Great White Father in Washington said to the Indians, &quot;Trust us, we are your friends.&quot; Even watching Hugh Jackman and Jean-Luc Picard could not disguise the earnest silliness of the sermon. Talk about science fiction!
1573921394|4.0|I do realize that very little attention will be paid to this review (it being number 30 something), but I shall persevere in my noble effort to restore some order in the court of economics and public opinion.<BR>        After seeing the amount of vitriol hurled at this book I wondered for a second if I have somehow misunderstood it, or carelessly missed a passage in which Keynes urged us to kill babies. No, John Maynard Keynes did not kill babies, nor was he as such disproved (merely disagreed with).<BR>       The abuse showered upon him is a clear and unfortunate evidence of the ideological division between (politically) liberal and conservative approach to economics, which in itself is not an exact or precise science (some would say it is not even a science) and lacks sufficient rigor to have anything beyond trivial proved or disproved (I, personally, prefer the phrasing along the lines of &quot;convincingly demonstrate&quot;) within its framework. With all this in mind economics quite often provides ample room for opposing views, especially when views are not directly conflicting, except when viewed through polarizing lens of ideology.<BR>        The &quot;conservative&quot; economists along the lines of Friedman and Hayek, so frequently mentioned as anti-thesis of Keynes preached (in my gross simplification) free markets and government non-intervention, which while a valid perspective hardly merits a nearly religious fervor.<BR>        Keynes, or any other sensible theoretical economist, would agree that free-markets are a good idea in principle, which is seldom if ever realized. Government protectionism (not always bad), monopolies (almost always bad), lack of sufficient incentives and transparency (almost always bad), are a few things that prevent markets from forming and operating efficiently &quot;as if by invisible hand&quot; to use one of the most beat up quotes in all economic literature.<BR>          Regardless of Keynes' political conclusions the contribution of this book to the economic theory is invaluable. Prior to him there was no &quot;involuntary unemployment&quot;, that is people did not have jobs because they chose not to. As people struggling to find work in this jobless recovery know that is far from the truth.<BR>         The dynamics of labor markets were analyzed in a very unenlightening (but orthodox) way of supply and demand. There is a fixed supply of labor, there is a flexible demand for it, cut the wages (that will equalize the market) and everyone will be employed. This concept is remarkably easy to grasp, and is also remarkably worthless, because according to it the demand for labor is a certain &quot;thing in itself&quot; floating in economic vacuum with no relations with the real world.<BR>         Mr. Keynes, attempted to establish a functional connection between investment, consumption and employment, which is conventional wisdom now, but apparently was not in 1936. Notions such as &quot;propensity to consume&quot;, &quot;liquidity preference&quot; have come of this book to take firm hold in our thinking and have not left yet.<BR>         The book itself I have to admit, is not easy to understand, was written by Keynes for his fellow economists, and is peppered with technical terms like &quot;marginal disutility of labor&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;how reluctant am I to work another hour&quot;) the &quot;multiplier&quot; (the meaning of which escapes me at the time) and of course the &quot;marginal efficiency of capital&quot; (roughly translates as &quot;if I build another piece of capital equipment, how much money can I reasonably expect it to make&quot;). Keynes has an affinity for Latin terms, and a maddening &quot;will to precision&quot; he is perfectly bent on making sure no detail escapes his attention.<BR>        If you are still reading my review, I would recommend this book to a serious scholar of economics (serious in a sense of dedicated), with an adequate knowledge of economic concepts and terminology. Otherwise you will be stumped, frustrated and most of all bored.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park is nothing but ear candy for kids with ADHD. This kind of music gets old really fast. The music is heavily processed and mixed and sounds more like techno than rock. The lyrics say the exact same thing in every track except i couldn't tell you what that is. The vocalist obviously feels pain, and the word \\"feel\\" is used an awful lot in his songs, but he doesn't give the listener any frame of reference for his feelings. This album is just completely void of anything that makes music interesting.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is the best that Fox ever lent their name to.  Its a pity that they didn't realize the jewel they had, and this DVD set isn't just one of many that are yet to come.  I am not usually a sci-fi fan, nor am I ever inclined to watch Fox. This show had me tuning into a TV station I never thought I would watch regularly and enjoying a genra that I never thought would interest me in the slightest.  That in itself is a testament to how good this show is.  I found myself unable to miss even one episode in my desire to learn more about the crew of Serenity, even the character I wasn't particularly fond of.  I would recommend this show to anyone who has a love of sci-fi, adventure, suspense, and comedy as these are all elements that frequently appear in this show.
B000069HK2|4.0|this is a good cd. the good thing also its not just a cd its also and enhanced cd so you see behind the scenes stuff like making the album and stuff. i didnt know what to excpect when i bought it. but when i did i loved there song taste of ink. then when i herd it, it kicked ass. buy this cd!!
6304675348|5.0|Scream is one of the best horror and best movies I have ever seen. Theres jjust nothing wrong with it. The acting and characters all went together so perfectly. Its a classic and almost everyone likes it. So I say you should buy it because it was a smash hit and one of the most remembered movies of all time.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|Although Two Towers is my favortie of the three, Return of the King is very good.  The addition of Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortenson's voices was a great touch, since both have very good voices.  Billy's voice is sweet, while Viggo's is deep.  &quot;Into the West&quot; is a great song and can hold it's own against &quot;May It Be&quot; and &quot;Gollum's Song&quot;.  It was an overall, excellent soundtrack and adds a pleasing finale to the trilogy of soundtracks.
B00005QK3B|5.0|What can I say? Not only is Marillion my favorite band ever (I'm an anorak myself), but Misplaced Childhood is my all-time favorite recording.<br />Possibly the best of the Fish era CDs, this remastered version sounds better than ever, and includes a bonus disc with a demo of the whole album. Outstanding!<br />Unlike many other bonus discs or &quot;includes previously unreleased material&quot; presentations, this additional tracks are not only for the die hards, anyone who's ever listened to the whole MC album and enjoyed at least 'Kayleigh' and/or 'Lavender' should give this a try. This are slightly different versions (as working demos tend to be), but of great quality and quite polished.<br />You can't miss...!
0385504209|5.0|I just finished reading this book. It was the most entertaining mystery/thriller that I read in a few years. It has all the &quot;required&quot; ingridients of the genre: murder, fast paced action, unexpected plot twists, a little bit of romance, and some philosophical and historical discussions (to make it more than just mindless entertainment).<br />The idea behind the plot is hardly new. One story with a similar plot that comes to mind is &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; by Umberto Eco. However, Dan Brown manages to weave a very exciting story around this plot.<br />This book is by no means perfect. In some places the story relies on foresight by the main characters that is hard to believe. In some places the characters manage to have lengthy discussions in what is supposed to be just 15 minutes. However, these holes were not enough to make me stop &quot;believing&quot; in the story.<br />Earlier reviewers make many complaints about the religion in the book. I think the book is fair and respectful towards Christianity. Those who complain that the characters offer their own interpretation of the New Testament should remember that so do all the priests and ministers in the world. This book is not a book on history or religion (fortunately :). Those who think they know the one and only true interpretation of the Bible should have some humility.<br />I enjoyed the book. I hope there is going to be a movie based on it. Since the story is set in Paris and London it would make for a very &quot;pretty&quot; movie.
B000002H4Q|5.0|but one glaring problem: they left &quot;hey you!&quot; off of the CD version. It was on the cassette, and was one of my favorites. I think it was a b-side to &quot;hot, hot, hot&quot; as well, but dang, it just bugs me every time I listen to this otherwise monumentally awesome album.
B000000XB9|5.0|Although the Chronicle Two also contains some delightful songs, this Chronicle One is really a hit-containing box. My favourite is and will always be &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; from the outstanding &quot;Green River&quot; album. Also &quot;Proud Mary&quot; and &quot;Up Around the Bend&quot; provide us with their great sense of making music. I would listen to this one over and over again.<BR>And if you really want more hits, Chronicle Two contains &quot;Cotton Fields&quot; (indeed a hit) and &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;, plus other pretty melodies like &quot;Don't Look Now (It ain't you or me)&quot; and a strong one like &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot;.<BR>Totally recommendable. Really essential pieces of collection!
B00008DDSC|5.0|This is an extraordinary movie.  Anybody can watch it, male or female.  I enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting more than anything.  This movie caused me to have a crush on her!  The genre can best be described as a Dark Romantic Comedy.  James Spader is great with his fidgeting and yelling.  The DVD presents the film in a widescreen format.  The extras include the original theatrical trailer of the film which is cool to watch, a 7 minute behind-the-scenes featurette with interviews with the director and cast, a photo gallery, and audio commentary from Director Steven Shainberg and writer Erin Cressida Wilson.  If you are a fan of Maggie like I am, see Secretary before seeing Mona Lisa Smile.
B000060K4O|5.0|Okay, I am sure many of you who are reading this have watched the movie before, so I am not going to talk about the movie itself.<br />The quality of the picture and audio on this dvd is excellent. Very clean and clear. The commentary is really fun to listen to also. You can see the black siloutte of the commentators while watching the movie with commentary on. They occassionally points at the screen to tell what they are talking about etc. It's really fun and great concept. Of coure you can turn off the silouttes if you just want to hear their voices.<br />Some of the special feautres were nice too..but some of them I really didn't cared about...<br />Overall, the dvd itself deserves five stars.
B00005JMEW|5.0|2003 was a pretty darn good year for movies.  We got Return of the King -- if not the greatest movie ever made, it's certainly one of them.  Kill Bill isn't to the scale of a LOTR movie by any means.  These movies are by their very nature more epic, and epic usually means better.  But that's what's so great about Kill Bill.  It's not epic.  It's a pretty simple story.  The sophistication of Kill Bill was not the story itself, but how the story was told.  As a traditional Tarantino, it's nonlinear, and just like Reservoir Dogs, you never actually SEE the scene at the wedding chapel.  That's Tarantino's gift; he tells you EVERYTHING about the pivotal scene of the storyline, down to &quot;Hotaru no Hikari&quot; on Sophie Fatale's ringer (for the outraged Americans, Hotaru no Hikari is the Japanese version of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;), but you don't see the scene.  Perhaps more brilliant is the music of Kill Bill.  It's simply flawless, to the open &quot;Bang, Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot; performed perfectly by Nancy Sinatra, to the whistling Elle Driver tune &quot;Twisted Nerve,&quot; that literally GIVES you a twisted nerve if you listen to it for too long.  That the music flows so perfectly with the scenes and evokes such emotion is what makes Kill Bill one of the best movies of 2003.  It's a must-see for any movie fan, not just fans of Tarantino.
B000003TA4|5.0|i didnt just buy this cd, so dont think im one of those guys who say they like nirvana and they only liked it for a month or a year. but ive liked nirvana since, along time. this is one of the first albums i ever herd. everyone who was close to me basically listened to hiphop. and i did for a while but this album changed my music taste. you need to get this album. it has all my favorite nirvana songs like smells like teen spirir,lithium,come as you are,in bloom,breed, and drain you. i like the other songs to. there is also a hidden track that i barely found out a while a go. after something in the way, keep listening like `10 minutes then youll heir it. the songs called endless nameless
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Despite what you may think of the last two films in this film franchise (I found them acceptable but certainly not on par with the first two), the ALIEN QUADRILOGY stands as a DVD benchmark in home entertainment.  One could argue that this package stands on par in stature to what THE LORD OF THE RINGS Extended DVD Versions have accomplished.  These discs (nine total) are filled with incredibly documented materials, including new documentaries exploring what went on behind-the-scenes while making each of the films as well as a semi-critique of the film series' impact on genre filmmaking.  If the discs have any shortcoming, I would say that the lack of true &quot;evaluation&quot; of Alien3 is missing from the supplementals; much of what is provided feels more &quot;promotional&quot; in nature and less &quot;substantive&quot; ... but that's a blip in comparison to the total package.  A sum total of nearly sixty hours of entertainment (films included), this QUADRILOGY makes for extensive viewing on aliens, filmmaking, and acting in scienc fiction films.  While the set boasts a hefty price-tag, I certainly felt my money was well spent.
B00007JVBI|4.0|Cat Power is a pleasant surprise in my life - musically speaking... I was staying the weekend at an SO of mine and he had this cd of hers... I fell in love with her music style immediately...  If you are a downtempo/ethereal dj - you need this cd of hers - as well as check out the rest of her music as I am going to do...  I enjoyed at different levels every track on this cd... So pick it up - you won't regret it...  DJ Dakini-NYC
B000068IEU|5.0|With so much hype about this film you will be disappointed, but not because Craven does not deliver on all the things you have heard about, but because the budget was very low and the story is weak to say the least. However exploitation films are certainly not about story or plot and let's face reality here for a moment - you sure as hell are not buying this to see \\"Gone with the Wind\\" are ya?? Over 30 years later Craven still pretty much delivers on the shock value in aces for a film that was made in 1972!<br />The plot is mostly illogical and is there only to string along a number of nasty and violent set pieces. ...<br />All in all, Last House on the Left is everything that it has claimed to be. Certainly the shock value has not diminished by much - if anything at all, but the story, soundtrack and acting does suffer a little in the 21st century. There is also a meaningless subplot involving two backward officers of the law trying to find the missing girls which serves as nothing more than a time filler and some humour, which to be honest, does very little to make you smile - especially when it follows immediately after a vicious rape sequence. For what its worth the film does pose a moral dilema. Rapists kill for sexual pleasure while mom and dad kill for revenge. Murder is murder whatever way you look at it and certainly the eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth philosophy gets all the workout it needs right here.<br />If you are afraid that Last House on the Left will not live up to its reputation then you are sorely mistaken. Its all here folks - the original \\"film nasty\\" which is still, surprisingly enough, one that Craven himself has not topped in terms of shock value. And for that it is well worth its place next to Texas Chainsaw Massacre on your shelf.
B000002LND|5.0|On November 13, 1990, just seven months after the release of I'M BREATHLESS, Madonna released her seventh album entitled, THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION. This would, obviously, be Madonna's first greatest hits compilation, and it is a great album. This album features 17 great songs, with the first fifteen songs being Madonna's greatest hits from 1983 to 1990 (all remixed in Q-Sound), with the last two tracks being newly recorded songs. Read on. <br /> <br />HOLIDAY <br />  From the album MADONNA (1983). Still an absolute classic. I still say that Madonna's best performances of this song are featured on TRUTH OR DARE, THE GIRLIE SHOW-LIVE DOWN UNDER, and THE DROWNED WORLD TOUR 2001. <br /> <br />LUCKY STAR <br />  From the album MADONNA (1983). I have always loved this song, but I am not too fond of the Q-Sound Mix. <br /> <br />BORDERLINE <br />  From the album MADONNA (1983). Words cannot describe this great tune. <br /> <br />LIKE A VIRGIN <br />  From the album LIKE A VIRGIN (1984). This is still a timeless classic, but I am not too fond of the Q-Sound Mix. <br /> <br />MATERIAL GIRL <br />  From the album LIKE A VIRGIN (1984). Great song.  <br /> <br />CRAZY FOR YOU <br />  From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack \\"Vision Quest\\" (1985). Still a beautiful song, and I really enjoyed hearing Madonna perform this one on her RE-INVENTION TOUR. <br /> <br />INTO THE GROOVE <br />  From the original motion picture \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\" (1985). I am not too fond of the Q-Sound Mix, but the song is still a classic. <br /> <br />LIVE TO TELL <br />  From the album TRUE BLUE (1986). Still a beautiful song. I am looking forward to hearing Madonna perform this one of her CONFESSIONS TOUR. <br /> <br />PAPA DON'T PREACH <br />  From the album TRUE BLUE (1986). Great song. The critics, who did appreciate the fact that Madonna is against abortions, bashed her when the stupidly accused Madonna of enforcing teenage pregnancy.Still a great song. <br /> <br/>OPEN YOUR HEART <br />  From the album TRUE BLUE (1986). Still one of my all-time favorites, for it was the song that turned me into a huge Madonna fan. <br /> <br />LA ISLA BONITA <br />  From the album TRUE BLUE (1986). Still a beautiful ballad, and this Q-Sound Mix is great. <br /> <br />LIKE A PRAYER <br />  From the album LIKE A PRAYER (1989). Still another one of my favorites and I love this Q-Sound Mix. <br /> <br />EXPRESS YOURSELF <br />  From the album LIKE A PRAYER (1989). Great song. A timeless classic. <br /> <br />CHERISH <br />  From the album LIKE A PRAYER (1989). Not too find of the Q-Sound Mix, but the song is still a classic. <br /> <br />VOGUE <br />  From the album I'M BREATHLESS (1990). Madonna's eighth #1 hit single (Billboard Hot 100). A great song, especially for dancing. <br /> <br />JUSTIFY MY LOVE <br />  New song. The first single from the album. This song, obviously, is about: S E X, which is why Madonna shot a music video to match the concept of the song. The video was so sexually explicit, that MTV had to ban the video from any airplay. Madonna did not object to the action, where she stated that, \\"...A lot of the graphic scenes that take place in the video are not meant for children. So, I totally understand what is being done here, I agree with it. But this is where I am at in my career\\". Being that the fans were going to want to see the video, SIRE RECORDS (Madonna's record label at the time, a label that was working for WARNER BROS. RECORDS, Madonna was, obviously, signed to both, but working under the direction of SIRE RECORDS, until she created MAVERICK RECORDS under WARNER BROS. RECORDS direction in 1992) released the video on the first-ever VHS Single. The video and its controversy are what helped the single become Madonna's ninth #1 hit single (Billboard Hot 100). Great song. She has only performed this song once, which was one THE GIRLIE SHOW TOUR, where Madonna and her dancers were dressed up in early 1900s Victorian outfits, like right out of the horse racing scene in \\"My Fair Lady\\". <br /> <br />RESCUE ME <br />  New song. The second & final single from the album. This is a great song, that talks about Madonna wanting to to conquer the world, a world where everyone thinks that Madonna is a freak. A classic. <br /> <br />    THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION covers all of Madonna's first hits from 1983 to 1990. I was disappointed in the fact that many other great songs were not featured on this album, such as \\"Burning Up\\", \\"Who's That Girl\\", \\"Causing A Commotion\\", etc. But this album is a classic album and all Madonna fans should already have it.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|We got this as a gag gift for X-mas.  Yes. It's that bad.  I Don't know anything about cars, but I do know that the dudes shift gears like 20 times in one straighaway and I don't think cars have that many gears do they?  Also - there are many scenes where people aren't wearing seatbelts.  This is supposed to be marketed to young people, and I don't mind the illegal racing, but at least wear your freakin seatbelts people!  I know street racing is alive and well, but the movie doesn't seem very realistic - they weren't even winning enough money to cover the damages on their cars from the race!  Anyway - the acting is bad, as to be expected in a movie more about cars than people. And I was a little dissapointed that dude didn't get the girl in the end - what's up with that?
B000002LLC|5.0|In 1990, Madonna had released her sixth album entitled, I'M BREATHLESS. People seem to think that this album is actually the soundtrack Madonna's latest film appearance, \\"Dick Tracy\\". I can see how that happened in people thinking that because the album is  entitled, I'M BREATHLESS (hense, Madonna's name, \\"Breathless Mahoney\\", in Dick Tracy). The album cover features Madonna sitting next to Dick Tracy. The front label says, music from and inspired by the film. But those people who thought that this was the soundtrack to the film were wrong because this is not the soundtrack. Madonna does sing each and every song on this album, which is reason number one for it not being the soundtrack. The only music on this album that is from the film are only three songs that Madonna sings, which I will point out in a moment. The rest of the songs are simply inspired by the film. Anyhow, this album, is simply amazing, and I will, indeed, explain why. <br /> <br />HE'S A MAN <br />  A great way to start off this \\"Dick Tracy\\" inspired album. If you listen closely to the very start of the song, you'll a clip from 'Dick Tracy\\". <br /> <br />SOONER OR LATER <br />  \\"Dick Tracy\\" Theme Song #1. This song was performed by Madonna twice in the film. She performs an unplugged version (not this version) in the beginning before \\"Big Boy Caprice\\" (played by Al Pacino in his most annoying role yet) captures Lips Manlus. The second time she performs this song (this version) is when \\"Big Boy Caprice\\" has his grand opening at Lips Manlus' club, after taking over the club. Great jazzy song. Even my father likes this one. <br /> <br />HANKY PANKY <br />  The second & final single from the album. Without a music video to support it, this song hit the #10 spot (Billboard Hot 100). I had the pleasure of seeing Madonna perform this classic on RE-INVENTION TOUR in 2004. <br /> <br />I'M GOING BANANAS <br />  Probably the only song on this album that is not \\"Dick Tracy\\" inspired. The song is 1:23 (1 minute, 23 seconds), but this is a great Latino like dance tune. Madonna even performed this tune on her GIRLIE SHOW TOUR in 1993, with performing \\"La Isla Bonita\\" right after it, for Madonna did, on that tour, perform in Mexico City. <br /> <br />CRY BABY <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />SOMETHING TO REMEMBER <br />  A beautifully performed ballad. Expect to see this tune to pop as the title track to Madonna's 1995 greatest ballads album entitled, SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. <br /> <br />BACK IN BUSINESS <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />MORE <br />  \\"Dick Tracy\\" Theme Song #2. An acoustic/rehearsal version of this song was performed in the film by Madonna as \\"Breathless Mahoney\\". After \\"Big Boy Caprice\\" takes over Lips Manlus' club, as well as taking Breathless (who was Lips' flame) as his girl, he has Breathless and her back-up dancers/singers rehearse this for opening night. BIG BOY CAPRICE (To Breathless about 88 Keys): \\"They next time I crush fingers and turn them into pretzels, I just might do the same thing to your face\\". <br /> <br />WHAT CAN YOU LOSE (Duet with Mandy Patinkin) <br />  \\"Dick Tracy\\" Theme Song #3. This is actually a duet between Madonna and actor Mandy Patinkin. Mandy had a supporting role in \\"Dick Tracy\\" as well. He played Breathles' pianist, 88 KEYS. In the film, they sang this song (this version) in one scene. Mandy, you're a great actor and I think you should stick to acting. <br /> <br />NOW I'M FOLLOWING YOU (Pt. 1) (Duet with Warren Beatty) <br />  Only over a minute long, but this song is kinda catchy. I am not Warren Beatty fan, but he really needs to stick to acting. <br /> <br />NOW I'M FOLLOWING YOU (Pt. 2) (Duet with Warren Beatty) <br />  Remix of Pt. 1. <br /> <br />VOGUE <br />  The first single from the album. My favorite song off of this album. This song definitely defines Madonna of the 1990s and definitely defines Pop Music of the '90s. Great dance song here. If you all want to know (those of you who do not know already) the 16 celebrities that Madonna mentions (the 16 celebrities that Madonna had idolized while growing up) in her celebrity verse, then read on: GRETTA GARBO, MARILYN MONROE, MARLENE DEITRICH, JOE DiMAGGIO, MARLON BRANDO, JIMMY DEAN, GRACE KELLY, JEAN HARLOW, GENE KELLY, FRED ASTAIRE, GINGER ROGERS, RITA HAYWORTH, LAUREN BACALL, KATHERINE HEPBURN, LANA TURNER, & BETTE DAVIS. <br /> <br />    This is another one of Madonna's greatest albums. Mainly, every Madonna fan had bought this album only for \\"Vogue\\". I know I did, but after hearing the whole album, it became one of my favorites. Great album here.

0062502182|3.0|This novel reflects a simple truth that what you're usually looking for is right in front of you all along.  Paulo Coelho makes use of an uncomplicated character a young man named Santiago who is an Andalusian shepherd.  He has a dream about finding his personal treasure at the Pyramids in Egypt.  He displays courage and determination to find out what this treasure is by selling his sheep and travels to Africa.  Along the way he will meet several people who will direct him toward that treasure.    The Alchemist is the last person he meets who inspires him to complete his journey.  He comes to believe in omens, fate and \\"personal legends\\".  My favorite quote from the book is \\"when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\\"  Readers will either love the simplicity of this story or be bored to tears.  One has to read with an open mind.
0345451325|5.0|This book is a very nice jewel.  It takes the reader into the fascinating world of the future, battling Covenant insurgents.  The formation of the Spartans and their whole training process was truly a worthy read.  From the first chapter, this book hooks onto you and doesn't let up.<BR>This book also makes a great prequel to the XBOX game, Halo.  It gives you a bit of an extra edge with the background you learn in &quot;Fall of Reach&quot;.  This is one book that will truly stay on my bookshelf forever.  I normally don't care much for science-fiction books, but this one allured me.  I personally found this book to be one of best science-fiction books, among top books such as Ender's Game, Dune, and the Lord of the Rings.<BR>This is definetely a book that anyone, teen through adults, should read.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My 5 year old son is autistic and watches this DVD over and over.  Usually this drives me insane, but \\"Monsters Inc.\\" is such a visual treat!  Each time I watch it (and I've watched it a lot) I see something I missed before.  Billy Crystal is a hoot, the images are unforgettable!
B00008J4P5|5.0|To  Dj Raucous: If you critizise the White stripes for her simple sound you didn't understand anything cause they want to sound exactly like that. This album was recorded within a few weeks and it is just brilliant. To me this is the clearly the best album of the year, and apart from all the other &quot;The&quot; bands The White Stripes are really special and talented.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Being a huge fan of Howard Shore's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; music, I went out and bought &quot;The Return of the King&quot; soundtrack on the first day.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but, after listening to it a few times, I quickly realized how fantastic it was.<br />RotK is very different from the first two discs.  I would never have thought Howard Shore could outdo himself once again, but I believe RotK far surpasses its predecessors.  A few themes carry over from the previous soundtracks (i.e. the Rohan and Rivendell themes).  Others sound vaguely familiar, but overall Shore has given RotK a completely different feel.  By incorporating recognizable themes with new ones, he has given the soundtrack even more emotional pull as it gently reminds us of past events.<br />The pacing on this CD, as on &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; is much more even than on &quot;Fellowship.&quot;  Time (72 minutes to be exact) just flies by when I listen to it, as the exciting, slow, and beautiful tracks are all spread out more or less.<br />Also worth mentioning is the closing song, &quot;Into the West.&quot;  It is my favorite of the three closing songs.  Annie Lennox sings it very nicely, but I believe its true power lies in the words.  They masterfully reflect the bittersweet nature of the story's ending.<br />Standout Tracks:<BR>&quot;Minas Tirith&quot;~ very upbeat brass features and fantastic choral work by the London Voices and Ben del Maestro<BR>&quot;The White Tree&quot;~ my favorite track; I love the strings in the background during the signal beacon lighting sequence<BR>&quot;Shelob's Lair&quot;~ very effective and creepy<BR>&quot;The Fields of the Pelennor&quot;~ more amazing choral work paired with brass<BR>&quot;The Black Gate Opens&quot;~ great tin whistle solo by Sir James Galway; ends with the &quot;Into the West&quot; theme<BR>&quot;Into the West&quot;~ I love how the words portray the ending; fun to sing along to<br />Bottom Line:  A true joy to listen toand must-have for any LotR fan!  You won't regret buying this one.  EVER!!!!
B00006RAKP|4.0|How can you possibly go wrong with a compilation of great songs from the great Elton?  It's hard, but I have to say that the exclusion of any tune from the classic &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; album and the inexcusable absence of the exquisite &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters&quot; keeps this from being a fantastic collection.  I certainly didn't need the bubble-gum Crocodile Rock or the forgettable Island Girl in their stead.  There should someday be a cd of Elton's greatest album cuts that would include such gems as &quot;Ticking&quot; &quot;Madman across the water&quot; &quot;Take me to the Pilot&quot; &quot;Burn down the mission&quot; and &quot;There goes a well known gun&quot; just to name a few...  Ah, well, that's why I'm not a record executive!
B00000JLWW|5.0|I was gratified to finally watch this excellent documentary on DVD, being that I could pause, back up, etc, to thoroughly analyze the causes behind the tragic sinking of a great ship.  And, as nearly always happens in such cases, the primary cause turned upon a simple, seemingly insignificant coincidence:  If the two sailors in the lookout nest had not been distracted by Jack and Rose kissing all giggly with each other on the deck below, and had continually kept their vision focused forward, they would have spotted the iceberg sufficiently early to allow the ship to be guided around it.  Accordingly, Jack and Rose join Mrs. O'Leary's cow as the heretofore anonymous precipitators of terrible tragedy, and we should all be grateful to James Cameron's detective work for digging up the truth.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Trying to describe Firefly is like trying to describe the meaning of life. ^-^ Firefly is one of the best TV shows ever and FOX is very stupid for taking it off the air.<br />Summary: A crew on a ship called Serenity searches for jobs for food and fuel while trying to avoid the new Alliance system that would love to get their hands on some passengers that have now become permenant members of the crew.<br />My favorite characters are Simon, River, and Kaylee. My favorite episodes are 'Serenity', 'Safe', 'Jaynestown', 'Ariel', 'Heart of Gold', and 'Objects in Space'. Check out the special features! See the movie when (not if!) it comes out! I cant wait to find out more about what happened to River in the movie and I hope Simon and Kaylee get together! FOX is very very stupid for cancelling this show. I LOVE YOU JOSS WHEDON!!!<br />^-^ Get this DVD set! You wont regret it!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Dream Theater needs to lighten up. The band represents the five best musicians in today's progressive rock field but lyrically and musically this effort has slipped off the tracks.<br />Detractors have long debated that DT's output is musicianship and not music.  This CD makes their case. Complex time shifts appear to happen randomly without consequence to the song as a whole.<br />The musical tone of these songs is bleak and joyless with anger and self-pity as the supporting lyrical content. This isn't entertaining, it's oppressive.  I'll take another Liquid Tension Experiment release over this threnodic collection.
0140157352|4.0|This is not the be-all-end-all for learning negotiation, but it is an excellent start. If you have a sales force to train, this is an essential text, short enough and clear enough to use for the sales professional.<br /><br />The Principles:<br /><br />A. Separate the people from the problem: taking things personally makes for vested interests. Keeping these separate makes for objectivity. Maybe obvious, but essential.<br /><br />B.  Focus on interests, not positions: People tend to feel they lose if they shift position. An interest more objective. There can be multiple interests, and interests come in varied strengths.<br /><br />C. Try to invent options for mutual gain: It's a win-win game.<br /><br />D. You must insist on objective criteria: this is the first step to getting to \\"yes\\" in an argument. If something is held objective, it is easier to accept.<br /><br />This should be on everyone's business shelf. A good beginning for learning negotiating skills.
6304539258|5.0|I've always considered George Lucas to be the Forrest Gump of Hollywood. He's an idiot savante who's somehow &quot;made it&quot; and become a household name. Prior to &quot;Star Wars&quot; he'd made two films of note, &quot;TXH&quot; (which I haven't seen) and &quot;American Grafitti&quot; (pretty average) and was flirting with box office disaster by making a &quot;sci-fi&quot; film. <br />A lot of people don't realize that &quot;Star Wars&quot; (theatrically released without the &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; subtitle) was made on a budget. It was these budget constraints that probably kept Lucas, with his affinity for short creatures (think Howard the Duck, Jawas and Ewoks) &quot;in check&quot; and turned &quot;The Star Wars&quot; into &quot;Star Wars&quot; and gave us a cultural phenomenon.<br />&quot;THE Star Wars?&quot;<br />Even less people know that as late as 1975-6, the vision that Lucas had for his movie was somewhat different from what we ended up seeing. See if you can download a copy of &quot;THE Star Wars&quot; script somewhere and see the subtle differences. One of the more notable ones was how much more &quot;THE Star Wars&quot; would have resembled a samurai movie. A lot of people accuse Lucas of doing Kurosawa-lite with SW when it came out. But Lucas' original vision had everybody running around with &quot;laser swords&quot; (lightsabers), even the Stormtroopers. Budget cuts cut down the number of &quot;laser swords&quot; to just a handful and that made them more special, not to mention a crucial story element. <BR>The cast was trimmed down too. Luke Skywalker (or Starkiller as he would have been called) would have been just a supporting player, the brother of famed JEDI BENDU OF ASHLA Deak Starkiller. The cast would have included Luke's twins (including Leia STARKILLER) and R2-D2 would have spoken English!<br />Of course, this would have spelled utter disaster at the box office. Somehow you get the feeling that if anything had been different about &quot;Star Wars&quot; it would have tanked. Somehow it just works the way it is. The acting is shoddy, the plot is less than original and some of the pre-Special Edition FX look dated. <br />Still, despite everything that's wrong or average about it, &quot;Star Wars&quot; just plain works. I can't really say this with any kind of objectivity since this is THE first movie I ever remember watching. You'd get kind of attached to something like that, wouldn't you?<BR>If I'd seen it yesterday, I wouldn't have gotten over the fact that CARRIE FISHER HAS AS MUCH RANGE AS A FRIGGIN' PORN STAR! But man, those X-wings look cool. My generation (and thanks to the Special Edition re-release, the next generation) has gotten the &quot;Star Wars&quot; bug.<br />And that's why George Lucas still has a job.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You love Buffy and Angel, and you have heard of this show, which was also helmed by Joss Whedon, and you heard it was canceled, and that its Sci Fi. Not really being too excited about wasting your money, but curious about the show, you've meandered over to the customer review section at Amazon.com. Now you've met me (Hello!)and I say, &quot;Firefly is the show that was too good to live.&quot; You wonder what I mean by this, and, to your excitment (OK, I'm being melodramatic) you discover that I am now about to explain. And I say...<br />I was just being ironic. I don't believe there was a conspiracy to kill Firefly because it was too good, it's just that Firefly WAS so good, it figures that it would only last fourteen episodes and then be axed.<br />Firefly, as I imagine it, was the imaginative playground of an extraorinarily creative team of artists who give free rein to their every latent productive urge that could not be expressed on Buffy/Angel. Firefly seems to have been designed in such a way that almost any genre or theme could be explored in a variety of strange and fascinating combinations that would have been impossible in any other format.<br />The show combines its thematic twists, genre busting, and stylistic conventions into a postmodern brew that comments on the contemporary while projecting it into the future and past.<br />With nine fascinating and charasmatic characters introduced in this series, the possibilities would have been endless for a show such as this. One can only imagine where Whedon and crew would have taken this show, but faint glimmers are hinted at by a variety of nestled clues and hints.<br />It is very depressing that it was canceled, but its unfinished nature does not make it to unworthwhile to watch, for we have fourteen existing episodes. And what makes them so great to watch is the obvious love the artists put into the show, and how much fun it obviously was to make.<br />I cannot recommend this show highly enough. The show was not designed to be a cash cow, but as an outlet for the expression of the artisic potentials of some very talented individuals for whom this show was obviously no joke (though frequently hilarious). The show was created by some very intelligent minds, and it does not stupify its content; like Hitchcock, it functions wonderfully on two levels, entertaiment and intellectual. No matter how short this star burned, its light was bright, and it leaves an afterburn in the mind, which inspires both heartfelt gratitude and the grief of dashed potential.w was not designed to be a cash cow, but as an outlet for the expression of the artisic potentials of some very talented individuals for whom this show was obviously no joke (though frequently hilarious).

B00005R23X|4.0|First of all, I have enjoyed the film from my first viewing in the theater to my most recent viewing on the Superbit DVD.   The film gives a rich, tragic subtext to the Dracula legend that most other films ignore in favor of gory special effects or cheap scare tactics.   The cast is spectacular, featuring Gary Oldman as the fanged one, Winona Ryder as his lost love, Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing, and Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker.<br />The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the digital transfer of the film.  Although I recognize that the film was released over a decade ago, Columbia apparently didn't take the time to digitally restore the film before the transfer, as there are still some visible pops and dust even on the Superbit edition.   The 5.1 soundtrack, however, will blow you away.  It was so crisp and clean, I had to turn down the sound significantly so that I did not wake up my baby. The soundtrack makes good use of all channels and covers the discriminating viewer who has a decent home theater system in excellent sound quality.  Thus, the movie sounds great, but I could not discern a significant quality difference in the picture from other DVDs.
B000077VPU|3.0|I too own the laserdisc of this show and got the DVD for the new mix in DTS.  The sound is good, but it's the content they cut (the opening acts) such as Metallica, Def Leppard, GnR, Extreme and others.  I would have gladly forfeited the &quot;extra materials&quot; for the original show instead of a bunch of new footage that was just as well served on the cutting room floor.  Don't get me wrong, the performances they left in are great...but shame on them for cutting what they did...typical non-musician producer.  The 2-star drop is for that reason alone.  Glad I didn't sell the laserdisc!
B000031XCR|5.0|Even if you don't have one single cd of hers, this is the one  you should pick up. All the way.....A Decade of song features Celine's hits that made her big such as The Beauty and the Beast, Because you Loved Me, and My heart will go on. It has something for  everyone such as All the way w/ Frank (featured in 7 new songs),  and upbeat ballads such as I'm Your Angel and Love Can  Move Mountains. Pick it   up and you won't be disappointed!
B000002H2H|5.0|What can you say that already hasn't been said. 2nd best metallica album behind MOP! GREAT GREAT GREAT A+
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Obviously, Images and Words blew most people away.  Awake and A Change of Seasons were great follow ups.  Falling Into Infinity wasn't that great, but it was something different, and very respectable.  Then Metro II and 6doit rocked the world.  Now comes Train of Thought.  At times brilliant, but at times kinda... Blah...<br />1.  As I Am<br />I personally think this is a really good song.  It has a catchy energy to it, and a steady beat and rhythm, with a wicked cool guitar solo near the end.  4 out of 5<br />2.  This Dying Soul<br />This song kinda bored me and I see it was a weaker part of the album.  To me, they blended nu-metal with the progressive style, and they made a good song out of it, but it's just not what I like from them really.  I didn't like Glass Prison all that much either so...  3 out of 5<br />3.  Endless Sacrifice<br />Absolutely outstanding!!!  It has a great chorus, a soulful intro, and cutting edge keyboard and guitar solos and riffs.  The lyrics are among the better on the album, and I can't get enough of this song...  5 out of 5<br />4.  Honor Thy Father<br />Is it me, or is Portnoy just pissed off?  I guess this is kind of an anger tune, to say the least.  To me, this is another of the weaker kinds of songs.  It's a nice thrash fest but, they coudl have done better, IMO.  3 out of 5<br />5.  Vacant<br />A nice calm mellow 2 1/2 minute ballad from James LaBrie.  Very nice, and very heartfelt.  Love it!  4 out of 5<br />6.  Stream of Consciousness<br />Instrumental.  Ranked right up there with Erotomania and Ytse Jam.  In fact, I think it's their best.  A lot of changes in it.  Well done IMO.  5 out of 5<br />7.  In the Name of God<br />Absolutely fantastic.  The best song, easily, on the CD.  This is an outstanding, can't get bored, 14 minute masterpiece.  5 out of 5<br />In the end, I think this is a great effort from Dream Theater, and a fine job at trying something a little different from the norm.  <br />4 stars out of 5  :)
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones' music can be an acquired taste, but once you like her, you realize that this is one of those silky voices that sounds great even without any accompanying music (although the piano sounded great).

0380002930|4.0|This is a book to put on the shelf with The Lord of the Rings and George MacDonald.  Like those books, it is a children's story that adults will find great satisfaction in reading.  <br />Like Tolkien, Watership Down is entrancing in its believability.   A detailed and natural sense of geography embodies both -- Tolkien invented his; Adams wrote about a real place, an actual Down in the hills of England.  Also like Tolkien, Adams has endowed his story with an in-place mythology -- the rabbits have their own age-old stories about gods and heroes and adventures.  It's amazing how much the stories of a people show us the character of that people.  Some of my favorite chapters of the book are when the rabbits stop to tell a story about the great El-Ahrairah and his clever adventures.  <br />Also like the Lord of the Rings, this is a novel that stops just short of allegory, and thankfully so.  The limitations of allegory is that the tighter they are, the more they are limited to the time and place they are written for.  Try to read Jonathan Swift's novels these days.  Aside from Gulliver's Travels (which is much more universal in its parallels,) without extensive knowledge of English/Irish history, you are lost.  Tale of a Tub, though brilliant and highly praised (and hated) at its time, now is hardly readable.    Instead, Adams, like Tolkien, writes of universal themes.  Universal enough that the crossover from rabbit to  human is effortless, and the crossover from his time period to ours or any other isn't very much harder.  The warren the rabbits leave dies because it refuses to change.  Is this the England Adams knew?  Perhaps.  It also applies to a lot of churches and businesses.   The second warren they visit has traded freedom and vitality for comfort and decadence.  Is this America, as Adams sees it?  Perhaps.  It could also be Rome.  Or suburbia.  <br />But these themes are not all that make this book readable.  A lot of authors have written horribly clunky books with universal themes.  Adams is a deft storyteller; his characters are well-drawn and different from each other, heroic and limited; one of the things I appreciated most in the reading was the peculiar limitations and abilities of rabbits.  Unlike most, Adams has not written a novel about men and called them rabbits; they are markedly different.  They don't understand bridges and boats and trains; they run fast but wear out easily, they are easily frightened, and can panic and be paralyzed.   In addition, Adams  has a great sense of suspense: he knows when to change perspective to keep the tension running, and when withhold information from the reader-- and parcel it out, bit by bit -- to keep us wondering, and reading.  The novel is paced well, and the problems the rabbits face feel legitimate, even inevitable.<br />A great book.  A classic, on its own peculiar shelf.
0393057658|5.0|This type of book, written the wrong way, can wind up only on the shelves of enthusiasts.  Instead, Michael Lewis did an amazing job creating a book which will not only be interesting to baseball enthusiasts and statisticians, but also to anyone who even has a remote interest in sports or business.  I agree with my local library's classification of this book as a non-fiction work that reads like fiction.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I love The Black Eyed Peas.  I was hooked by the poppy &quot;Shut Up&quot;, and floored by the knowing &quot;Where is the Love.&quot;  This is good hip hop, not that &quot;Baby cuz im a thug...&quot; crap.  That's what makes hip hop no fun.  I can't get over how well crafted everything is, and how well it all flows.  I love the multi cultural band and think of this band as a more commercial Spearhead.  Pick this one up quick!!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I inadvertently came across this DVD package while browsing Amazon and I decided to order it.  What an unexpected gift from above!  Truly the spirit of George Harrison permeates this incredible concert.  I have to say up front that I am an original Beatles freak who grew up with their music and who knows every note of every song in the minutest of detail (yes, I am also a musician of some 37 years).  Therefore, I always enter these \\"concerts\\" with tremendous expectation if not trepidation at what havoc an assortment of heavy-handed musicians can wreak upon the subtle genius of the Beatles (and George's) collective works. <BR>Alas, my fears quickly evaporated upon hearing the first song as played by Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne and band. One of my all-time favorites, \\"I Want To Tell You\\", was given just the exact amount of delicacy mixed with driving rock spirit (I know that sounds like an odd juxtaposition, but that's how George's genius works), that I was in pure musical ecstacy which did not abate until the DVD ended.  Every single performer from Clapton to Billy Preston to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to Paul McCartney (yep, he's there, too), played and sang every note with love, enthusiasm, and emotion as if they were trying to pass a heavenly audition being overseen by Harrison himself.  Paul's version of \\"Something\\", which starts out as a solo on ukelele then morphs into the full band/orchestra version we've come to know and love, could raise goose bumps on a cadaver. Yet, none of it ever seems phony, contrived or overwrought.  There is also a portion of the concert that features an incredible composition by Ravi Shankar and an even more incredible performance by his daughter, Anoushka on sitar.  <BR>I could obviously go on and on about this spectacular DVD, about how great the audio and video quality of the package is, about how moving each performance is (tears came to my eyes more than once, especially when you see George's son, Dhani, onstage playing guitarand looking like an exact clone of his Dad) but I'll leave it at this: if you're a Beatles/George Harrison fan, do not hesitate.  Heck, if you just like great music and wonderful artistry, don't hesitate.  Buy this DVD and don't forget the kleenex. Like the other reviews have said:  you'll watch it again and again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only managed to catch about two episodes of this show while it was on the air.<br />That was enough. I knew I wanted it. Now that I have the DVD set, I can say that it is worth it. This will be known as one of the best science fiction shows ever. Fox made a terible mistake.<br />Really, what other show do you know of that, after only having 14 episodes, reaches cult status within a year and number 14, as it is now, on Amazon's listings?<br />Buy this.<br />Then wait for the movie with eagerness.
B00008EY9G|5.0|When I first started watching this movie I had my doubts it was going to be any good.  I was wrong it caught my attention right away and I was hooked throughout the movie.  You are introduced in the beginning to a serial killer that up for execution in a short amount of time.  The storyline then changes and takes you to a hotel where strangers are all gathered together.  I have watched this movie twice already and I recommend anyone to watch it at least once.
0385504209|1.0|For all the rave reviews that I had heard prior to its release, The Da Vinci Code was really a mediocre mystery novel at best.  The mystery was actually solvable for any reader who just put a little thought into it.  The weaving of symbolic details and historical tidbits throughout the story would have been interesting had it been a little more in-depth...it was shallow at best.  I would grade this as just an average book to read on vacation, but not one to be listed amongst the classics.
0553212443|5.0|This is the book to read if you ever need to get in the Christmas spirit. Everybody goes through the holidays and becomes a &quot;scrooge&quot; at least once during the season. Though we aren't as bad as Ebenezer, we still need the realization of the Christmas spirit to set us right again. Reading the classic story of Ebenezer's adventures with the three Christmas spirits will bring warmth and happiness back into our hearts. It will be easier to give and be gracious, we will be grateful for everything we have, and we will remember what Christmas is all about. Thanks to Dickens for writing a masterpiece especially for this time of year.
0451169514|5.0|This is the only novel by Stephen King I could easily reccomend to anyone looking for that &quot;truly absorbing&quot; read.<br />I have read almost everything he's had published, but then I've read a great many books in my lifetime (I'm sixty-two years old), so that's not saying alot.  Frankly, I've felt let down by King on many occasions, most recently with Dreamcatcher.<br />With IT, the story seems to tell itself.  Nothing seems forced to drive the plot, and the characters become vividly alive (something King often has a serious problem with accomplishing).<br />When reading this masterpiece, I am utterly charmed by the lack of King's presense.  It is as though he himself is so lost in the story that one can imagine he might have looked down at his typewriter on many occasions while writing it, surprised to find his fingers were typing out the words.<br />This book simply pulses with life.<br />DW
0385504209|1.0|The topics this book touches on are interesting; Leonardo Davinci, Dead Sea Scrolls, Secret Societies, the Opus Dei cult etc. but the story around it is horrible. The characters are so stupid I am now halfway through and I don't think I will continue. I can't stand how utterly stupid this book is. The ancient codes that these characters are pulling out of their heads while being attacked and chased are so comical. I think the Scooby Doo cartoon had better character development and a more plausible story line.<br />I would like to note that I have no problem with any of the religious content in this book and I was in no way offended by it. It seems some reviewers of this book flipped out over anyone questioning the meaning of the life of Christ. I don't want my review to be taken as one written by a religious freak.<br />A note for the author -- I can't take the main character Sophie being surprised by one more thing - after about one hundered &quot;shocking events.&quot; Toughen up Sophie!  I bet there will be yet another surprise on the next page you complete idiot !!!!!!!!!!!
B000002UAR|2.0|Attributing the success of ground breaking artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s to this release is laughable.  While the Beatles deserve credit for moving music out of the Elvis and Beach Boys era into a more guitar oriented rock sound, it happened with A Hard Day's Night.  Not with likes of Eleanor Rigby.
B000068TP0|5.0|I am a HUGE Shakira fan...like seriously.  I bought this DVD and I have seen it as of today over 45 times.  I love watching Shakira sing and perform.  Shakira isn't dancing during all the songs, but it is very entertaining.  Her voice is amazing in this DVD and shows her true talent.  The song &quot;Estoy Aqui&quot; has a new sound to it and there is this REALLY long note that Shakira sings and it is truely amazing that she can hold it that long, and it is so beautiful.  You can tell she really connects to her own songs, especially in &quot;Sombra de ti&quot; and &quot;Moscas en la casa&quot; and she is very emotional towards them, they come straight from her heart.  This DVD also shows her great personality.  There is a mexican twist to &quot;Ciega Sordomuda&quot; and her dancing is really neat.  Then of course in &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; she does the traditional belly dancing and it is incredible.  If you are a Shakira fan, this is a must have item.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore has done it again!  He has wrapped Peter Jackson's final film in the Lord of the Rings with a rich texture of themes.  This is the best of the three soundtracks as the movie is the best of the three films.<br />The selection of Sir James Galway, Ben del Maestro, Renee Fleming and especially Annie Lennox to perform is outstanding.  And who knew that Billy Boyd could sing?  His song in &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot; makes you &quot;see&quot; the futility of Faramir's attack on Osgiliath.  Viggo Mortensen singing the actual Elvish lines from the book in &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; was brilliant as is the use of text from the book for &quot;Into the West.&quot;<br />For serious soundtrack collectors, this is a must and I certainly hope that Howard Shore can be nominated for an Oscar for this soundtrack!
0446677450|1.0|This book demonstrates to the reader clearly what not to read.  This book is childish/adolescent by appealing to emotions rather than have any substance.<br />Why has this book been on the best sellers list for so long?  Because people are inclined to follow lemming style, in with the crowd.  <br />This book appeals to those who enjoy complaining about their bosses or their late retirement rather than to those who actually want to do something about their situation.  <br />Do some research.  Learn that Kiyosaki's \\"rich dad\\" is a myth and he relates it to Harry Potter.  Learn that the fine print of the book says that its been fictionalised (i.e. lying).  <br />Kiyosaki is a phenomenal writer.  He has the ability to create illusions through repetition.  Check how many times he's repeated his slogans.  Look at the number of blank pages.  Look at the number of pages dedicated to advertising.  <br />And all his rubbish about not learning any financial information in school?  Well, why don't you try asking how many students do and enjoy commerce or accounting?<br />In conclusion, this book is definitly not for adults who want to be rich.  This book is for adolescents attempting to fulfil their fantastical dreams of a million porsches.<br />For those of you that are SERIOUS about investing rather than entertaining your emotions with false ideals, wasted money and contribution to the degradation of society, read \\"the millionaire mind\\".

B00008PW2D|4.0|The discs are too expensive, boo hoo, wah wah! Get over it. I agree that the HBO folks SHOULD have lowered the price to make up for the fact that it was a truncated season, but the fact is that they DIDN'T. The product description clearly tells you that you're getting eight episodes. If you don't want to spend the money for eight episodes, then don't. Nobody's holding a gun to your heads. A true fan will savor every moment of the show and wouldn't think of holding it against the Fab Four that the people who produce the DVD's of their show are overcharging us. I wouldn't miss a single episode because of a few dollars. Check out Daniel Sunjata's appearance in the first episode of the season, &quot;Anchors Away&quot;, which was his introduction to many of his fans.

B000031WD9|3.0|that this is a typical teenage movie.  Yes, it borders on soft porn but there are definitely worse movies out there.  My fifteen year old is too young to watch this with me in the room, with his friends, yes, that's a different story.  I watched it through on DVD the day after Christmas. It was shocking but also quite funny.  I suggest any parents of preteens watch this (not the edited version on TV) just so you know what your kids are watching when you are not around.  You will laugh and you will be surprised!
B00009V7T2|5.0|i think these guys will be the next Pink Floyd or Led Zep, with their amazing  Musicianship im blown away, i think they will be a huge band in the years to come.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I am resisting the urge to add this DVD to my SATC seasons 1 through 4.  While I do want to own every episode of this, one of my favorite shows, I cannot justify paying that much for only eight (sub-par) episodes.  HBO is taking advantage of their loyal fans and it makes me wish I had never bought anything from them.
1878424319|5.0|While searching for meaning in a truly manipulative world of back stabbers and those who call themselves &quot;friends&quot; who wear an array of masks, this book brings light and hope to those of us who wish to better ourselves and try to accept others who are stuck in that hell. I certainly was captured by the Toltec way of life from reading what author Don Miguel Ruiz wrote. I would ask any person who is curious about how to become a better person with pure thoughts and a good heart to read this, as it will bring you hope and guidence. I LOVED this book and wish that it was required reading for young adults everywhere! As everyone can take away something meaningful and pure from it.
B00008OWZC|5.0|im a big zeppelin fan, and i didn't really buy this CD, i borrowed it and burned a coppy.  but if i didn't have a CD burner, i would deffinately buy it.  it would sound a lot better if it was recorded in a studio, and not in 1972, but it still sounds great.  Dazed and Confused is a little long, and i don't like this version.  they tweaked it a little, and it doesn't sound as good.  my favorate songs have to be the ocean, and track 4 on disc 1 (can't remember the name) if you're a zeppelin fan, like me, this is a great CD to add to your collection, or to start it. whatever.
6304806442|3.0|This movie is different, unique and interesting.  The baby scene is magnificent.  But there's nobody to root for in this film.  Also much of it is just disgusting.  It does show some of the side effects of drugs, but not very realistic ones.  One person commented that everyone in this film is ugly.  I'd like to respond by saying that most drug addicts aren't beautiful.  That was the last thing to cross my mind (especially with Ewan in it).  It's a drug film, it's not about beauty.  I wish I could have loved this movie, but which it's interesting, it's not that captivating.  Something to look at, maybe, but not a exceptional film.<BR><BR>Note: Movies rated R have a broad range, and this would definately be more suited for older kids.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Being a Joss Whedon fan, I was probably one of the 10 people who didn't find out about Firefly by accident.  I was waiting, because I knew that Joss Whedon and his Mutant Enemy crew turn out consistently high quality, if largely misunderstood, products and I was intrigued by the claim that Firefly was to be Whedon's \\"anti-star trek\\".  I enjoyed the Star Trek universe until the producers watered down their own product into the promising but disappointingly bland and predictable 'Enterprise'.  So, when 'Firefly' aired the first time, I was clean, refreshed, recently fed and I'd even put on new socks for the occasion (I'm kidding about the socks, actually).<br />I'm not a fan of the TV Western genre, so the notion that this was a Sci-Fi/Western didn't do much to win my heart, but I remembered that Gene Roddenberry had sold Star Trek to the networks by billing it as \\"wagon train to the stars\\", so I gave it a chance.  I really enjoyed the first episode \\"The Train Job\\", but it wasn't love.  In fact, it wasn't until about episode 3 ('Shindig', I think) when I realized that I was completely in love with these characters.  They were as vibrant, flawed, and genuine as any I'd ever encountered, with a complexity usually found only in good books.  I found myself thinking about them when I was driving to and from work. The plot twists, and production values too, were just as impressive.  Finally a sci-fi show where they remembered that there's no sound in space!  Finally a show that films the action in a way that makes your heart pound with excitement!   And that's when I realized that Firefly wasn't the product of some bad joke (\\"What do you get when you cross the Millenium Falcon with Little House on the Prairy?\\"), it was a brilliant science fiction experience doing what sci-fi does best: It explores the human condition in a fresh and exciting way, by showing us circus-mirror reflections of ourselves.  It entertains but also gives us a safe way to ask ourselves the hard questions.  And unlike Star Trek, Firefly never attempted to answer those questions or preach to us.  Firefly was a high water mark for the Television medium.  I'd finally found a show that would take TV to a new level.<br />So what did the Fox network do?  They bungled the whole thing up from the beginning and then cancelled it after 11 episodes!  I was outraged!  I wrote letters, posted to internet forums, I sent post cards, told as many people about the show as possible and tried to do my part to keep it on the air.   But Fox threw it away in favor of more predictable, forgettable and, ultimately, unwatchable television.  Do you need more evidence that big corporations are out of step with their audiences than millions of people petitioning to keep a show alive, filling out demographic surveys to empower the advertisers with more effective market research, sending in letters, taking out full page adverts in major magazines and they still turn a deaf ear?<br />When the DVD set looked like it might actually happen, I went to Amazon.com and pre-ordered it, hoping that the commitment of my dollars would encourage the Fox people to actually produce the set.  When it finally arrived, I suddenly had this cold fear that maybe it wasn't going to be as good as I'd remembered.  Maybe the excitement I felt was misplaced.  After all, it's only a TV show, right?<br />Well, I'm happy (and deeply grieved) to report that after watching the entire Firefly run again, (on DVD which looks much better than the original broadcast) plus the 3 never before aired episodes, that this show isn't just as good as I'd remembered, it's even better!   <br /> There are no bumpy headed English speaking aliens in Firefly or big morality tales telling us how to be better people.  There are just life sized folks doing what life sized folks do.  We settle new frontiers, we strive to build lives for ourselves, keep food on the table, stay free, take care of our loved ones, and we keep going.  Fiction often allows us to delude ourselves into believing that human history has lead us to one singular defining moment, but the reality is that life just endures and there never is an end to justify the means.  There is only the means, the journey.  Firefly is true and real and gritty in that way that the best book you've ever read is true and real.  It doesn't fit comfortably into the narrow expectations of TV. It's not a western, or a space show, a drama or a comedy.  Like real life, Firefly is all of those things.  Of course, there's still the space ships, the action, the romance, the beautiful people, terrific special effects, great music, unexpectedly funny hi-jinks and movie-quality production values if all that effete mumbo jumbo about the human condition doesn't get you excited!<br />This is the best television ever produced, bar none!  You owe it to yourself to buy this DVD set and then take a couple days off to watch it all.  Especially since there are a few million of us nagging at Universal and Mutant Enemy to make us a Firefly major motion picture which you will want to be hip enough to enjoy.  Fox may have interrupted the run of Firefly, but believe me when I tell you that no power in the 'verse can stop us.  <br />Serenity will fly again.  <br />Cheers.
B000099T2L|5.0|Wow! Beyonce. I love this Cd. All the tracks are great. You got alittle of slow jam and fast beats! I recommend that you buy because it's worth your money! I personaly think she needs to do another solo album.
B0000041Q3|4.0|The orchestral playing, the recording and the supporting singers are superior.  Not the main cast
B00005U11Z|5.0|There are some people that just don't understand. Steve Perry is no longer singing with them. Isn't the band good enough for them to get a positive review? <BR>The Audio and picture quality is great, and performancewise they play the whole concert flawlessly. Of all the concerts I own, for sure this is the best one. No need to write anymore, two thumbs up!!!
0446530891|1.0|All I can say is this book left me scratching my head in wonder.  What happened to the killer books Baldacci previously wrote?  No plot and a lame group of characters.
0553260111|5.0|I have read most, if not all, of Ludlum's books.The Bourne books are my favorite ( I have read all three two times each). exciting, well written, interesting, etc. These books are absolutely flawless.<BR>p.s. both attempts at making this book a movie were absolutely horrible
B00005U122|5.0|This is a great DVD. It bought Rogers the Wall live in Berlin DVD and I liked his songs in there especially another brick in the Wall pt. 2  <BR>In this DVD, it was even better. It took us more into the concert instead of the cameras just flying around. It was very good visual stuff in the DVD. The songs were great, the sound was great, the picture was clearer than any other DVD I have, except for Lord of the Rings DVD, it was probably the most high-definition DVD I have. I recommend this to anybody who likes rock.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I LOVE this series.  I was really upset when I found out it had been cancelled.  I've never felt this way about ANY show before.  Don't really care much for Westerns either.  To the person who said they thought it was Joss just doing Alien Resurection his way: no, he didn't care for the film.  But no - this was something that had been in his head before he had anything to do with that.  Not shocked about Fox's nixing this show either.  They have VERY bad ways of doing things.  Don't know if the Fox execs read this or not.  Don't much care.  I just hope that some other network picks this up (like the WB) and brings Serenity back on the air for us.  P-L-E-A-S-E...<BR>p.s. Why is the &quot;gag reel&quot; edited?  The one I downloaded a while back was MUCH longer.  Egg?
B00006LLLN|5.0|I have been playing this CD set non-stop since I got it for Christmas. Alison Krauss' voice is exquisite and clear, Dan Tyminski is just fabulous. The music in incredible; these are true musicians. Bluegrass lovers, this is a must-have.
B0000TB050|5.0|The energy of the crowd and the band makes the concert truly special.  After seeing this concert I would be interested in seeing U2 in Ireland --- there was a true connection here that I have not seen in other U2 concert videos.  Amazing video.
B000002G23|5.0|If you happen to be a member of BMG Music, you can buy the Police box set from them for about $20 less.
044022425X|5.0|I love these romance books more than any other because of the time travel, action, and historical information.  Diana writes so vividly that I even felt as though I was in Scotland or later in early America.  First of all, make sure that you read the first book, Outlander, and make sure to read the books in order.  If you like even the first two books, then you will continue to enjoy the rest of the series and look forward to each one.  I have heard some people complain about Drums of Autumn, but I found it as enthralling as the rest.  The book may look long, but you won't be able to put it down.
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|Dear Mr. Bruckheimer and Mr. Bay:<BR>After a long time avoiding seeing your movie because all of the bad talking and negative reviews about it, I finally got to see it. Over the years I heard everything, comments like: it is a piece of junk, it stinks, I went blind after leaving the Theatre, and a very long etc, most of them with a very harsh and obscene language, also I heard comments from an small group of people thinking quite the opposite. But now I can tell you that your movie is far WORST than I expected, but to be honest, I didn't expect nothing good from your names, actually every time I hear the words: From producer Jerry Bruckheimer, or From director Michael Bay (or both together, like in this case), I take it as a massive warning to avoid seeing that movie (the exception was with Black Hawk Down, and because Ridley Scott was directing and co-producing it). I mean, your cinematographic interest have always been (plain and simple), to make a lot of money, to hell with quality, it's all about big bucks. So why a movie about Pearl Harbor? Well, after the huge success of Titanic, I guess you did the math, and that is: Epic Tragedy + Love Story = $$$. Yeah, not very difficult to guess, and so your strategy was to look for the next Anniversary of some worldwide tragedy, and that was Pearl Harbor. Again, after many year of bad films like: Armageddon, The Rock, Days of Thunder, Bad Boys (Part I and II, and possibly Part III), Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur, and a very long etc of sh?, Pearl Harbor wasn't going to be the exception. <BR>And so Mr. Bruckheimer, you went with your actual number one puppet Director, the infamous Michael Bay, a man who has brought a lot of money into your pocket. Luckily for him, he thinks in the same stinking way that you do, surely you deserve each other. Yes, lets talk a little bit about Michael Bay's direction (Amazon.com wont let me put in accurate words, what I really think of you as a Director). Your directorial skills areclose to none, bad frame composition, bad actor direction, a blown up pace, corny sensitivity, and a careless camera movement to induce in the spectator a Music Video feeling of frenzy, a mere masquerade to distract from your empty vision. But with Pearl Harbor you went even further, the stupid script was deliberated set into screen to plague the images with a sick and cheap nationalistic pride, enhancing it (you thought), with a love triangle that is as vulgar and predictable as George Bush's Iraq War campaign, SHAME ON YOU (Where are the weapons of mass destruction George?). But what makes this even funnier is that you and Mr. Bruckheimer actually believe that your movie portraits the real events that took place in Pearl Harbor with all the tragic sense and heroic mood, no one can't take this film seriously, cheesy, boring, and completely blown up by your gringo sense of pride, you are not Oliver Stone, and you will never be.<BR>Pearl Harbor lasts at least one unnecessary hour, of course the Japanese version was completely dismissed, here they are just the bad guys, this is how partial and irresponsible your judgment is. Just like every movie that Mr. Bruckheimer has produced in the 90's, Pearl Harbor has an inaccurate photography that makes everything look superficially perfect, the result is again laughable, sum to this the esthetic values of the production design, where the goal was to put everything in front of the camera in a picture perfect style (Kate Beckinsale's hair is always static), something that is particularly sad in the supposedly gruesome attack scenes. And then, the particularly calculated way in which the poor soldiers where depicted aside fallen flags and the corpses of their friends was a mayor breakthrough in cinematographic manipulation, yes one step closer to the bottom. I can't understand how Hans Zimmer accepted to score your picture, and I don't blame him for the poor result, I mean, a good score (mostly), response to a good film, but with this piece of commercial junk, there was no way to inspire the composer. <BR>About the cast, well, Ben Affleck as Captain Rafe McCawley wasn't a mayor disappointment, I expected a bad performance from him, and boy did he deliver, but from here on, he wont get any worst, your mediocre actor direction Mr. Bay is a fine example of what not to do. Josh Harnett as Captain Danny Walker is equally flat, and Kate Beckinsale as the nurse and central piece of the love triangle, really could use some acting lessons, again your directorial Skills Mr. Bay, did some wonders, the supporting cast doesn't even deserve to be mention. <BR>The visual effects are good, but at this point, who cares? <BR>The Vista Series Director's Cut DVD offers a lot of material to the customer, which in this case is even more valuable, the History Channel stuff will make your pocket (Dear Amazon reader), hurt a little less, but do your self a favor and buy Tora, Tora, Tora, Special Edition DVD, you'll later thank me for that. (Yes, the visual and audio transferring of Pearl Harbor is quite good).<BR>At the end, I got it, Pearl Harbor was a satire of the tragic event, but it was sell out mistakenly as an Epic picture, the thing is that as a comedy, it also sucks (Surely, one of the worst films ever made). So, I'll like to say good-bye to you Mr. Bruckheimer and Mr. Bay with some kind words involving the (F) word to both of you and your movie, but again, Amazon.com wont let me say this in a harsh and obscene language (as you deserve). Have a nice day.
6304711891|5.0|I remember that this movie came out in theaters while I was in high school around the same time as Independence Day.  I saw the Rock first and liked it better.  I know... many people would find that statement unpatriotic, but this movie has a good plot, good action, and just keeps you on the edge of you seat.  This all comes from someone who generally prefers the romantic comedies, but somehow this movie captivated me and still remains one of my all time favorite movies.  What can I say?  This girl thinks that the Rock, well...rocks!
078681859X|5.0|This book is now one of favorites, and I look forward to the next two books.  The book mixes humorous and dark, and the fact that Nathaniel isn't a perfect character - his motive throughout the book is revenge, and as the djnni Batimaeus points out, guilt as well, makes the story stand out from other young adult novels.
