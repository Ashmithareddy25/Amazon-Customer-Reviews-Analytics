B004LWZW7E|3.0|In a future world, humans live up to the age of 25 and then a countdown for one more year of life begins. The time they have left to live is seen as green glowing numbers on their arms. In this world where time is literally money, the poor are always struggling for a few more minutes, while the rich have the potential to live for all of eternity. Will Salas unexpectedly hits the jackpot when a suicidal man gives him the rest of his time- over one hundred years. Will soon sees how the other half lives and makes it a mission to redistribute the wealth. He befriends socialite Sylvia Weis, and the two play Robin Hood, emptying the accounts of the rich and giving more time to those in the ghetto. With the Timekeepers on their trail, Will and Sylvia rely on each other to survive.<br /><br />I thought the premise of this movie was really interesting and was excited to see how it would play out. The first ten minutes or so looked promising but it just went downhill after that. Cillian Murphy was excellent as both a creepy, yet justice-driven Timekeeper. Justin Timberlake was all right in his role. Amanda Seyfried was not great- she always seemed to have the same cool expression on her face. I also thought the movie became inundated with cliches- rich girl/poor boy, Robin Hood, idiomatic expressions- which made most of the movie very predictable. There were also a lot of things that were unclear to me- like wouldn't there be more violence if people could just kill each other for more time? And how did Sylvia know how to shoot a gun so well when she had been protected by bodyguards her whole life? Overall, I was disappointed with the execution of what I thought was a brilliant and original concept.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Story was too predictable. It did not flow smoothly. It's OK to watch at home. I'm just glad I did not spend the money to see it at the theater.
0143119680|4.0|Diana Bishop, a descendant of a powerful line of witches, has spent much of her life denying her magical heritage. Other than the occasional blue sparks emitted from her fingers in times of anger, or the quick spell to unclog a washing machine, Diana strives to become a renowned historian on her own merit. One day at the library, she requests Ashmole 782, an old manuscript that will aide her research in ancient alchemy. The book literally sighs in her hands, and Diana finds a powerful magic hidden in the pages. She returns the book without realizing that this text holds information of dire importance to all magical creatures. When Diana finds herself under the scrutiny of a host of otherworldly beings, Matthew Clairmont, a debonair vampire with an interest in genetics, becomes her protector. Over time, their relationship becomes more intimate, and Diana finds she must accept the power she's been granted and learn how to wield it, if she is to have any chance of survival in the oncoming war.<br /><br />Harkness's tale combines elements of mythology, history, and fantasy, creating an engaging and well-written story. Matthew Clairmont, who has lived for over fifteen hundred years, can describe famous historical events, and his role in them, with remarkable accuracy. Diana has a thorough understanding of the ancient science of alchemy, as well as ties to the Diana of mythology. It was clear that a great amount of research went into the details of this novel- all the way down to the scents associated with each wine the characters indulge in. As much as I appreciate the correctness of facts, I felt that Harkness's story sometimes got lost in the details. I wasn't fully engaged until about halfway through because I found all the descriptions of clothing, wine, locations, facial expressions, etc., were a little tedious to read. There also seemed to be so many characters, some appearing out of nowhere, that it was hard to feel attached to all of them.<br /><br />I agree withsome other reviewers that I found Diana's personality change to be a little unrealistic and reminiscent of some YA fantasy novels. She starts off as a strong, willful historian who frequently reminds Matthew that the modern-day woman is capable of taking care of herself. Even though she becomes more powerful in her magic as the book continues, she also becomes more subservient, letting Matthew order her around and giving in to his every whim. I found that a little irritating. There did seem to be some hope near the end, when Diana becomes the more powerful one in the relationship. I enjoyed Diana's aunts Sarah and Em, precisely because they seemed like strong female characters who felt very comfortable expressing their opinions no matter how angrily Matthew might glare at them. I am looking forward to reading the next novel in this series and seeing what happens with these characters.

B004WOS7LO|5.0|When \\"This Loud Morning\\" was first released I listened to the full album that I borrowed from a friend. Unlike David Cook's first album I wasn't instantly hooked and sadly I forgot about it. I really like his new track \\"The Last Song I'll Write For You\\" so I thought I would give \\"This Loud Morning\\" another chance. Perhaps the passing of time has changed how I interpret the words but in an explainable way this album is exactly what I should be listening to right now.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The movie depicts a civilization that is a blend of the Romans' thirst for blood in the Coliseum with the Americans' craving for reality shows. It's a great interpretation of the consequences to humankind and individual freedom when they ask their government to get so big that the state provides everything--including entertainment diversions.  Haven't read the book, but the movie is a good view for a couple of hours.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|This is a great show with amazing performances from Danes, Lewis and the actor also know as Inigo Montoya. The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is the uneven final episode, but I very much look forward to the new season.
0525953728|4.0|Opinions of this book very all over the place. Bottom line - A very worthwhile read!<br /><br />It is a story of one boy from Alaska that ends up in a lead position that was not anticipated as a youngster nor during the first minutes of the raid.<br /><br />Almost every aspect of writing is understated, from the simplicity of the writing to the concepts being told.  There is simply a lot more to this book than most originally comprehend.<br /><br />You can read some of the reviews which might be confusing as to why to purchase the book - but if anything in the product description of the book interest you - then it will be very worthwhile read!

0812550706|5.0|Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin kept his government-issued monitor on until the age of six. That was a year longer than most. Many of the other kids are jealous, especially his older brother, Peter. When the bad boys at school corner him, Ender does what he has to. Shortly thereafter, Colonel Graff arrives at the Wiggin home and offers Ender the chance to attend Battle School.<br /><br />It has been about eighty years since the last war with the buggers. The buggers almost managed to wipe humanity out of existence. Since then, the government has been trying to make officers for the next war; a war that could happen at any time. Battle School is where children are trained to become commanders. All the children are organized into armies and they compete in zero gravity war games.<br /><br />Unknown to Ender (but well known to readers), Graff intends to make six-year-old Ender into the best battle commander in history. The future of humanity could very well depend on Ender becoming a perfect killing machine. Ender is bright, in perfect health, highly intelligent, and imaginative. To Ender, winning is everything. (To quote part of the book: \\"Ender Wiggin isn't a killer. He just wins - thoroughly.\\") To some others in the military, Graff is often too cruel to the children, especially to Ender. But Graff is doing what he believes is necessary for the preservation of the human race. Ender realizes early on that Graff is isolating him from the kids by using every low-down trick in the book - and several NOT in the book. The mind games are nothing new to Ender. He was used to dealing with Peter, who is a master manipulator. As Ender thinks up more and more amazing strategies to win the war games, he is also shaping himself into the very weapon Graff wants so badly.<br /><br />***** FIVE STARS! This is one of the most impressive novels of our time (imho). The author takes a nascent child (Ender) and places him in a military school to (basically) sink or swim. Due to the exigencies of an upcoming war, the person in charge of Battle School (Graff) is unstinting in his mistreatment of all the children.<br /><br />This story has already become required reading in some high schools. Teachers enjoy having their students debate on whether Graff is guilty of mistreatment of children or if his actions are justifiable. Another point of debate is the emotional and psychological toll on young Ender.<br /><br />Though the story mainly focuses on Ender, some time is given to his brother and sister who are still back at home. Those Wiggin siblings are as intelligent as Ender, but instead of strategy they have more manipulative and/or persuasive abilities.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is an excellent story for Science Fiction fans of any age. (Fans of Robert A. Heinlein will especially enjoy this tale. The meticulous thoughts and beyond-his-time-ideas can be found in this story too.)

B004LWZW6U|1.0|Speaking as a fan of writer/director/producer Alexandre Aja, it isn't surprising to be one of the few who stand up for the \\"Piranha\\" remake. It was more or less as campy as everyone expected and the storyline was ridiculous, but the cast was pretty decent. The special effects were the crown jewel though. While the 3D effects were weak and the computer generated stuff wasn't so great, the practical effects were top notch. The gore was so good and it made a cheesy remake just a little bit better than it should have been.<br /><br />\\"Feast\\" director John Gulager replaces Aja for \\"Piranha DD,\\" (the movie drops the 3 from its title on the regular Blu-ray and DVD) the production budget is about a fifth of what it was for the remake, and the cast is mostly filled with unfamiliar faces and washed up stars. Judging by the title and tag line alone, everything is doubled for the sequel. But as you can probably imagine everything goes even more downhill in comparison to the remake, as well. The campiness is magnified 100% and the sequel takes no shame in showcasing nothing but large, fake breasts. All obvious statements that shouldn't be considered bad if utilized properly, but \\"Piranha DD\\" doesn't exactly blend them together to make a worthwhile concoction.<br /><br />The 3D effects are atrocious; just bulky and blobby CG that looks like it was sloppily thrown together in minutes. The special effects in general take a huge nose dive from \\"Piranha.\\" The water park sequence tries to recreate the beach mayhem from the remake relocated at a water park and it just fails horribly. The ratio of practical effects to computer generated ones in \\"Piranha DD\\" is probably somewhere around 25/75 and it just feels cheap because of it.<br /><br />When the piranhas aren't CG, the fish props look way too big. They're watermelon sized on land, but are small enough to swim up someone's genitalia in the water? In the meantime, the fish are pulling off completely impossible feats like breaking through grates, sheets of metal, and the concrete walls of pools. The result is something that is neither terrifying nor entertaining and is more along the lines of a movie seen on SyFy except without the boundaries of being restricted to cable.<br /><br />If the horrible fish weren't enough, the people are even worse. It's sad when the most enjoyable character in a movie is David Hasselhoff portraying a more exaggerated version of himself. Garey Busey shows up long enough to get farted on by a dead cow. Paul Scheer, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd return from the remake. Lloyd is the only one who makes himself useful. Meanwhile, Rhames does his best Cherry Darling impression and Scheer just kind of complains about everything.<br /><br />David Koechner is probably the most enjoyable of the new faces and that's mostly due to him playing his role way more seriously than he should. This is probably the least ridiculous and over the top that he's ever been. As for the younger parts of the cast, they're nothing but bait with lines. When they're not jumping in puke for no reason at all, humping pool jets, or being completely incapable of properly running off of a dock, they're having some of the worst sex to ever be featured in a horror movie. What transpires between Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) and Shelby (Katrina Bowden) is so utterly asinine; especially Shelby's last line. The sex scene in the van isn't much better.<br /><br />\\"Piranha DD\\" is listed as having an 83-minute runtime, but it's more like 70 and is still difficult to swallow given its short length. You could at least find a few things to compliment in the remake. With \\"Piranha DD,\\" it essentially has nothing to make viewing this feature worthwhile. The cast is awful, the screenplay is unbearable, and the special effects are laughable. Even the ending makes it seem like everyone who made this hates its core audience. \\"Here's this crap ending. Yeah, the movie bombed and everyone hated it but we're going to make another one anyway!\\"<br /><br />You know what you're getting with \\"Piranha DD.\\" It does not offer anything that you wouldn't discover at face value or by watching the trailer. You know it's going to be nothing but naked women and gore. But when the gore doesn't deliver and nudity is all you have to fall back on, then you might as well just watch porn since you know you'll at least walk away from that with a spring in your step. \\"Piranha DD\\" will have you wanting to throw in \\"Jaws\\" just to wash off its stench and get the last remaining bloodthirsty and carnivorous fish out of your brain.<br /><br />Special features include Commentary with Director John Gulager, Producer Joel Soisson, and Co-Writer Marcus Dunstan, three Deleted Scenes, The Story Behind the DD (just shy of 8 minutes in length), The Hofftastic World of David Hasselhoff (around 2 minutes), Busey's Bloopers (also 2 minutes), Wet and Wild with David Koechner (about a minute and a half), and \\"A Lesson with John McEnroe\\" - A Dimension Short Film (about 4 minutes).<br /><br />\\"Piranha DD\\" is now available as a single disc DVD and three disc combo (Blu-Ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD +digital copy). It's rated R for sequences of strong bloody horror violence and gore, graphic nudity, sexual content, language, and some drug use.

B005HSG3VK|3.0|I purchased this with my new Kindle.  It is continually shredding on the sides.  A concern I have.  I do like ease of it, but would most likely recommend buying a completely hard cover one, as this one has a soft cover front.  The stand, is ok?.  It is not the most stable, but will do.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|I agree with the previous reviewer that FRAMING ARMAGEDDON is a great metal album and history will judge it as a classic. I'm talking RIDE THE LIGHTNING, THE MANTLE, THE WARNING, SYMBOLIC, NOSFERATU and ACT III territory here.<br /><br />I bought this CD when it came out in 2007 and five years later it stands the test of time. Although I was blown away by it back in 2007 I like it just as much today. If anything, I appreciate it more.<br /><br />Ever since 1990's ICED EART and 1995's BURNT OFFERINGS Iced Earth have been putting out quality albums (1992's NIGHT OF THE STORMRIDER showed potential but something about it didn't click). Regardless of who the vocalist is, most of Iced Earth's albums are worthwhile and FRAMING ARMAGEDDON stands with the best of them.<br /><br />&#34;Ten Thousand Strong&#34; was the initial single from the album and, although it's a really good song with a strong chorus (pun not intended), there are no less than FIVE songs that are actually BETTER -- &#34;Something Wicked Part 1,&#34; &#34;Motivation of Man,&#34; Execution/Order of the Rose&#34; (essentially one song), &#34;The Clouding&#34; and &#34;When Stars Collide.&#34; The latter three are in particularly exceptional, especially the spectacular &#34;When Stars Collide.&#34;<br /><br />On top of this, there are a number of songs that are equal to the quality of &#34;Ten Thousand Strong&#34; -- &#34;Setian Massacre,&#34; the memorable ballad &#34;A Charge to Keep,&#34; the progressive but catchy &#34;The Domine Decree&#34; and &#34;Framing Armageddon.&#34; Even the least proper songs -- &#34;Infiltrate and Assimilate&#34; and &#34;Retribution through the Ages&#34; are quality songs. I say &#34;proper songs&#34; because the rest of the tracks aren't actual songs, more like transitional numbers used to embellish the album's story, which too many people whine about. I disagree; I think they make the album more epic and diverse.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Like my title blurb says: FRAMING ARMAGEDDON is a Metal Masterpiece on par with the greatest metal albums of all time.<br /><br />GRADE: Aest metal albums of all time.   GRADE: A
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was hooked from the first book and it kept me turning the pages with anticipation of what would happen next. Not typical for my reading list...but I really enjoyed it.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Testament are back in 2012 (after a bit of a delay albeit) with Dark Roots of Earth. This is one hell of an album from these bay area thrash titans. It features some of the best songs that they have put out in years, although their past output is by no means lackluster. On board for this one on the skins is former Death, Strapping Young Lad, and Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan and he does not disappoint one bit! Like I mention throughout many of the songs and at the close of this review, the album has many different riffs that keep the album fresh and some great vocals from Chuck Billy. There is also one song that Chuck performs clean vocals on, that being 'Cold Embrace' which is a good song overall, anyway, enough babbling, on to the review!<br /><br />Rise Up - Starts out with a blazing guitar riff reminiscent of old times past and Billy's vocals kick in around 48 seconds and Testament has picked up right where they left off with The Formation of Damnation. Some great leads in this song as well, it also has some nice gang vocals where Billy sings \\"Rise up!\\" and the others say \\"war\\", and also great drumming by Hoglan (what else can we expect from one of the best drummers in the genre??)<br /><br />Native Blood - Quite possibly my favorite song in this record. I absolutely love the vocal delivery of Chuck on this one, it is quite excellent. The main riff in this song is extremely thrashy and  groovy at the same time, delicious! Another interesting thing to note is that in the pre chorus (I believe it's the pre chorus anyway) Gene Hoglan performs some blast beats (quite odd for how the guitars are playing, but it works out pretty well and sounds quite unique). Another great set of leads by Skolnick and Peterson, can we expect any less from these two guys? No way! Peterson has also really stepped up in the lead department on this album.<br /><br />* The music video for this song is quite good as well, make sure to check it out.<br /><br />Dark Roots of Earth - This song starts off with a nice heavy-doomy sort of riff, very good and quite different compared to the proto-thrash style of Testament we are all used to. The chorus here is one of my favorite's as well, with a nice groovy Pantera-esque riff in there. Some nice melodic leads as well. About a little more than half way through this one it really kicks into high gear with some nice riffage and more melodic soloing.<br /><br />True American Hate - This was the first song released to the public from the album as a free download (at least that's how I originally obtained it) and it starts off with some heavy riffs and great drumming and then after about 30 seconds kicks into a full thrash fest! Overall another good song with a great chorus and some great blast beats before the chorus by Gene once again. And again some more melodic soloing (one of the things that makes this band so great in my opinion, and somewhat different that some of the other thrash bands, in that they utilize melodic soloing in thrash metal over using chaotic, fast paced solos (although sometimes they do have some of those).<br /><br />A Day in The Death - Starts off with a nice bass intro (good bass sound as well, nice!). This song showcases some nice riffs, but overall isn't one of the standouts on this album for me anyways, although by no means is this song filler whatsoever. Gene's drumming on this one is also a bit more pedestrian than the previous songs. In general this song is quite different and showcases many different riffs and solos so it will keep your attention. Another solid vocal delivery by Chuck as well.<br /><br />Cold Embrace - Now to preface this track review, I read somewhere that Chuck thought or wanted to use this song in a Twilight movie, if so that's pretty lame. Testament doing a ballad after so many years!? AHH, SELL OUTS!!! Just kidding! Anyways, this song starts off with some nice acoustic guitar coupled with a tasteful lead. It also showcases Billy's clean vocals once again, something we haven't heard for quite some time. Features some great leads and I can't stress enough Chuck's vocal delivery, it's great to hear him sing clean again!<br /><br />Man Kills Mankind - God, oh God, the riffs, the riffs! There are so many great riffs on this album as a whole, but the start of this song is just badass. Chuck's vocal delivery in the beginning of the song also sorta reminds me of Electric Crown in some spots. (Actually on about half the song it sounds like that, very cool, as that is a great Testament tune). In fact, this song sounds like something that could have went on The Ritual or Souls of Black. Great solo, and the riff that is played under it is just awesome!!<br /><br />Throne of Thorns - As soon as this one starts out you know that you are in for one hell of a ride. The main riff at around a minute or so into the song is similar to 'Children of a Worthless God' by Exodus, but is also different as it seems as it is a little more complex or defined. Amazing, amazing lead by Alex Skolnick on this song, and the best one on the album for me by a long shot! He definitely shows why he is one of the top guitarist's in metal today, that's for sure.<br /><br />Last Stand For Independence - A thrash fest all around! Like Rise Up started this album out with an all out thrash attack, this one ends the album the same way, some serious speed here! Eric Peterson along with Alex Skolnick (although I am pretty sure it was mostly Peterson) came up with the riffs for this album and this song is chock full of some of the best this album has to offer. The song slows up about 3/4 of the way through but still remains heavy and has a nice solo, but then kicks back in to full aural assault, thus ending one of the best albums of 2012 for sure.<br /><br />Some final thoughts...this album as a whole is absolutely fantastic. It contains (in my opinion) some of the best overall songs Testament have come up with in many, many years. The album is chock full of tastythrash riffs as well as awesome melodic soloing by Peterson and Skolnick. If you are unsure about getting this album, let me assure you that it is worth absolutely every penny and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Highlights: Basically the whole album, there is no filler here absolutely anywhere, but if I were to recommend three songs out of the nine, I'd say Native Blood, Throne of Thorns, and Dark Roots of Earth.<br /><br />* Also if you purchase the deluxe edition you get a DVD with the making of the album as well as 4 tracks performed live (from previous albums) and a run through of Eric and Alex's gear. You also get 4 bonus tracks on the deluxe edition, 3 covers and an extended version of Throne of Thorns which consists of a longer solo from Alex. I'd say go for the deluxe if you have the extra cash, it's definitely worth it!
B004EARTN8|1.0|This movie is terrible, it end sad and all you see is Ryan in the coffin. I usually like any movie I watch, except for this one and the Gray, both wasted a hour and a half of my life.  It is realistic what the US goverment and the company he work for did.

0345803485|1.0|I have read a ton of really good BDSM fiction. This is not that. It's not an accurate or reasonable portrayal of a BDSM relationship- I think anybody in that community is probably offended (Who has a sex contract? What?)<br /><br />The characters fall flat, with little to no development (more character development than Twilight by about 15%, so there's that). The girl is so innocent that it is frankly disturbing. It feels like she's writing about a middle-school girl, instead of a legal adult. She's never been drunk, never masturbated, never had a crush. One of her catchphrases is 'double-crap', and we're expected to believe that she had six orgasms in her first sexual encounter? Because of the crush this makes her develop, she then decides to sign a three-month sex contract. Who does that? When I first had a crush, I sent him an anonymous valentine and we ate ice cream together. Show some self-respect.<br /><br />As for the writing, it's a train-wreck. It feels like she's writing for a fourth grade audience. The use of present-tense is off-putting, and the author sometimes slips into past-tense. The dialogue is not how people talk. Anywhere. Ever. Who here has ever said \\"Shall we make dinner?\\" Nobody, that's who. I can't believe I wasted my 13.25 on this book, and my *insert derogative term here* sister won't even pay me half of it because it's not very good. The only reason I bought it at all was because of all the hype- I figured 'mainstream BDSM fiction, what could go wrong?' A lot. A lot went wrong. Additionally, the sex scenes were unarousing and unrealistic.<br /><br />This would be a good time to confess that I've only read half the book. I can see where this is going, and I don't like it, but will probably finish it because I can't resist a train wreck... However, not buying the sequels.<br /><br />If you're looking for an actual good BDSM fiction, I highly recommend Manna Francis' 'Administration series'. It's got a strong plot, interesting sex scenes, andis a much better read.

It was fairly short and odd enough to be interesting; full of wisdom and dark, important humor.<br /><br />With Vonnegut, you always get some satire, some sci-fi and something you can take home and add to your own personal religion.  This one will make you a Bokonist, which is like an atheist, but without all the smug ignorance passed off as knowledge.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|It works great on the Kindle Fire. It automatic updates and I do some manual updates too. I use it with Dr.Web also.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|was pretty boring to me, stopped reading at half of the book, good marketing though, building a hype on that book, which I unfortunately found absolutely average, as just a typical story where a poor girl (student) meets rich and good looking guy (CEO of a blue chip company), being far out of here league... Angelique and the King, Cinderella, Pretty Woman and the like just pimped up with some spice. For those who like to read this kind or romances it might be interesting. But I´m happy I bought it cheaper at Amazon than in a bookstore.<br />Cheers Pat
B0006HBZXS|5.0|this is a great movie.  Anthony Hopkins is a billionaire that is prepared for the outdoors but the two other guys ask him what to do.  the only way that Anthony Hopkins knows so much on survival is just by books.

B0067EKY7M|4.0|SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN takes a very unlikely premise and makes it somewhat believable. The movie, based on Paul Torday's acclaimed book of the same title, takes us on a different and somewhat fantasical journey into another side of the Middle East and the mysterious and exotic country Yemen.<br />Egyptian actor Amr Waked stars as an incredibly wealthy sheik who has the dream of bringing salmon visiting to Yemen. Salmon need water and Yemen is not known for its abundance of water nor is it known for cooler temperatures that seem to be the preference of fish. The sheik is a kind-hearted, well-educated and enlighted man who seems to think spending $50 million on this project will bring joy and prosperity to his poor nation.<br />It's up to Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor), a fisheries expert, to make it work along with the help of the sheik's consultant Harriet (Emily Blunt). The fantasy project comes together after Britain's Prime Minister's press secretary Bridget decides there needs to be a postive story coming out of the Middle East. Why not Salmon fishing in the Yemen. Kristin Scott Thomas is a chain-shoking, hyper-active Bridget who does not know the meaning of \\"It can't be done.\\"<br />The sheik has lofty dreams while Jones is practical. When Harriet's sincere dedication is added to the mix, anything seems possible. There is great chemistry among this cast of talented British and Egyptian actors. They almost get us to believe in the project and its future for Yemen. Unfortunately, the story gets muddled in the waters. Alfred's marriage is falling apart. Harriet's soldier boyfriend who she has just met has disappeared in Afghanistan. Bridget has to deal with angry British fisherman anxious to protect their salmon from being shipped to Yemen. Above all, the sheik's life is in constant dangers from elements within his country who think his project will shame and ruin Yemen.<br />If you've gotten this far, you can probably guess the story and the familiar plot. A fun idea becomes another run of the mill story about boy meets girl under difficult circumstances and a dream brings them together.<br />SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN does have its charm along with beautiful scenery in Scotland and Morocco (who fills in for Yemen--probably not the safest place to film a movie at this time in history). Yemen is a lovely and exotic country and it is sad Morocco had to be the double. It's not a fulfilling movie but pleasant enough with a dream cast of great actors.

B005LAIGPA|3.0|I heard so many people talking about CHRONICLE that I decided to give it a look. I knew nothing about the plot. I didn't realize it was another installment in what is becoming the \\"found footage\\" genre. We start off with another high school student wanting to document every second of his day to day routine. The filmmakers find creative ways to keep the \\"documenting\\" process going to see all angles and all activities. Fortunately, the jittery \\"hand held\\" camera feel disappears and you find three high school students with super powers. By chance they discover what might be an alien life force undergrown that gives them incredible power.<br />There are some super fantastic scenes of the kids flying high in the sky as they realize the extent of their powers. Along with incredible powers comes the urge to abuse the powers. A first the tricks are annoying but harmless, \\"move\\" a shopper's car to completely different parking space all though the power of telekinesis. Needless to say, silly tricks soon have the potential for serious harm.<br />There is a moral story here of how one would or should use super powers for good or evil. Our three heroes have the potential for good and evil, especially outcast Andrew, who quickly begins to relish in his power. Andrew has a dying mother and a violently abusive father. There is no surprise that his new found skills could turn into an abuse of power.<br />Now the story follows along until death and mayhem enter the picture. Suddenly, the film loses direction and turns into mayhem and destruction of the city of Seattle. How it gets that far is so off the radar and really a sad conclusion to what was a mildly thoughtful film.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|At first I was confused when the author would switch from current to earlier dates.  It all makes sense, though.  I am not quite finished with book.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|In product info, So many apps claim to be &quot;A Challenge&quot;, Finally we have a winner, not a wanna be or lie. Info on app is truthful - the real thing. I love that it actually has ongoing levels, unlike others who claim to, but then go a max of 3-5. 90% of the time I would play Angry Birds; This is the only one I cont. to play that gets me away from that and I have hundreds of apps. My 11yr old boy loves it as well, is good for many age groups. And - It doesn't have that cheap look or feel but It's still free! I love brain/challenge games - I especially love this one!

B005K0HDGE|1.0|I had never read a Stephen King book, but this sounded so intriguing!  I liked a good portion of this book, however, he spent too much time focused on Lee Harvey Oswald and people that I had never heard of before.  There were times I wanted it to move along, and other times, it actually was good!  The love story was interesting and I wanted to know how that turned out.  Did he take her back?  How did she handle it?  What had he changed?  I didn't like the answers to any of my questions.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy and straight forward.  Cards and background can be customized.  This is very similar to the one that comes standard with Windows PCs.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I used this product for our family road trip to Scottsdale. It was a 3800 mile trip (60 hours total) and we literally played this thing for at least 40 hours of that trip. Usually 3-4 hours a pop, sometimes even longer. This thing worked like a charm and I never had a single issue with it. Once in a while we would have to change stations as we got to new cities, but most of the time, there wasn't even a need. Great product. I used both a 2GB SD card and an 8GB flash drive. They both performed very well. I didn't have the instructions on me during the trip and couldn't figure out how to connect our ipod using the aux in, so, I can't comment on it. I didn't think we would use the remote...which we did, a lot in fact, so, that was a surprise for me. Totally worth the price though. They have really come far with this technology.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like using this app even better than the site on a PC.  Easier to use and on-the-go convenience.  Only one con, if you don't have your screen position locked and you turn your kindle, you go back to the top of page.  Drives me nuts.

0393339815|4.0|It all started with this antique silver cow creamer, lusted after by Bertie Wooster's Uncle Tom Travers (husband of his Aunt Dahlia) who collects such things, but also coveted by Sir Watkyn Bassett, father of Madelin Bassett to whom Bertie was once briefly engaged.  Sir Bassett was once a magistrate, and he remembers Bertie from a past appearance in his court (a matter of stealing a police constable's helmet during the exuburance of his college days).<br /><br />Events lead to complications as Bertie ends up as a house guest at the Bassett estate, where he tries to mend the romances of both Madeline and her cousin Stephanie, while Aunt Dahlia is intent on recovering the cow creamer that Sir Bassett had made off with - she is willing to use a little larceny.  Events lead to a little blackmail - it is always useful to know something about someone that the person does not want the public to know about - and a little horse trading when you have matters that a person needs settled (preferably out of court).<br /><br />It is the usual Wooster and Jeeves, with the supporting cast of characters, including Bertie's old classmate and fellow member of the Drones Club, Gussie Fink-Nottle; and introducing another old school acquaintance, Harold Pinker, who is now a curate at the local village.  I don't think that it is necessarily the funniest, but it is delightful light reading.  It was published in 1938, just before the onset of World War II.

The story is fast paced and each chapter leaves you wanting to read more. While you root for the characters, this is not a story where they will live happily ever after. And best of all, you may not see the surprises coming. Give these books a chance. You won't be disappointed.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I don't know why so many people gave this film bad reviews.  I thought it was awesome!! The cinematography was beautiful, special effects were very well done and costumes were amazing.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I thought they did a great job translating the book to film.  The casting was spot on.  The video and audio quality are reference.  My only complaint is that there should have been a few exta minutes devoted to Kat's struggle over what to do about the feigned romance - the film makes it seem more comfortable for her than was actually so.

B006BGZJJ4|3.0|It's just a cord, people; and it's really overpriced.  $10 plus shipping and handling.  Get real.  The Kindle Fire cost over $200 w/shipping and everything else (covers, speakers, etc.) is sold separately.  Amazon has really learned how to milk their customers for every penny. It's damned annoying.  They've become just like the airlines with all of their extra fees. If Amazon's business model is to follow the airlines; congratulations, they've succeeded.

B005Y4241K|4.0|Though I will remain Adele's fan for both her vocal and songwriting abilities, I plan to give away this DVD. The DVD's camera work was jarring, and Adele's introductions repetitive, endless, and not that illuminating. Add to that all those f-bombs she kept dropping, and I used the \\"Advance\\" a lot to get to the songs. Yes, I want visuals in a DVD, but what I want most is the MUSIC and I really don't care for explanations what inspired it. (All listeners have their own ideas of what the song means--and it may not be the same as the songwriter's. E.g., Sting's \\"Every breath you take\\" is basically about a guy stalker, but people play it at their weddings, so there you go...) With her unique voice and delivery, she's obviously destined for a good long career, but this is my first and last Adele DVD. My suggestion: Unless you love f-bombs and endless yakking between songs, stick to buying her CDs.

1849800030|5.0|PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WORLDWIDE -A NEW STRENGTHENED STANDARD<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Fundamentally it is innovation which keeps markets and economies moving.  But in the wake of new ideas, there are always counterfeiters and pirates out there ready, willing and able to profit hugely by stealing them - hence the pressing need for the protection of  intellectual property and the even more pressing need for effective enforcement worldwide.<br /><br />Enter ACTA - the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement finally enacted from 15 April 2011 after several years of tortuous negotiations and in the teeth of opposition in 2006 from Argentina, Brazil, China and India in response to an EU proposal at a TRIPS Council meeting that year, for `an in-depth discussion' of enforcement issues.<br /><br />Recently published by Edward Elgar Publishing, this timely work of reference and research presents a thorough, scholarly and certainly readable examination of this newly enacted worldwide initiative, which has been signed by almost 40 nations footnoted in the book's Appendix, which contains the text of the ACTA itself.  (It is illuminating, if dismaying, to note the nations that haven't signed up for it.)<br /><br />Providing for enhanced international cooperation in enforcement matters, the agreement promotes sound enforcement practices.  Quoting the press statement issued by the negotiating parties, author Michael Blakeney points out that the ACTA `establishes a strengthened standard that builds on the minimum standards of the TRIPS Agreement and therefore effects `a considerable improvement in international trade norms for effectively combating the global proliferation of commercial-scale counterfeiting and piracy in the 21st century.'<br /><br />The book also comments upon all pertinent aspects of ACTA, including the negotiations and the impacts of the global trade in counterfeit and pirated products, citing along the way, some horrifying financial statistics.<br /><br />In 1995 apparently, the worth of such products was US$60 billion annually, a sum which increased 10-fold ten years later.  One of the major contributions of ACTA, says Blakeney, is that `both the direct and indirect benefits obtained by those participating in this trade should be subject to confiscation.'<br /><br />Check out Chapter 9 for more on the subject of implementing confiscation actions.  Also note the important innovation of enforcing intellectual property rights in the digital environment.<br /><br />This important book should be required reading for all IP practitioners, academics, students and policy makers concerned with the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Extensively footnoted, with a detailed index at the back, this impressively analytical volume opens up any number of avenues for further research.

B0092MKTL2|5.0|I have never been so struck by an album so immediately. Albums, at least to me, usually take a couple listens before I can call them great. My roommates cousin introduced us to Imagine Dragons only a few weeks ago and my roommate quickly bought the EP. I have been listening steadily to the EP. Last week I wanted more and looked them up and to my surprise I saw that there album had dropped two days earlier.<br /><br />Since buying the album, neither I nor my roommate can stop listening. The album just has so many great aspects to it. Mostly the fact that each song is different. The intensity of 'Radioactive' compared to lightness of 'It's Time' shows you right away. Upon listening you are not going get just your average same old same old song. Each song is it's own world and with it's poetic lyrics it takes you to a different place.<br /><br />If I have one bad thing to say of this album is it leaves you wanting more. The album is short in time, so it's over before you know it. I cannot wait to see what else this band has in store!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|No heavy lifting. Romance usually is not my cup of tea but thoroughly enjoying these books. Historical fiction is one of my favorite genres. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series
B006LSZECO|5.0|Okay...clearly this book is of the polarizing variety...you tend to either love it and think it is an amazingly twisted piece of art or you go \\"WHAT??!!!!!\\" and immediately hate the book.  Now, that being said I truly do not want to spoil anyone's experience with this book I really dislike spoilers...when I went to buy this book I only looked at a couple and basically the one that I went with was....trust me and buy this book...don't read too many reviews, and I am grateful that I did.  I do understand the ire of some of the one star reviewers and I truly respect their feelings.  I had my own strong reaction to Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins that left me feeling depressed for several days...I still hate that book.  I love the series up until that point and then just loathe how it ends.  I think that is how a lot of people feel about Gone Girl...  It is all a matter of perspective and how you react to certain things. Someone else compared it to how they felt about the Vow...(I hated that too...but it was for completely different reasons...)  Gone Girl took me on a ride that grabbed me by the throat and kept me reading for an entire Sunday just because I had to know!!!!  I have never read anything quite like it...I enjoyed everything about it...the twists...the lies...the not knowing what to believe...  I even enjoyed the ending after I got over the abruptness of it...  Now...all you new readers STOP READING NOW!!!<br /><br />SPOILER!!!!!  SPOILER!!!!!! SPOILER!!!!<br /><br />I have to ask all you people who hated the ending...don't you think that it was a little perfect?  The fact that she was set up as this extreme psychopath mastermind and that she won in the end!!!!  She set up the final trap that she knew would keep Nick in check for however long she wanted? I did not need to like Nick or Amy in order to enjoy their story...they are both psychos in their own way...maybe it is because I am studying psychology that I enjoyed it so much...  Sometimes evil wins!  That fact is all around us...  As far as the unbelievability of what happened with the police dropping the case...what evidence did they have?  Those notes were so cryptic no jury would have understood them...what else was there?  The only thing I found a little puzzling was them not investigating Desi's death more...that was the only thing that didn't make complete sense to me...<br /><br />In the end I say BRAVO!!!!  And I look forward to going back and reading her other two novels....fact is all around us...  As far as the unbelievability of what happened with the police dropping the case...what evidence did they have?  Those notes were so cryptic no jury would have understood them...what else was there?

B002KYHZLQ|3.0|A friend recommended Steven Erikson to me, and pretty much nagged me to start reading.  I bought this book on Kindle, and read through it.<br /><br />Now, first, I realize that the first book of an epic fantasy series is often a bit slow to start, as we need to not only get acquainted with the main characters, but also get a sense of the setting, including relationships, magic system, politics, and so on.  However, even by that measure, I found Gardens of the moon a bit painful to slog through.<br /><br />Here are my main issues:<br />* The characters don't seem to be relatable.  Part of that, to be honest, is that so many characters are introduced, it seems more like a series of novellas where they pop up and then disappear for a while.<br />* The magic system just doesn't make sense at all.  The \\"warrens\\" are very vague, and seem to accomplish whatever the author wants them to do at the time.<br />* There is way too much \\"deus ex machina\\" (literally) in the book.  Almost every time a big conflict comes up, just as things are starting to get good, BAM!  A god or god-like creature intervenes and completely tips the balance.<br />* There's no sense of true continuity.  The story moves immediately from one conflict to the next, and there is little or no foreshadowing.  When foreshadowing exists, the characters all seem to know exactly what's going on, but the reader has no idea, and there seems to be no desire to explain it to the reader.<br /><br />After having read this book, I find that my reading time is sufficiently limited that pursuing anything further in this series would be a poor use of it.

I was introduced to the racy novels by such masters as Harold Robbins, Sydney Sheldon, and Jaqueline Susanne. I devour everything Lawrence Sanders has written as well. I read the classics (Bronte, Austen) as well as some contemporary romance (Emma Holly) and historical fiction (Philippa Gregory).<br /><br />I gave this book 2 stars because I did have an interest in seeing what would become of the two characters met in the first one. Some of the s*x scenes are good, not great. Even though the writing is truly dreadful: repetitive, trite, pointless/ridiculous plot, no surprises, unbelievably false characters, it compels one to finish. What happens? Well, I won't spoil it for you,  but you already know. Christian and Ana continue to annoy and madden the reader, especially Ana, with her insecurities, inner goddess(oh, please!), constant orgasms (really?), she is so weak and stubborn at the same time. Is that possible? I really despised her as the books went on, and felt NO sympathy for her... I did, however, understand WHY Christian is hell-bent on punishing her--even a non BDSM would be driven to punish her! A more annoying protagonist I have not yet met.<br /><br />It was a struggle to get through this one, I found myself skipping the sex scenes(!!), rolling my eyes (ha!) and skimming through entire chapters just to get to the blessed end. I won't be reading the third one.<br /><br />My complaints: The stupid names (Anastasia STEELE, Christian GREY...Really??)  The ridiculous timeframe (5 weeks to... Really??) Did he have to be a BILLIONNAIRE? and 27 yrs old???  Tell me HOW on earth does a college graduate circa 2012 NOT HAVE AN EMAIL, cell phone, OR A COMPUTER ??!! The repetitive and stupid DIALOG!!! (Jeez, \\"down there\\", WOW, Holy Crap, Crap, Inner Goddess, my \\"sex\\", \\"ARGH\\", GAH, My Fifty, and my favorite, \\"Laters, Baby\\"...gag!) NO satisfying description of what either character really looks like. Ana: \\"Blue Eyes too big for her face\\" Whaaa???<br /><br />Why the 5 stars from so many readers? My guess is, these people have never read good erotica and now that they have it's a revelation. Many of them are huge Twilight fans. I, too, enjoyed Twilight, but Breaking Dawn not so much. I never had an interest in the 3rd and 4th ones. Maybe I am fickle. That being said, Edward, Bella and their co-horts were infintely more interesting and better drawn out, not to mention so much more believable despite Twilight being fantasy fiction. This is like a cheap carbon copy, but OF a copy, you know how they fade out with each subsequent copy-of-a-copy?<br /><br />Honestly, I have had more fun reading these reviews than I did reading the books! Infinitely more entertaining to say the least. Maybe I'll sit down and write a Fan Fiction of Fifty and make a bajillion dollars...hmmm.....<br /><br />Maybe the Movie will be better than the book, a la The Devil Wears Prada? But they really need to make the Grey character much older. I'm really not buying the Fifty Shades of F*&d up self-made 27 year old bajillionnnaire bit.! The repetitive and stupid DIALOG!!! (Jeez, \\"down there\\", WOW, Holy Crap, Crap, Inner Goddess, my \\"sex\\", \\"ARGH\\", GAH, My Fifty, and my favorite, \\"Laters, Baby\\"...gag!) NO satisfying description of what either character really looks like. Ana: \\"Blue Eyes too big for her face\\" Whaaa???<br /><br />Why the 5 stars from so many readers?

1846866588|5.0|I got it as a gift for the 2-year-old daughter of a good friend.  They've loved it, but I haven't seen it.  Evidently it is a big hit, just what the family enjoys, a very nice story and easy songs to share.
1433502445|5.0|I anxiously awaited this new Bible and have found it to be an amazing resource. The ESV uses clear language and is highly recommended by most scholars. There are a great number of maps and study resources not found in most Study Bibles. Additionally, it is great for those who want to use it in teaching because you are given access to everything online including all of the commentary and the entire Bible. It also presents all of the major eschatalogical views in the commentary where appropriate. The only drawback to this amazing resource is that it is too large to fit in a normal size Bible carrier, and in my opinion, it is just too large to carry to Church or Sunday School. But if you want a Bible that has it all, this is the one!
0525953728|5.0|This book is not only a well-written, thoughtful account of what it takes to be a warrior of the highest caliber, but it is also a no-emotion, straightforward rendering about what it was like to get OBL. I was riveted from start to finish and enormously impressed with the author's humbleness, constant drive to excel, appreciation for his comrades, and dedication to duty.<br /><br />I didn't see anything in this book that I haven't heard or read elsewhere in the plethora of mixed reports handed to us civilians in the aftermath of the raid. I'm glad someone who had the actual experience cared enough to share the straight story with us.<br /><br />He ends the book by referring you to agencies you can connect with, to help SEAL families, and a beautifully laid out tribute to fallen SEALS. Seldom does a book find me saying that this guy has my complete admiration and respect and I hope he writes more books about his other adventures. Go SEALs!!!and THANKS for your service.<br /><br />As a final note... I hope to see Obama follow through with his invitation to them, and (at the very least) treat the SEAL team to some brews and BBQ at the White House!!!!
034580404X|1.0|I wasted precious time I wouldn't wish to get back.<br /><br />I've read better trashy erotic novels from the $2  service station bargain bin, written by authors more deserving of this authors fame.<br /><br />The whole insult of a novel is just a erotic, wanna-be romantic waste.<br /><br />Worst of all, the horrific insult to my intelligence as this so called author fobs off Childrens Book structuing and simplistic reading.<br /><br />As it is the younger generations now and to come already have the ball rolling for a bright future of monosyllabic oxygen theives, that wouldn't know common sence even to 'Google it'.<br /><br />Was it absolutely imperative for this paper-scat to be published to accelerating the downward spiral into the pits of simple minded kaos!!!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This will be short and sweet, since you should see this movie, espeically if you love action or scifi.  The lead actor (Taylor Kitsch) and actress (Lynn Collins) are making their rounds in big movies, and you can see why.  The only negative was that the movie seems rushed, just a bit choppy at times. I hope when the sequels are being produced, they will lengthen the movies to smooth out the flow.  Disney needs to continue the story!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|on my Kindle no problems. The 1800 comment? That's just you. 3400 highscore here. Its a fun timewaster. Its repetitive yes.
1451648537|5.0|this book tells all even those i'm about 1/4 way though the book.i made a good choose for my first big book to read at night.

0307951529|5.0|This book is great! Got me inspired and motivated to go after my passion. I shared it with a friend. Who shared it with a friend, who shared it with another friend. Detalied direction to start a business on $100 StartUp.
B007NVI0VA|5.0|Every episode was great . I totally enjoy watching them over and over again. Picture is clear and colors are vibrant.
0545265355|5.0|This series is absolutely amazing.  I read a book a day and couldn't put them down.  I have already started re-reading them too.  My sister isn't a big fan of reading at all, but she decided to give this series a try after I kept raving about them.  Now she's hooked and can't put them down either.  You don't be disappointed!
B007XNAOS0|5.0|I can understand all the negative reviews of this album. Once a band establishes its sound, there are certain fanbase expectations. If Radiohead came out with a sludge album, no matter how well done it was, I would imagine that most of its fanbase would hate it. I see some of it here, too. If you like sludge / stoner / doom metal, and you are not a huge fan of progressive and psychedelic rock, I can see how this album would not appeal to you. There is not much to do about it - these people are entitled to dislike it. I would say that I equaly like progressive rock and metal, and I have tried to judge this double album on its own. Also, just because they have changed their direction doesn't mean that they know what they are doing with the newly found direction.<br /><br />Having said all that and having listened to each CD about 15 times, I think that this is a masterpiece. I think that all these songs flow really well together. And the whole mixture of styles to include rock, folk, space and some melodic metal doesn't seem overdone. Each delay, reverb, wah-wah and echo is placed perfectly to add to the appropriate song. Also, the lyric delivery is great, with the right punch as the song climaxes, but not to the point where they sound cheesy and repetitive. The metal elements and nice lead guitars are still there, just not as much as in the past. I think that if this had been the group's first album, all the prog rock publications would have been raving about it, and it would go under the radar of the metal-only fans who would not be there to evaluate it (again, nothing wrong with being a part of the fanbase and disliking this album). But just as Ulver releases are always found in the metal section of a record store (even though they are everything but metal these days), Baroness will often be measured and evaluated by the metal base.
1451696205|5.0|I felt the storyline was very real and emotional.  I enjoyed reading it a lot.  I am also glad they are going to be making this one into a movie too.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|This great 2011 concert follows Bonamassa's last recorded event at Royal Albert Hall in 2009.  This time out, he cuts out the horns, the extra drummer, etc. and goes for a 4 man group.  He and they are great.  I didn't notice any common songs, except for his outstanding acoustic \\"Woke Up Dreaming\\" which once again finds its way to the \\"Bonus\\" section of the disc.<br /><br />Helping Joe out with some vocals are blues belter Beth Hart, folk rocker John Hiatt and from Bad Company and recently Queen, Paul Rodgers.  Each does a couple numbers with Joe torching the strings in the background.  The stellar band is certainly worth mentioning with Carmine Rojas on electric bass, Tal Bergman on drums and Rick Melick on keyboards.  By my count Joe uses 8 different guitars on the 18 songs including a vintage 1959 \\"Les Paul.\\"<br /><br />Like his previous Blu ray/DVD the concert is directed by Scot McFadyen who does another masterful job.  Unlike most concert films these days, the transitions are smooth and stay focused on what is important at that place in the song.  Editing is well done.  Lighting is appropriate for the venue.  Excellent production which comes across in the Blu ray.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is well presented across the channels. There is also a LPCM stereo and a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 mix.  Crank it up and enjoy one of the great guitar masters of our day.
0375842209|5.0|This one is a little slower to read than some due to the content and the reflection that comes with the way this story is written.  Great point of view that it was written from as well.  It made me laugh at times and cry my eyes out at others.  I have never been so moved before by a book.
B005HEE186|3.0|This episode deals with a very young man who is both cunning, and innocently likeable at the same time.  Charlie's ignorance of 'human bedhaviors' causes eruptions for him emotionally, and crew members begin to disappear.<br /><br />It takes a rather long time before Kirk and Spock to figure this out; which was exasperating to me, since we are talking Starfleet Academy Officers here.  Kirk should never have been personally involved with this young man, let alone permit him access to the Bridge?  Why do all alien guests receive a visit to the Bridge??..NOT SMART.<br /><br />Jim ~
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Good, cant wait for next season. A lot of suspense, turns and twists to this season. when does season three come out for amazon?
B004M8AL6E|5.0|Excellent story line with fabulous actors. This has always been one of my favorites. I'm glad this one is available instant.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book changewd the way that I look at food.  10 lbs in 10 days!!!  It is not only about weight loss but I feel amazing!!
B003SI84D6|5.0|This is, by far, the best western ever. Val Kilmer made this movie a classic with his Doc Holiday. \\"I'm ya huckleberry.\\" :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is SOOO good. Ups, downs, and unexpected turns @ every page. Must read! The only downside? Not knowing what to read once your finished with the series :0)
B005LAIHPY|4.0|When I sat down to watch Battleship, I did not have an open mind. A movie based on a board game? Well, it worked for Clue, and it almost works for Battleship. The acting is pretty mild, despite having the powerhouse Liam Neeson (though he makes us smile at the end of the film). The whole time I was sitting there going \\"where's the gimmick?\\". And when it revealed itself, I laughed a lot. But it worked.<br /><br />One thing that really impressed me was the cast of Navy veterans that brought their guns to blaze for the climax of the film. It brought a sense of realism to any otherwise FX-happy producers. The bonus features aren't anything to write home about, but the cast and crew seemed to really enjoy their time in the film.<br /><br />All in all, if you enjoy the 'end of the world' flicks like 2012, Armageddon, the Core, or any of that, you'll probably enjoy Battleship. Just don't forget to turn off your brain and grab the popcorn. And if not, I'd still advise viewers to stick around for the climax - once there, the ride makes up for most of the short comings prior.<br /><br />In other words, it rocks to boat. Apologies for the weak pun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read it very quick.  It kept me very interested.  I couldn't put it down.  I finished it and had to get the next book.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|So happy!  not only do I have the movie I got the how it was made and a digital version of it!  Thank you AMAZON!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This App is amazing!  It tells you how much battery life you have for browsing, standby time,  music and more. I love it and highly Recommend it to all!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Got started playing this when I was spending a month with family on the east coast. Boy did I ever get hooked!!! Have been playing this ever since whenever I have a little free time to spare.<br />So much fun to play with very little thinking/strategy involved. Just a nice quite time to spend relaxing with some very angry birds. Would recommend to everybody - my young grandkids are even playing it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app for both guys and girls. from wedding to birthdays gadgets clothes home improvements tools.... run on sentence but its a great site.
0375507256|5.0|I'm in absolute love of how Mitchell connects seemingly unrelated topics and stories. And the way that each story has it's own characteristic style and yet is part of a whole is just amazing.
B003UYUP58|5.0|As a former cancer patient, I was interested in learning something about the history of this insidious disease.  The writing is crisp and the story spans about 4500 years although it mostly covers the 20th century.  I found the psychology of the doctors most interesting.  But for the ego of some of these folks in the field of oncology, we probably would be further along towards a cure.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The best app so far. you can use it with your PC or tablet or even your smartphone !! It sincronizes with all&iacute; three !!!
B008EOVHXI|5.0|I bought this album because I was familiar with some of Valentina's work and enjoy listening to artful playing of the piano.  I've listened to all of the pieces at least 5 times today!  If you are familiar at all with Valentina's skill and technique, you will enjoy these classics.  I am amazed by her talent every time I watch her fingers manipulate he keyboard.  My favorites include the Op 23, Fur Elise, Paganini's Grande Etudes, and of course, Moonlight Sonata.  A great compilation of fantastic music by a talented musician.
0061730327|5.0|This book is inspiring my life! How a little bo could transform a entire village? This book helps me to open my eyes to develop the society!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed playing all of the Angry Bird games but have been dismayed at having had to lose all of my progress, two times for Space, twice for Seasons, once for the Original, and no times for Rio all because I wanted to upgrade. Why is this happening and what's worse why is this happening multiple times? Have the crew at Rovio truly not been able to create and send through updates that don't require a reboot? I absolutely LOVE my Angry Birds but once I getnotified that I mustdelete my progress in order to upgrade I cancel the upgrade...and I don't feel that is fair to the fans who not only play all of them but also have paid for allnof them multiple times for multiple devices.
B005F3XV62|1.0|I RECEIVED MY MOVIE IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE ONLY THING IS I DIDN'T NOW THIS MOVIE WOULDN'T COME WITH THE CASE. AND ALSO THIS MOVIE WAS LISTED AS NEW. BUT LOOKS USED. THERE ARE DEEP SCRATCHES. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
B00846REIS|4.0|Was a good read.  Am waiting for volume 2 release..!  Will read all 3 book.  Liked that much.  The story was well written.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This CD was a great choice.  The entire selection provides a great opportunity to relax and enjoy.  The price was right and the entire process was simple and painless.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|not only very easy to read and the plot sucks you in and you can not stop reading till the end, but also lot of interesting parallels to real world and gives you opportunity to think and discuss.
B007MJT1K2|5.0|Fun Movie, had lots of adventure and action. Kept us entertained when not a lot of movies these days will!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I have downloaded many of these \\"Japanese crosswords\\" also known a nonograms, pic-cross, etc and this is one of the best! I downloaded as the faotd, but would have gladly payed for it.  The user interface is easy, the puzzles are just the \\"right amount\\" of hard per level.  I recommend to anyone interested in these sorts of puzzles.
0205191584|4.0|It came in less than a week and in great conditions. It's perfect for college or high school or whatever you need it for
0307594009|5.0|One of my all-time favorite books. I read this for the first time in eight grade as required reading for my English class. I knew little about Anne Frank at the time. Her diary is one of those iconic books that never leaves you. From time to time, I still seek out its pages. Wisdom and humanity jot the pages the way trivial banter fills others. I love Anne's perspective, and stand in awe of her ability to see past the brutality that encompassed her life at such a young age.
B001S86J5S|3.0|Major League is a fun little film filled with lively performances from the likes of Wesley Snipes, Dennis Haysbert, James Gannon, Tom Berenger and in what started him down the track of comedic acting Charlie Sheen.  Outside of a funny cameo in Ferris Bueller, Mr. Sheen had done only dramatic acting.  His performance as Ricky \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughan showed he a great knack for comedy and he almost exclusive does that style of acting today.  The film focuses on the hapless Cleveland Indians who are inherited by a Las Vegas showgirl who wants to move the team to Miami (the film was released prior to baseball expanding to that city).  She orders the GM to assemble the worst team possible so they draw less than the required attendance to iniate an escape clause in the lease.  Of course through seemingly insurmountable odds, the team wins and forces a one game playoff for the division title versus the mighty New York Yankees.  Mr. Berenger & Mr. Sheen had recently worked together on Platoon and share a nice chemistry.  Bob Uecker adds some authentic MLB exposure as the team's announcer (most of the movie was actually shot in Milwaukee, Uecker's hometown).  All in all, Major League adds up to a fun way to spend two hours.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|If you are a novice at creating books for Kindle this is an excellent book. I was looking for a little more detail about how to go about incorporating special features in a Kindle eBook. This book doesn't cover many advanced topics.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's The Promise is a double cd set of outtakes from the Darkness sessions and was also included as part of the Darkness box set.  It doesn't feel like a bunch of outtakes cobbled together for a release, but has a theme and unity that would have made a great album itself back in 1978 if Mr. Springsteen had chose to release the songs.  You can see why he opted to not include them on Darkness because they don't fit the stark theme of that album.  Obviously there were some big hits among these songs that other artists covered to much commercial success like \\"Fire\\" and \\"Because The Night\\", but others like \\"Wrong Side Of The Street\\", \\"Ain't Good Enough For You\\", \\"Gotta Get That Feeling\\" and \\"Save My Love\\" had strong hit potential.  There are alternate versions of some songs that made the album \\"Racing In The Streets (78)\\", \\"Candy's Boy\\" (\\"Candy's Room\\") & \\"Come On (Let's Go Tonight)\\" (\\"Factory\\") that are good but don't hold up next to the originals.  There are two songs that were left off the album that could have easily been fit on and held the theme Mr. Springsteen was going for.  They are of course the title cut and the hidden track \\"The Way\\".  They both have that sense and feel of loss, searching and redemption of Darkness.  Mr. Springsteen many times in his career has forsaken sure fire hits for his overall vision, but the greatness of these songs show that his vision is usually 20/20 not matter what he elects to put on an album or keep in the can.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really great continuation of first book.  It is a great combination of adventure, love story and political philosophy.  Highly recommended.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. Interesting concept with good acting. A little cheesy in some spots but I liked it anyway.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I loved reading the adventures as a kid and the movie does justice to Tin Tin and Snowy. I hope there is a sequel. The quality of the DVD is really great
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's easy to use and understand. Definitely a must for the kindle because it's FREE and makes keeping track of your battery life easy. It has other helpful additions to it. Get it, it's free, if you don't like it then uninstall it.
B008Y7GPY6|5.0|I have never written a single review on Amazon before, but this movie was outstanding. Not all movies have a happy ending, but this one was absolutely terrific. The entire movie takes place in a coffin. While that sounds boring, the way everything ties together is very heart wrenching and thought provoking at the same time. This has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Definitely watch it.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|It's easy to learn and has tons of puzzles.  Most puzzles can be figured out fairly quickly, so it's great to play if you're waiting in line and need something to do.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've had several problems with charging my Kindle in the past and thought a battery monitor might help.  This free app was everything I wanted and more! Not only does it give me a visual representation of my battery level, but it also lets me know how long it will take to charge to full, the amount of time I would have for reading or game playing based on the battery level, and even lets me know the health of the battery. One of the most useful functions is the percentage notifications. I like that I can set it to notify me at different stages of battery charge, as well as how it notifies me. This way, I don't have to worry if I'll have my Kindle shut down while I'm in the middle of something. I'll always be able to keep track. I'm very glad that I've downloaded it and have the chance to use it everyday.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this impulse purchase. I greatly enjoyed this book and found it a refreshing take on most science fiction. The author weaves a great tale with a twistful ending. Combined with the price - you definitely can't go wrong with this one. Time to see if he has written anything else!
B0086700CM|4.0|dude it is so fun addicting rocks but u bye wallpaper and it dosnt work but on the other hand fun
B004H4XL7E|4.0|I used to work as an advertising agency creative. The book covers several aspects of pitching I discovered for myself on my own. Especially, the disruptive (and creative) power of defiance, frames, narratives that let the Customers form our message in their minds, the \\"secret sauce\\" I used to call \\"coolness factors\\" and many more. The book gave me an opportunity to confront and back up what I knew in the area with several findings in the neurology field - instead of relying entirely on intuition and my own experience.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some are good, some mediocre.  But it's a worthy free download.  Ads are a lot but not as intrusive as worst of other free games
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was excellent and it exceeded my expectations even after watching it a second time. I rented this movie because I plan on watching it again and with others. I am also glad I chose to select the blueray edition. It made it worth while and I think amazon had a good deal especially because I pre-ordered the movie and saved a little bit of money.
B0043WDK3K|5.0|One of the better returning Season openers. Castle and Beckett could not be parted. Beckett solved case before Castle but was not going to let her man go. Castle has no chance.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have this app on the ipad and kindle fire.  it works better on the ipad..it is much easier to resume a puzzle. there are also many more free puzzles on the ipad version.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|One of the best challenges I have seen or tried. Some of the simplest levels are difficult unless you try the most direct actions.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Simple.  Repayable.  Great.  The update seems to have fixed the choppiness and losing-coins-on-exit bugs for me.  Best game I've played in a while.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Finally a real female action \\"hero\\" I can take seriously!!!!!!!  Great flick even with some predictable spots.  Good cast and a fun ride throughout.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting premise, interesting characters, continued suprises. Character development was a bit stale but they were likable. Loved the underwater part! Very fun reading. I recommend this book.
0099579936|1.0|Awful!  This book was intended for the shallow minded! If you enjoy reading, dont waste your time with this book!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Time escapes while  you play.  Great challenges.  I recommend to anyone and of all ages.  And the music is very soothing.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|There's really no reason to review the movie itself. After all, it's one we all grew up with and easily stands the test of time. Commenting on just the Blu-Ray version.... I will say that it's unbelievably incredible!!! It was basically like watching it for the very first time!! The characters, the costumes, the castle, and even Chitty himself all look AWESOME!!<br />I had already owned this movie for years; First on VHS and then DVD. But, to watch it in 1080p High Def splendor is simply incredible!!  If you don't currenly own this movie in blu-ray, do yourself a huge favor and BUY IT!!<br />You will not even be slightly dissappointed...
B008JAGZDE|3.0|Felt like this movie could have been a little more funnuier. It was funny, but doesn't really compare to American Pie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am enjoying playing Amazon solitaire as it is allowing me to learn to use my Kindle Fire without a mouse.
B002C39TTG|5.0|If u like the smiths chances are im waisting my time typing this because you already own this but if not and you want to start listening to them start here  with theyre 1st lp here  its  absolutely  a great record!!!!!!!!!  one of my favs. of the smiths probably the favorite of all of them!

B004CFBMRY|5.0|Amazing read, not just about running, but the human race and our natural abilities. A page turning read and highly motivational also
B003QNXPUK|1.0|The clear film turned yellow in a month and looked horrible. It also started to peel off. I bought some cheap off brand ones for a dollar and they worked a hundred times better, not yellow, not peeling! These are a waste of money.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I just stumbled on this title, and wasn't even looking for a book on this topic (but that is one of the fun parts of shopping on Amazon.com). I started reading this and couldn't put it down and almost read cover to cover (if you can call it that on a Kindle). The book inspires you to find your little niche in the big mean capitalist world we live in, while still keeping both your feet firmly on the ground. And it's not all about dry theory: the Best part is teh scores of real life examples on how people turned their hobby/interest/special skill into something that can also earn you some (extra) cash. As I write this, I'm forwarding this title to a friend of mine who is just starting her own business after being made redundant, as she is starting up her own little adventure in consultancy. I'm sure it will give her soem extra hope AND practical advice. I'm also thinking on a little side project on my own, and will definitely re-read this book for the practical advice on reaching new customers, using the new (internet) tools BUT keeping the project small enough not to overtake my life. The future is there for grabs... you just need to take that first step
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This is a superbly written and is brilliantly brought to life with todays state of the art CG...  I loved every minute of the film.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have watched this movie 3 times and am certain to watch it again and again. Have also read the books twice and cannot wait for the next movie to come out. One sees and understands more with each viewing and/or reading. It is great for starting conversations and discussions with all age groups from teens to older adults. It is not about the violence but rather the principles behind the games. LOVE IT, LOVE IT!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The Outlander Series is one of the best series I have ever read. I can't put them down. Diana Gabaldon has done an excellent job portraying the main characters of Jamie and Clare.  Men can take a lesson from Jamie on what women want  in a relationship. It was stated perfectly...I have seen a marriage of obligation and a marriage of love...I want the marriage of love.<br />The story plots are great and you immediately get caught up in the drama. Awesome!
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|Great game. Takes thought but doesn't take forever to finish. Would recommend it for anyone who likes jewel games or puzzles. Nice combination.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  It showed the moral, intellectual, and spiritual evolution of the man and the numerous external forces that attempted to block his development.  It is necessary to see the various experiences and stages of life to appreciate the man he became before his death.  Terrific acting and story.

B001QVFDA4|4.0|For 2012, I am doing a 100 hundred movie challenge. After slacking for a few months ( ahem, majority of them ), I realized I was terribly behind and started taking suggestions from friends, family, and anyone who would listen for five minutes. When I read the synopsis, I wasn't sure this was going to be the movie for me. However, I wasn't being picky about what I was watching at this point as I realized I had three three months to watch 75 movies. I would take what I could get, especially at a decent price.<br /><br />First and foremost, I was pleasantly surprised! The plot, though a bit twisty in the beginning, was pretty easy to follow. While violence was present, it was not over the top and particularly gory. It fit perfectly with the story and did not seem to be completely unnecessary. The humor was on pitch and struck just the right tone of funny but not campy. Nothing between characters felt forced ( thanks to a fantastic cast ) and you really got the sense that they were some old pals just hanging around.<br /><br />In all, this movie was a great sort of watch for a fun movie night with the gang. Guys, gals, anybody could enjoy this film.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My husband never read the books but thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  We hope that a second and third movie are in the works.
0345803485|4.0|I am a 20 year old girl and I loved this book. The pasion and the love between the two characters would not let me out any of the books down. I did not like however how repetitive it was. And there were so many sex scenes I began to skip over them. Didn't care for the ending but I am a sucker for love stories and I truly enjoyed this one. I am not a very experienced reader so I do not have much to compare this book to so it got four stars from me!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Once I got to the middle of the book, I could not put it down.  I will finish it today.  Very good quick read.
B00866H7SS|2.0|This is not worthy of being called a book. No story worth talking about. Thrash is how I would catagorise it.Not worth buying if its good read you are after.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I played Quell Reflect when it was offered as the app of the day and loved it.  It's prequel shares the same great frictionless sliding gameplay.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is the exciting continuation to the Hunger Games. It was very hard to put the book down. For parents who can't get their Middle School or High School student to read, the Hunger Games Trilogy is a great way to get them interested in reading. A parent could even make it a requirement to read before watching the movie when it comes out.

B0090EIC3Y|1.0|I actually liked Borat. This movie sucked a big one. I shut it off after fifteen minutes. Waste of money.
B007KUFDBY|4.0|Disney's release of Treasure Planet on Blu-Ray I'm sure will introduce a lot of young children to a great movie that will find it's way into a lot of favorite lists.  This movie has a lot going for it, and should certainly make it into the collection of any parents that want their children(especially boys) to watch great wholesome adventure.<br /><br />Great things about the movie:<br />1.  The script!  Of course this movie is a retelling of the book classic, \\"Treasure Island\\", and it stays right with the plot of the book.  I wondered how they would accomplish such a feat being the setting is so different, but they do and do it well.<br /><br />2.  The setting!  I love the sci-fi element to the movie.  When you look at the setting and layout you see a little of old and new.  In the special features the designers said they followed a 70-30 rule in that 70 percent was new technology and 30 percent was old technology.  So you see giant sailing ships that sail in space, and laser guns that look like muskets.  VERY COOL!<br /><br />3.  the cast.  Hawkins plays a good character that is likeable but just as in Disney's movie \\"Treasure Island\\" and in the book by Stevenson, Silver, the cook/pirate steals the show and is the most developed likeable scoundrel in the story.<br /><br />This really is a good movie.  If I were to judge it by animated movies outside of Disney I would say it's an AWESOME movie.  But when you measure it up against Lion King, Aladdin, or Peter Pan, it doesn't exactly hit the mark.  I would put this movie in the Disney Realm of the Fox & Hound, Tarzan, or Hercules, good(3 stars) but not great.<br /><br />I give the movie 3 stars, BUT I added one star because of the creativity of the setting.<br />Great movie, you boys will love it!
030758836X|5.0|This is a fun read, very contemporary with its inclusion of modern media trends (print, broadcast and social), and I recommend you have someone else that's read it - much discussion required!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I had heard that this is a franchise movie so I will be expecting more, but I am glad they at least 'finished' this one...just in case.<br />Well done.  I enjoyed the film very much.
B006LSZECO|4.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" is a thrill ride of a story that introduces you to the married couple, Amy and Nick Dunn.  Living in NYC, they see their world deteriorate when they lose their jobs and coupled with Nick's parents health struggles, Mom with cancer and Dad with dementia, the burden starts to badly impact their relationship.  Amy is the spoiled child whose parents were successful publishers of a children's book series ostensibly based on her childhood.  They decide to move to the Midwest to be near Nick's parents which sets in motion the fast-paced and devilish heart of this novel.<br /><br />More than halfway through \\"Gone Girl\\", I couldn't stand either Nick or Amy.  Usually such lack of emotional attachment to a single character would spell doom for a book.  However, Flynn manages to make this work because of the wild ride she takes you on and the \\"psycho\\" nature of Amy.  Ordinarily you'd be left with some sympathy for Nick, but he is such a pathetic guy it isn't the case here.<br /><br />Many of the poor reviews pan the ending of this novel.  When I first finished the book, I had the same reaction.  After a couple of days, I came to the conclusion that it was the perfect ending for this book and something that only made sense giving the sinister nature of Amy and much of the rest of the story arc.  Ironically, it wasn't the ending that prevented me from giving this book 5 starts, but the fact that I found it preposterous to believe every little diabolical move could turn out perfectly.  This is a pure adrenaline ride and quite entertaining that I immediately downloaded Flynn's first two novels right after I finished the last sentence of \\"Gone Girl\\".  I can't wait to see what else her devious mind created.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely adore Pintrest. I prefer this app over the full site. Its easy to use and so very much fun. I am glad to finally be able to use on my kindle. thanks!
B008MG1E4A|2.0|The content of the book is generally not engaging and for many stretches within is poorly written.<br /><br />The big question about this book is what was so friggin important that it had to be written. It is widely accepted that the author wrote this book in violation of the procedures required by agreements he voluntarily entered with the United States Government. (His justification for violating his agreements with the US gov (something along the lines of, \\"Well, since the President did it, I can do it too.\\") is nothing short of lame.)<br /><br />The author states that his intention in writing the book was to \\"set the record straight.\\"  However, it is unclear how this author's account of what happened in the bin Laden raid was *materially* different from what has been reported.  At most, it seems that he provided details that only those on the ground would have known.  However, the variances between his report and what was previously disclosed are rather insignificant.  So, what was so important that the author had to violate his agreements with the US government?<br /><br />Having patently failed in achieving his stated intention, one is led to suspect that the author really had other motives.  Profit would be a good one that I cannot or would not condemn, but be honest about it or at least don't mislead your audience.  An attempt at political influence might be another -- he takes a couple of awkward jabs at his Commander In Chief who ordered the raid (though the author acknowledges that the order was the right one) -- but in this too he fails because the author's negative (if you can call them that) comments about Obama are tepid at best and in all events unreasoned (e.g., 'most of the guys did not like Obama'.  No explanation of why and, frankly, I think most people would say, Who cares.  Lots of people dislike their bosses).<br /><br />In the end, the author comes across as being quite confused about the purpose of his book.  He states that the raid was justlike hundreds of others he'd performed in his career but, it appears, after all of the fanfare that followed the raid the author was able to see that the country's insatiable desire to know more about it and these highly trained soldiers presented a once in a lifetime opportunity for him. Taking advantage of an opportunity is fine and I have no qualms about it so long as self interest is not elevated over more important things such as the promises the author made that allowed him to be in the position to have the opportunity to be on the raid in the first place.<br /><br />Despite the foregoing, I would sincerely say congratulations and thank you to all of men and women who participated in taking out the best known terrorist in the world.  However, I did not need this book to do that.
B007TML4EI|5.0|This game is amazing as a free app of the day but would be worth the $0.99 it costs any other day. The levels are pretty straight forward, you are given a task on how to protect Melvin (and in some cases, hurt kelvin the bad dummy). This app runs well and can be challenging to figure out what and how build a structure to complete the task and within budget. The levels are not unbeatable and there are even some walkthrough's on Youtube should you get really stuck. It's similar to Bridge Constructor but a very different concept. This is a good way to past time and educational at the same time. I look forward to more apps with physics in mind from this developer.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I found myself addicted to this creative twist on the familiar fairy tale. \\"Once Upon A Time\\" takes some of the most famous characters known to most of us through their Disney version (Snow White, Prince Charming, Cinderella, Pinocchio, The Mad Hatter, and Belle) as well as some that haven't been Disney-fied yet (Rumpelstiltskin, Hansel and Gretel, and Little Red Riding Hood) and puts them all together in modern times in a town called Storybrooke. None of the Storybrooke citizens remember their fairy tale origins (which are seen in flashback sequences), except for the Evil Queen from \\"Snow White,\\" who runs the town as Mayor. It was she who engineered their memory loss and move to Storybrooke, so that she could remove all happiness from their lives out of her vengeance for a slight from Snow herself. It is the Evil Queen/Mayor's adopted son who figures it all out by reading a book of fairy tales. He makes the link between the Enchanted World and that of Storybrooke, and enlists the help of his birth mother, who he believes to be the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. If it sounds a little convoluted, well...at times it can be. Yet with each episode, I found myself drawn further and further in as each character becomes linked and intertwined, drawing towards the season's breathtaking finale...which only leaves the viewer with more questions that will have to wait until the second season.<br /><br />The cast is stellar. Lana Parrilla shines as the Evil Queen/Mayor, rising to the occasion of being the villainess you want to hate, but also giving her just enough touches of humanity to make you sympathize (just a little bit!) with her and feel the pain that created the vengeful creature she became. Note: without giving away any plot twists, Barbara Hershey has a fantastic cameo as The Evil Queen's mother...talk about chilling! Ginnifer Goodwin is letter perfect as Snow White, but even more perfect in her characterization of the teacher in Storybrooke. Conflicted by the hate of the Mayor, she struggles with choices that seem a little unlike her fairy-tale counterpart. This is what makes this series so fun; perfect characters become imperfect in our present world, and it can be difficult to predict what they will do. Jennifer Morrison was an excellent choice as Snow White's Daughter, aka Emma Swan of Storybrooke. I do have a bone to pick with the writers though, who flip flop her Storybrooke character from being a tough and determined mother to being a wimpy whiny mess who wants to run away. This flopping of character only serves to draw out the drama, and not in a good way. No such problem with Robert Carlyle's characters of Rumpelstiltskin/Mr. Gold. He goes head to head with Parrilla, serving up a performance that you love to hate, but at the same time also sympathize with.<br /><br />The special effects are top notch; when looking at the extras, it is hard to believe just how much of the sets were done in CGI. I doubt that this series could have been done on a television budget ten years ago. On blu-ray, the visuals and sound are spectacular. Great detail, clarity, and color.  Aspect ration is 1.78:1, with the sound in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD/Blu-ray include the following featurettes:<br /><br />* Fairy Tales in the Modern World: How the classic stories we all know and love were adapted to coexist with Storybrooke.<br />* Building Character: Using Belle (from \\"Beauty and the Beast\\") as the example, it shows how the production team re-created her character for \\"Once Upon A Time,\\" using just enough visual queues from the Disney version to make her recognizable, but adding a few new twists to make her fresh. Actress Emilie de Ravin's input was also taken, which you can see in her interview when she was asked to give her thoughts on Belle.<br />* Welcome to Storybrooke: This was one of my favorites, showing how the town in Canada used for Storybrooke was transformed each time it had to be used for filming. The production crew had the changeover down to a science, as they took existing stores and restaurants and made them the ones that you see on screen. I'm sure this will bump up the tourism, as visitors have already asked when will Mr. Gold's Antique shop be open!<br />* The Story I Remember...Snow White: Interesting to hear the different actors in the show describe the version of Snow White that they are familiar with (note: there  exist many more versions besides the Disney one). Some darker than others!<br /><br />The usual commentaries (including co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, writer Jane Epenson, and cast members Goodwin, Carlyle, Parilla, Morrison and Josh Dallas, aka Prince Charming), bloopers and deleted scenes are included, too. Some of the deleted scenes added a little extra information (especially revolving around the plot of Snow being in jail), but in the end, nothing that really was missed.

B005LW5J9O|4.0|Great overview on how the original atomist ideas, from a Greek philosopher thousands of years ago, survived through various historical figures. Most notable among them is Poggio Bracciolini, an Italian humanist/papal secretary who hunted down ancient texts in the Middle Ages like Nicholas Cage in National Treasure.<br /><br />Multiple themes are realized throughout the Swerve- from atoms, religious heresy, and Middle Age culture to Papal Court intrigue, Roman Catholic Church Reformation, and the social hierarchies in Italy during the Renaissance. I felt as if this would be required reading for a Liberal Arts education but is manageable for anyone with a passing curiosity in the translation of ideas across the ages. Although Greenblatt's ideas may be questionable, his research and insight into ancient Greek texts, Middle Age scholars, and even Church politics is unquestioned.

1594744769|3.0|Here is a completely different take on a very popular topic. Mr. Riggs has taken the plotline that many fantasy novels have today and turned it into something completely different...in a good way.<br /><br />Jacob Portman is a normal teenager who leads a boring and uneventful life (according to him). He is fascinated and intrigued by the stories his grandfather used to tell him about his past life - about growing up in an orphanage on an island and about the peculiar children who lived there. He described children who could levitate, who could pick heavy objects and of the one who was invisible. As Jacob grew up he knew these stories were just made up.<br /><br />But when his grandfather dies in mysterious circumstances, he decides to find some answers by journeying to his grandfathers orphanage somewhere close to Wales. What he finds there is completely unexpected, fascinating and overwhelming.<br /><br />I loved loved loved the plot. I thought it was innovative and very mysterious. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The author created a beautiful atmosphere with the Island and the mysteries that surrounded it. I wished I was on the Island with Jacob. There is a lot more to the story than what I just told you but I wont disclose more because I want to keep it spoiler free.<br /><br />Now the bad - yes, it's not perfect. There were a lot of loopholes or if you see it from a different perspective, I didn't understand some of the story. The ending was rushed and there is a sequel. I'm kind of bored with the whole sequel obsession in YA. Why can't people write a book that is complete in itself? Also I found Jacob to be very decent considering the fact that he is a teenager and a boy.<br /><br />I still really enjoyed reading the book and would love to read the next one. The pictures in the book helped with the story and made it more fascinating. Initially, before reading the book, just looking at the pictures, I thought this would be a horror novel - but it isn't. I know some people get turned off by horror novels, so don't be.<br /><br />I think you would enjoy this book even if you don't read YA.t isn't.

B001HN694K|4.0|This is one in a series of posted reviews for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other \\"Alice\\" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!<br /><br />This general commentary continues as a posted review for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (this title), as these are the two most well known Alice's. Rather than attempt to add yet-another-review here, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse for a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon will have a specific review of the relevant production with same title used throughout.<br /><br />To continue...<br />I claim to be neither a Lewis Carroll nor an Alice in Wonderland expert. Rather, I went into this project naive... ignorant of the details of the story of Alice in Wonderland... ignorant of the poems within the story, and certainly ignorant of the comings and goings in Lewis Carroll's life that set up the circumstances allowing him to imagine the story of Alice in Wonderland (originally entitled \\"Alice's Adventures Underground\\", by the way).<br /><br />Watching that 1951 Disney rendition of AIW was a remarkable experience. It was fun to \\"remember\\" the story of Alice again, but also, it left me with a desire to see how else the Alice story has been rendered. The Disney film is of course animation. So how would Alice in Wonderland be portrayed in other mediums? What I learned is that AIW has been rendered in about every way you can imagine. Most familiar of course is the telling of the Alice story in film, with live action, animation, and various combinations of both. In fact since the invention of film at the turn of the 20th century not a decade has gone where at least one (and usually several) fresh renderings of the Alice story been told in moving pictures.<br /><br />Beyond that however the Alice story has been told in many forms: audio recordings, plays, ballets, operas, and musicals. It's been done with the use of puppets and marionettes, with stop motion \\"Gumby style\\" animation, in games, in home-brew backyard productions posted to YouTube, and as an Alice in Wonderland theme park. There's even been an X rated version done as a musical (quite good). A number of established shows have done a take on the Alice story; The Muppets, Sesame Street, The Care Bears, Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse, Barney, Scooby Doo, The Simpsons, Star Trek TOS, and even `Hello Kitty' took a shot at Alice.<br /><br />What's more, a wide variety of famous actors and celebrities have appeared in an Alice film. Stars from W.C. Fields to Cary Grant to Peter Sellers to Richard Burton... The Smothers Brothers, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Dudley Moore, Brooke Shields, Maryl Streep, Debbie Allen, Nathan Lane, Sammy Davis Jr., Ringo Starr, Terry Garr, and Whoopi Goldberg, just to name a few, have been involved in some sort of Alice production.<br /><br />And then there are the numerous Alice based endeavors, from Woody Allan's `Alice' with Mia Farrow, to Jefferson Airplane's `White Rabbit'.<br /><br />Why? Why is Lewis Carroll's story of a young girl who fell down a mythical rabbit hole so compelling? What gives the story such staying power? How is it that people of virtually all ages are so inexplicably drawn toward Alice and her land of wonders?<br /><br />I don't know.<br /><br />I've tried to steer clear of scholarly answers that address that question. There have been many attempts to do so. On the surface we can locate several plausible reasons that explain why Alice in Wonderland resonates with so many. We have a young, [seemingly] helpless girl. She's an underdog. Out of her element. A vulnerable character put in jeopardy. We ask, \\"what will happen next?\\", as the story takes one unexpected turn after another. And of course animals with human attributes in any story is compelling. Walt Disney discovered that innate attraction and made an industry of it. But do these answers get to the heart of the question?<br /><br />I happen to believe the explanation of Alice in Wonderland's universal appeal is that we, all of us, all human beings, young and old, have been to Wonderland ourselves. We go there in our dreams. We can all relate to the experience of logic and proportion falling away because it has happened to us. We understand how, in all the bizarreness of the wonderlands we fall into at night, that we rarely lose our heads. We should be really scared. Alice should be really scared. But somehow we accept what we see. Such is the worlds of dreams.<br /><br />Furthermore, how many of us have wondered if we continue to dream after we die? Are dreams what the afterlife is composed of? We don't fully understand the nature of dreams, so we contemplate upon them. Even the errant machine HAL in 2001 A Space Odyssey asked if he would dream after he was turned off.<br /><br />And now to return to the original question I postulated. How did I somehow know the story of Alice in Wonderland without having a particular recollection of reading the book? Or seeing a movie? One answer of course is that pieces of the story just leaked into my consciousness over the years. A movie clip here. A verbal explanation there. But could there be a deeper reason? It may have to do with \\"archetype\\". It is certain that Alice in Wonderland acts as a metaphor for dreams, but the Alice Stories seems to delve deeper... into a primal archetype --a \\"template\\" if you will-- out of which human circumstances arise. Because of that we recognize Alice's dilemma in a deep and fundamental way.<br /><br />To write the story of Alice in Wonderland Lewis Carroll had in some way become conscious of the meta-physical world. The world beyond normal perception. A world that is, as Rod Serling put it, \\"beyond that which is known to man\\". Whereas visual artists such as Hieronymus Bosch reflected their visions of the other-world in paintings, Lewis Carroll's palette was paper and words. I would not be surprised if Carroll had at some point and in some fashion become \\"experienced\\", in a Jimmy Hendrix sort of way.<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy every telling of the Alice story you can get your hands on. Each one is unique. It's fascinating to see how the core Alice story is manifested in different media. It's fun to see how the various animals are rendered. If you can, read the books first. If you can't, remember that anything to with a playing card motif, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Knave of Hearts, the stolen tarts, the Duchess, falling down the rabbit hole and the pool of tears, the White Rabbit, growing and shrinking, the Mad Hatter (and tea party), Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Mock Turtle, and the Gryphon, -phew- all come from Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />A motif based upon a chessboard, The Red King and Queen, the White King and Queen, the Red Knight and White Knight, the Jabberwocky, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion and the Unicorn, Hatta and Haighaa (a disguised appearance by the Mad Hatter and the March Hare), and the The Walrus and the Carpenter come from Through the Looking Glass.<br /><br />You'll find that many renderings of Alice in Wonderland combine elements of both books, and you know...<br /><br />Not everyone likes what's often been done<br />turning the story of Alice on ear<br />but I say, it's in the spirit of fun<br />there's really nothing at all to fear<br /><br />so what if Tim Burton brought forth Tweedledum and Tweedledee<br />And introduced Alice to the ja-bber-wock-y<br />It's been done by others dontcha see<br />he named the movie from the first book<br />but he didn't stop there<br />he poured in the latter... yet kept the Hatter!<br />gotta tell-you-the-truth, I just don't care<br /><br />in the end we all know who killed the ja-bber-wock-y<br />it was done in plain site for all to see<br />The vorpal sword was manned by that girl<br />The blonde<br />With the curls<br />that unfurl<br />or was it a boy who did the deed?<br />From the poem.

0937381888|5.0|This book is really good for rookies. The text was written in clear way even for non English speakers. It starts with a fast recipe which allow the anxious readers to start brewing since the first chapter - so you don't need to read hundreds of pages to became an official brewer! After this warm up, the author goes deep into the brewery science, showing the aspects and needs to make a real good beer. Definitely a good way to start.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not a usual sci-fi reader (I stick to fantasy in general), but I thoroughly enjoyed the Wool Omnibus. It is extremely well written: the story was well paced, the characters were interesting and the plot twists always caught me off guard. I was addicted right from the first novella and Howey did not disappoint! The omnibus is incredible value for money in my opinion and I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, or needs to ease back into like I did.
1594203334|4.0|It seems this book is full of what my grandparents would have called, \\"common sense.\\"  Personal observation, not too much seems to exist in many parents today.<br /><br />Main points:  Pause and observe your young baby when he cries, and make sure he's awake and actually needing something before picking him up and waking him yourself, so he can learn to sleep through normal human sleeping cycles, such as REM to lighter. Works, evidently, up until about 4 months of age. (This takes sensitivity on the parent's part, however.)<br /><br />\\"Creche,\\" the French day care, is run by people with (gasp!) advanced degrees in child care, not a teenybopper with her ear to the phone making minimum wage. The creche usually has a good cook working there too, and the children do not learn schoolwork, but socialize and learn to get along.  \\"A pediatrician and a psychologist each visit the creche once a week!\\"  However, not surprisingly, there are waiting lines for the creche.<br /><br />When at home, young children help with cooking and chores, to learn responsibility, and starting and completing tasks.  There are cookbooks published for children.  That's help, with adult supervision!<br /><br />Meals are every 4 hours, with an afternoon (after school) snack called the \\"gouter,\\" during which small amounts of sweets can be part of the snack. Meals are eaten with adults, and with the same food as adults, always.  \\"Parents aren't short order cooks.\\"<br /><br />French parents do believe that the child can learn to deal with frustration and greed, as in not getting everything his little heart desires. The child is not the leader/head of the family.<br /><br />Children must always say \\"hello,\\" when meeting others, and also use the magic words \\"please,\\" and \\"thank you,\\"  when in the home or public.<br /><br />Not very exacting.<br /><br />There is a lot of the author's autobiographical detail to get through for the main points, but if a parent is doing something else, this may be needed.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have now read all three of 50 shades of gray and I loved them all.  There definately is a story line there for those who only thought it was about sex. I recommend this book to anyone that loves to read a love story.

B0019O6IWU|1.0|This book is highly political and biased showing the Arabs in a poor light. I really am tired of authors especially psychologists who infuse their writing with the Halocaust and the the current Middle East power struggle.<br /><br />Perhaps my snap judgment shows a certain anger and inability to communicate. I may need more work on not getting upset or emotional, but this is not the book or the author.

B006LSZECO|2.0|Don't read on as it informs one of the ending.I think the characters are pretty shallow to have been tired of each other in only 3 years, maybe 4 at best since she was setting him up  by then.  It's a huge step from being disgusted by your mate to hating him enough to frame him for your fake murder. Then, after showing so much intelligence and cleverness to plan everything, she falls prey to \\"low-lifes\\" while she's hiding and can't hack a few days on her own.  The end, though, was ridiculous.  After all of that, they end up together?  Please...

THEY USED REAL NAVY SEALS; THE BEST PART IS THAT THE DIRECTOR (..& PRODUCERS) PULLED IT OFF (..IT WAS ALMOST AS IF THESE NAVY SEALS DIDN'T KNOW THE CAMERA WAS ROLLING WHEN THEY FILMED THIS MOVIE; THESE NAVY SEALS TOTALLY PULLED IT OFF & LOOKED NATURAL)!  THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT I WILL WATCH OVER & OVER AGAIN!  ACT OF VALOR IS A FIVE STAR MOVIE HANDS DOWN!!!!!
B004XISI4A|4.0|Great book, maps are small when viewed on kindle making it difficult to pick out details. Also a few spelling mistakes.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Well made with 3 different factions.  I'd like it if the factions were a little bit more varied from one another, but they seem to be balanced, which I suppose is more important.  Well worth the price of admission.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not the most skilled writer, but I cant help that I've gotten hooked! Just began book 2. Although the amount of sex they have is a bit unrealistic, in real life the poor girl wouldn't be able to walk...this is a novel--a fantasy that EL James has written for us, and am deliriously excited to see what happens next.
B008XG1X18|2.0|This app is good enough... but just that. on the Kindle Fire, the app shuts down and needs to be restarted several times.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Sometimes when I don't know what to read next I will look at the bestsellers list and pick one. Often this is a pleasant surprise and occasionally it is dreadful -take the Twilight series or 50 Shades of Grey for example- Both books had atrocious writing and yet were ridiculously popular. This book was promising in the beginning although disappointing at the end as it turned out to be too predictable. Perhaps the writer did too well creating her character but from the outset I had the mystery solved and I would assume that anyone with half a brain would as well. So..if your IQ hovers above 80 you can skip this one. If not you will love it and find it highly entertaining.
1428155937|5.0|My 13yr old son and I listened to this audio cd while driving back and forth from his daily sports camps.  We both loved it.  It is hard to find audio books that we both like and this author seems to be perfect.  We have listened to two of his other audio books with the Sigma Force and liked both. We both would recommend this book.  Just be aware that the disease is described in DETAIL.  If that would bother you this book is not for you. This is basically an adult fiction.
B008I34ZUM|5.0|I just heard of this release so I have not even ordered the CD yet. But this album on vinyl was always one of my absolute favorites. All of the tracks are perfect and can be played endlessly over and over again, which I did and still do. These perfect songs are ingrained onto my brain, and will still be there when my DNA is collected by future interstellar travellers ( undocumented ). You MUST own this.

B007WPM4P0|5.0|This was very well done. I watched it before reading the book.  I wish it had followed the book more closely but then it would have been twice as long and I don't suppose there was enough budget for that.  I recomend it.
B0000CABBW|3.0|\\"The Whale Rider\\" is a movie that is one of great interest to people who are big into primal religions. This movie hits the nail on the head per say, when dealing with an local, and ancestral religion. \\"Pai\\" must overcome resistance as she tries to assume her destiny, as the leader of a tribe on the New Zealand coast -- is quickly absorbing. The film starts off with her mother and father in the Hospital where Pai and her brother are being born. But with birth complications Pai's brother dies and takes their mother with him.  This is upsetting to the grandfather because the tribe needs a boy to be born to learn the ways of a chief to lead them out of the darkness they are in. Pai lives with the family on the coast where she attends school and is constantly rejected by her grandfather. He loves her and treats her well at times but he tends to hate the fact that the boy did not survive the birth. When Pai's father comes back from Germany he. Is not pleased with how the grandfather is raising her and asked Pai to come live with him in Germany. She says that she will go and on the way to she stops him and says she cannot go. Her grandfather not pleased with the fact that she did not leave starts a school, where he will train the children to be leaders. Pai does not follow his command and he kicks her out of the school for not listening to his ridiculous commands. Pai asked her uncle to train her to fight with the pole all the kids are forced to learn how to do. Pai's grandfather has task for all the young boys to complete but they all always fall short. While Pai is with her uncle she completes all the task her grandfather ask of the boys. Then one night that her grandfather called to the whales she called also and they came, and got beached on the shore. The whole tribe tried and tried to get the whales back in the water but they were not able to do so. Pai went out to see the main whale and motivated it to get back in the water, and in doing so she gave up her life. The tribe rescued her drowning body and took her to the hospital where she was revived and her grandfather accepted that Pai a girl was the chosen one.
B007SGM084|3.0|These books were okay at best. The story line was very weak, especially in book 3. Book 2 was the best in terms of feeling like there was an actual plot. I'm glad I read them but I'm not sure why they earned all the media hype.
B0044WQHA2|5.0|Lucas made a movie filled with American archetypes that was followed by dozens of inferior imitators, which turned them into stereotypes. This was the one that started it all. It still seems fresh today. There are moments of pure corn, sure, but many too of sheer exhilaration - the joy of being a teenager on a night out.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I loved the 1st book of this series. It was incredibly unqiue and the story sucked you in! It was suspensful, funny, and heart breaking. The second book felt a lot like the first and then third was tough to get through but overall I really enjoyed the series!
0307949508|5.0|Although I did love the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, the second book in the series, Girl Who Played With Fire just blows it away! It was so awesome. You just can't stop reading this book. I'm so in love with Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />I loved the book because it had the amazing continuation of Lisbeth and Mikael, but it also had the new cop, detective outlook perspective.<br /><br />A journalist and a graduate student are working on a ground breaking story that will detail the workings of the underground sex trade/ trafficking in Sweden. Just as the journalist is about to publish his article in Millennium, and his girlfriend has just finished her thesis on Trafficking both are found (by none other than Mikeal) murdered. All signs point to Lisbeth. The entire city is on the hunt for her...<br /><br />The story unfolds brilliantly. You will not regret reading this book. Fiction at it's best

0739383280|5.0|This is Sophie Kinsella's best book so far. We listened to it on audio book and found that we couldn't stay out of the car. This is a delightful book that keeps interest up throughout. The heroine, Poppy, is one of the most endearing figures so far that Ms. Kinselle has dreamed up. This is a book which deserves to be made into a movie with George Clooney playing the role of the enigmatic Sam. We have never really gotten into the Shopaholic series and have brought Ms. Kinselle's books largely because they are witty and current. But this book puts this gifter writer into a different and more interesting level, far away from her dizzy characters in the shopaholic series. The turns and the twists in this plot will make you dizzy; but in a delightful way. Poppy slowly emerges as a heartwarming and forgiving female who finds herself falling into a love relationship just days before she herself is to wed. Not giving the story away, readers will have a hard time figuring out how she's going to handle this difficult situation. Let's just say, the book has a perfect ending which will leave you in tears. Buy and book and enjoy. I hope that Ms. Kinselle continues on this line of work.
1417823801|5.0|I look for writing that is alive, and this certainly is!  His descriptions and portrayals of soldiers and correspondents jump out of the page.  It was quite engaging.  It raises multiple moral questions regarding human nature and the nature of war in general.  I've also been going through the songs he quotes to get in the mind set of the time period.  Very cool.  I hope you like it too.  A classic!
B005PV81MS|1.0|Shaun of the Dead is one of my favourite movies, so I was excited when I saw the connection with this film. I was even more excited when I saw the ratings from professional reviewers. When the movie started I had some misgivings but I was willing to give it a chance. About a quarter of the way in I was wondering when the comedy was going to kick in. It never did.<br /><br />I don't mind the fact that the heroes in the film are thugs and hoodlums at the start. I don't mind that the aliens look like someone's tried to make their childhood soft-toy collection look scary. I understand this is a low-budget film and the acting and camera work are all fine. What I do mind is that the storyline goes nowhere, it's extremely cliched and predictable, there is no character growth, the one-liners are not funny, and the boys from the block are really just crude stereotypes at the end of the day. The only people I can imagine this film appealing to are teenagers who fantasize about living in the 'hood and being \\"ganstas\\", that's why I'm mystified that it got such high ratings.<br /><br />If you're looking for another Shaun of the Dead you'll be very disappointed.
B000I9YX06|4.0|Fun and fairly smart. Not exclusively action and in some ways prophetic, I expect. Good for thinkers and also laid back enough to satisfy dumb-fun too.
0451196716|5.0|I had to use a book for a summer reading project, and after horridly failing at reading other 20th century author books, my friend had suggested trying one of King's novels. I loved this book. I still do. Its nice because its a change from his stereotypically scary books. This one is deep and has a lot more put into it than i had thought a book about boys walking could ever hold. I highly recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|I love the way that James captures the essence of each character's personalities.  I feel like I know them personality.  Her use of adult vocabulary is awesome!  It intriguingly entices the reader and has you craving for more.  I highly recommend it!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app; helps me sleep.  The melodies on the free app was good enough.  I dont like the melodies on the purchase app; could have saved my self a couple bucks.
B007TML4EI|4.0|this game I kind of hard at some parts  but it is so fun and all the levels are so cool and fun
0316056863|1.0|While there a couple amusing pictures of Tina there is nothing really funny. The book is super boring and not worth to read. Thanks Tina for wasting my money and time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love everything this app offers. it really help me to control what to use in my phone. Definitely recommend.
0345803485|3.0|I do not understand why the characters have to \\"murmur\\"  and \\"cock their heads\\" all the time and the main character \\"flushes red\\" on almost every page of the book. Kind of annoying but still: it is entertaining and I could not put the book down!
030758836X|4.0|I am not a mystery reader but I really liked this book. It had many twists and turns, was very well written and had a some interesting psychological drama in there. Would recommend!
0316017930|5.0|You must read this book.<br /><br />In Outliers, Gladwell tells us that as a culture, we tend to believe that people who are successful, such as Mozart, Bill Gates, or the Beatles, are all `self-made men, and have risen to great success because that had some special power and other people did not. However, Gladwell takes a closer examination of the factors that contribute to high levels of success. For example, he examines the causes of why the majority of Canadian ice hockey players are born in the first few months of the calendar year. There is a major reason, and the short version is that if you are born on the wrong side of the date they use to group kids into age levels, you are likely to be a year younger than the other kids you are playing ice hockey with, and therefore smaller than them too. This of course, will make the kids on the \\"right side\\" of the date, look like bigger and better players- and they will be too. A year when you are 10, is  in fact, a huge advantage.<br /><br />Throughout his novel, Gladwell makes the point that there are many other factors to success. In fact, Gladwell, doesn't believe in `natural ability' -  he only believes in effort and time.<br /><br />I can tell I enjoyed this book because as soon as I finished it, I kept telling people about it, especially Mum, who I eventually got to read it (or at least watch an interview of Gladwell speaking about the book!)<br /><br />All in all, this book, tells us this: success depends on a multitude factors, especially cultural, that are mostly beyond our control - however, we can control how much effort and time we put into our goals, and this is what will ultimately make us successful.<br /><br />Read it!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Was good protection for the kindle fire. If I were to be keeping the kindle fire, which I hated, I would have kept this. I do recommend this to anyone that is buying the fire.
B007TML4EI|3.0|it is a very good game once you get it up on the kindle fire. it is hard but keeps my attention along time.
0788812408|1.0|I am doing the litter mermaid play, and i was excited to watch the movie, so i put it in the VHS player, and it wouldn't play, i tried putting in a different movie to see if it was the player but it was perfectly fine, so i hated this and i was mad and almost cried
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on every device I can, including in my Chrome account and love it.  I use it for my personal studies, preparation for teaching, and everyday inspiration.  thanks for making it free and keeping to add new features.  awesome app
1466401885|5.0|I love this book it has a great story!! I have read it 2 or 3 times and i am having a hard time finding other books i like as much as this one.
B007TMON8M|5.0|It's one off most complete physics &amp; construction games I've ever played. I gave it 5 stars, but I think it needs some sound effects.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|To be honest, keep your expectations at a minimum. The novel went through a chop shop. The descriptions from the book is accurate. But, read or do the audiobook first!
B007TML4EI|5.0|I just know one physics game better than this, and that game is &quot;simple physics&quot; again by &quot;JUNDROO&quot;.<br />I really love your games. waiting for more.
1401322786|5.0|I read this book in 2-3 days. I have read all of Mitch Alboms books and by far, this one is the best yet. The Time Keeper is worth the money and I doubt anyone will dislike this book.
0307279189|5.0|The book tells the story of the author's desire to run without pain.  Along the way we meet amazing people and learn of the greatest race ever run.  As a person new to trail running, I found the book both interesting and inspirational.  I do think it would be interesting to all people, even if they do not run.
159514188X|4.0|The story is very thought-provoking.  I think everyone at some point in their younger years, has experienced the feelings of isolation.  This book should be read by young people as an emotional reminder of how to treat others.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Very good except the movie experienced two annoying periods where nothing was playing but a countdown clock. :(.  Picture quality was good, and ease of ordering was also good. But pauses are very discouraging!
B003SJ6XMY|2.0|The plot in this movie centers around a former U.K. Prime Minister who's being accused of war crimes for supporting U.S. renditions and torture activities. He's also believed by some to be a U.S. puppet. The ghost writer is brought in to finish editing a book about the former P.M. after his predecessor mysteriously dies. An accidental find of old photos, a bit of probing here and there, and eventually we learn that the P.M. had been recruited by the CIA and was in fact a U.S. puppet. In between we encounter a few chase scenes and a tryst between the P.M.'s estranged wife and the writer.<br /><br />Extremely improbable, from the very beginning until the ending. Also quite slow-moving and boring.
0385343248|5.0|What a great book. The plot is masterly woven throughout the book, and the story line keeps the reader entertained. Even though Shogun is over 1100 pages long it does not drag at any point.<br /><br />Reading about Japan in 1600 AD is like going to another planet where people regularly eat meals of raw fish, soup, and pickled vegetables, live in houses that have paper-thin walls, where royalty paint their teeth black to make themselves beautiful, and men with razor-sharp swords cut you into tiny little bits and feed you to the dogs if you look at them the wrong way.<br /><br />The book's main characters are based on real historical figures, and the basic story line follows real events. Interesting details of the Japanese culture, habits, and philosophies during that time are sprinkled throughout the book. This is a fabulous book for those with an adventurous spirit.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Two, maybe three actual \\"a-ha\\" moments that were worth the read.  Otherwise, so much of the SAME thing over and over again.  Disappointed.
B004LWZW6K|4.0|PIRANHA 3DD is not a great \\"horror\\" movie but it's pretty funny..and ultimately a hoot to watch.  Director John Gulager obviously had his tongue deeply in cheek.  There's plenty of T&A, excessive gore, complete with cheesy effects...and David Hasselhoff's self-parody is priceless.  David Koechner, Ving Rhames, Clu Gulager. Gary Busey and Christopher Lloyd join in the fun.  Danielle Pannabaker, Matt Bush and Chris Zylka gamely play the straight roles.  It's a movie that entertains in spite of itself.
0785132619|5.0|If you liked the movie than you'll love the novel. Great artwork, funny dialogue, and fast paced action. I really recomend this one, I bought it about 6 months ago and I still re-read it every once and a while. Classic.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Love this puzzle game...keeps me entertained and is a good brain work out. I never want to put it down!
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is a great game that the entire family will enjoy. I like the way it gets more and more challenging with each new level.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|The game worked great for a while the night after I loaded it, and I really enjoyed it, but the next day it wouldn't load at all and still won't.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I never finished this book and have no intention to. Just do not see what is so good. Awful book!
B00009RDG9|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro deliver an exceptional performance in this fast-paced action thriller.  The movie rarely slows with constant fight scenes and amazing stunts.  The final battle is epic and just a bit unrealistic but still keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I found the knife fighting to be incredible and very exciting.  I highly recommend The Hunted.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Gives accurate information in a quick view format.  Free app but does not act like one....worth the download and works great for my kindle fire!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, and is surprisingly detailed for a mobile game! The idea and mechanics are streamlined and balanced well, and there are a lot of complex tactics to be found, but the game is simple enough that anyone can get into it.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|Having already seen the film in the theater, I wanted to view again. And own.  Even better the second time around.  A definitely overlooked film.  Excellent soundtrack.
B008KOMMTA|5.0|There's no need to go on about the film and its presentation, its top shelf, but the Amazon Exclusive pack (and any of its variants Japanese, UK etc..) is very well done. This is what an Amazon Exclusive should strive to be, I hope its taken to heart as this is a great way to be a VAR.<br /><br />Nuff' said...
B007KZY1YY|4.0|this is a graphic and explicit but enjoyable read, definately for those women who are bored with their sex lives
B008IJTFYW|5.0|i love that you can make your own relaxation combinations.. the sound is very good with lots of choices! my fave is wind, wind chimes and flute or even a little rain thrown in :)  the best of its kind! a must to have :)<br /><br />amy
B008BIN9EW|5.0|A very well made RTS. It is not perfect, but it is satisfactory. The multiplayer can get intense with up to 4 players, and the campaign has good depth and length, although slightly repetitive.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is a must if you use Pinterest regularly. I was very excited to download and use. I would definitely recommend to others.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|good movie - characters are well played and keeps the story moving.  This is the 3rd time I've seen the movie and find it still interesting (sad) but interesting.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|This cd has great collaboration with R&B artists and hip hop artists with Glasper on the keys doing what he does!!! I saw R Glasper twice in Wash DC & once in NYC 2012 and never disappointed!
030758836X|2.0|I began this book with enthusiasm and an open mind. The beginning was well written and the plot plausable, but it was all downhill after that. The characters were just plain unbelievable as was the plot. I felt more disappointed and frustrated the further I read and to tell the truth I was glad it ended so I could get stuck into a book that had some grist and depth to it. Sorry but this is a shallow forgettable novel. If you want to read a brilliant psychological thriller I suggest you try The Summer Of Katya by Trevanian.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Having now also read the books this show is nothing short of a perfect representation of these stories! Characters you can love and hate in th same episode and when closing credits hit you are wanting more!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I love this album so much! My favorite songs are \\"Kill Your Heroes\\" and \\"Sail\\". It is also perfectly priced too!
0802473164|5.0|I bought this to go along with the original book. It's a great read for all husbands! I highly recommend it!
B005AKFXZW|4.0|Fabulous story, full of surprises and very well written. Well worth the read,different and almost spell binding.Lots of characters whom are all interesting and unique.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love the case! I made sure it was water proof before I put my phone in the case and no water at all was inside.  I like how its not as thick as an otter box.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As a mother of a child who passed away of a congenital heart defect, I was able to relate to this author's portrayal of so many familiar emotions and the truth he portrayed as families face an inevitable end.
0486295559|2.0|i think this is the worst of the austen novels for me,alot of people choose this novel. as their favorite, my favorite,1-emma,2-mansfield park,3-northanger abbey 4-sense amd sensibilty, 5-pride and predjudice 6-perssuation ,. i think this novel is dry,and not alot happens.although i am still an austen fan, this one is my least favorite.so i recommend, if you have never read an austen novel, please do not start with this one, i would start with her best known novels , sense and sensibilty or pride and predjudice and save persuaition for last. also keep in mind her novels are about middle-class or upper middle class girls looking for marriage.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I actually really like this app and it allows me to keep videos for my son to watch.  One major flaw is that two of the last three updates have wiped out all of my saved files.  It sucks to have to find and download it all again. Can this be corrected? If so,  I could give it 5 stars.
0316044938|1.0|I will give my unpopular opinion but this is how i really felt about this book. i HATED it if i could give it zero stars i would. I have read many books and this is one of the very few books i couldnt finish. It was poorly written and the characters were unrealistic and bland. The story really wasnt that great either dont belive all the hype you hear about this book its not all what it is cracked up to be.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I'm pretty conservative when it comes to what I let my kids watch. Most Disney movies have either too many behaviors I dont want my kids copying, or too many tense / frightening and overall adult-themed scenes.<br /><br />This film was whimsical and fun, the music was excellent and heart-warming, and like all good movies, the main character experiences redemption in the end. It's a movie I plan to buy and own and won't mind watching dozens of times with my children.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great writing, suspenseful plot, good character development. I really enjoyed this book! Didn't want to put it down. Love the different point of view switch ups used - really gets you into the story.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Perfect movie for when you just want to relax and not worry about a thing. It's very funny and cute!  I do recommend.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is a must read!  Travis is my kind of guy. I hesitated at first but all the great reviews are well deserved!
0345803485|1.0|where is my book at i have not got it so where my money at im sick of this bs it show it got here on friday rite where is it then
B006QVRVJK|4.0|I though this was one of those slasher movies until I saw the names of the stars. This is actually very similar to the classic [[ASIN:B000I2JDEY Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. All of the action takes place during one afternoon after a schoolyard fight between two boys leads to a meeting between both sets of parents to settle the tiff. Very different socially, the two couples at first perform the usual polite dance of parents everywhere, trying to remain polite and civil. A bottle of single-malt scotch, and some expensive cigars, lead to a loosening of social norms and shifting alliances among the group. I found this to be among the most intelligent films that I have seen in quite some time, especially since it is not an \\"art film\\" and is readily accessible to a mass audience. This is like attending a well done one act play right in your living room.
B007RP4D5Y|4.0|I've been a Pat Metheny fan for many many years.  I only just noticed this new release, and was very impressed with the lineup.  I love Chris Potter's work - especially with his Underground band (Follow the Red Line is IMO the best jazz album since 2000), and Sanchez has been an amazing addition to PMG for a while now.  I remember seeing the group live during the Way Up tour and being blown away by Sanchez on the drums.  In fact his solos are what I remember most from that wonderful show.  Ben Williams is obviously a newcomer, but keeps up with these seasoned vets admirably and adds some much needed fresh sounds to the proceedings.<br /><br />All that said, the album disappointed me slightly, which is a complaint I've had about all of Metheny's albums since The Way Up.  I feel like none of his work since has truly pushed boundaries the way that album did.<br /><br />Here, with Metheny assembling such a fresh and outstanding group, I was curious what kind of sound Metheny would go for (as among modern jazz artists few have AS MANY voices as Pat).  Here I feel like he recycles a lot of ideas that are past their prime.  We have an obligatory track with his synth guitar.  We have an intro to another track with Pat's infamous 40-string or whatever guitar.  These touches feel a little too familiar and played out for me.<br /><br />That said, the group is outstanding, and if I wasn't such a huge fan of the two headliners here, this would probably be a five star album.  But I honestly hoped for something a little more forward thinking from a Metheny/Potter date.  More of that Underground sound and less Speaking of Now-era Metheny.  But the group here is great, and if you're a fan of any of these guys you'll enjoy listening to this album.  But I don't think it will be one you want to play over and over again.  Maybe I will have a change of heart after repeated listens.
B0063IH60K|5.0|LOVE THE OPTIONS.  YOU CAN WIN EVERYTIME! I ALSO LOVE AMAZON FOR PRICES AND AVAILABILITY. THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really enoyed this book, enough so that I purchased the 2nd book in the trilogy. Deborah Harkness is an amazing historian, which makes the book so rich, but the character devlopment, interactions with each other and with family, was wonderful. I'd highly recommend it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Once I started reading this trilogy I couldn't put it down. It wasn't what I expected, it was much more. Characters are quickly developed and interesting. Buy it you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B006H5120E|5.0|This is for the 4 disc 3D edition:<br /><br />My shipment arrived yesterday (Saturday), before street date (thanks, Amazon!).<br /><br />I have to admit that I wasn't really impressed with the 3D when I saw this in the theater, but I can honestly (and thankfully) say that it is MUCH better on my 3D TV than when I saw it in the theater.<br /><br />The image quality is crystatl clear, and the 3D adds a wonderful depth that, again, I did not see in the theater. I wonder if the theater that I saw it in did not have the proper setup or equipment? In any event, I am thrilled that I got the 3D version of this movie. The restoration/cleanup is fantastic, and the sound is equally dazzling.<br /><br />This set does come with 2 discs for the 3D version of the film. The 3rd disc is the regular 2D version (including audio commentaries), and the 4th disc contains all the bonus features. The bonus content includes 2 new documentaries, the first being \\"Reflections on Titanic\\", which includes new interviews with James Cameron, Kate Winslet, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates and others. Leonardo DiCaprio is not featured in any of the new interviews but is seen in some of the older footage. The 2nd new documentary is \\"Titanic: The Final Word\\", which is a very interesting and informative re-examination of the sinking. Both of these documentaries run about 90 min or so each.<br /><br />Also in the bonus materials are trailers, tv spots, music video (of course), 30 deleted scenes, 60 behind the scenes featurettes (none running over a couple of minutes), a few \\"Titanic\\" parodies, some footage shot by crew members (some is funny, some leaves you scratching your head), and some other archival features from the Special Edition DVD set from a few years back.<br /><br />This is DEFINITELY worth the upgrade from the previous DVD releases!<br /><br />EDIT: Also includes code for digital copy.
1475143389|5.0|I have been weightlifting since about my sophomore year of high school (now a Senior in college), and I have spent entirely too much time reading websites about lifting.  This book is the simplest book to get a really good understanding on everything a new lifter needs to know.  He is very knowledgeable and this book makes all the research I did feel like a waste of time.  I highly recommend this book and even gave it to my brother who is new to lifting.  The most outstanding part of this is that you can talk to him and get his honest opinion.  I emailed him a couple of questions and he responded back in less than 3 days.
0061928356|5.0|I am usually wary of reading books that I don't think I could relate to. This book was totally out of my comfort zone - it covered a lot about a culture entirely new to me and about issues that do not pertain me as I am too young. But this book hit home. I became truly engaged, so engaged that I shed a few tears when it ended. It felt so genuine throughout, I can't recall a time in the past few months where I was this connected to the book - it was as if I was reading a nonfiction piece on someone really close to me. It was unbelievably well written even though it captures so many different points of view on life. It talks about life in three different points of view - a struggling family in India, a well-off family in India, and a new family in America with ties to India. All of the three come together so beautifully. It teaches us some deep lessons about family ties and the importance of knowing where we come from as well as appreciating what we have. I SO SO recommend you read this book.<br /><br />For more book reviews + food stuff, check out my blog :)
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Thoughtful Reading for everyone who lead à creative life. Good for creating à distance to the processes that make things happen. à bit on the short side though. I would have liked to see à fre deeper interviews with creative folk. Its à nice read though and i'm sure i'll keep thoughts from it for à long time ahead.
B007X4ECMI|2.0|The gleefully bad Lockout is determined to have a retro look and feel. The film aspires to be a politically incorrect and formulaic B-movie. There is no need to rack your brain over its plot holes. The simple story takes place in the future, when almost everything is dimly lit. While by no means a good film, Lockout is still somewhat entertaining.<br /><br />While investigating the conditions of a space prison (yes, a prison in space), the president's daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) finds herself in the middle of a breakout. Officials send \\"Snow\\" (Guy Pearce), who is on his way to jail or worse after being framed for murder. At least one convict (Joseph Gilgun, clearly having a good time) is inexplicably obsessed with Emilie after spending a few minutes talking to her. Vincent Regan adds a little gravitas as the criminal ringleader Alex, but he, like the rest of these characters, is undeveloped.<br /><br />Predictably, Snow and Emilie clash. Snow is sarcastic and tough as nails, as well as disrespectful and whiny. He is not particularly likable, but he is funny and has an edge. In the face of certain death, Emilie finds it strangely necessary to try to get to know him. Her character doesn't make sense, but at least she shows a little gumption and compassion. (Grace's expressions are somewhat puzzling, though, since she looks as though she's trying not to laugh through most of the film. Or perhaps she's just unable to hide her attraction to Snow?)<br /><br />Snow treats her pretty roughly in the name of getting in and out, but their tension is one of the best things about the movie. Much of the acting is quite bad, including Peter Stormare's as the man who insists Snow's guilty. Lennie James is decent as a coworker supposedly on Snow's side, though he, along with everyone else, doesn't really seem to care about the potential deaths of hundreds. The end appears to be a half-baked afterthought, but a lot here is. Sitll, if you want to watch a movie late at night that doesn't take itself too seriously, Lockout isn't necessarily a bad choice.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|I did not find docs to go full version helpful to me. Most of my documents were done in wordperfect format and docs to go is requesting application to open my documents. I feel that I spent $ 14:95 for nothing.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I've never read any of SK's novels before, but this novel was a wonderful read! Started off a little slow, but I understand he was building the story. Once Jake gets to Maine via rabbit hole, my interest quickly picked up.  I love the rhetorical question you find yourself asking: what if we could go back and change history? What would be the outcome?
B0084IG7KC|4.0|As for the movie, an excellent adaptation of the book. Although I thought it a bit short. It definitely captures the uneasiness and anxiety in the early stages of the first book.<br /><br />One big problem... The silly digital copy via Ultra-Violet. Far more complicated than it needs to be and if you don't have a hyper fast internet connection, forget it. I'll never use it.
0385344228|5.0|I read about 2 to 3 books a week and I can say that this is the only book I have ever read that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  It was not a quick read for me but rather something to savor.  The ending of the book is something that I didn't even come close to expecting and in fact had to read again because I couldn't believe it.  It is one book that I would read again and again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is sweet<br />I'm addicted!<br />Download and buy counterfeiting piece<br />The game is already awesome as is though<br /><br />You will love it
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Always a favorite! One of the best 80s movies out there!! Next time, I'm actually BUYING the dvd, since I only have it on VHS without a VHS player lol.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I read all of Nicholas Sparks' early books, even the one about his trip with his brother.<br />I especially enjoyed The Notebook and The Guardian. However, I grew weary of the string of<br />sad endings in his books. He paints beautiful characters that you really connect with, but<br />they never fare well in the end. After the ending of Dear John, I vowed that I would not read<br />any more of his books. However, after reading the clip for The Best of Me, I gave it one last<br />try. In my opinion, this one had the most predictable, riduculous ending of them all. It is the<br />last one I will read.
0312641893|5.0|When you re-imagine a classic fairytale there are two big concerns.  One concern is that the new story won't be as good as the original.  And the second concern is that the author must make the reader compelled to flip through the pages of a story they already know the ending of.  Cinder has succeeded to overcome both of these obstacles.  By being so different from the original that it is challenging to even compare the two, the author throws us off the rails of our expectations and onto an entirely new ship (or space ship).  The author also altered enough of the story that you don't even care if you know the end.  Yes, Cinder will marry the prince and live happily ever after.  But we no longer know how this will happen.  It's extremely fun.  There are enough reviews of the plot itself that I needn't bore you with summaries.  Just know this story starts out a little \\"out there\\" but pulls you in so quickly that by the time you're finished, you hardly remember this was supposed to be a fairytale revisited.  It's a fairytale makeover, extreme style.  Enjoy it!  There are few YA novels this unique.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked this book. Although there are some things that Ana does and says repeatedly and that can be annoying. Other than that pet peeve I liked the book overall. Liked it so much that I went ahead and purchased the next 2 books, because I just had to know what would happen next.<br />I do not consider this a romance series, it is way beyond that. There is ALOT of sexual themes in this book and if that is not your thing, do not read this book. The author does well with the scenery and descriptions that I can picture it well in my head.<br /><br />******Semi Spoilers********<br />I do like Ana, because she is smart, funny yet she also has flaws, she is not perfect. And she struggles with her feelings for Christian and I can totally relate to that.<br />I like Christian even though he is VERY controlling, arrogant yet Ana brings some other feelings out of him that he himself struggles with and I like that. The ending of this book is not a happily ever after and that was fine for me. Because thats what lures you into purchasing the next book.<br /><br />Im excited to see/read what the future holds for these two.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I loved the movie!  I thought it was compelling and very well done.  However, I don't think the plot development was adequate for those who have not read the book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Simply worth the time to read. Similar to Patrick Rothfuss, Simon Green, Brandon Sanderson & Brent Weeks epic tales. Single story line with amazing detail.
B0055SWM08|5.0|quell is challenging and fun. very relaxing. i also enjoy the soundtrack. some levels are easy but i like being able to replay a level to better my score.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|Who the heck is giving this a 4 or 5 star review? I've liked some of FA's previous albums, and \\"When the Pawn\\" was probably one of my favorite late 90s albums. But this is just unlistenable.The angry pain poetry is still there, but where is the music? All I'm saying is, don't buy this based on your perceptions of her previous work -- listen to some samples to make sure you're going to be able to stand to listening to 42 minutes of this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I get stuck playing it for hours!  I  recommend it to everyone! Soo much fun. I am so happy they came out with kindel edition
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love it! no complaints....I think its a great app and it works perfectly on my kindle fire, I haven't had any issues at all.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A casual friend recommended this book and because I don't know her very well, I wasn't sure about her literary taste.  She really seemed to like the book, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I found that the first half was ok.  I enjoyed the thoughts and thought-processes of each character and the back-and-forth chapters made it a quick read.  Once I hit the middle of the book, I couldn't put it down and enjoyed the psychological edge to the whole thing. I'll be ordering another Gillian Flynn book soon.
B008VBYN80|5.0|it great fun all the time in car train any where its great I love it great game makes me happy
B008JGSM6G|4.0|started playing on a co-workers device, had to get for myself. challenging enough to make it interesting. good way to pass time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this series with all of its passion and adventure. Personally I wish there were more books to the series. I couldn't put the book down! It was pulling me in, just in the first few pages.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Based on the sci-fi book by Edward Rice Burroughs, John Carter is the movie rendition of the book. The book for what its worth was decently written for the era (1930's) and with sci-fi at the time it was short and not highly descriptive or engaging in character development...which may be why John Carter is the way he is - (he was written that way). The movie is a fun Disney adventure and kicks off the John Carter of Mars series (of which there are 12 books or so). Disney did a good job overall bringing a so-so book to a fun movie with some great special effects and an epic environment on Mars...The 3D however was not so great and it's a shame that they took the effort to make the movie in 3D because it was a disaster from that stand-point. Again a fun adventure that surpasses expectations (based on the story it was based on). Don't expect a lot from the 3D aspect.
0307388921|5.0|Once again, I find myself having avoided an author I've been told many times I would instantly love because I have a deathly fear of hype. A fear which I'm going to have to get over because turns out the hype is usually for a good reason.<br /><br />I don't even know where to begin with this book. The powerful theme of displacement and lack of identity? The low standards for heroism in America? The idea of addiction, and how it invades and destroys the mind and will even if the addiction isn't an actual substance? Mental illness and its affect on family? Self-loathing?<br /><br />There's no end to the things I could talk about in this book; both thematically and stylistically. It's brilliantly executed to make you want to simultaneously laugh, sob, and throw up. The story breaks your heart and makes you sick, and flips back and forth between the two so often you don't know whether you're laughing at something horrible or crying at something hilarious. It twists your emotions in a way I've never experienced in a book before.<br /><br />Maybe my favorite part though was the graphic sexual language used to describe the main character's sex addiction. Never is sex described as something beautiful, or meaningful, or even satisfying. It's the purest form of addiction-all consuming and completely purposeless. He has sex because he has to. In today's culture sex in literature has become so romanticized it's almost sickening. While this book has been around for a while, it's refreshing to read something that makes you uncomfortably aroused, not nauseated in its \\"sweeping romantic majesty\\".
B0081SRJSY|4.0|If you are a fan of the board-tile game the app-game is a very natural transition and allows the user to play against computer AI's or local opponents. The game includes the base tiles from the original game as well as the river 2 tiles for a game variant. Scoring options allow for the old-school scoring of castles, but I think they may have missed the scoring accuracy for the farms (not a big deal, but worth noting). Graphics and UI are really nice and the game has endless replayability. It also has some nice and challenging accomplishments/achievements. A nice game for a decent price-point, however it would take the game to a new level by opening up for online or server based play. Would also like to see some updates for expansions/updates for more tiles.
B0001AUAU4|5.0|This album has plenty of songs on it that all convey some type of emotion. I love the lyrics, the moods, and the meaning for each song. This is truly a beautiful album that anyone who enjoys French music should own.
B008M34IJG|4.0|It's a space action movie! All the critical elements are there - space and action! Acting is overall decent and while it wasn't a blockbuster in the theaters, it is worth the rental and time to watch. A very enjoyable cut into a hostage rescue movie that takes place on a super-max penitentary (in orbit! - which funny enough doesn't cost the tax payers anything to maintain). Again, not a blockbuster, but I'd watch it again it was fun for the genre and seemed to have enough budget to not skimp on the sets or special effects.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|After watching Jaycee's interview with Diane Sawyer, I had to get the book and read it.  How she survived is amazing.  A very easy and heart wrenching read. I purchased this book for my Kindle.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app!!!  It improved all the glitches that I was experiencing on Pinterest without the app!!!  I'm enjoying Pinterest on my Kindle Fire as well as I do on my laptop!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An amazing end to the trilogy. I do however wish they would have elaborated on what happened to Gale, his parents, her mom, Johanna, Finniks wife, and Haymitch to name a few. The ending was sad but happy as well.
B007JRU4N0|5.0|Not a big fan of Gorge Clooney, but the movie was well directed and a lot of the content struck close to home. Overall very surprised how much i liked this movie.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Solid advice.  A quick and easy read that will save you time and money.  It will also help you avoid looking like an idiot in the gym.  Lots of trainers have their clients doing all kinds of weird things to get into shape.  This book focuses on core exercises that work.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I purchased One Direction. The music was awesome and enjoy listening it everyday. Love One Direction I can't wait for their next album. Thank Amazon for the great service.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love this show I have watch since the start. I own seasons 1-3 and can't hardly wait for season 4.  I rush home on Monday nights waiting to watch it I even shut off my phone while it is on. I tip my hat to the writers as well as all the actors that protray their writings.  Well done one and all!!! Keep them coming...a true fan!!!  LadyRosemarie.
B007TML4EI|2.0|The game seems good, but can't run on my HTC sensation. Every time I open it, it just launch and immediately closed itself.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story line keeps your interest but all their text messages and all their<br />sex scenes get old after awhile.  If I read where she \\"groans\\" one more time,<br />I think I will vomit.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|The book was chosen by my book club.  I read one that was very similar, the same theme which was a kidnapping of a young girl who was used by the perpetrator for several years.  I experienced this book as boring and somewhat depressing.  I can't recommend it.
0345347951|5.0|I have read half a dozen books by Clarke in the last few months, spanning from \\"Prelude to Space\\" (1947) to \\"Firstborn\\" (2008), and for my money \\"Childhoods End\\" is the stand out among the bunch! Even though it was written in 1953 it is still fresh and vivid in it's portayal of events leading to mankinds next evolutionary step. And it's a page turner too!<br /><br />Also, as a side affect reading \\"Childhood's End\\", I felt that I finally, fully, understood \\"2001 a Space Odyssey\\", which deals with similar themes. It's well worth the effort. FYI, I also enjoyed \\"Song's of Distant Earth\\" which was a good read. (I thought \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" was a bit overrated).
B0000258CK|4.0|I bought the CD version of this so I could add it to my collection of CD's and not have to worry about digital rights for playing it. When reasonable I enjoy having the CD version. The songs on this CD are great, the original classics you know and love. Unfortunately the CD quality isn't up to what we would consider top class for a digital version at this point. It's aged, needs to be cleaned up and does not have the fidelity I would expect from a modern recording. This is something that could be cleaned up and a new CD put out. Until that happens, this is a about the best version of the songs.<br /><br />***Update: looking at the Amazon listing, now there are many versions of this CD to choose from, including versions that have been remastered in the last few years. It looks like my concerns have been addressed, look at each CD option carefully to assure you get one with the version and clarity of the songs you prefer. There are also versions with multiple discs and extra songs now.  Look for the remastered version when you make your purchase.<br /><br />4 stars, great songs, but the digital versions aren't as crisp as I would like.
B007RI56NY|5.0|if you love train, this is one of the best yet!  all of the songs are great - don't want to skip any of them
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie could not capture everything that was in the book. Too much going on. However, it did capture the essence of the book and followed it pretty closely. I don't think the movie showed the really bad condition Katniss was in towards the end of the games nor does it really explain the danger they were in after the games form the Capital. But over all, great movie. I've watched it twice since I received it and listened to all extras.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Awesome read. I was in the cross-hairs from beginning to end. This book promises to bring out the patriot in you. Thank you Chris for your unwavering support of the Red, White and Blue!
B005EGXTHG|4.0|I thought the ending of the last book was boring.  Both of the main characters drifted together with little romance, or energy while Gale was left out.  Ok I get why she didn't pick him but just leaving him hanging in the new frontier didn't seem real.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|You need to read this book.  It is easy to understand and practice, and it actually works.  Seriously, just read this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. I spend lots of time using this, and one of these days I'll actually get around to completing some of the projects I've pinned!
B002APU580|4.0|All of the characters that were young seemed more immature than how Jane Austin portrayed them in the original story.  My favorite Pride & Prejudice was done by A&E several years ago which I purchased from Amazon.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|The bad.<br />Starting off at the same intro is a bit of bummer.  With nothing to clear \\"levels\\" its kind of boring.<br /><br />The good.<br />Character is fun to mod.  Obtaining the vehicles is great.  Gadgets are fun.  The slot machine is hilarious.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Plain and simple this is one if the best games around. I enjoyed the first game they made immensely and this was just as wonderful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was just as good as the other two in the series. The ending did seem a little rushed but it was still a good book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Easy fun that does not require at-length attention spans.  While it may require extreme concentration to figure out some of the levels, each level is relatively short so a great game to occupy short free times.  Or if you have the time, just continue through the different levels & see how many you can get with perfect moves & continue through the several different levels of varying difficulties.  I would definitely recommend.<br />(Side Note: I have TrendMicro security on my Kindle & the virus scan for this app came up clean.)
B0000033IR|5.0|Aretha Franklin<br /><br />Aretha: Lady Soul<br />(Atlantic/Rhino CD w/bonus cuts)<br /><br />This Atlantic/Rhino CD is the one to get because it includes (in its first bonus track) the full-length version of \\"Chain of Fools\\"!  The edited album version (track #1 here) is very good, but when the unedited version (track #11 here) was first released, it was a tremendous revelation and made the song even more compelling and popular.  It would have been a disaster if Rhino had not included that unedited track to this CD and Rhino deserves a lot of praise for having the common sense to include it.<br /><br />As to the original Lady Soul album, it is another Aretha Franklin classic.  It may not be quite as powerful as her \\"I Never Loved...\\" album, but it is a true companion to that album.  That being said, this is a glorious album in its own right and is well deserving of a Five Star rating.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its just like the game I played when I was a kid. my kids love it just as much as I loved the game.
B0000033IS|5.0|Aretha Franklin<br /><br />I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You<br />(Atlantic/Rhino CD)<br /><br />This is a solid irrefutable Classic, one of the greatest releases of all time.<br /><br />This Atlantic/Rhino CD adds three cuts: stereo versions of Respect, I never loved..., and Do right.<br /><br />Please read David W. Coleman's review (on this page) as I can add nothing more to it.<br /><br />This CD deserves a Sixth Star.
B008BM9L72|5.0|As soon as you start reading, it is extremely difficult to put it down.  Sort of addictive!  It might be gruesome to the most women, but keep on reading and you will realise that it is very gripping!  It sweeps you away to a different world!
1936608898|5.0|I started following Dallas and Melissa's Whole9 blog early in 2012.  They present a ton of great nutritional information using an accessible, no-nonsense, witty, and sometimes stern approach.  I purchased a copy of their Whole30 Success Guide eBook and tackled the Whole30 this past spring.  I had been eating paleo for close to a year with good results before taking on the challenge so I was skeptical I would see much improvement.  The added focus on food choices, food quality and mindful eating habits made a huge difference for me.  The process helped me learn and re-learn basic nutritional and health concepts that are easy to blow off or take for granted.  Many times its the little things that add up to make noticeable change.<br /><br />It Starts With Food didn't come out until after I finished my Whole30, but I pre-ordered it because I felt strongly about the positive change their Whole30 protocol provided me.  I found ISWF easy to read, very accessible, and spot on when discussing the basics of nutrition, digestion, key hormones, emotional aspects of eating, and potential issues people can have with certain foods.  The recipes and meal plans are great additions to anyone's repertoire.  Many other nutrition and diet books that I've read are some combination of dry, boring, complex, or uninspiring.  With It Starts With Food, you will get none of that.  It's a joy to read, and the Whole30 is a great nutritional reset to get you started down the path to better health.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|We had Tivo'd Jason's concert at Farm Aid last year and loved it. This CD had many of the same songs, in same arrangements we had heard of Farm Aid. Haven't watched the DVD yet, but I'm sure we'll love it too!
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is a movie that show you some of the reality of what people go because bad choices by the church and some some people that use their power to justify crimes agains inocent people. Also beatiful music score and places that the movie shows.
0307592731|5.0|I found out about this book in my local newspaper's Sunday edition which shares some book reviews, comments, etc. I was familiar with the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) as I lived in Seattle, and knew people who had hiked some portions of it.<br />Being a somewhat avid hiker myself, I found reading about this inexperienced (and somewhat \\"clueless\\", yet sweet) young gal hiking the trail for both spiritual and physical reasons completely enthralling.<br />Cheryl's writing style captured me - I wanted to know her whole story - a very interesting (and at times heart-breaking) life, it was interspersed in the pages very well - kept my attention.<br />There were many times, (like her first try-on of the backpack) that I could just \\"see\\" it happening, and laughed out loud.<br />An engaging, funny, inspirational story.  I highly recommend it!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Well you sure can't read this one without reading the first book. It's a good read like the last book but not as exciting. I don't see it any better or any worse then the first. They are very easy reading is what I like about the books.
B0070B42M4|4.0|I thought the book was very interesting and different I am really excited to see how it translates to the screen.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I've heard about this series, so I decided to buy it, without ever watching an episode.  I was hooked after the first episode!  Bryan is especially good as Walter White, a struggling chemist, who just needs a break in life.  His sidekick, Aaron Paul, does a great job as Jesse White, a young thug who is sort of clueless, yet has street smarts.  They balance each other out.  Very interesting concept for a show and excellent execution.  The whole cast is good.  Buy it or watch it, you won't be disappointed.  I watched the first season in a day.  I bought the second season and watched the day I bought it also.  I'm buying all seasons of this show.  I love it!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|Addictive!!!  Holy cow!  Couldn't put it down.  I did only give it four stars because the sex scenes every second page get distracting to the story after awhile.  I do definitely recommend this collection!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|FUNNY MY GRANDSON WATCHED IT 10 TIMES IT WAS A GREAT HIT  I PERSONALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE SLOW AT THE END
B005ILYWN2|1.0|This wouldn't have been a bad movie, if I could of understood it. Being in another language where you have to read the whole movie was a bummer. It would have been nice if you would have said it was not in English.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use. Lots of great ideas and useful tips! I am addicted to Pinterest! I use this app everyday!
B000P5FH3K|3.0|My feeling after watching this movie, is the classical watch-the-movie-after-reading-the-book conclusion, which is a certain degree of disappointment. The movie skips important details from the book that are important to get under the skin of the characters, and the plot for that matter. On the other hand, after having read the book, I was able to place certain aspects of the movie into a larger context, thereby grasping more of the plot than I would have. I feel my recommendation is a bit of Catch 22-situation; If you have read the book and watch the movie, you will be disappointed by the movie, if you don't read the book first, you will probably miss parts of the plot, and certainly the \\"mood\\" of the characters.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|This is one of the best written shows I have watched. It's pretty much my guilty pleasure but an amazing one. Kurt Sutter has done such a great job through the years with the story of SAMCRO. I hope many more people enjoy this show and it's around for much longer.
B008COD5OO|3.0|Not what I was expecting....it was better!  Definitely a movie I would watch again.  I don't think it's the quality of Old School or Talledega Nights but it is up there for its era
B008D28HYS|4.0|This is a really neat little game.  I love this type of puzzle in general and have an entire book of black and white ones, so having quick access to fun picross puzzles in color is really awesome.  The only thing I dislike about it is that sometimes I will tap the screen to zoom and it will register as filling in a square, or I try to tap and drag but the game will fill in the wrong direction or not register at all.  These are likely just because of me pressing wrong, but it still gets a little annoying from time to time.  Overall the game is great though, with a good variety of pictures and puzzles.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes logic puzzles or sudoku puzzles.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I have to admit when I saw the outside of the box I was concerned about the condition of the CD's. They work perfectly. I  want to get all ten seasons of Smallville but not break the bank doing so. Now I can and will.
B001JIAK66|4.0|I remember when I first saw this at the movies & how much I loved it so I was excited to see it added for purchase and not just a rental. Its a fun movie to watch with great humor and really good action scenes as well! Get this if you want to watch something that's actually worth your time:)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|it's a great game.  very relaxing and fun.  my wife is also addicted to it.  it takes no time to learn and master it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was so impressed with these three books.  Something entirely different than anything else I have ever read.  Yes, very sexual but in a wonderful way.  Not a smutty way.  Something you will not be able to skim through.  This writer is amazing.  Am waiting for his next book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an excellent book. It is good for any age. I think it is very good for the \\"young adult\\" audience since it shows a young woman being strong and controlling her own future rather than allowing events to overtake her. I may be \\"all grown up\\" but I would love to be like Katnis. I look forward to reading the other 2 books in spite of my son's opinion of the books.<br /><br />It is obvious in reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" that this is a society where a privileged few get the best of the food and other needs of life. This book shows Katnis becoming aware of this inequality. I am looking forward to how Katnis and her friend Peeta will deal with the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have-nots\\".
B0002B15XI|4.0|Funny, and very entertaining...Knew it was o ld hat from the start, but worth washing every so often.  Watch again and laugh!
0553801473|1.0|The first two books were interesting. In the third book he killed off a lot of the main characters, then brought in new characters. This made the fourth book unbearably boaring! In the 5th book he lost the plot completely!!! He's clearly just milking it! Sooooo many loose threads and no going forward with anything. Im done with it!! He won't be able to write a good ending with the mess he's made now!!!<br />It could have been so good, but he messed it up completely!
B00834R580|5.0|Sherlock is a great show, and the quality on this episode was good.  However, I wish it wasn't so expensive :(
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Immedietely after it's debut release onto the Amazon Market almost a year one ago, I've read the numerous reviews that are riddled with complaints about the apps poor performance right up until the beginning of this month. Reports of devices unexpectedly Freeze/Lock up or Shut Down during game play or,having the app suddenly Force Close in mid-game; unprovoked.<br /><br />But...no matter how incredibly annoying these issues were? Many customers, myself included, DID NOT Delete but KEPT this Mahjong Deluxe HD! Some, even continued to play the game whenever or however long the app did cooperate. This says a lot about the game! Because, regardless of it's flaws, some were willing to ignore it simply due to the fact that this is a beautiful Mahjong game! But hankfully, we no longer need to ignore the flaws! We can finally enjoy this game because just this week, after almost a year of customer complaints, this app has been updated with a fix for those issues!<br /><br />With that being said, here is my review for Mahjong Deluxe HD:<br /><br />Mahjong Deluxe HD has used gorgeous high definition for it's graphics making the designs that were used visually &quot;pop&quot; with vivid colors &amp; amazing clarity. This is especially noticeable on the Kindle Fire &amp; two other tablets I own. Although, it still look good on a mobile phone, as well. However, there is NO option to Zoom, therefore, some game layouts will be more difficult to see than others.<br /><br />The audio quality sounds good on the Kindle Fire. Not so much on my Samsung Galaxy III. The music chosen is okay but, it continually loops, causing it to become annoying, if not irritating (for me). Thankfully,there is an option in the Menu to turn sound down or off. I'm thinking if the developer were to add several more audio tracks (5-7) that shuffled continuously in a loop rather than just the same one, it would be much more relaxing.  They would have to br somewhat different in tempo but not so far off that they won't didn't well together in the loop when shuffled.<br /><br />This app has over 140 big beautiful layouts! All of them with have unlimited replay potential to beat your time, if you so desire. I'm a little disappointed there are no options to change background or tile designs. All four levels have the same tile design &amp; they all appear to have the same level of difficulty. I haven't done any of the layouts in the higher number range so they may become more difficult at that point. I will return to edit this review if I ultimately discover this to be the case. Even so, I don't consider any of the above to be flaws but merely a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />If you love Mahjong &amp; have been considering this app but have been hesitant due to all the negative reviews; you no longer need to worry. This app is now  worth every penny of it's 99&cent; asking price....and then some!<br /><br />*To EnsaSoft: This is a 5 star app but I did remove 1 star. After playing the first 4 or 5 layouts, I'd received a pop-up asking me if I liked &quot;Mahjong Deluxe HD &amp; if I'd review the game&quot;? Then you need to check &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;Not Now&quot;. I tapped &quot;No&quot;.  Less than a half an hour later, it pops up again after I'd already gave it my NO choice. This is a major annoyance &amp; unacceptable! If I like your app enough &amp; decide to write a review then, I will. And obviously ...I am...<br />A pop-up like this, gives the developer the appearance of &quot;begging&quot; for votes &amp; reviews. It's unprofessional &amp; a turn off to many customers. Please, get rid of this in your next update because this truly is a 5 star game!ey won't didn't well together in the loop when shuffled.<br /><br />This app has over 140 big beautiful layouts!

1416550518|4.0|I purchased this book, because I wanted to break away from my normal, mystery/suspense books.  I thought, well if it has too much drama and no substance, then I will pass it on to one of my co-workers who love the romance/drama world of books.<br />I was very surprised and read this book in 4 evenings after work.  I enjoyed the dramatic re-telling of the main character's childhood and the surprises revealed on a couple of the characters in the end.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds offers my parched ears what cool water affords my sometimes over-heated and dry, prickly throat...<br /><br />... a brief reprieve from the next while's (who knows how long?) mundane, frustrating, eye-scraping dose of normalcy.<br /><br />When I finally collapse on my soft couch and need them, Brian's Pet Sounds are always near. I put my headphones on, close my eyes, and listen.<br /><br />*********Listen. And feel perfectly free to project you own positive musical vibrations, thoughts, and emotions here**********<br /><br />This album breaks my heart regularly.  I have felt it, especially during my free and sometimes lonely evening hours, shatter my jaded exterior into approximately one gazillion shards.  Then, I feel a comfortable sense of exposure.  Pet Sounds penetrates me and becomes me, and I become Pet Sounds. I listen. And cry. And sing. And smile. The album ends. And I feel rejuvenated.<br /><br />In anthropological summary:  Discomfort. Isolation.  Mainline dose of shaman-prescribed Pet Sounds (Liminality).  Reintegration (with a smile).<br /><br />Thank you, Bruce.<br /><br />Thank you, Mike.<br /><br />Thank you, Al.<br /><br />Thank you, Dennis.<br /><br />Thank you, Carl.<br /><br />And thank you, Brian, for being so tender and honest.  Thank you for recording some of your most \\"Pet\\" Sounds.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The first third of the book is a fascinating and engrossing  look into the almost unbelievable physical, mental and psychological demands made on any young man, determined to become one of the best of the best, a U.S. Navy SEAL. The second third of the book tells more of the team bonding rituals that cement a Navy SEAL group into a one of brothers who admire, respect, and beyond all, know they can depend on in any situation, however dire. Being given a window into a world one will never know is always enlightening and, with luck, at times entertaining. I was just tickled when the author told that these hugely talented and unbelievably tough young men took a French press and some good coffee with them where ever they went. It showed  that they can be seen, at least in this little matter, as human as the rest of us, and at the same time reach a state of physical and mental readiness and raw courage that none of us mere mortals would ever dream of.. My attention did start to wander. I was focussed on the Bin Ladin raid, so I found the run up to it a little longer than I might have wished. But, I soldiered on, did a little page-skipping until the last third of the book, when, at last, they boarded the helicopter to Abbottabad.<br />From here, until some unfortunate stumbles after the fact, the story of Bin Ladin's killing is as riveting and compelling as any story, truth or fiction, I have ever read in any history, any where.. It is an almost second by second account of the SEALs' landing, the search, the killing and the escape with the body, back into Afghanistan.<br />Unfortunately, the author chose this stunning achievement as a stage to launch jarringly immature and petulant criticisms of President Obama, his Commander-in Chief.<br />Military personnel aren't required to like their Commander in Chief, or even respect him in the privacy of their own hearts. But they are required, in accordance with military law and tradition, to show respect for the office, regardless of how they may feel about the office holder.<br />There is more than enough credit to go around in this extraordinary tale of derring-do. The author doesn't seem to realize that.
0525953728|5.0|This book is very interesting and informed me of a LOT of information about the S.E.A.Ls. I think that the author did an amazing job when it comes to getting as much info in that is legal. This is an outstanding book and I would recommend this book to everybody that I know. Again this is easily the best book I have ever read.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Been in love with Owl City since hearing Fireflies on the radio. Got all the albums. This one is just as terrific as his earlier two. It strikes me as being more mature and thought-provoking than the first two albums. I think this is my favorite album of the 3, though in actuality, each is like a different and decadent dessert. Yum:)
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Ready Player One was a fun book and I read through it very quickly.  Though it has shortcomings it is, nonetheless, a great source of entertainment.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The story takes place in a well-crafted future in which the majority of the population is poor and one of the only sources of entertainment is a MMORPG called OASIS.  The creator of OASIS has died and revealed that in the OASIS an Easter Egg has been hidden, and that whoever finds it will inherit his fortune and controlling stakes in his company.  The story revolves around Parzival, a poor orphan looking for the egg.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />For whatever reason, I really found myself rooting for Parzival.  To be honest, Cline doesn't do a fantastic job developing characters, but I still found that I could root for the protagonist.  The world and concept was very neat and engaging and kept me turning pages.  The book was well-paced.  A few parts are shockingly emotional and philosophical, which knocks what could be a pure-entertainment book up a notch.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Cline's storytelling is a little meandering at time, and for someone not well acquainted with 80's pop-culture (a key source of clues for finding the egg for the protagonist), parts may be a little confusing or uninteresting. Those who reminisce strongly of the 80's might really enjoy these numerous references, however.  The story wasn't as homogeneous as I would have liked, but others may find that fine.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Fun and entertaining read!  Not great, but not bad.  Recommended for video game lovers and fans of 80's culture, as well as general scifi/fantasy fans.  4/5.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This was an excellent movie. My wife and I want to watch the 3rd Batman movie but hadn't seen the first two and we wanted to watch them in order.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I see this book as a reflection of what goes on in this world, today. The book gives us a fictional world to help us view our own. Today, we have such corruption in some countries where the ruler has absolute power and oppresses their own people. Children in those countries starve to death all the time. People are rising up against their oppressors because they have had enough of the cruelty of the ruling staff. This is a book of fiction, but there is so much truth about the human condition reflected in it that we should not ignore it's message. People Hunger to be free, and when they are denied that freedom, they will rebel and bring down the oppressors. It's a good book and a wonderful series. I recommend it to anyone mature enough to handle the violence.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|Live this book.  Have enjoyed it more than the second book. Looking forward to ready the next book in the series.  These books make me want to go to Scotland and find these locations.
089898890X|4.0|The book has lots of information and very good lesson plans, but it's written in eighth notes requiring you to transpose them in your head into eighth note triplets. I found this cumbersome since I work out of other books and haven't had to do this. It's confusing. Maybe this is the way pro's do it. For my needs, since I don't take gigs that require reading, this was a problem. But, that said, the exercises can be memorized and that can be more useful.
0618526412|5.0|Carson McCuller's novel about a deaf mute, Harry Singer is one of the most poignant books I have ever read. Outstanding characters and great story. It was made into a motion picture in 1969 and starred Alan Arkin as Singer, the deaf mute.
0525953728|1.0|I admit, I purchased this because I was curious as to what all the commotion was about.  It was poorly written.  I really can't say that I saw anything that would have been related to operational security but it is frightening to know that our \\"elite\\" soldiers are stooping to this level.  Mr. Owen seems to be a glory-monger and terribly egotistical.  I don't feel that he wrote this book to set the record straight, I think he wrote it to inflate his ego.  Let's face it.  Our idealogy of these soldiers are of strong, silent and brave men.  My own father, who served in WW II, never spoke of his years in uniform.  I miss those days.  He wasn't Special Ops but there is a quiet dignity in that generation of soldiers. I can't imagine why Mr. Owen would write about this mission other than for his own gains, perhaps not financially but for his 15 minutes of fame.  I believe the Navy made a mistake giving him his trident.  There are a lot of well written accounts out there, I suggest that if someone wants to read one, they choose any but this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you liked the first book you must read this book.  It reveals much.  Christain is the sexist man alive and know you will know why he is so fifty shades.  I am 65% done and can not wait to finish and read book 3.  I can not see the movie that is supposebly coming being anywhere near able to match the books.
B007JUWTI0|1.0|Don't waste your time or money. The sets all look fake, the special affects are bad, and the acting is laughable. There are some good actors in this film, but they don't live up to expectations. This is a really bad remake of a really great story.

B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I was very satisfied with the Kindle Micro USB Cable that I received to use with my Kindle Fire.  I needed it to go between my computer and my Kindle.
1401923127|2.0|I initially read this book with enthusiasm. I was awaiting to hear how the author, in his new spiritually awakened state, changed his beliefs and perceptions about the universe and the meaning of life. He put teasers out there that the mysticism of his approach was coming near the end of the book. It never did come.<br />I, personally, have been on an intense inner journey for over 8 years. I am writing a book about the journey and raising some important issues related to brain research, beliefs, spiritual authorities and culture. I assumed that this author would be a good resource for me. However, I am very disappointed after reading the book.<br />The author makes some interesting comments about human biology and how the membrane of each and every cell in our bodies is analogous to a brain. He calls the cell membrane a homologue of a computer chip. Each cell, then, has a kind of memory and is conditioned by the environment. It sounded fascinating at the time and I still need to do follow-up research to verify his research findings. He also makes comments on quantum physics but is not a quantum physicist, thus, I take these comments with a grain of salt. I then read the addendum, which appears to be an advertisement for Psych-K, which is an expensive course in de-progamming the beliefs we hold and changing our perceptions. It is a technique that amounts to another easy way to a spiritual awakening, in my opinion.<br />Mystics throughout the ages have spend years in the \\"desert\\" dying to self and opening up to that Mystery that is the source of the Universe. Now, in the modern, \\"new age,\\" we have simple techniques to avoid any arduous inner journey, and these \\"techniques\\" are used as a short-cut to \\"heaven on earth.\\" It appears that this book is suitable to those who want to avoid the real difficult task in becoming a free human being and replacing the arduous journey with a week-long course.<br />I have a difficult time believing a scientist who uses his credentials in marketing expensive, \\"trademarked\\" techniques for spiritual enlightenment. It appears that this approach is what we can call, \\"canned enlightenment.\\"

B000QGAU4E|5.0|Brilliance and innovation radiate throughout Children of Men. The director Alfonso Cuaron's use of single shot sequences was innovation at its finest in the film industry. I thought this film was very good the first time I saw it but, after multiple viewings, I know that this film is indisputably great and one of my favorites of that decade.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|definately a fun way to twiddle your thumbs.  Actually, it will keep you quite busy as you may be just goofing around and killing time.  ...  I would be dissapointed to be unable to advance in the game if it requires cash, in which I can foresee frustrations.  It runs smooth so far.

B008GX2YQQ|5.0|If you like Merriweather Post Pavilion but are finding this one a bit 'difficult' here's some rules to make this album work as a listening experience for you.<br /><br />1. This is an album in all senses of the word, to really get the right kick out of it listen to it from start to finish.<br /><br />2. Listen to it loud with a good set of headphones. It's the only way to really experience the amazing sound pallette.<br /><br />3. If you don't get it on first listen, listen to it lots of times before dismissing it.<br /><br />When I first listened to the album I was a bit disappointed, then on 2nd listen I became a bit intrigued by it, now after 5 listens through, the latter with headphones, I'm convinced it's a masterpiece.<br /><br />Don't expect another Merriweather Post Pavilion. This is a different record. If MPP was Animal Collective's Sgt. Peppers, this is their White Album. It's like The Beatles moved to 21st Century America, got into modern electronic music and melded Revolution No.9 as a background to the rest of the tracks on the White Album!<br /><br />I really think Animal Collective are pushing music now in ways equivalent to the Beatles in their heyday. They're our modern day Fab Four.<br /><br />If you like Panda Bear more than Avery Tare (as I did) you'll probably be disappointed that Avery gets way more vocal time. But I've really got into the versatility, wildness and passion of Avery's singing on this and Panda Bear's contributions are excellent, particularly the drumming that drives the record.<br /><br />After my last listen to the record, by the time Amanita morphed into its ecstatic finale I experienced a rush that I can only imagine is like being on some mad pyschedelic high. I don't do drugs so I'm just speculating!<br /><br />There's so much going on on this record, so many strange noises. The song structures are wild, unpredictable. There's loads of really catchy sing along bits, they're just not done in the obvious way like regular pop songs.<br /><br />I love Merriweather and rank it as one of the best albums I've ever heard, this isn't as accessible or catchy, but it's probably a better overall record. A real artistic high point.<br /><br />I'm not going to single out songs because I think this is a bit like a symphony, the whole is so much more satisfying than the parts. It's just not the same listening to Amanita in isolation as it is going through the whole album and then the end of Amanita just hits you like a wall of rapture.<br /><br />Their upcoming live shows are going to be unmissable. Best band in the world at the moment.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|beating the achievements is lots of fun. slot machine is good too. takes quite a long time to get boring.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|It was a very good movie to watch.  Makes it even better when it is based on a<br />real life story.
B005LAIHE0|1.0|The Five-Year Engagement is labeled as a \\"slapstick comedy\\" but there is little comedy and more sadness to the movie.  The premise of the movie is that Violet and Tom are engaged but postpone getting married because Violet needs to move from San Francisco to Michigan where she has received a teaching fellowship. Dutifully, Tom goes with Violet giving up an outstand job as a chief for making sandwiches at a fast food joint.  Even though Violet and Tom are together, their wedding is postponed while Tom's friend Alex married Violet's sister Suzie and start a family, providing a contrast to the unmarried Violet and Tom.  Violet's stint in Michigan is to last for two years during which time they inexplicably don't get married.  It would have been funnier if they were separate in California and Michigan and had bizarre incidents trying to see each other.  It is hard to understand what is tripping them up on their way to the altar.<br /><br />Scenes in the movie that could have been given a funny twist are grim. Tom goes out hunting with one of his new Michigan friends and shoots a deer in the head. The deer is roped to the roof of his friend's car and slides off so Tom has to put the deer in his car with its head sticking out of the sunroof. It would have been funny if the deer charged Tom or that the deer was not dead but stunned and wakes up in the car with Tom.  The movie is made up of scenes like this that simply fall flat.  I am glad I did not see the movie when it was in theaters.  At least I could turn it off

B006GECE9Y|3.0|I like to keep a browser when I find that some apps run better using it rather another browser.  Dolphin is pretty much in a neutral zone.  Nothing was enhanced, nothing degraded.  I'll keep it a little longer, but, I prefer Opera.

I have all of my pictures for the past 10 years backed up, and close to 4000 songs backed up and I can carry then EVERYWHERE with me.  This product is sooooo user friendly.  It only took 1 day to upload all of my music.  It was amazing! I never write reviews on products, but this app and the Amazon Cloud are sooo good I just had too! I highly recommend it!
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|There is a certain kind of wit possessed by Roald Dahl that just captures the imagination with such clarity and perceptiveness, he cannot help but leave his readers spellbound. This is the case with Matilda. Its characters are intricately fashioned from the depths of Dahl's mind, perhaps springing from deep within the memory of a young impressionable boy where villains are caricatured to larger-than-life proportions, heroes are triumphantly vindicated, and the ending leaves one with a resonance to be savored with a smile. Roald Dahl is a master storyteller who understands the world of a child with all its strange, chaotic, incomprehensible and splendid possibilities. Fears loom like tall dark shapeless shadows, while the wonders of life sparkle with an ethereal glow. Matilda is my favorite of Roald Dahl's books, and an example of his talents at their finest. It is a story to be enjoyed again and again.

1932907009|5.0|I'm so sad I didn't discover this series until after the untimely death of the author--I'd like to kiss him on top of his pointed head. Written passionately with joy and candor, Blake Snyder LOVES writers. He truly wants you to succeed, and is so thrilled to share this method with you. Must have been a lightening bolt from above when he figured this out... his method is salvation for very creative, but maybe also very disorganized writers. Godspeed, Blake, and from the depth of my bottomless heart, I thank you.
B0013TPVGK|2.0|I bought this book after reading many good reviews and expected it to be mind-opening. I've been a musician for 30+ years and to be honest, i didn't really get a heck of a lot out of it, although i still have about 40 pages left.<br /><br />There are a lot of good nuggets of information, or philosophy, in the book but i think it would have benefit for beginners, for the most part. It's not a method book but rather a story told with fictional characters. It's sort of long-winded and to be honest, a bit boring. I'd rather have a book where the basic principals are laid out a bit better without the silliness of the imaginary characters. Good for beginners/intermediate musicians.

The ONLY comics reader app that will see all your comics and open everything you throw at it. Make sure to get the .pdf plugin for absolute freshness.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This has changed how I eat and where I buy my meat.  I support more Farmer's Markets and organic farmers and farms.  I learned so much about where the food comes from.  I have no problem eating meat, but I truly don't believe our Creator meant for chickens not to see the light of day, literally, before becoming food for us humans.  To sad.  I do it chicken, only free range.  Wake up people!

B000Y9PILI|4.0|Not that it can't be \\"repaired\\", but a bit too much bass on Graham's, \\"Chicago\\" - it modulates his vocals. However, with it toned down, it does sound nice(r). I bought this set just for the \\"remix\\". The DVD doesn't want to play, but who really cares. Actually, Graham's vocal, at the end of the first verse, \\"It's Dyin'\\" sounds out of place, like an afterthought. Would have been nice to hear some studio talk on that tape, for a genuine collector's edition!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OMG... I have never read a book that made me think the things I thought with this book. It is by far the most erotic book i have ever read and at the same time you have love, drama, suspense, and much much more. I am working on book 2 now and already am longing to get to book 3. I hope to get to read more books like this from E L James.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. If u have ever watched the Disney version of Snow White as a child, well, this is the grown up version.<br /><br />The movie, very much sticks to the fairy tale classic. I honestly cant figure out why others have given it such bad reviews. Perhaps they are reality tv show fans?  This movie, is a very solid fairy tale, and, the characters are cast quite well.<br /><br />2 hours, of amazing effects, good story, and, great cast, held my interest easliy.<br /><br />I went into watching this movie, prior to tho, expecting to see a story about Snow White. Guess what I got?  A story about Snow White!  Others, not so sure what they were expecting. ;)<br /><br />If any have aversions to fairy tales, maybe they should pass on this. I thought it was superb.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book and though i did not think i could be I think Darker is better then Gray. Can not wait to get my hands on freed. The only part I would have to say I did not like but at the same time I see why E L James did it was the end. Cause I have to wait 2 days for freed but I am left hanging lol.. Will be on pins till I get it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This review will not ruin the story if you didn't already read it.  I am giving perspectives on the book.<br />I just could not get the concept of the silo's. How many people in them, how they got power for them, how they got oxygen if the air outside was poisonous, where everything came from including computers and the power to run them as they did not depend on the mechanical floor for that. Yet they were kind of backwards, one stairway for the entire silo? Did every floor have just one way in and one way out?  Just how large is a silo if Juliette was able to see all 50 silo imprints on the surface of the land (notice I did not say earth because I still do not know where they are). You would have thought they were each at least the size of a small state but apparently they were not too large. They had dogs and rats but did they have farm animals? If so where?<br />While the book kept me reading (I was done in just a few days) some of the the writing did not mesh. While Juliette was under water it was clear blue in one instance then inky and thick in another.  What exactly happened to security towards the end of the book? Did they all just up and leave?(you will know what I mean when you read it). While there was a hospital floor somewhere in the middle how did they get the sick or injured there, as it took days to a week to climb up or down to that floor. These are just some of the examples of the story not being explained within the first five books?<br />But the book was engrossing, and that's why I gave it four stars. I just wish some of those things mentioned and many others had been explained better.<br />PS, just my opinion but this is NOT on a Stephen King level.
0062014102|4.0|The Holographic Universe woke me up to the different realities that exist in any moment. Loved the story about the hypnotist.<br />Puts everything into perspective. I am not very scientific, so I had to re-read a few parts, but once it all sunk in, my mind was definitely expanded.<br /><br />It is a book that I will read again and again in order to grasp his information more fully and try to put it into play.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in expanding your level of awareness quickly, as it is pretty mind blowing.
1616614609|5.0|Netrunner as an asymmetrical living card game for two players featuring one corporation player and one 'runner player.  The game features 4 different corporate factions and 3 different 'runner factions to choose from, each with their own distinct play style.  The box contains everything needed to play for two players.<br /><br />The game itself is an 'I go, you go' turn taking game.  The goal of the game is to score (or steal) 7 points worth of Agendas, but there are other ways to win or lose the game as well, such as running out of cards to draw in the case of the corporation, or being killed by accruing too much brain damage from killer ICE as the 'runner.  To safeguard and then ultimately score their Agendas, the corporation must install software called ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) on their servers to protect their valuable data.  On the other hand, the 'runner is at the same time installing software and hardware in his 'rig,' which is basically his computer for accessing the net, designed to hack through various ICE the corp is installing.<br /><br />A typical game lasts about an hour and plays fast and hard.  The game includes a lot of tokens as well, to represent different status effects, money, et cetera.  These are of good Fantasy Flight Quality.  The card art is fantastic, as is the flavor text.  Presentation is top-notch here.<br /><br />After having played 20 games or so of this so far, I can still say that I look forward to every opportunity I have to play it.  Both my friend and I have been playing this pretty much nonstop since it released a few days ago.  Playing as the corp is vastly different from playing as the 'runner.  Even then, playing as the various factions of each is vastly different.  I can't wait for future expansions for this game already!<br /><br />As far as future plans, the game is a 'living card game,' (not collectible) so when you buy an expansion for it, you get a complete playset of 3 copies of each card that comesin that expansion, for all factions. This means no hunting for rares, no trading your friends to get the cards you want, you get them all. Everyone is always on an even playing field.<br /><br />According to the official website, the first expansion will be a six month cycle with a pack released every month during that cycle. Each pack will contain 3 copies each of 20 different cards. New identities and corporations are also going to be released.<br /><br />If this game intrigues you even in the slightest, don't hesitate, just buy it right now, it's totally worth the cost of admission.<br /><br />08OCT2012 UPDATE:  Still play this nearly every day with my roommate, at least one game a day.  We even bought a second core set so we could each keep customized decks.  No sign of wavering interest and each game is different.  Building custom decks is a lot of fun and easy to do on the fly.  Looking forward to the first expansion.

0312360266|3.0|Marked is, quite frankly, not a great book. It IS however a guilty pleasure. The reason this book isn't great, or even good really, is that it is entirely too awkward and uneven. My bottom line is, if the character wasn't so uneven and if the book had been easier to stay in, the STORY wasn't that bad. All the other aspects of the book kept side-tracking me though and made me wonder why the writer chose to write it the way she (or rather \\"they\\") did. The problems I had are following, but before reading on, I did not hide this review because of spoilers because I do not think the reasons I give for it being awkward and uneven are vital to the story in any way, but they ARE things that happened in the book, so if you want to stop reading, do so now.<br /><br />I am not a fan of \\"chick lit\\" and since this series is intended for a teen audience, \\"teen chick lit\\" is an awkward combo since one of the aspects of the genre is promiscuity. Although there is no sex by the main character, she does agonize over thinking she is a \\"slut\\" for lusting after the blood of her \\"almost-ex-boyfriend\\" (the human she broke up with shortly before being marked) and then kissing a fledgling she has met at her new school, The House of Night.<br /><br />Another uneven aspect, in my opinion, is the main character's inner dialogue (the book is in first person). Zoey goes from \\"poopie\\" to BJs which is just odd. If she can openly think, or talk, about one, why is the other embarrassing? (And quite frankly, if she IS discussing one, this book is NOT for the tween audience, and you may want to think about how adult your teens are before okaying this book.) That glaringly uneven thought process pulled me out of the reading to wonder if I missed something and that maybe the book had moved on to another character. Zoey also goes from insecure to Queen of the World and back to insecure rather quickly. Maybe I just don't remember being 16 that well, but I don't think it was quite that bad of a roller coaster.<br /><br />The book also wont stand up to time because there are so many pop culture references throughout the story. Even with the book being just a few years old, I was occasionally shocked at how some of the things brought up had changed so much. Sadly, and maybe because the main character is a teenager, the pop culture references are everywhere in the book, from popular movies to popular singers to favorite cereal brands.<br /><br />The entire changing process was weird to me too. I love that authors these days do not stick to the cookie-cutter vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural beings that past books did, but this series (in some aspects) just didn't go over well with me. When a person has been \\"marked\\" their body begins the change in becoming a vampyre. I am okay with that. I am even okay with the process taking years and these kids being shipped off to a different school to learn about their new life. I don't understand the facial tattoos that go along with it though, especially when the tattoos eventually take up a good portion of the face. Although the small marks might make for an interesting mental visual while you are reading, once it is covering a third of someone's face (sometimes more) I just don't get it. Then to throw in specific actors, politicians, and musicians who are (in this series) vampyres and would thus have all these facial tattoos, just again took you out of the story into the realm of unbelievable. This is yet another problem with using pop culture references. (Yes, I understand that as vampire-fiction it is in itself unbelievable, but a book should hold you captive and make you feel like it could be real.)<br /><br />Underneath all the uneven inner dialogue, pop culture references, and the more outrageous aspects of becoming a vampyre, the story in itself isn't terrible. I think I just got pulled out of the reading too often to think to myself, \\"What the heck!\\" for me to think the book was \\"good,\\" but it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I can't say I'll read the book again, but I will read the next book in the series to see what happens in the story.ure of mine. I can't say I'll read the book again, but I will read the next book in the series to see what happens in the story.
0786891416|5.0|This first book is the series has already hooked me!<br /><br />Nikki Heat is an NYPD homicide detective.  She is very focused on her job and being the best professional she can be in a very male-dominated career.  When the commissioner assigns her to 'babysit' journalist Jameson Rook for some ride-alongs for an article he's writing, she's livid.  This wasn't exactly the hard-hitting crime work she's used to.  When she is called to investigate a murder and art heist, she knows he'll slow her down and maybe blow the whole case.<br /><br />I loved the characters of both Heat and Rook!  Rook is so charming and so maddening at the same time and he so frustrates Nikki that it's hilarious.  She is about to go insane or murder him herself yet she can't show any emotion because that's just what Rook wants.<br /><br />I love that the female character has all the power in this book--and she keeps it.  Usually, when romantic tension is involved, the female character usually becomes silly and bumbling and starts focusing on the man.  Not Nikki-she keeps Rook is his place and her eyes on the prize.
030788743X|5.0|SO GOOD! I want to open it up and re-read it already!<br /><br />If you lived through the 80's, if you are a video game junkie, if you love old mech anime, if you know all the lines of Monty Python movies, if you are an avid sci-fi'er, if you've spend uncountable hours inside an MMO, YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK.<br /><br />This book takes place in 2044, in a time when the world has pretty much collapsed and everyone logs into the OASIS to live in a better place. When the creator of the OASIS dies, his video-will announces he has hidden an Easter Egg inside the game, and the first person to find it will inherit everything. GAME ON! The entire world becomes obsessed with 1980's pop culture (because the creator was obsessed with it) looking for clues to where the Egg might be hidden, and some will stop at nothing to find it... even murder.
B00846REIS|1.0|It's unbelievable that an author would copy so much from another book. I feel that it's trying to capitalize on the success of the Fifty Shades.  I was very disappointed!
031606792X|4.0|Once again, I forgot how much I enjoyed this story.<br /><br />There were a few interesting things to note though...<br /><br />First, the story is broken into three parts:<br />Part One:<br />Bella's POV - the same we've come to expect from the series<br />Part Two:<br />Jake's POV - which I LOVED, maybe it was the change, maybe it was that things the reader needed to know Bella wouldn't be privy to so Meyer decided to keep us in the loop, but this is some of my favorite 220 pages of the series.<br />Part Three:<br />Bell's POV again - sadly, despite all the times she says she feels the same, the voice on paper was noticeably different. It sometimes didn't seem like it was Bella's voice.<br /><br />Secondly, so much of this could have been left out of the book. There were two whole chapters I think on just the way things looked and felt to Bella that I didn't really need to know. There were a few other parts as well that just seemed to drag on and on and on, but I don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />Overall though, I was satisfied with the ending to the series and not really left \\"wanting more\\" which is always good when a series is over.

B00003CX8N|5.0|I remember reading when this movie first came out that Anne Bancroft's husband had purchased the story for her as a gift. Well, she made the most of it. Each role was perfectly cast, each scene perfectly crafted.  Subtle little things that give one insight into what her life was like up till the time of the story.  Subtle scenes of the life of each of the people in London.  If all you want is fast action, sex scenes, etc., then don't bother with this.  If, instead, you love to just sit back and watch great performances in a lovely story then you are in for a treat.  I've watched it many times and am happy now to have it on DVD.
B00702NWW4|5.0|I was first introduced to Lana Del Rey by Saturday Night Live. I was as confused as everyone else by her incredibly odd and downright poor performance, but something about it stuck with me and I decided to listen to the samples on Amazon.<br /><br />After a few listens I bought the album, and it's now one of my all-time favorites. From beginning to end, LDR cultivates a completely unique, seductive, and haunting sound that is perfect for chilling out. There are days at work where I just listen to the album on repeat. I can't wait to see what she does next, although this first album set the bar very high and I don't know if she can capture whatever magic went into this one.<br /><br />If you like 'Video Games' and are wondering if the rest of the album is as good, the answer is a definite YES. This is no one-hit wonder.
B008M34INW|5.0|Very entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Much of it could be considered a little too far fetched to be true, but that's why we watch movies, right?
044655667X|3.0|The Fifth Witness is an engaging book once a reader works through the early chapters.  It contains all of the usual Michael Connelly elements, and as with all Michael Connelly books, a reader is advised to pay attention to the details along the way, because he's sure to deliver a twist or two before the book is done.  It's fun to try and anticipate these, and in this case while I was close I found myself, as usual, virtually kicking myself for having missed a few key clues.<br /><br />Yet despite the fun, the book felt strained to me.  In particular Michael Haller ongoing relationship with his fresh-from-school associate attorney, Jennifer, seems wooden.  Over and over Mickey lectures her on the hard facts of criminal defense, on how the guilt or innocence of the client is a distraction from the job and of no interest.  The dialog becomes unbearably wooden.<br /><br />Court room scenes interest me, so I found the emphasis of the book on the court room attractive, but again the dialog approached parody, with Michael repeatedly using the tactic of asking a loaded question for the purpose of getting a message to the jury only to have the judge disqualify the question.  There must have been a half-dozen examples of this.<br /><br />Then the finale: Connelly's modus is to always hold back a zinger or a few for the end.  It's a delicate balance to play \\"fair\\", providing the reader with clues as to what these might be, and being too obvious.  While I enjoyed the end of the book, I did find myself trying to sort through a series of apparent contradictions.  The book seemed unpolished, like it could have used one or two revisions, and I fear this is due to Connelly focusing more on quantity than quality.<br /><br />Connelly and Haller fans should read this book.  It's fun, it's fast, and it raises some interesting social questions.  But those new to the author should look to his earlier work first.

There were also some surprisingly tender descriptions of home life that rang true.<br /><br />But the book was unnecessarily gruesome in spots and at times the author's writing style grated (particularly his frequent use of incomplete sentences).

B004XWLN20|5.0|This set is a must for any Smallville fan in my opinion!  My only complaint is that the sleeves in the collectors booklet that houses the DVDs are almost too tight and it's hard to get the discs out to watch them.  Plus, there is the worry of scratches.  For this reason alone I have kept my backups of each individual season that I purchased.  However, for the true collector of Smallville or Superman items, this is a wonderful addition.  Highly recommended!

I accidentally purchased one of the \\"new\\" Curious George books, before this and it was definitely not as good as the originals.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel's unusual format of \\"She said; He said\\" keeps the reader involved. Is it a mystery or a love story?  Gillian Flynn's characters are not warm and fuzzy, but interesting in depth and they make the reader want to guess how the story will end. There is a reason it has become a bestseller...go for the Gone Girl!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Like all of this series, I enjoy the resolution where the bad guys get it. There are enough plot twists to keep me interested.
030758836X|4.0|I agree with what everyone says: this is a fresh, taut, twisty thriller that stays with you while you're reading it. The structure of it is GENIUS!<br /><br />I'm surprised that more people haven't commented on the ending, however. I won't ruin it for you--it ruins itself--but let's just say that it's absolutely implausible. It feels weak and rushed. It's tidy for the author, and sequel-ready, but you don't buy it for one second. For me, it almost made me sorry I'd stayed with these characters for so long.<br /><br />The central impulse of being human is seeking happiness. When a character deliberately chooses not to, he's no longer a believable character.

B000JMKTLO|3.0|I thought this book was not so much a mystery as a character study of small towns in MO (Disclaimer:  I spent the summers of my youth in MO and have even seen the cannonball that is still lodged in the pillar of the court house in Lexington, MO).  You will recognize all the types in this crime novel but I wonder about the description of the cutting.  Nevertheless, the idea of singing flesh (like Ray Bradberry's Illustrated Man) was compelling.<br /><br />I also did not know whether having sex scene between two consenting adult that were fully clothed was enough to justify it's inclusion under the heading of new and innovative but that is for others to judge.  The sex scene with someone younger was, I suppose, a blow for women's right just years too late.<br /><br />Some of the stuff just did not seem motivated to me.  Why did she stay at her mother's house when there were motel rooms to rent?  Would it not have made more sense to have her down-on-her-luck and sent there by her editor as ONE LAST CHANCE to save her career?  What sort of deadlines does her newspaper have for crime articles?<br /><br />Anyway, I did not mind reading it and parts were real page-turners.<br /><br />djc
B007SGM084|5.0|What a story, you get so involved with the characters in the story you can't put it down. Not at all what I expected!!!! Read all 3 in a week and am thinking about reading them again. I love the love between the two in the story. I was sad when I finished them. I need more!!!! Hope E L James continues them would love to read more!!!If there is a move I will be there to see it for sure. Thanks James for making reading fun, erotic, and sad!!!! What a journey!!!!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I have not read much of this type of litrature since the Jim Chee series.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I liked it's blend of hare-core realism about fighting crime in a small city which often means fighting with your friends, relatives, and neighbors.<br /><br />In this case, the friend, relatives, and neightbors occupy that margin between reality, hopes, and dreams.<br /><br />The discription of the terrian is passable and the author manages to capture the change in weather.<br /><br />There was an enjoyable absence of gratuitous sex (or sex in general for that matter) which allowed me to focus on the relationships rather than the niggling details (why didn't somebody put a pair of handcuff's on George after he ran away the first time?).<br /><br />This is only the first in a series and I intend to read more.<br /><br />djc

0451228731|4.0|Right up front:  If you buy this book because you like thrillers, hard sci-fi, and mind-tweaking visions of the future, you WILL get your money's worth.  Author Suarez is no hack, but rather has extensive knowledge of both computer gaming, and the capabilities of cyber warfare.  Mix in some futuristic weaponry (all of which has either had proof-of-concept initial testing or fits well within the realm of feasibility), some impressively thought-provoking moral and ethical complexity, and some truly perceptive rumination about where technology can and will be taking commerce and human society, and what emerges is a rollicking techno-thriller burns through preconceived notions of the future like a plasma torch cutting through aluminum siding.  So why not five stars?<br /><br />Well, truth be told, the writing could be spiffed up.  Considerably.  Initially taut, the book develops some plot stutters about two-thirds of the way through.  Characters in the book tend to be more suited for a graphic novel, barely reaching 2D status, much less fully fleshed out 3D personas.<br /><br />Bottom line?  A brilliant conception by an author whose intellectual capacity and imagination outstrip, at least in this first novel, his literary skill.  Regardless, a tale that is evocative, provocative, and a helluva fun ride.
B007SGM084|5.0|Well I can certainly see why this book is such a smash!  I was very sad to come to the end, but the books made me cry, laugh out loud, and well, you know...KEEP WRITING, E.L. James!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a fascinating book and once I started reading it...I couldn't stop!  The daily routines training, missions, more training and  back to a mission is unreal.  The physical and mental wear must be intense and the costs of broken marriages must be high.  The Bin Laden death was very interesting and shows how Capital Hill twists every event they can into a political advantage.  The White House leaked to the media after four hours that it was the Seals from Virginia that killed Bin Laden!  These leakes to the media and Muslim Groups seem to be standard procedure today regardless of putting people's lives  in harm's way.  I support the military and respect their service to this country.  This is a great book showing the teamwork of the Seals!!  Since the Secretary of Defense has given out Owens real name on ABC and threatened  legal action against him...and since the organizations that Owens wanted to donate profits has declined...I will buy extra books and give out to frends and this Seal can use the profits for his defense fund or for his retirement.
0977476073|5.0|There are ongoing discussions on these pages concerning the several translations of \\"Mein Kampf\\".<br />75 years ago there would have been no disagreement:  \\"Mein Kampf\\" would have been in your face.<br /><br />I believe it was mandatory for Germans to own the book, (but reading it was optional), although<br />if any were forced to read the thing, they were probably students assigned to do so.<br />Hitler was an abysmal author, but \\"Mein Kampf\\", although a difficult read, is definitely not boring!<br /><br />I first read it when I was 15 and again in college.  I always wonder about people who say \\"The Germans<br />should have known what Hitler planned to do -- he wrote everything down in Mein Kampf!\\"  They are<br />merely stating that they never read the book, because Hitler did Not write everything down!<br /><br />At 15, \\"Mein Kampf\\" was my first exposure to anti-semitism.  I was totally surprised, having never<br />imagined such a thing.  What I recalled, and found again on re-reading, that the prose becomes rather<br />more semi-literate when harping about the Jews, as if the subject caused Hitler to have temper trouble.<br />However, nowhere does he state anything about the destruction of the Jews.  He does say that they need<br />to be 'removed', but as he did not elaborate on this, there is no way to know how he planned to conduct<br />such a 'removal', if he even had any plans at all.  I think he did not, if only because he could have<br />made great headway into such an endeavor during the 1930s, yet as late as 1942, he did not attent the<br />Wanssee Conference where the \\"Final Solution\\" (Holocaust) was planned.<br /><br />It has come to my mind that perhaps no Holocaust would have occured if it had not been for Heinrich Himmler,<br />by effecting the decisions made at Wanssee, at least perhaps not in the fanatical manner or to the extent<br />that it ultimately became.<br /><br />Even so, as unlimited as Himmler's powers were, regardless of what attrocities were committed against who<br />during the NAZIs 12-years reign, it was Adolph Hitler who was the grand master of the destruction perpetrated<br />during this unspeakable Reich.<br /><br />It seems it is now the fashion to say that Hitler was not insane or mentally disturbed.  Are they kidding?!<br />Hitler allowed his delusions and mental poison to totally suppress any morality he might once have had, to<br />the point of murdering over 50 million human beings.  (The precise numbers, and exactly who many of these people<br />were, will never be known.)<br /><br />It will take humanity a long time to get over the Third Reich....1000 years?
0525953728|4.0|The only question after the May 1, 2011, killing of Osama bin Laden was which Special Operations outfit was responsible-- the U.S. Navy SEALs or Delta Force? Whether SEAL Mark Owen wanted to keep that a secret didn't matter, as SEAL Team Six was soon pegged by the U.S. government and media as the culprit.<br />This book takes the reader along for the mission to kill \\"UBL\\" in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Along the way, Owen reveals only a small amount of his own background and a very slim amount about his \\"hundreds of missions,\\" but the details of the dramatic operation to kill Osama are so exiting that the book is near impossible to put down, despite the foregone conclusion. No reader should be disappointed.<br />That said, some fellow Navy SEALs and the Pentagon are apparently miffed that Mark Owen, whose real name is Matt Bissonnette, kissed and told without a final governmental proofread, a breach of ethics for any SEAL. Sort of ironic, considering that \\"Owen\\" was so concerned about his identity being leaked that he didn't want to sign a flag for President Obama and was irked that the SEALs had been outed by government sources as the outfit that sent bin Laden to hell.<br />So how did Owen battle to maintain his identity? He wrote this book. Now he's rich. That sort of hypocrisy I can deal with and I'm happy to have bought this book because the majority of the proceeds, Bissonnette says, will go to the families of fallen SEALs.<br />The sort of hypocrisy I can't deal with is addressed in this book: ridiculous Rules of Engagement that lawyers and politicians place on our troops that place their lives in even greater danger. Bissonnette exposes the nasty truth that one has to these worm-like attorneys OK missions, which is absurd. SEALs, among other troops, act as cops, repeatedly \\"arresting\\" armed terrorists/militants, whom the Afghani government releases time and again. Apparently, our troops can't even kill the enemy in war without an OK AND witnesses to supply rebuttals by the militant \\"victims,\\" who first get to answer the question, \\"Where you abused?\\" when they are captured.<br />Of course they all say yes. What a joke.<br />If this was a secret, I'm happy Bissonnette, who cracked on President Obama for taking credit for \\"killing bin Laden,\\" outed it. Read it for yourself. Thank you to all the Navy SEALs, whoever you are and including Bissonnette, for ridding the world of bin Laden -- and all the other things you have done that we will never know about.
B0064U6OYG|1.0|This album exists. That is the only reason it gets 1 star.<br />If the album did not exist, it would have zero stars.<br />I wish it didn't exist, because then this wouldn't exist, and that would save me a lot of work to tell you how bad this is.<br />It's bad, like really bad.

B006LSZECO|2.0|This book took off like a rocket! I couldn't put it down. It was like watching CNN and HLN at the same time. The braided storyline was great. But then...the story took a horrible, horrible turn. It became predictable yet unbelievable. I won't ruin it for any future readers but let me say, had I not been reading it on my Kindle, I might have thrown the book across the room.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very intriguing story line! Enjoyed the suspense and twist and turns of the story. I was surprised to find out the series was written for teens. I felt it was a bit violent for that targeted age group.

Deeply disappointed. also my screen keep cracking for no reason. I left it on my tabled perfectly fine and when i turned it on its bottom half was white and had white lines going across it. I might change to a nook because they are more reliable  ooookk. RANT OVER. The book was another masterpiece by my favourite author. Luved it.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|As I've grown older and care less what other people think of me I have developed an appreciation for some of the earlier, simpler rock artists.  AC/DC falls into that category.  Although I've essentially grown up with AC/DC, being in my mid-50's, this was the first album by them I've purchased.  Primarily because the song list covers all the AC/DC songs I've grown to like (Thunderstruck, Shoot to Thrill, etc.) and did not have any that I especially hate (i.e.; Big Balls).  The DVD is a bonus, and helped me introduce my teenage son to AC/DC.  He'd heard many of the songs before, but having the visual image enabled me to give him some background on the band.  He won't admit it, but I know he watches the DVD when I'm not around, and he has loaded the entire album on his ipod.  So, if you are only going to buy one AC/DC album, this one is perfect.

B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|This is actually an excellent action movie.  Why?  Because the action in it is excellent.  The fight scenes are well-choreographed, gripping and brutal.  And you can actually SEE them, rather than just imagining that you saw them. The difficulty of making action scenes look this good in front of a camera that holds still and doesn't \\"blink\\" is not to be discounted.  For anyone who is a fan of great fight sequences, take a look.

031250926X|5.0|Our 14-month-old son loves this book. We have to read it several times a day and we just ordered our third copy of this book as he chews on it, throws it, picks at the binding, and abuses it in every conceivable way. We've bought other Eric Carle books and other slider books, but none captures his interest the way Brown Bear does. I'm even sewing a Brown Bear costume for him for Halloween.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really loved reading all three of the books, It had everything you could want in a story,I literally could not put it down. It has been along time since a book really excited me and kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. Great writting. If you read these books you will not be disapointed in any way.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Read the Hunger Games last year and for the most part really enjoyed the book.  Books and Movies are different and the story sometimes cannot translate and sometimes translates even better.<br />The movie looked like it was going to achieve the goal of relaying the spirit of the book but just fell short on most occasions.  So much potential and just got dropped.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" by Mark Owen is a difficult book for me to rate. It is a 5-star story for a true hero of the war on terror. It is a 1-star story from a literary works standpoint. I sense that Kevin Maurer took a 50 page succinct accounting and added filler to make it a 336 page novel to satisfy the publishers. There was no discernible command structure in the story. My guess is that in an effort to sanitize the story to protect an individual's identity, the typical TO&E structure was minimized. This was disconcerting to me. Knowing a person's rate or rank (for officers) is helpful to me when I read such novels.<br /><br />I did not find anything to justify the Obama administration action against Owen for releasing classified or sensitive information. The White House released far more data on the raid well before this book was written. This book does clear up all the \\"credit taking\\" that politicians are wont to do.<br /><br />Given the above, I rate this book as a 3-star novel as a compromise.
034580404X|5.0|I really loved these books! Never could put the book down for very long. I hope to see more from this author in the very near future.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I made a gaming rig with a Coolermaster HAF 922, GA-Z77x-UD3H Motherboard, GTX 560 Ti Graphics Card, Intel i5 3570k CPU, Corsair Vengeance memory DDR3 2x4GB, and a CX600w power supply. The cpu is great right out of the box and is strong enough with built in graphics to run games like Minecraft and Runescape without any lag. However add an awesome graphics card and you will be running Skyrim in Ultra with awesome frame rates! I haven't even had to overclock this thing, it was powerful right out of the box. This is more than enough power for modern games, with the great option to overclock, I highly recommend this CPU.
0871404133|4.0|At first, Wilson seems very hard-headed and technical with his intricate analysis of how social life evolved. He's perhaps the world's greatest expert on social insects, so his comparison of sociality among the bugs and the humans gives a great combination of fine detail with broad perspective. Because Wilson looks at clanishness and meat eating as utterly necessary steps in the evolution of human communities, I thought he was going to defend tribalism as a necessary reality of life. But as he reviews human history and modern social trends, he sees a critical path toward inclusivity, creativity, and mutual care as the requirements for success, which will replace tribal-style culture and religion as known in the past.

After watching the movie I read the 2nd & 3rd book and found them much more enjoyable and easier to picture and they filled in the gaps left out by the need for time editing in the movie.

0316056863|5.0|This book is completely worth the $18.00-ish I spent on it.  I don't typically read celebrity memoirs.  In fact, I read so many nonfiction/academic books that I often receive Amazon offers to buy back my \\"textbooks\\".  However, in the past year-or-so since purchasing \\"Bossypants\\" I've read the whole at least three and a half times - twice in its entirety and the rest in small sections.<br /><br />Tina Fey is such a good writer, because, well, she IS a writer.  Her stories are though provoking as well as funny, and there is a depth to \\"Bossypants\\" not commonly found in celebrity memoirs.  I think I like this book so much because in addition to making me laugh, it helps me put my live in perspective.  Fey reminds all of us that a feminist is not a toxic she-monster, rather a smart, capable woman who, in the course of five days, can book and shoot Oprah as a guest star on the TV show Fey runs, plan and celebrate her 5-year old daughter's birthday party and learn and preform a game changing impersonation of a vice presidential nominee. The genius in Fey's writing is not that she finds the humor in the madness, but that she weaves the three separate issues into each other, giving them all an equal level of importance.  Without missing a beat, she combines the stress of deciding wether or not to impersonate Sarah Palin and managing Oprah's manic schedule with taking her daughter's suggestion and relaxing by pretending to be Wendy (from Peter Pan) and a mermaid for 65 minutes.<br /><br />I read \\"Bossypants\\" so often because as a young female professional, I need the occasional reminder that my personal life is just as important as my personal life, that I can define \\"having it all\\" as I see fit, and that I will always question my choices, there will always be a source of stress,  and my plate will always be overflowing - but as long as what I'm doing brings me happiness and fulfillment, I'm on the right track.  Plus, I like to laugh.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I would have liked a little more information about the time frame of this book - is it about 2030 or further into the future.<br />It is a completely different world than we know - did our world just wear itself out and this is what it came to.  How did the capitalists get in control?  Story is very interesting as it goes- just not enough info as to where it started.

0307472841|4.0|The Man From Beijing is a wonderful example of a Swedish thriller. If you like any of the books by Stieg Larsson (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest), you'll probably become a fan of this novel too.<br /><br />Henning Mankell has crafted a very entertaining international thriller that begins with a massacre in a sleepy Swedish town, and then crosses the globe, from China to Mozambique. Birgitta Roslin is a judge who just won't let go of the fact that 19 people were brutally murdered. She's a conflicted woman, but a very determined central character. Birgitta's marriage is full of problems, yet she still finds time in her less than perfect life to pester the Swedish authorities and let them know that they might be after the wrong man.<br /><br />One of the things I liked most about the book is that not only does it take you around the world, but the stories reaches back into time, and shows how a bitter grudge can last centuries.
0525953728|5.0|This book is NOT political!  Like the author contends, it's about getting the story right and highlighting the critical contributions of so many.  I thus vehemently disagree with those who've offered poor ratings and contended the book was either egotistical, self-serving, or political.  It's the opposite of these things.  It's simply a well-written account of one serviceman's experiences leading up to and through his role in an extraordinary event.  Imagine for a moment if you were involved in such an event, one of historical magnitude, and the stories that emerged were either intentionally or unintentionally untrue.  What would you do?  Might you write a book to promote the truth and in so doing, give the majority of the proceeds to those foundations that serve your community?  This is what \\"Mark Owen\\" did, and he's to be commended for it.<br /><br />Now, I formed my opinion by reading the book over the past couple days and listening to his 60 Minutes interview last night.  Not only were the stories consistent in every way, the way he shows up, unsurprisingly, is extremely credible and confidence-inspiring.  I believe he wrote this book for the noble reasons he contends and, like many of you over the past few weeks, I've had lively internal and sometimes public dialogues about the appropriateness of the book.  Given this, rather than listen to other people's opinions, I thought I'd read the book and form my own (what a concept!).<br /><br />For context: I'm a Democrat, a small business owner, and strong supporter of President Obama.  I'll be voting for him again in November.  I'm also a staunch supporter of the 2nd Amendment, yet also of gun control.  As asserted at the outset, this book is not political, nor do I believe was its release date meant to sway public opinion during an election year.  If that happens, it's because certain people chose to politicize it (and this is being done, of course) and, like \\"Mark Owen\\" contends, \\"Shame on them.\\"  A few points asevidence:<br />◦ The author was critical of Washington being Washington - bureaucratic, slow and confusing - over his full tenure as a SEAL stretching back to the late `90s.  He did not single out Obama.  In fact, he commended him for making the decision and thought his speech announcing UBL's death to the world wasn't bad at all.  These weren't gushing accolades, and they shouldn't be.  The response came across and honest and appropriate given his history and line of work.<br />◦ While the author stated a couple unflattering things about the President and Vice President towards the end, I don't fault him.  If I was invited to the man's house for a beer, I expect to be invited to the man's house for a beer.  Also, Biden putting forth lame jokes is, unfortunately, credible.  Both interactions are part of the story as they affected his perception of the two.<br />◦ While I have no illusions the author is a Democrat, growing up in remote Alaska and liking guns, I do find him highly intelligent, eminently reasonable, and keenly aware of the irreplaceable value of roles, team, and community.  These concepts are cornerstones of Obama's policies and approach, and are often in direct opposition to the untenable macho individualism that frequently dominates Republican thinking.<br /><br />In the end, I believe \\"Mark Owen\\" achieved his stated objective: he set the record straight in an extremely credible way and, while doing so, honored his fellow SEALs and all those who support their missions - the helicopter pilots, the intelligence community, the contractors, the interpreters, and so many others.  Hell, now that I think about it, I recall him even giving props to the dogs!  This book, this story, was not about him and his ego.  It appears he has very little of the later (a extremely high compliment for those who don't know!).  The book, rather, was inspired by the virtuous need to promote the truth, to clarify what really happened that night, and to highlight the extraordinary skill, sacrifice, and humility exhibited by all those involved, and all those who could have been involved: \\"It struck me that anybody standing in that line (a line of SEALs) shaking our hands could have been in our shoes.  We just happened to be in the right place at the right time.\\"<br /><br />While I still have mixed feelings about whether the story should have been communicated in this way, I do respect \\"Mark's\\" reasoning, fortitude, and story-telling ability.  I do also respect that others will feel differently.  In the end, I hope all who read the book walk away with a keener appreciation for the SEAL community and its awe-inspiring ability to execute the extraordinary work that needs to be done to keep us all safe.  To that community, a limitless Thank You!<br /><br />Two final points:<br />1. I feel a bit uncomfortable to admit it, as there will never be \\"closer\\" for me, and I imagine anyone else, about 9/11 and its aftermath, yet the story has brought me a greater sense of peace about those events.  I'm still processing this, so I really don't know why.  I imagine it's because the guy behind 9/11 was stopped once and for all, and that I/we have some pretty awesome people on our side!<br />2. In addition to the above, my overriding take-away is this: NO ONE does it alone!  It was a team, a community that worked together.  We all need to recognize this and pull together locally and as a country.  I, for one, still have hope!

B003A97PV0|5.0|I'll be honest, I didn't know about Biffy Clyro, until seeing them live at the Rockness Festival and they blew me away. A bit of Indie, a bit of grunge, pop, it's a nice mix of genres...but what I like the most about Biffy is their lyrics, the type that make you think for a split second....or take you away (Many of Horror).<br /><br />As for other reviewers saying the different \\"moods\\" in the album are a bit off...I beg to differ, I like it when a band knows how to mix it up a bit. Albums that have the same stream through out, tend to get boring fairly quick. So Biffy Clyro did it right by my standards; of course, we all have different tastes and opinions.<br /><br />Whatever your take is about this album in particular, one thing is for sure...Biffy Clyro is a really good band, so don't pass them up. Enjoy.
B0058YPL66|5.0|For the 2 people who gave one star keep in mind this is an ABC series, not a huge budget show.  The CGI is great for a low budget series show, come on folks this isn't a 50 million dollar show.  Sure there were a few characters that needed a little more development and I couldn't get enough of Mr Gold and Regina together. I also hated loosing two of my most favorite characters and hope with the magic that has been unleashed they may return.  HERE'S HOPING!!  I have never reviewed a show, this is my first and tell you its so worth the money if you haven't seen it.  If you are a fan of fantasy, fairy tales, and the whole good vs evil ONCE UPON A TIME is a great investment.  I promise you will watch these dvd's over and over again and again.  I LOVE IT!!  So looking forward to the Sept 30 Season 2 premiere to see where they take the show.

0446572993|4.0|This is my first Baldacci novel.  Just came across it by accident.  I would have given it 5 stars, but for the slow pace early in the novel. This story feels like a blend of Vince Flynn and Lee Child.  Lots of action, sprinkled with social commentary (both on the left and the right.) I am not sure why it received so many lukewarm reviews, though. It's worth reading! I will look for more Baldacci and I hope that Robie becomes a recurring character.

B003K15IF8|4.0|I almost abandonned Stoner when I first encountered it. It seemed so slow and pessimistic but I'm very satisfied that I gave it another chance. Despite its somewhat pedantic discussions of literature and rather slow start, once you get into the novel and observe how the hero develops from a sad sack to a fully rounded hero, you won't be disappointed in the novel. I was truly sorry to finish the book and would definitely recommend it. Not just for English majors, but for anyone who appreciates someone who stands up for his/her principles.
B007ZBWJXI|3.0|I have been following Asia since the beginning...through the Payne era (which I really liked) and back to the original line-up.  I read the rave reviews on this release and were looking forward on buying.  I have listened to the album several times and it is falling in line with the previous releases in my opinion, not much different at all. If you are an Asia fan, it is, obviously, a must have.  If you are expecting something that will completely blow you out of the water...this really doesn't cut it.  I \\"like\\" the album, but it isn't one of my favorites.  I personally enjoyed Through My Veins on the Omega CD MUCH more than Face On The Bridge from this release as favorites.  It is classic Asia style.
B001BANK32|5.0|This book is a very good book and I think anyone who wants to get scared out of thier wits should read it. I especially like Dick Hallorran because he is awesome. It's too bad the movie is rated R. I really want to see the &#34;Here's Johnny&#34; part. I will never throw away my copy of The Shining by Stephen King ever. The only part I didn't like was when.... it ended! If I ever go to the Overlook Hotel I am definetly bringing this book with me. However I will not go into room 217. If you want to know why read the Shining by Stephen King, just make sure to leave the lights on when you go to bed.
B004OU2FQE|5.0|I first read this book in 1998 and loved it!  I was on a trip to NYC and stopped in a little shop called The Mysterious Bookstore and found they have signed hardbacks by Nelson DeMille.  Check them out online.  If you call them, they will be happy to help you.  I now have a signed hardback copy of PLUM ISLAND and I'm reading it again.  It gets better each time.  Never get tired of John Corey.
B008MEM24S|4.0|decided to buy this app after playing the free version. levels are relatively simple (only second mission so far),  but nicely made. only down side is its replay-ability.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I purchased this CD for my 7 year old son after seeing how he got up and danced with the music throughout the movie. The night I gave it to him, it was repeated in the CD player time after time! I even put it in when Im cleaning the house to give me some upbeat motivation! =)
B003VANOFY|5.0|I use to go through headsets at least once a year so I decided to buy a somewhat more expensive one and with no regrets. The sound quality is great, noise reduction is fantastic, and voice quality is awesome. This one is MUCH more worth getting than its wired version because the wiring gets tangled and eventually will ruin the wire. The wireless on this is fantastic and it is nice you can use it plugged in too. I recommend this headset to anyone who is looking to get 2+ years out of one headset. And Logitech has awesome customer service too, I think it comes with a 2 year warranty.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|This year was going to be the year I learned to like opera. So my husband and I took to going to see the HD Met at our local theater. The first thing we saw... Das Rheingold, and we loved it. It did help to do a fair amount or reading first on the show to understand what Wagner was doing when it comes to the score so we both read some short essays on The Ring. I know this production really divided opera fans and critics as one that knows nothing about opera I loved it. Maybe in years time as I grow to understand things that may change but there are moments of such beauty in this piece that there will always be something that brings me back to this production. I have now watched 4 different productions of the Ring Cycle on DVD and still love moments in this more then the other ones. The opening of Das Rheingold is just perfect to me and the most convincing staging of the mermaid sequence, as well as the decent to the dwarves and the crossing of the rainbow bridge are all stunning moments. The whole of the first act of Die Walkure is charged with sexual energy in a way like no other production available on DVD right now, and Act 3 is awesome from the first moment of famous Ride to the ring of fire at the end. In Sigfried \\"The Machine\\" does get more use and has various backgrounds and levels as to make it more interesting but the stand out in this piece are the performances....sigh...  In the final part Twilight of the Gods I do agree that things get a little flat for a while, but that is something I have noticed in several of the productions I have watched. I don't know if there really is a way to sustain a tension and energy over 5 hours of anything.  In one of the intermission chats Deborah Voigt alluded to being in a  certain mental space while off stage so she can go out and chew the scenery again. When she did come back in did she ever. The confrontation scenes with here were mesmerizing to watch and hands down the best acting scenes for her. While not perfect this ring is still a great way to begin.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|A beautiful movie that is good for young and old. A story with believable characters many with their own flaws which in the big picture turn out to minor or even supporting of the strength and perseverence that ultimately result in a truly beautiful story of goodness in humanity.
1419703692|5.0|I think that Christopher Nolan's vision of Batman is pure genius. It has been thrilling to learn the back story of these three wonderful movies. In these days of CGI and shortcuts, the creativity, vision, hard work and the pursuit of excellence that went into all the production phases of the Dark Knight franchise have been wonderful to share with my teenage son. The photography is breathtaking. I cannot recommend this book enough.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very addictive and relaxing games. Highly recommend all flipart pixie games!!! Have purchased all that I could find and have enjoyed them all!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie lived up to the hype, I will watch it again.  The actors although young were believable and they didn't make a huge deal of explaining the future just got you going from minute one.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I am really happy to have a new Bonnie Raitt album in my collection. This is one of the best she has had since way back to her album Luck of the Draw. Her voice is so distinctive and it comes through clearly and not over-produced.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|nice puzzle game . hard but not unsolvable. music and game noises are not obtrusive or annoying.  good tutorial, easy to learn
B005AUWY90|5.0|Who can complain about Disney and Pixar movies. Purchased for grandchildren and loved it myself.............Great entertainment. Not really good for smaller kids, little suggestive it places.............older kids loved it.
0812993292|4.0|This is a book that is deeply introspective, yet also telling of the human condition. Harold lives in southern England, retired now from working as a sales rep for a brewery where he met Queenie. He receives a note from her that she is dying of cancer and is in a hospice in the north. Harold goes out to mail a letter to Queenie, who he has not been in contact for years, and on a whim starts walking to her...unprepared and leaving his wife behind. There is much that does not seem sensible.<br /><br />We are presented with the unidentified reasons of why Harold feels he must do this. What does he feel to Queenie and why. There is also the mystery of his son, where he is or what has happened and what has happened to Harold's marriage. Harold muses on all of this as he walks. He meets people who are kind and those who become infatuated with the idea of this walk as a pilgrimage. We wonder at times how he continues and the narrative does become as slow as the journey at times.<br /><br />Very slowly we learn of the dynamics in his family, both as he was growing up and in his marriage. There is tension and facts that the author very gradually reveals by Harold's reflections - this is what the walk is all about and in fact what makes it a pilgrimage. At points he finds himself and loses himself again and the reality of Harold's life is revealed.<br />This is a book that fits so very well into its setting of England and is a journey of sorts of discovery of Harold and the world around him.

B007IQX9ZW|1.0|Not worth the money or the time spent watching it. I do not recommend it. I like her as a general rule but not in this movie.
1468161660|5.0|Great characters. Great story. I laughed. I cried. I didn't want it to end! After finishing the second book in the series, I immediately went to the author's website so that I could find out when her third book will be out.

B000SEFM6K|4.0|It really is an intriguing read. The flowerery language gets a little tiresome. The use of so many different characters to tell the story is fun. Really loved all the twists and turns.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very relaxing and thought provoking game. I love the music and pressure free atmosphere. A must get for any Android phone.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I have read this book once a year since high school.  It is a life enforcing book, and it makes a perfect give to anyone you love.
B000FA5STS|5.0|I've read several of David Baldacci's books and this was not a disappointment.  He has a way of capturing your interest from the first page and building it to the very end.  I would recommend Baldacci and this book to anyone who likes a good mystery.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have not enjoyed a series this much since reading the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Series.  I read the first four books in a week and could not put the books down.  I am taking a break before reading the fifth book.  This is up there with Lord of the Rings.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Of the three books, this one was the one I was most looking forward to, but the one I enjoyed the least of the three.  By the third one the sex scenes start getting a bit old, and too repetitive.  Excluding the sex portions the rest tied up the story and was good reading.
030758836X|2.0|The first third of the book was S L O W.  The second third was far more intriguing,  and I actually was interested.  But it started to go downhill again and the last quarter of the book was a total disappointment.  It was as if the author got tired of what she was doing and went for a quick ending, and it didn't matter if it made sense.  I was tired of reading at that point and wish I had that time back.  I was glad I could return it to the library and didn't waste anything but time on it.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|The CD is wonderful and I really enjoy listening to it with my daughter. It came in a decent time.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|But for the rest of us, it was awful.  Really awful.  I wish I had those two hours back.  A lot of close ups and focus on Bella, er Snow White.<br /><br />Sadly the best thing I can say about it is there were some nice hairstyles and fancy gowns.
034580404X|4.0|Really great read...lots of unexpected turns! I just wish the author would have made the story into 5 or 6 books, I finished to quick!
0345536886|3.0|First of all, I LOVE the work of Grisham.. This ones an entertainer, but not a page turning epic like his other brilliant works.<br /><br />Very humorous and the witty comments cracked me up.<br /><br />All in all, its a 3 star book at best.<br /><br />Are there better books out there? Sure.<br />Would I still recommend it ? Yep. Its a fun book. No Stress.
B00371XIJE|5.0|An amazing movie for sure. The puppy at the beginning was an Shiba Inu. The adult dog was an Akita Inu. I have a Shiba Inu and they act just like in the movie. Mine follows me everywhere and probably would wait for me at the bus stop if he could get out of the house. These dogs are very faithful to their owners and always bond with just one person. The movie is beautiful to watch. I never thought of Richard Gere as a dog person but he does a very good job in this movie. Another good dog movie for everyone is \\"First Dog\\".
0452273331|3.0|This is not one of the pleasurable holiday reads.<br /><br />This book is the following:<br /><br />1) Profound and Thought Provoking<br />2) Astoundingly relevant to Modern Day life since this was written in the 60's.<br />3) Seems like a psychology Lesson<br />4) Characters are very deep and intriguing.<br />5) Sometimes you find yourself losing track of the chain of thought of the characters and being confused<br /><br />Why did I pick this book up? - Its a classic. And if you call yourself a reader, you have got to have read THE FOUNTAINHEAD.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? - Umm.. I'm not so sure.
B00881VLCE|5.0|good better best.  best puzzle games I have found so far.  good for the family with easy medium hard and very hard.
B00633W614|4.0|The Clifton Cronicles is an amazing look at history and just another amazing story by Jeffrey Archer.  I can't wait for the next chapter.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is great! I love it and can't wait to finish all 3 books. As a Twilight fans didn't think I could find another love story I would fall for and here it is.  Readers enjoy!
B000O8OTNC|1.0|not sure if my sharpener is defective or the product just sucks.  i've had the item for a year and just can't seem to get an edge that is sharp... i've set it up with a vice on a table as well as using a spacer so i can slide the blade at the exact same orientation and still no edge.  the carbide section does a good job getting an intial edge but the ceramic side sucks.  there seems to be a rounded divot on the ceramic side where the two edges meet... i just figured that was the \\"special design\\" that was mentioned in the description - in either case - MY sharpener sucks... go spend the extra cash and get a better sharpener
0007477155|5.0|Thought I would write a review on here in response to the many unfair 1 star reviews that have been given by seemingly very simple-minded Americans, who seem to think the product is a scam because it doesn't contain two books that haven't actually been written yet.<br /><br />The product description is very clear and from the pictures you can see that the set contains all five volumes of the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series that have so far been published.  The novels are lengthy tomes and hence two of them have been split into two separate books.  This is also how they are printed individually (at least in the UK) and how they are listed on the inside covers of the books (along with a list of Martin's other works).  I understand that in the US it may be that these books have been published as five separate books rather than seven (as in other countries) but since you can clearly read the titles on the spines (and the fact that the final two books do not exist!!) there really should be little confusion as to what one is purchasing here.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I bought my box-set from a bookstore (remember those) and have been very happy with the purchase.  I did spot a few typos near the end of the first book (\\"she pleased\\", instead of \\"she pleaded\\" etc) but on the whole these are very well edited books and the story itself is gripping and addictive with plots, intrigue, emotive twists and well-drawn characters.  I'd recommend this box-set to anyone looking to embark on a voyage to the seven kingdoms or simply any lover of fantasy, military fiction or great adventure novels in general.<br /><br />To Americans out there, books will invariably appear on Amazon only after they are actually written.  However, I do have a copy of the 8th Harry Potter book you can have for the right price!!!

B008578PMU|4.0|This is a story that should be told, but this movie doesn't quite do that. Still, its worth watching, but to me it leaves out a lot of the true story.
0670022411|2.0|I found this first book by Deborah to be quite slow moving and I could not get thorugh it. I read 1-2 books a month and this book just took forever to get throgh. Just to give you an Idea I bought this book when it was released, read a third of it and put it aside because it was just too slow and for some reason difficult to read part of this could be the extra un-needed details ( I mean how many times can you end a chapter with Diana going to bed )and picked it back up in June 2012 and finished the book in August. Need I say more?<br /><br />The book just had alot of un-needed details, and I love details in a book because I like to picture myself in the scene and let my imagination run wild with the look of the houses, streets, and charactres. This however was just to much. I dont need to know everytime Diana's sister poured her a glass of tea or coffe, How many times she sleeps in a day or how many times the window looks a certain way? It just is un- needed.<br /><br />The book picked up for me about chapter 15 ( Which is a lot to read to get to the meat of the book as each chapter is a mini novel ) and after that it was smooth sailing. I will pick up the next two sequals just because I wanna know what happens but pray that Deb's editor took alot of those un needs out and the story picks up.<br /><br />The story also has alot of similarites to the twilight series, make Bella a Witch and you have a older version of twilight. Something a little more original would have been nice.<br /><br />Over all I liked the book but gave it two stars because no book has ever taken me this long to complete, and the story is not really all that original and contains way to many un needed details and story lines that could have been axed in making the book a more full circle piece of work.<br /><br />If you like the current Vampire/Witch trend that is booming in books pick this up but just be prepared to make a commitment to having it take awhile to get thorugh.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait for this installment to make it to the large screen! It fills in some of the holes in the relationship between Katniss and Peeta. It, also, leaves one with questions pertaining to Katniss' and other characters. Ultimately I enjoyed this book; actually the entire series
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The movie is great-not only for young kids, but for us older folks too! This is my 2nd copy, the first got taken by the kids next door. I would recomend this for anbody who enjoys good comedy, but also has a deeper underlying story.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love the app and use it everyday. I never kept a journal but this has made easy as I usually make a note on my phone and tablet. fantastic way to keep little little lists and keep thoughts organized. easy to use and seamless syncing across my tablet and phone make this a must have for me.
1612680011|2.0|It's hard to put a finger on what I didn't like about this book.  It just seemed very thin on specific examples and kind of hid behind the annonimity of the Rich Dad and the Poor Dad.  It just didn't seem like a breakthrough piece of work to me.
B007TML4EI|1.0|Does not work wont start just getting black screen thank goodness I got it for free. still need 3 words to submit my review ok that ll do
B002OR0RP0|4.0|ICEAGE Dawn of the Dinosaurs was a great family movie I watched with my daughter.  I may have been slightly longer than her attention span, but if you like the other ICEAGE movies you will enjoy this one.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|A trifle heavy-handed on the religion, but only a trifle, and it is a story about Christmas. In any case, one of Dickens' classics, and deservedly so.
0739341243|5.0|I'm now a proud introvert. I was forcing myself to live in an extrovert's world. Now, I know the things I enjoy doing are normal. So glad I got this \\"book\\".
B0001US8EO|5.0|How this epic-length movie escaped me back in the '90s is beyond me.  I think it sets a high standard for accuracy in depicting our Western heroes in general and Wyatt Earp and his brothers and associates in particular.  Period detail is indeed detailed, and the dialog and action are clearly communicated.  Never a dull moment.  I am not bothered by the length of this movie in the least.<br /><br />The casting was certainly inspired.  Examples can include the overly-thin (and aged before his time) Doc Holliday, the increasingly chubby Bat Masterson, and the resemblance among the Earp family.<br /><br />Those involved in the screenwriting did their homework, and it was good to see in the credits something to the effect that (only) some of it was fictionalized.  Comparing the movie to the novel \\"Doc\\" (by Mary Doria Russell) shows some agreement of independant research; examples include the Masterson brothers working for Wyatt as buffalo skinners, the \\"arrangement\\" between James Earp and his prostitute wife, and the occasion of the first meeting of Wyatt and Doc Holliday.  Of course there are discrepencies with the historical record.  The shooting of the two Earp brothers and the two train rides out of Tombstone are conflated to the same time period, but this really makes no difference to the gist of the story and the significance of the events.  In his old age at the end of the movie, Wyatt is aware of the liberties being taken in the making of his legend and apparently doesn't feel too bad about that.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a fun game.  You can easily kill a lot of time playing it.  It is also easy to play for a few minutes.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this program worked as advertised. It is slick but requires thinking. The down side is no violence. Great job. I continue to play and my grand children help.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|This was as good as Eye and a good training session for his latest trilogy books for character development, plus a good review of Israel and their journey for self protection.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted just a basic calculator to balance my checkbook and pay bills.  This app works perfectly for both and I love the large key size!
091581112X|5.0|No kidding, this book is by far my favorite book in the world regarding my spiritual growth.<br />It spoke to me on so many levels that It's the first book I'll recommend to anyone interested in new age spiritual matters. I just love it especially the message and guidance. I can reread this book 10 times and still learn more.  It's dynamic and fresh
B005OLNOW6|5.0|I am so glad that I happened to hear \\"Wonderful Life\\" on my internet radio.  I love the stories behind the songs and love the music.  I just wish I could hear it on the radio now.  Can't wait to get the other albums!  Give this a listen, I think you would enjoy this group.  The music video of this group is sometimes weird, but that is the British for you.
0143117009|5.0|The best kind of nonfiction shares something in common with the best kind of fiction -- it grabs you and it won't let go. Jared Diamond gives you a new way to look at the world. I couldn't stop thinking about or talking about this book for weeks and even months afterward.
B006DPXFVM|5.0|The movie download was easy. Enjoyed beng able to watch at home without going to a store. The quality of the HD was excellent.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked this app, u never get tired of the games because there is always a different goal. I recommend this app to anyone.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|loved this game on my iPhone. Happy it finally came for my droid! runs great on my HTC One X but it's really fast on my Nexus 7. Fix it halfbrick!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Was amazed of the imagination of the author. Held me spell bound through the whole trilogy.<br />Read all three books in one week.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Sequels.... so people say.  The truth is that this sequel to Phantom of the Opera was a joy to watch and hear.  It did not bother me that much of the music sounded much like the original score.  The plot was fitting for an opera. The production was great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this trilogy. They are powerful books. I saw the first movie and read the 2nd two books.  They get sadder or rather more depressing with each one.
1400069289|4.0|I really liked this book.  It is not a self help book.  It doesn't tell you how you go about changing your habits.  What it does it explain habits so you can go about finding your own answers.  Very interesting facts and the psychology of how they recognized the habits in people to get them to buy their products, etc.
B007TML4EI|5.0|finally a good faotd. there's been absolutely terrible faotds. anyone whose been regularly checking the appstore for the past two months knows what I mean. I AM NOT A DEVELOPER!!! this is really a good game for anyone who is getting bored with all of their old ones and wants one that makes you work for it. it gives me a great little feeling when I get one to work, but it is also really funny to se Marvin fall apart. Amazon, the faotds need more of these kind of games. Finally!!!!!!!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Awesome movie, can not wait for the next two movies. A very good, clean story with morals and values. Excellent details for the characters and flows well with the book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game. it has fun levels the only thing that is not so great is the cost of the games and home many times I have reply games I have already won to get to play new ones.
B00884GR0W|5.0|its great like a realistic minecraft after a few updates when there are tons of things to craft it will be beget but it needs something like survival mode on minevraft there needs to be hunger monsters spawning at night but its a great game
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I started reading this book with high expectations, simply because of the publicity it has been getting the past few months. I did not know what to expect as I cracked open the first page. I have read every detailed word that this book has provided, and I assure you, it will keep you hooked. I took my Fifty Shades every where. I read it first thing in the morning, during my breaks at work, and right before I went to bed. Every page is filled with a delicious new conflict, and an amazing shock. You can not just be satisfied with book one. You NEED to buy Fifty Shades Darker, as book one leaves you with a heart-wrenching cliff hanger.<br />Cheers!<br />Amy
159102594X|2.0|Though Abercrombie writes fairly good action scenes, all the other elements of good fantasy fiction-- believable characters, compelling story, engaging writing-- are nowhere to be found in this overlong and borderline-pointless book. His characters (of which there are too, too many) are not just one-dimensional, but actually the same character with different names. His story never really gels, and just seems to go on and on for no good reason. And the writing is just plain sloppy. Over and over I had to reread whole passages, to see what the author really meant to say. Take, for example, this passage from the chapter titled, \\"The Ideal Audience\\":<br /><br />\\"Arch Lector Sult was standing by his huge window when Glokta arrived, tall and imposing as always in his spotless white coat...\\"<br /><br />If you follow the basic rules of English, \\"tall and imposing\\" should refer to Glokta. As you read the rest of the sentence, however, it becomes clear that Abercrombie meant for the adjectives to refer to Arch Lector Sult, who is always depicted as tall and regal and wearing a white coat. (By this time, the writer has established that Glokta is a cripple who cannot walk unless supported by a cane.)<br /><br />The book is full of amateurish writing like this. If not for the fight sequences, the imaginative job titles, and the colorful character names (the \\"practical\\" named \\"Severard\\" being a good example of the latter two), I would give this book just one star.<br /><br />I am told that books two and three are very good. Sadly, because this author lost me on this particular chapter, I can't be bothered to find out for myself.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Wow! I love this case. Get it, you will not be disappointed. I have had many other cases costing a lot more, but I like this one the most.
B004PA50JM|3.0|There's a song on this album entitled It Happened Today. It features the vocals of Eddie Vedder. It's a sing-a-long of sorts; though lyrics lead way to a wordless chant about a third in; a song presented along rock guitars, a stomping drum beat and what sounds like happy church tambourines. What it exudes is the kind of folk party vibe you haven't heard from REM in a long time. I wish the other melodies on Collapse Into Now were as uplifting.<br /><br />It's their best album since Reveal, peppier than Around The Sun and easier on the ears than Accelerate, but half of the songs fall short, at-least at the chorus where melody counts the most. The Oh My Heart ballad, on which the band sound like old men having heart attacks, is a grower, but Michael Stipe yelling \\"discoverer\\" over and over (Discoverer) sounds silly. And Andre 3000 did the \\"Hey-ya\\" thing, Every Day Is Yours To Win, better years ago.<br /><br />Uberlin flies high, thanks mostly to Mike Mills harmonizing Michael Stipe's vocals in the background, a technique the band should make use of much more often. Blue, in which Stipe talks his poetry instead of singing it, is a nice showcase for Patti Smith. But, even with an escalator at her feet, guest Peaches can't help lift Alligator Aviator Autopilot Antimatter. Mine Taste Like Honey, another throwback to Accelerate, is more bitter than sweet.<br /><br />There aren't any musical calamities. Nothing even comes close to countering It Happened Today on the low end of the spectrum. It's just that, as is the case with REM's last few albums, there are too many mediocre songs. I guess that gives some unintentional meaning to the word \\"now\\". The band, in other words, while still one of my favorites, is merely another group of aging rock stars trying, only almost successfully, to revive their former glory.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a great game! It is similar to Pixel Perfect for the Kindle, but since it is in color, it makes it more difficult and much more fun to play. The resulting pictures are also much more detailed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book could not put it down. Loved the writing very interesting. I thought the conflict in the book was enjoyable to read.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|New options like moveable spikes, combined with the original gameplay make this new game a winner in my humble opinion.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This book definitely did NOT let me down as a Maze Runner prequel! Lots of detail about how the apocalypse hit, its impact on civilization, and how the virus infected the survivors and the chaos that ensues. But it left me wanting more!! I hope Dashner continues the saga so we can find out what happens in the following years...like what happens to the little girl on \\"the other side\\", more detail of the forming of the maze and the boys who are placed inside, and a more in-depth look at what Teresa and Thomas' lives were like before and after they started working for the cure.
0312641893|5.0|Based on an ARC<br /><br />I absolutely adored this book. It's like Meyer got into my head with this retelling. I absolutely loved picking out the details from the original fairy tale. But this isn't what stood out for me.<br /><br />The world building was utterly fabulous. The post-apocalyptic/dystopian feel with a little steampunk mixed in, should appeal to many. I was completely invested into this book from page one. This definitely isn't the fairy tale we all remember.<br /><br />The characters are another standout of the novel. So realistic that I could identify with. They draw you in until you feel for them. I was on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I really want to know more about the Lunars. I have a feeling we just hit the tip of the iceberg with them. That cliffhanger at the certainly says so!<br /><br />I'm such a fan of fairy tales. The Lunar Chronicles will introduce others we know and love. I personally can't wait to see how Meyer handles those. Cinder gives the series a great foundation to start on.
1451629192|3.0|Jaycee Dugard was abducted at 11 years old. She lived with her abductors; a pedophile and his wife; for 18 years. But she wasn't held captive for all that time. That's the problem with her story. She was certainly a helpless victim in June of 1991 when Phillip Garrido zapped her with his stun gun, put her in his car, imprisoned her in his home and started using her as his personal sex slave. But by the time Jaycee; now living under the secret identity of \\"Allissa\\"; a 29-year-old mother of two girls of her own; was discovered by the police and reunited with her real family, she'd become a willing participant. That's a fact she attributes to being \\"conditioned\\" as she tries to play the helpless victim role all the way to the end, but she's full of shit. She had countless chances to flee; at one point, she's strolling thru a crowded shopping mall without Phillip; but chose not to.<br /><br />Her story is nevertheless an intriguing one. The style of writing she displays here is sometimes childish and redundant, especially at the beginning, but the personal journals she was thoughtful enough to write over the years, which she apparently saved, help her do a fine job of revisiting the past. That is assuming all of the details she includes; the rape scenes, which are the most interesting parts for me, are surprisingly graphic; are, in fact, true. This is just one side of a long story, after all. My only major complaints about this book are the \\"Reflection\\" bits, which take the reader, or listener, from a factual account of the past to a present-day psychological analysis in a jolt, and the fact that it should've ended at the Discovery And Reunion chapter; the ending of which is genuinely poignant; because the rest could've been summed down to a short epilogue.<br /><br />marcellee.com

0525953728|5.0|Thanks to Mark Owen for writing No Easy Day as it is the ultimate detailed book on the raid that took out UBL!!  Easy to read book, full of details of the raid, does not reveal any secrets, is non-political.<br />The book is about 1/2 totally about the ramp up training and the raid itself, and a little at front on some other aspects of the authors SEAL experience.  It is totally engrossing, and many friends have read it straight through in one sitting.<br />It took me about 2 1/2 days to read due to other issues in my life, but I savored every word.<br />The color photographs are great, the section of black and white isometric plans of the UBL compound and routes of the various team members, and the entry points etc are all well done and add to the explanation of a complex raid.<br />I bought this book thru Amazon and it arrived on day one of publication, and I am 1000% behind this book, its author, and the account of the raid presented here.
0812993292|5.0|We all have heard and perhaps even read about the aging man or woman who late in life decides to take the roadtrip of a lifetime one last time as a form of redemption or self-discovery.  This is such a story, except this is on foot the slow way.<br /><br />The chapters are slow at first but each chapter reveals sometime about the three main characters:  Harold Fry, the just-retired brewery salesman, his wife Maureen, and Queenie Hennessy, with whom Harold worked 20 years ago but who had to abruptly quit her job at the brewery.<br /><br />The book starts out with Harold receiving a letter from Queenie saying she has inoperable cancer.  On a whim, he decides to walk across England to see Queenie one last time.  He leaves behind his wife, who learns only afterwards that he has left to see an old friend.  But why does he walk instead of drive, or get a train or bus ticket?  The constant stays in village B&Bs must surely take a toll on his retirement fund.  The reason for the tortuous walk is revealed on page 86:  \\"In walking, [Harold] freed the past that he had spent twenty years seeking to avoid and now it chattered and played through his head with a wild energy that was its own.  He no longer saw distances in terms of miles.  He measured it with his remembering.\\"  Every subsequent conversation he has with strangers reveals a bit more about his past, his marriage to his wife, and their lives together.<br /><br />There is much bittersweetness to this plot, but it makes for an engaging read, with episodes we all can relate to:  lost love, failed love, sadness, tragedy, humor, understanding, compassion.  Every day that Harold is walking, he meets interesting people and or experiences something that helps him understand himself more.  There's the silver-haired gentleman, a group of cycling moms, the immigrant doctor, and ultimately the \\"new beginning.\\" I've met strange people along my many backpacking and road trips, so there's nothing too unusual about opening up to strangers.  This story reads as if this really happened, and in essence it has happened to all of us.  The end completes the journey both spiritually and physically, and perhaps some will find it satisfying.<br /><br />Rachel Joyce is a talented writer.  This was a very engrossing read.  I am looking forward to more such stories by this gifted author.gers.  This story reads as if this really happened, and in essence it has happened to all of us.

B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Don't waste your time...this is one of the worst books I have read in a long time.  The story is flat out unbelievable and the characters unlikeable.  Travis is manic and Abby is an idiot.  I'm an even bigger idiot for wasting my time.

0345803485|2.0|I must start with the fact that I would not consider myself \\"well-read\\", however, it is apparently that the writer of these books isn't really a true \\"author\\" either.  The books are fun, as far as the plot and some of the salacious activities and such, but I have to say that I know A LOT of twenty-somethings out there and I can assure you they do not speak the way the characters do in the books.  That is the part that makes it very hard to \\"buy\\" into their characters.  Most of the verbs are entirely too obscure and over-used.  Not only do \\"normal\\" day to day people not use these words, they certainly don't use them as often as the writer of this book does.  The word \\"stills\\" happens so often that I should have counted them up because I am sure it is in the hundreds.  Would I suggest this to a friend, oh probably because there is some fun to them, but as far as well-written books, ummmmmmm no.  Let me put it this way, the Twilight series is 100 time better written.  Does that put it in perspective?
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved every bit of this book....very sad that I have to wait until April for the second book.  Very well written...KUDOS Jamie McGuire I think you just might be my new favorite author!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Childish& amateurish -how this book became a best seller is beyond my understanding. The first two chapters were enough junk writing. In my estimate it is trashy, childish & not worth of further comment!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was thrilled when I found this app! those of you trying to pin through the website using the kindle fire understand why! this app is way easier to use than the website on kindle and is super fast. my only complaint would be that sometimes the app won't open on the first attempt and it occasionally force closes.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Abby is a preppy freshman at college eager to start a new life for herself and erase her past. Travis is the resident bad boy looking to conquer the entire female population at Eastern. They meet each other at an underground fight to which Travis is the star of and after Abby refuses to be wooed by his good looks and quick pick up lines, it becomes Travis' mission to get to know Abby better. The two quickly become friends, which confuses every single person around them. Travis isn't known to have female friends and Abby's clueless about their friendship becoming anything else. Both Abby and Travis eventually explore a relationship that could be called anything but chaotic.<br /><br />What is there to say about this book that you don't immediately get from the title? Well, for starters, Abby and Travis have the most complicated, passionate, dysfunctional, crazy relationship ever! They're always fighting about something, and while I always want to take Abby's side (because Travis uses women and leads a reckless life) I actually found myself sympathizing with Travis. In his defense, Abby knew what she was getting into when she met him. I feel like the author creates Abby to be more naive than a normal girl would probably be. She's extremely stubborn, and that will likely have other readers screaming at their kindles just like I was.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say read this book just to get an idea of how a relationship should not function. It is pretty entertaining and I can honestly say I never knew what was going to happen next.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Excellent cliffhanger. Lots of themes within the main story. Couldn't put it down. Loved it.<br />Connelly aces it again. Looking forward to his next book.

This watch has lots of numbers.  I explained & before I knew it he was asking me Grandma do you want to know what time it is?

B00422LESO|4.0|This story started a bit slow, but picked up speed as you go through the trials and tribulations of our heroine Jane.  Caught up in \\"All things Austen\\", she can't find and keep a boyfriend that measures up to Mr. Darcy.  She gets a chance to get out of her Austen funk by going to a place that plays to her fantasy in Austenland.  She gets to play an Austen-like character and she meets other people who are either playing characters from Jane Austen or are there like her playing out their own Austen fantasy. She begins to get an idea that she has been the cause to all her relationships because of her hangup with Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice, that she has not been seeing the real man with real emotions, not the false ones expected from her DVD/book characters.  In the end, she realizes what she has been missing out on and surprises herself be finding the real deal.  A good, funny, thoughtful and insightful look into the Austen mindset.  Would recommend this book.
B005LAII62|1.0|I want to start off by stating that I don't care that there was a gay character.  In fact, I walked out of the theater long before the movie ended.  This movie was just not good.  I started to fall asleep and my 6 year old daughter asked if we could leave.  We love unusual animated films like Coraline and Corpse Bride, so I thought we'd enjoy this one.  Wrong.  The plot was boring and did not hold our interest.  I am surprised by all the good reviews.  To each their own, I suppose.
B0088TG252|4.0|Good, but not great.  The action keeps moving for most of the movie.  Gets a bit graphic and some bloodshed if you are sensitive to that.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|There are LOT of great songs on this record, very little 'filler'. Lots of layering of guitars and electronic effects. It makes me think of the spiritual successor to Nine Inch Nails, without the angst and fury.
B002VBV1S6|4.0|A refreshingly different setting, interesting characters with detailed back stories, and an engaging plot... what's not to like?<br /><br />OK, a couple of things...  there was some extraneous writing here and there - for example the scenes of Locke trying to find new clothes were long and, in the end, unnecessary; and there were a few silly bits (fighting leaping sharks from platforms?  Really?), but is fantasy after all.<br /><br />A high point for me was the world building.  The thought put into the political and cultural infrastructure is outstanding.  In fact it could have easily been a longer book had the history been explored more.  The writing is also very good, in my opinion. Lots of humour mixed with generous dollops of pathos.<br /><br />It definitely left me with an appetite for more. I'll be getting the next in the series soon.

B005LAIGN2|3.0|Red Tails, 2012 film   This movie was inspired by true events. It starts in the air war over Europe where P-51 fighters escort B-17 bombers. Some fighters are distracted by decoys so the main force of enemy fighters attack the bombers and shoot them down. Next four obsolete P-40s fly over Italy in 1944. One attacks a truck on a highway, then they attack a steam locomotive train. They return to base and read the news. There is a discussion in the Pentagon about this unit. The talk tells about the conditions. One pilot visits a local family. The pilots talk about combat. &#34;Operation Shingle&#34; will place them in support of a beach landing. They approach enemy fighters and fire on them. Four follow a fighter to attack an enemy airfield and destroy ME-109s on the ground. The colonel needs fighter escorts for the B-17s to reduce losses.   One pilot visits the officer's club and starts a fight. A DC-3 brings a colonel with news of new P-51 fighters for their group. Lt. Joe Little rejoins his unit. The Colonel explains why bombers must be defended. Their new fighters will have red tails (for easy identification). They begin to escort a hundred bombers through flak. This time no bombers are lost. One pilot is wounded. Another attacks a war ship. One plane crash lands. A captured pilot is sent to a POW camp. Film cameras recorded the attacks on that war ship. Bomber flyers thank them. They are warned about the German jet planes. The prisoners plan an escape from the POW camp. They will attack a tank factory on the outskirts of Berlin. The Red Tails will fly the first leg. But their replacement does not show up. ME-262's attack the mission with their faster speed. But the P-51's shoot them down (and take casualties).   They stay &#34;on mission&#34;. Sophia gets the bad news. The Colonel talks to his men. The captured pilot returns alive. The Distinguished Unit Citation is given to the 332nd fighter group. They received 90 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Sixty were killedin action. The credits at the end thank the Czech Construction Crew. Production services provided by the Croatia Unit, and filmed at Prague Studios ; also Italy and Slovenia. This is worth watching once but it could have used a better script or story. &#34;Flyboys&#34; or &#34;The Battle of Britain&#34; were better movies.   &#34;Double Victory&#34; provides a history of the war from the viewpoint of African-Americans. The 1925 War College Report shows the attitudes of that era. The P-51 was the most advanced propeller-driven fighter in the war. The life expectancy of a fighter pilot was 15 to 22 missions. The ME-262 fighter was 100 mph faster than the P-51, but were shot down by P-51s (and Spitfires and Typhoons). [These propeller-driven fighters were more maneuverable with a shorter turning radius.]
B000R9RGF6|5.0|I purchased this CD because it includes \\"Divenire\\", the music in the hp \\"Make a Difference\\" ad, which played frequently during the recent summer olympics.  (If you don't remember the ad, you can Google it!)  Divenire is, of course only one of twelve tracks in the album, all of which are arranged by Ludovico Einaudi.  All are beautiful, light and delicate, and make wonderful background music for relaxation.  I recommend the album and give it five stars.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This book is \\"unforgettable\\" but in a bad way. I will always remember struggling to get through this book because 1. It's the most I've paid for a Kindle book and 2. From all the positive reviews it should have been a book I loved.<br /><br />I've tried to think of at least one positive thing I can say and believe about this book. I thought of one...only one positive remark and that is this Author can write. The story, as it slowly evolved, was convoluted and complicated and would take a talented writer to do what she did. What I disliked the most was there are very few likable characters within this story and the characters I could have liked were not fully developed.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewers who basically think the ending was a mess. It was! I too felt the Author ran out of speed and was unsure of how to end the mess she created. I read 2-3 books a week. This book took me almost two weeks to finish. I hate that I wasted 2 weeks of my life in the belief that it had to get better and realizing after reading the final page that it didn't get better...it only got worse. It makes me sad that I have to write a bad review. I wish I could come up with one redeeming reason to read this book...I can't.

0525478817|5.0|Heartwrenching, beautiful, genuine, moving, sarcastic, witty, meaningful.  All these words come to mind when I think about The Fault in Our Stars.  However, they seem so inadequate.  I knew going into this book what to expect.  You don't read a book about teenagers with cancer expecting happily ever afters and picture perfect memories.  In that way, I anticipated a strong emotional reaction and the need for my trusty box of tissues; however, I wasn't prepared for the depth of my response and the realism Mr. Green portrayed.  I was transfixed by this novel.  In fact, I listened to it in one sitting, totally unable to stop listening.<br /><br />The plot is straightforward and simple.  There aren't a lot of twists and turns.  Not much in the way of mystery or surprises.  It's real.  In my life I've watched two dearly loved individuals die from cancer.  Both young.  One slowly, excruciatingly so.  And one incredibly quickly (3 weeks from the day of diagnosis).  It's an ugly process, literally and emotionally.  Your body is not your body anymore.  You are not even you anymore in many ways.  The Fault in Our Stars deals with this both respectfully and realistically.<br /><br />One of the most amazing parts of this novel were Mr. Green's characters.  Teenagers with cancer are going to have a certain amount of maturity combined with a bit of awkwardness compared to their healthy peers.  They have an \\"elephant in the room\\" with them at all times leading to a feeling of \\"otherness.\\"  They also are forced to consider the likelihood of an early death while their peers have more of an invinsibility complex.  This leads to characters who are grappling with life or death issues in a time of life that is awkward and frustrating enough on it's own.  Green does an amazing job introducing us to very real, exquisite characters who are placed in these circumstances.<br /><br />Hazel, the main character, has cancer and knows it will most likely kill her one day.  For now though, the cancer has been held at bay by medications.  Hazel is alive but she's not really living.  She's a realist, rather sarcastic, and rather depressed.<br /><br />Augustus/Gus is a vibrant, handsome, incredibly sacrificial individual who had cancer which took one of his legs.  He's in remission and lives life to the fullest.  He's a romantic and a philosopher.  When he sees what he wants, he goes for it.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus are characters you can feel and see and hear.  There were moments I had to remind myself they aren't real people.  I adored their banter and their frankness.  They weren't romanticized or perfect.  Hazel and Gus have a realistic relationship.  They are opposite personalities in many ways, so they disagree and sometimes get very frustrated with one another.  Their reasons for living and being and doing are very different; yet, they are two teenagers who fall in love, and through their quasi-mature yet awkward personalities, they make it work and find something beautiful.  Augustus and Hazel are exactly what each other need in order to live fully in their story and become better people.<br /><br />To sum things up, The Fault in our Stars is gritty and compelling, sarcastic and delightful, heartwrenching and romantic.  It is not for the faint-hearted.  You will cry ridiculous amounts of tears.  John Green's novel is captivatingly beautiful; full of love, life and loss; and delivered with a hefty dose of reality.  Highly recommended.
B008YP272M|5.0|A sobering read, noteworthy for its brutally honest chronicle of what it's like to suffer the dying processes associated with terminal cancer. No false heroics, no grandiose philosophies, no warm and fuzzy faux-romanticism, no deathbed conversion from his avowed atheism, no retreat from reality, just Hitch telling it like it is. In similar vein, a fine afterword and testimony to the man by the person who perhaps knew him best - his wife. Read it and you may not be uplifted, but you will perhaps be enlightened.
B004T4LUPW|2.0|Do not find that it is any better than the \\"on phone\\" product.  Have already removed from my phone.  Can not recommend.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I can't say enough about the series. This is a must watch. Get season one and two together and don't be surprised when you finish them both in a week, this show is that good. Also, hurry up because season 3 is starting in October. And if me liking it isn't enough my wife loves it as well and that says a whole lot.
0857685848|5.0|As noted by other reviewers, this artwork is both beautiful and diverse.  Some of it is so realistic it almost appears photographic.  Some is a little stiff, almost like a still life with dinosaurs.  Other art included here verges on fantasy art with dinosaurs portrayed in deeply intense colors.  There are also some terrific fold-out landscapes of prehistoric life.  No one is going to like all of these styles equally, but anyone who enjoys the portrayal of dinosaurs and other prehistoric life should enjoy most of them.  If you read a lot about dinosaurs, some of the images will be familiar, but I also realized that pictures I had seen in other books had often been truncated and I was now looking at the complete artwork.  I am also delighted to see paleo-artists get some solid recognition.  Most of the best modern artists of prehistoric life are represented here, and many of these people know as much about dinosaur anatomy as hard scientists.  At least one of the artists has a sense of humor in naming his work (T-Rex Enjoying Seafood). I was also surprised at the very reasonable price for such a beautiful book. This belongs on the same shelf as Richard Milner's stunningly beautiful recent book on pioneering artist Charles R. Knight. [ASIN:0810984792 Charles R. Knight: The Artist Who Saw Through Time]]

I am thankful to have the opportunity to read her story from her perspective and hear the personaL growth that she has gone through inspite of deplorable circumstances.  I enjoyed this book, although at times it was very hard to read!  I wish her and her daughters well as they continue to heal and grow.
B0053O89YM|5.0|This show is really excellent.  I never imagined that a show about lawyers and courts could be so good. A show doesn't need any shooting or explosions to be riveting, it just needs a good story and great character development -- which this show has week after week.
B000002OX5|3.0|I've long loved Tommy and Who's Next, and after falling in love with Quadrophenia just this year I decided to check out the rest of The Who's catalogue. This is the first early Who album I've heard start-to-finish. The concept is neat- the album is made to resemble a broadcast by Radio London, with station ID jingles and fake commercials for real-world products. The spontaneity of a radio broadcast gives the album a unique energy, allowing an even flow between different styles of songs. It runs out of steam in the original album's B-side as the commercials and jingles disappear and the songs become less inspired, capped off with the whiny Rael. As of this album The Who had still not realized the revolution in sound recording that was occuring at the time, so The Who Sell Out still retains the crunchy, tinny, and washed out sound quality prevalent in the era. The CD I bought was the single disk 1995 reissue which contained some good bonus tracks. Overall, The Who Sell Out is a good album, but nothing compared to the 3 I already knew.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Nick and Amy are about to celebrate their 5 year anniversary. Nick wakes up the morning of, sees his wife fixing breakfast, and then goes to work. He gets a call from a neighbor that something is amiss at his house and rushes back to find furniture overturned and his wife gone. A missing persons case ensues, and the reader follows Nick and the police as they try to discover what happened to Nick's wife.<br /><br />I really liked this book. It's very well-written and I liked the dual-narrative structure. The husband, Nick, narrates events happening from the day of his wife's disappearance, forward. His wife, Amy, narrates events via her diary entries, which start from the day they met, up until her disappearance. These chapters are woven together like a patchwork quilt. Or more like a puzzle, in which the pieces don't quite fit, and more than a few are missing.<br /><br />Nick is an unreliable narrator. Although he's telling the story, and the reader is right there with him as events unfold, we find that we don't really trust him. There are gaps of time at crucial points in his narrative. He sees his wife for breakfast and then goes to work. But the reader later finds that there is a huge chunk of time between which these events occur. So where was he? Also, as Nick narrates, he constantly alludes to the fact that he is lying to the police. As the reader we don't know why he is lying. Is he guilty? The husband is usually the primary suspect, right? The book takes place in modern day, and the author is aware that many readers are familiar with popular crime shows such as CSI, or real-life cases such as Scott Peterson. It usually is the husband. Gillian Flynn toys with the audience by neither confirming nor denying whether the husband is the killer. He's the narrator, so the reader immediately wants to identify with him, but Flynn does a great job of planting doubt. Nick certainly isn't acting like an innocent man. Innocent men don't normally lie to the police. But itcan't be him because that would be too obvious. Or would it?<br /><br />The story is told in 3 parts. Part 1 uses the dual narrative structure to describe the events that happen immediately following Amy's disappearance, as well as tell the story about how a marriage might unravel. Both Nick and Amy talk about their marriage and how it seems to be falling apart. Nick narrates from the present, and talks about the fact that his wife seems to no longer be enchanted with him, always finding fault. Amy narrates through her diary entries, and describes the initial excitement of falling in love and describes trying to please a husband who becomes increasingly aloof. It seems like a classic case of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, common communication issues that every couple goes through. Except, again, certain things don't add up. There are conflicts in their narratives about crucial decisions which leave the reader wondering who to believe. Parts 2 and 3 and expand on the story and add quite a few twists and turns.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read in a while. There have been some complaints that the ending was a bit too open-ended. I was ok with this. The story ends and it's up to the reader to draw his own conclusions about what might happen next. I will definitely check out more from this author.
B0080OK7YC|3.0|I'm a \\"gleek\\" who has enjoyed quite a lot of their remakes, but this is not my favorite of their cast albums for content or performances.  It's just OK for me. They tried to showcase some of the \\"seniors\\" who started in season one but were not hired orginally as lead singers.  The voices that mainly sang background over the first couple of seasons could be heard on this album along with some of the stronger vocalists, and they made me wish I had only purchased the individual songs that I liked on this album.

B0094ZJ7HO|4.0|When a band releases its \\"Best Of B-Sides\\" record, that's usually an ominous cue that they might be running out of ideas. And yes, I know that on the last tour, Elbow did like a 5-song ballad break in the middle of every set while the band sat around a table and drank whiskey in celebration of their 20th anniversary together as Guy Garvey serenaded them. There's just one problem with the stereotype: this is actually a terrific album that might be better than one or two of their studio albums. Obviously, it being a B-side collection, there's no lead single here, but so what? There wasn't one on their last record either. Instead you get 13 moody meditations on everything from the price of phone sex to the War On Terror.<br /><br />The reason this record is so good is because Elbow cranks out two or three of these murky, whiskey-and-cigarette infused distorted discontented grumbling drifters for every one of their stadium stompers, and so a ton of gems get left on the cutting room floor for every session. To wit, with their most recent album Build A Rocket Boys!, the lovely little tune Buffalo Ghosts got B-sided while the mail-it-in With Love went on the record. Problem solved: Buffalo Ghosts is here. And don't get me started on the gorgeous EP-that-never-happened that the Leaders Of The Free World sessions produced. Suffice to say that that album's title track, a political stomper that the band still plays at shows, wasn't even the best War On Terror song. That's here, it's called The Long War Shuffle, it'll never get 10,000 people clapping in unison, but it's terrific and even now is more politically salient than 90% of the contents of Newsweek Magazine.<br /><br />For American fans of this band, their B-sides have been almost impossible to get up to now by any legal means. Hard core fans know that some of the best numbers still didn't make the cut (can we now get a Dead In The Boot B-Sides with Vum Garda, Brave New Shave, The Crow, Wurzel, the acoustic About Time, Puckfair, Suffer, Stumble, Live On My Mind, The Drunken Engineer, Strangeways, Hotel Istanbul, Kisses, the August And September cover and about four others please?) but this is an overdue remedy.uckfair, Suffer, Stumble, Live On My Mind, The Drunken Engineer, Strangeways, Hotel Istanbul, Kisses, the August And September cover and about four others please?) but this is an overdue remedy.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I think the thing that kept me reading all 3 books was that it was a fun, \\"indiscreet\\" way to learn more about bondage.  Other than that it brings some yawns here and there.  If the drama was cut out and more of the phycol orgy was presented in depth it would've been 5 stars for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought it, but this book was mind blowingly intense. What a great beach read, and my husband didn't mind me reading it .
B0065GC0BA|3.0|Me Before You treats very serious matters about which I believe it is not too easy to write and I am glad some authors, like Moyes,  are concerned by these topics. This book is done a bit sentimentally, the style is not too remarkable, it is rather popular and not very demanding, thus allowing you to read the book in one go thanks to the captivating storyline and likable characters. But it does not leave you puzzled in the end, although may evoke a couple of tears at some places. Overall, a pleasant read.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|The autobiography section towards the beginning is a sticking point in a lot of negative reviews here. I admit, I almost put the book down after a couple chapters of this section. But, this novel really excels once it gets past the beginning, which in a lot of ways lays down a foundation for the rest of it. The characters can be unlikeable but many of even their most hateful traits can be related to almost universally. The author has a deep sympathy and love for all of them. They find themselves in emotionally unworkable positions, and they can be very selfish, but I couldn't stop thinking about their struggles long after putting the book down. There is nothing particularly new about any of the situations detailed in their stories, but they are told in a freshly minimal style against the backdrop of 21rst century current events. There are many great insights into the paradoxical nature of freedom, in American society and in interpersonal relationships. I felt strongly enough to right my first Amazon book review.
0525953728|1.0|I was about to buy this but after discussing this and seeing the reaction from Navy Seals, SAS, marines etc i understand that this guy has betrayed all of them. He has probably put many lives at risk now by outlining how this top secret mission was done. Disgraceful.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I haven't actually finished the book yet but I've read the two previous and I am enjoying the read.  The author is able to make the characters come alive and the story is intricately woven and I have no doubt it will come together in the end.  It is too bad there won't be more books by this author because I would buy them for sure.

B0010SKUYM|4.0|In short - if you enjoy fictional novels, this is a fun read.<br /><br />The pacing is so well done that I have rarely thought to myself that I was bored or expecting something to happen. Vice versa, it's also not to quick, and doesn't feel like to many things are happening at once.<br /><br />The story is vary intreguing and I'm excited to see how it develops over the course of the next books.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This story kept me wondering where it was going through the entire read, loved it until the end...if you want to call it that. After all the cleverness, the ending was completely anticlimactic-a real disappointment. I was mad at the end because I expected something and got nothing - literally for an ending. I won't waste time on another read of hers for fear of the same kind of ending.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent series that kept me reading and couldn't put the book down.  I recommend the Hunger Games to everyone.  Definitely a 5 star series.

B005LAII7G|5.0|DREDD 3D<br /><br />Excellent movie for the budget. The spirit of Dredd is here in spades. It is not perfect but bloody imaginative.<br /><br />First the camera work is fantastic. This is really a film to see in 3D. Not because of fancy Hollywood CGI but because of brilliant artistic imagery.<br /><br />MegaCity looks European in the visuals and vistas but maybe for Americans the vans and cars just look weird. So it works!<br /><br />Pete Travis' direction is solid and Alex Garland's script is informed and funny. Would loved to have heard Dredd say \\"Drokk\\" just once!<br /><br />Karl Urban is Dredd. He needs to be warmed too but he plays the part very well. Olivia Thirlby is also excellent as Anderson. Lena Headey is very convincing in her Motherly role.<br /><br />I do hope this becomes a franchise. Dredd is as important as Bond. Show him some respect.<br /><br />Brilliant!!!!!
B007IYWY3C|5.0|Wow, it's so great to get a video of Florence & the Machine. Her voice is so phenomenal & it's even better to watch her sing! MTV really did it right doing an unplugged performance. I think I actually prefer this kind of performance better than some of the over-production on some cd's. Her voice is an over-production in itself!
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|Based on the popular comic book series, \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" follows the young man named Tintin and his dog Snowy who after Tintin purchases a model ship gets thrust into a plot that involves ancient scrolls and a lost ship that holds something very valuable and there are some that would kill to have it. This story is presented with some breathtaking computer graphics that truly advance motion capture technology to new heights, the characters look real, the action scenes are well done and the whole presentation is quite good.<br /><br />The only real faults may be the story is a tad basic and thus this movie relies on more action than anything else, there is some good humor throughout though thankfully. Director Steven Speilberg does heavily make up for the abysmal \\"Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" and the remake of \\"War of the Worlds\\" with this breezy and fun movie. Its not really for small kids as there is some violence and bloodshed, the cast is also very fitting with voices provided by Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Toby Jones and others.<br /><br />I did enjoy the visuals and the pace of the movie, it wasn't too long and kept up a good pace, sure the story is somewhat lacking but its fun to watch. *** out of 4 stars.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator. and how I can see exactly what added at the bottom and how it feels the screen :-))
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Loved this movie, reminiscent of 50's sci-fi plots, but done with all the power CG can bring to a film.  Do it again!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book that kept me on the edge of my seat!!  I would highly recommend it because it kept me guessing the whole time.  I especially loved the two main characters' voices, which changed from Nick to Amy to Nick and back to Amy throughout the whole book. The author wrote it so that you totally believed every word and thought.  Nick comes home one day and finds his wife, Amy gone - without a trace.  Nick becomes the main suspect and I won't tell you more because I don't want to ruin it.  Let's just say, you're never sure who is naughty or nice, lying or telling the truth, crazy or sane.  Great read!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Wife and I enjoyed the movie.  The story line was unique and the acting and production was good.  I would highly recommend it; however the themes are not for children
B005LAIGLO|3.0|Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg, \\"Shooter\\") is a long time criminal/smuggler who gives up his life of crime to be with his wife (Kate Beckingsale) and kids. Things seem just peachy but of course this wouldn't make for much of a movie unless a ruthless drug lord (Giovanni Ribisi, \\"Gone In Sixty Seconds\\") decides to threaten Chris's and more importantly his family's well being.<br /><br />This forces Chris to revert to his old ways to protect those that he loves, so the movie does become one chase scene after another as Chris is determined to take everyone down. Its somewhat similar to \\"Shooter\\" in that this flick is nothing more than a vehicle for Wahlberg who does well in most every movie he's in, even with the limted material films like this provides.<br /><br />At least its fun to watch at times, cause the story and dialogue are pretty standard as are most of the performances. Having Walhberg in this really does elevate this basic action flick, as its pretty bare bones beyond the action. However I enjoyed a good amount of it even if I've seen it all before. ** out of 4 stars.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was very impressed with this book. As others have mentioned, it reminds me of the Name of the Wind, both a coming of age story, along with the \\"Chronicler\\" aspect of recording their life \\"after the fact\\".<br /><br />I regularly was impressed with the writing style, particularly considering it's an indi book. I don't remember finding a single typo, grammar error, etc. All together, it seemed incredibly polished. The only \\"unpolished\\" aspect of the book is the cover (that I'm not a huge fan of :)<br /><br />All together, I'm very impressed with the book and looking forward to reading the next book in the series, which I hope will be just as polished as the first.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|One of my all-time favorite books.  Laugh out loud funny, and intriguing at the same time.  Wish there were more authors like this one.  It's one of the few books I would read again--will have to put it on my Kindle now that it is available.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|So a few years back there was a planet discovered that was remarkably similar to Earth, to contact and gather more information on this planet there was something created called The Beacon Project which decided to send a transmission to this planet called Planet G. Now we cut to a man named Alex (Taylor Kitsch, \\"John Carter\\") at a bar with his brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard, \\"Melancholia\\"), after Alex's failed attempt at impressing a girl at the bar named Sam (Brooklyn Decker, \\"Just Go With It\\") ends up getting an ultimatum from Stone, either join the Navy or else.<br /><br />So some time later we cut to both brothers in the Navy, Alex is together with Sam (some guys have all the luck) and along with the Shane (Liam Neeson, \\"Taken\\") the Admiral of the entire fleet. After some more exposition while out at sea some aliens decide to attack various locations around the world. These attackers are obviously from this planet G and Shane along with his sailors must do their best to turn back this attack and drive the aliens out of our world.<br /><br />There's some good humor in this one, of course a lot of it is unintentional thanks to the complete and utter ridiculous nature of the film. Its based on the popular family game in name only as I don't recall ever saying \\"Aliens sunk my battleship\\", the budget is enormous just over $200 million, the cast is decent even including singer Rihanna, the story is so bad but honestly its also an entertaining mess.<br /><br />I do credit the filmmakers for working with actual Naval officers to lend some more realism to this flick, even having a good amount of actual Navy members as part of the cast. This did show that they actually cared about making sure the Naval aspects were accurate and not just made up. Of course that doesn't stop the director and writers from taking liberties with how silly and ludicrious the story and plot is, along with the goofy and stilted dialogue.<br /><br />The cast at least seems to be having fun, though how Neeson was cast in this goofy flick is beyond me, however I must commend them for casting Brooklyn Decker who is just stunningly beautiful. The special effectts are very good as are the action sequences, it does breeze by a lot of the time and while I expected to hate this movie I found myself enjoying a good amount of it. Its not nearly as good or as fun as another Hasboro inspired movie \\"G.I. Joe\\" but \\"Battleship\\" is much better than I ever thought it would be. **1/2 out of 4 stars.ugh how Neeson was cast in this goofy flick is beyond me, however I must commend them for casting Brooklyn Decker who is just stunningly beautiful.

B0000CABBW|4.0|Paikea, an ancestor of the whangara people of new zealand, escaped death thousands of years ago by riding to shore on the back of a whale when his canoe overturned. This created the tradition within the whangara people that the first born male in each generation was thought to be a direct descendent of Paikea and was given the title of chief. Pai, an 11 year old girl, who's mother and twin brother died during child birth, believes she is destined to be new chief leader. She must go against her grandfather, Koro, and more than a thousand years of tribe tradition to fulfill what she believes to be her destiny. I found this movie to be very uplifting and inspiring. It can be related not to just this one, small, tribe of people, but to so many other religions and people as well. It's truly enlightening to see such a strong transition of female roles within traditional, customary belief systems. I think this film is a must see for all people. Tradition is only tradition until someone breaks the rules...then it becomes a new tradition. Culture must change according to the people that are in it, and this film portrays that beautifully!
B002VPE1AW|2.0|Back in 2009 director James Cameron (\\"Titanic\\", \\"Terminator 2\\", \\"Aliens\\") brought countless movie fans and people in general to the world of Pandora inhabited by a race of tall blue skinned beings named the Na'vi. They're a peaceful race who live in one with the land and respect it, so naturally they aren't too thrilled when a group of humans come to Pandora, set up base camp and have every intention of harvesting a rare mineral from the planet called Unobtanium. The higher up decide the best way to establish trust with the Na'vi is to have a few people have their minds put into Avatars (Na'vi engineered bodies that look exactly like the real thing).<br /><br />Among these people are Grace (Sigourney Weaver, \\"Alien\\") and Jake Sully (Sam Worthington, \\"Clash of the Titans\\"), Jake who as a human was paralyzed is overjoyed at having the us of his legs, soon after waking up in his Avatar he goes with some others to explore the rest of Pandora. Jake does fall for one of the Na'vi Neytiri (Zoe Saldana, \\"Star Trek\\") and a budding romance of course occurs. Everything wouldn't be all happy go-lucky unless there was a ruthless Colonel named Miles (Stephen Lang, \\"Conan: The Barbarian\\") who wants to destroy the Na'vi and take the planets resources at any cost.<br /><br />The one big, big plus about this film is the visual treat that it is, the amount of detail Cameron wanted put in to the look of Pandora, the Na'vi, the animals that inhabit the planet and everything about the look and feel of Pandora was beyond top notch and the visual effects crew. Cameron and any others involved deserve all the credit in the world for the time and effort they put in to make these effects so good that they made special effects in many other films pale in comparison.<br /><br />The problems however are plentiful, from the basic and predictable story, I mean everything could be seen coming from a mile away, the plot is basic and feels all too familiar even with the great visuals. The acting is good to just basic, I mean Lang is a good actor but is one note in his villain role, Worthington is a breakout star for sure as is Saldana, Weaver is decent I guess in her role, the rest of cast is okay for the most part.<br /><br />Outside of the amazing effects I wasn't drawn into the movie, I felt very little if any attachment to the characters and while there are far, far worse movies out there for all the hype this received it's not very good. ** out of 4 stars, mainly for the visuals.od to just basic, I mean Lang is a good actor but is one note in his villain role, Worthington is a breakout star for sure as is Saldana, Weaver is decent I guess in her role, the rest of cast is okay for the most part.<br /><br />Outside of the amazing effects I wasn't drawn into the movie, I felt very little if any attachment to the characters and while there are far, far worse movies out there for all the hype this received it's not very good. ** out of 4 stars, mainly for the visuals.

B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Of my friends, the ones that read the books were thrilled to see a faithful re-creation of a story book that they loved.  I myself did not read the books and I was seriously underwhelmed.<br /><br />I will say that a magnanimous effort was made in creating this universe!  Costumes, architecture, ethics & psyche of the characters, zeitgeist, everything.  Think, The Golden Compass - that grand of a scale.  Having said that, most of the story was easily predictable and there were gaping holes in plot development that left me sitting there asking, \\"but why?\\" and all my questions remained unanswered until I could speak to someone that read the books.<br /><br />Although I'm sure the rest of the world saw this before I did, I will be sensitive to spoilers.  Even the commercial explains the elevator-pitch: The Hunger Games are a televised \\"The Running Man\\" style event where a large group of teenagers are drop-shipped onto an \\"island-sized\\" Thunderdome to murder each other.  So, you have to be into seeing a group of 13-19 year old children murder each other - I was not.  Also, be prepared to see our hero, Katniss, to be either asleep in a tree or otherwise unconscious for approximately 4 days!  Yawn.  Once she joins the movie, all plot points are visible from a mile a way.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is a talented young lady, but Josh Hutcherson acts circles around her every step of the way.  There are some plot points that, as an actress, she simply could not express.  Suffice it to say that Katniss' internal thought process involved things to do:<br /><br />1. to survive the players<br />2. to deceive the audience<br />3. to deceive Peeta<br />4. manipulate the producers<br />5. to remain true to herself<br /><br />A brutal chunk of acting for anyone - but Lawrence never came close.  All of the character motivation that I found was driven by props and dialog, and that was massively insufficient to explain what was really going on.  Again, I had to ask friends who read the book.  Then I had to read the Wikipedia page!<br /><br />Look for a surprising performance by Lenny Kravitz!  He is great at connecting the audience with the characters in the movie.  It is hard to explain, he is surrounded by VERY over-the-top personalities that I could not relate to - but I connected with him as someone that sees this universe the way I (the audience member) sees it.<br /><br />Bottom line.  If you read the books, you have already seen it.  If you haven't, have your phone handy - you'll have questions.e book.

I could live with B, but I got this specifically so that I could attach it to my belt or car visor. Without a clip, my headset goes from being loose to loose in a case, emphasize the 'loose', the condition I was purchasing this to remedy. Oh, and I've bought genuine Plantronics items before and they were packaged professionally. This came in the infamous, \\"non-retail packaging\\", i.e. a sealed plastic bag. If I had known that, I would not have purchased it, since things packaged that way frequently turn about to be knockoffs. I uploaded some pictures of what I received. Beware.
B004LWZW6U|2.0|What a disappointment.  Actually, I didn't think Aja's Piranha held a candle to Joe Dante's original, anyway.  However, it was at least a visceral, gory blast with lots of great eye candy.  In this more-of-the-same sequel, there is less of everything.  Less fun, less gore, less tongue-in-cheek comedy, less professionalism on the parts of the writer and director.  What you get in this sequel is a bunch of pointless cameos, cartoonish direction, too-goofy comedy and less creative gore.  Not to mention some less-than-inspired acting.  It's no wonder this only got dumped into a handful of theaters before ending up on disc.  However, if you're looking for mindless fun on the level of a SyFy channel movie (with a bigger budget), then you'll probably enjoy this undemanding junk.  Not too bad for a beer-drinking time-killer.  You be the judge.
0345803485|2.0|If you're looking for a quick beach read and you don't want to use any braincells at all.. this could be your book. The story is ridiculous, far fetched, and mostly annoying. Perhaps this book is best for \\"non readers\\" and bored housewives.
B0088X7YMS|3.0|Voice acting is key here, and the actors do pretty well going along with the animated features and movements of the characters. There are tons of battle scenes but a story is in there somewhere as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|[[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]<br /><br />Each book can stand alone but obviousily so much better if you can continue, unobstructed, to enjoy the development of the relationship. I know Ana and Christian so very well. Passionate, sensual, unexpected, daring and provocative. Great reading!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is by far the best book in the trilogy.  Read it and emotionally feel the PTSD that haunts returning war veterans.  Katniss and Peeta survived two Hunger Games and the revolution - the ending is not a disappointment, it is a triumph of the human spirit to endure!
B002EXEGTW|5.0|One of those rare movies that's so well done that even though I know the story and the outcome, I'm on the edge of my seat every time I see it!

1442419814|2.0|My 12 year old daughter's first book review:<br /><br />I was very shocked after reading this book.<br /><br />I thought I would have enjoyed it more after hearing good things about it. But it was definitely a disappointment. I found it shallow, slow, and well- boring. The book was drawn out way too long considering it's a series. I was definitely not happy with the main character, Tally. I found her whiny and couldn't really relate to her. I was also upset about how easily Tally and David developed feelings for each other. It seemed like the Author was just trying to force a romance to make the book more interesting.<br /><br />I was expecting the Author to make a point about beauty not being skin deep. Although there were some highlight worthy sentences I was a little let down.<br /><br />I'm also not a fan of the way the book was written. In the beginning, I found the way the Author jumped from Tally to Shay narrating confusing. I'm a fan of having feelings deeply described and that is something else this book lacked.<br /><br />Although, this wasn't a horrible read I'm not going to read the rest of the books. I am a little interested in how Tally will look pretty, but it's just not worth it.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|The 2nd season followed up Season 1 with an even more amazing season. Each episode was filled with shock and horror. Will be watching it for the 2nd time very soon.

0670023329|5.0|This book is a quick read, so pick it up.  What this author describes is happening NOW, in North Korea.  How can we go on allowing this?  No one who thinks of themselves as a good person and a lover of democracy would allow this to continue.<br /><br />The author describes his life to the American co-author.  The book is short, as I imagine life in a concentration camp is quite repetitive and so very dulling to the memory.  Indeed, most of the author's changes in life revolve around his changes in work assignment.  His mother was also forced to work long hours in the camp, so he never had a mother who fed and cared for him.  His mother is mostly a shadow figure who would eat any food in the house, so sometimes he would eat her food, as she was competition and not an object of affection.  The same went for his older brother.  He describes with very mixed feelings watching his mother and brother suffer execution for discussing an  escape.  At the time, the author was proud for telling the authorities about the discussion.  Now he realizes that most people respect and love their mothers, and his guilt is great.<br /><br />After realizing that there is a world outside the fence, he becomes irresistibly drawn to it.  The author's escape attempt is a harrowing read and you won't forget it.  He reaches China and eventually the US.  His life is a mixed experience of successes and failures, but he's trying.  That's victory enough.

B0091WR678|5.0|Amazing movie. Suspenseful while making you think the entire time about what is actually reality. It's a movie ahead of its time because it makes you ask yourself: if i could live for as ling as i wanted in a dream realm but not physically age in reality, would i do it? If so, how long, and with who? One day technology regarding how we perceive time will be discovered, and they will think back to this movie.

B003WJQ74E|5.0|Well it did! It was beautiful. I was debating between what book to buy, since I only had 10 dollars to spend, and, well, I'm glad I went with what people suggested and picked this one.
B007DA2FHG|1.0|17 min is not long enough especialy since there were 3 times in the beginning that buffering occured (I had windows 7 since this July).  Toward the end of the 17 minutes the picture format changed to full screen. While changing the picture format back that is the moment the video stoped.  For $14.95 the video on demand is very expensive. Buy the the DVD instead.
B00005B1W7|5.0|Fantastic movie!! It's a long one, and can be watched with more than one sitting, but definitely worth the time. I expect that at some future point in time, I will watch it again.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book was another of Nicholas Sparks' tear jerker with a twist at the end. It was beautiful. One thing I like about Nicholas Sparks is that his stories are realistic. People do not always end up with their true love and he really captures that.

B000KDZSEK|5.0|This is a great adaptation of, in my opinion, Dicken's best novel. It has good acting, a decent script, and while there are always parts from the book you wish hadn't been cut out it pretty much encompasses the story well. I love this version. I don't know if I will ever be able to bring myself to watch the American version. : D

B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!  I enjoyed the writing style from the very first chapter and the characters pulled you in immediately.  I wanted to read it whenever I had a few minutes to myself.  The main characters seemed believable but kept you second guessing yourself as the story developed.  I will recommend this to my friends.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do not write many reviews for books, but this is one that is so good it deserves one. This book starts off with a simple premise, but the more you read, the more depth that comes out and the more you get engrossed with it. The author does a good job with not overwhelming you at first, but more and more details come out that make you want to read more. This is one of the few books that is definitely worth my valuable time to read. It is a great book.

0321543726|2.0|Just a quick post to offset the praise heaped on the book (and it deserves it for what it covers):  The exercises have not been thoroughly vetted.  Stroustrup himself apologizes, in one of the sparse set of solutions offered on his web site, for not having introduced a key concept that is required to solve two of the exercises in Chapter 4.  I found another problem with a drill for which his web site doesn't offer a solution.<br /><br />If you plan to run all the drills and exercises in the book, be prepared for some frustration.  Drills and exercises are worth doing, but expect that sometimes what he tells you to do will be vague or flat-out impossible based on what you've been taught so far.<br /><br />Specifically:  Learn about the \\"continue\\" keyword in relation to loops before attempting chapter 4 drills; learn about \\"cin.clear()\\" before attempting Chapter 4 exercises.

B005LCYR7Y|4.0|The book was excellent, have always been a Stephen King fan, but felt that he had lost his way a bit recently.  I loved the premise of the story, and the detail in the book, the characters was also great, Happy it is on my Kindle, as I will definitely be going back to 1963 again
0345803485|5.0|This was a very easy addictive read.  I couldn't put the book down, and it had a really good story line.  I'm really excited that I get to read two more books!!!!  Excellent.  Would definately recommend.

B001AOKA3W|5.0|I found Cloverfield to be a VERY disturbing film, almost compelling in its horror (as in \\"I can't look away\\"), and I think it actually is groundbreaking because of what I think they were trying to do.<br /><br />Although on the surface it may SEEM to be illogical and annoying, a bad effort at making a modern \\"Godzilla\\" movie, I believe it used a totally new approach to story telling in cinema (and I am NOT talking about that annoying \\"first person\\", jiggly and wobbily camera stuff).<br /><br />I believe it was trying to break the mold of the usual \\"giant monster eats metropolis\\" genre. The approach they used makes it the kind of movie that requires some thought to answer the question: \\"WHAT were THEY thinking?\\"<br /><br />And, I think I figured it out.<br /><br />I think that this movie is an attempt to film a nightmare - AS nightmare, using all the elements and techniques that are characteristic of a nightmare. I think it was successful from this point of view. See if some of my observations ring a bell.<br /><br />The Plot:<br /><br />There isn't a plot, and if they were going for filming a nightmare, true to the way nightmare's work, then this is completely appropriate.<br /><br />Have you ever had a dream where you are being chased by a monster? It's terrifying, there's no reason why the monster is there, there is a lot of mayhem going on around you, and you feel terrified and HAVE to run and hide. Only you run to the most illogical places, people around you don't make sense, what they say makes even less sense, and the monster is unbelievably relentless. Stuff of dreams.<br /><br />I think that's what was going on in this movie. And on this level, it worked for me. I left this film (which I have seen twice) feeling that terrible sense of disturbance that a nightmare creates. So I give the film credit for this, IF that is what they intended. (I may be giving them more credit than is due).<br /><br />Because this film is nightmare in cinema, logic doesn't have to work. In fact, logic has no place in a nightmare. So it is with this film. To criticize plot issues for illogical elements is unfair. Dreams don't make much sense.<br /><br />Think of your nightmares, think of this movie, you'll may make the connection.<br /><br />The Characters and Dialog:<br /><br />As in a nightmare, these people are dream characters. They have no more substance than a half realized idea - again, the stuff of dreams. Each represents a persistent train of thought, which is what dream characters are designed to do. Rob is persistent in his quest to save his girlfriend. He represents the nobler emotion of heroism. Hud is persistent in making a video of everything that is happening. He represents our need for constant observation. Hud often missed pointing the camera at things we needed to or wanted to see.<br /><br />How often do WE miss seeing what we need to or want to see?<br /><br />Other characters represent feelings of being victims, feelings of being helpless, and even hopeless.<br /><br />Think of the girl who was bitten by a \\"parasite monster\\" and later explodes! Ever have one of your ideas \\"exploded\\"? Ever have someone jump on you because of an idea you had and they tear it, and your psyche, apart with harsh criticism?<br /><br />The characters are one dimensional because dream characters are one dimensional. They have nothing of interest to say because, for one thing, given their situation, what could they say? For another, what do your nightmare characters say as the nightmare unfolds?<br /><br />We have no feelings for the characters because we don't have feelings about feelings, which is what these characters are.<br /><br />This is a major departure from usual cinema, and it could be considered groundbreaking.<br /><br />The Monster:<br /><br />The monster is of course, very much the stuff of nightmares. Big, unrelenting, impossible to understand, unmotivated. Monsters in nightmares represent unresolved emotions or conflicts. They are unresolved because we can't figure them out. They are terrifying for the same reason. The mind always tries to find resolution. When it cannot, it views what is the problem as monstrous.<br /><br />So the Cloverfield monster comes out of nowhere, for no reason, and like a monster in a nightmare, you cannot defeat it.<br /><br />That's why everything the military does is of no avail against this monster. Have you ever tried to fight a monster in a nightmare? If you have, you probably know, you can never win. In \\"Godzilla\\" nothing worked because of his \\"atomic shield\\" or some other implausible nonsense. In Cloverfield, the monster cannot be defeated because he is an unresolvable situation. Stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />The Rest of the Film:<br /><br />Given that this seems to be a nightmare in cinema, it is interesting to consider the techniques used.<br /><br />Camera Work:<br /><br />A lot of people complain about the camera work, the shakiness, the uneven photography, and so on. I AGREE, it is extremely annoying. However, it may have been necessary to use this technique in order to maintain the heightened sense of terror. \\"Normal\\" camera work would have been too \\"rational\\" to work in this type of approach. Still they could have toned it down a bit. But think of nightmares and dreams. How often do we see things cockeyed in them, from impossible perspectives, much as this camera does in the movie?<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />There isn't any. Obviously. Music adds to the story, helps unfold the plot (as when the violins start screeching in more conventional horror films to cue the audience that something bad is about to happen). But in a nightmare, there is no music and no cue. Everything is a surprise, as it is in this movie. So of course, this movie doesn't really have a \\"score\\". If it did, it could have ruined the nightmare quality.<br /><br />Sound Effects:<br /><br />It was interesting how disturbing the sound effects -- which were all normal expected sounds we hear every day -- in this movie were. When Rob and friends are in the collapsed buildings and the safety buzzers are sounding... that is uncomfortably disturbing. Safety buzzers are supposed to be disturbing, of course, and I think they used this as a completely natural occurrence (since the buildings are running on back-up power) to heighten the fear elements. We are conditioned to be on \\"Alert\\" when one of these devices is sounding. I always jump when my smoke alarm goes off because I burned the toast. Have you had a similar experience? This film used these everyday sounds to heighten the tension. For me, it was appropriately creepy.<br /><br />Scenery:<br /><br />New York City, even being destroyed, is still a dramatic stage! I think the film makers made good use of it, the empty subway tunnels, the abandoned buildings, taking what is normal (crowded subways and buildings) and turning them around -- making them mysteriously empty. This also heightened the uneasiness of this movie for me. Which led to...<br /><br />A Venue Change:<br /><br />At this point, I think they switched gears for a while from \\"nightmare as cinema\\" to \\"first person shooter game as cinema\\". Some of these games are also nightmarish in their design and action. They also have a compelling quality about them.<br /><br />The characters are alone in different scenes, running through empty corridors, making hairpin turns... all like the protagonist in a computer game, and the stuttering visuals (from Hud, the camera guy) resemble a game player trying to control his or her character with a joystick. And like a video game, we have the \\"little\\" monsters that pop up out of nowhere and attack. It's scary in video games, it was terrifying in this movie.<br /><br />Special Effects:<br /><br />I cannot imagine the huge amount of work it took to make this film. Granted much of it was CGI, and that in itself is a daunting task. The sets (especially the cockeyed building interiors) were obviously well conceived and executed. This was an expensive film to make and the set designers deserve credit for a very fine, and disturbing job - well done.<br /><br />The Ending - Discovering Ourselves:<br /><br />The idea of it being a nightmare in cinema film -- something never tried on this level before, I think -- not even \\"Blair Witch\\" holds a candle to it -- is further supported by the ending of the movie.<br /><br />The video camera keeps filming after the bridge collapses on the remaining characters and then goes black. Why?<br /><br />At this point, I realized that the audience is part of the film, just as we are part of our nightmares. WE ARE the camera! Like our \\"eyes\\" in a nightmare, we see through this device, and it is the one thing that cannot die. Obviously, we usually don't die in our nightmares. When a nightmare becomes too much, it all goes black and we wake up. When this movie became too much (all the characters were dead), it went black and we were left looking at the credits in total silence. Even the silent credits were disturbing and clever. Silence implies respect in many cases, such as at a funeral or in a library. Here, the film was silent, denoting how serious it was, the terror, the fear, the utter hopelessness... welcome to my nightmare, because when we awaken from a nightmare, we are there, in the silent darkness... alone with our fear.<br /><br />This film brought us to our fear and left us with it, just as a nightmare does.<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Overall Rating:<br /><br />5 stars for a very good, very annoying, very unlikable, very disturbing, very clever, very compelling and very well done movie.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very innovative approach to the \\"giant monster\\" horror genre.<br />Look at it as nightmare, release logic and reason, and it may work for you.<br />Well crafted scenery and sets.<br />Terrifying.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Camera work was too disruptive and jiggly. They could have toned this down.<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />If you like nightmares, or are compelled by them, this film may grab you on that level and hold you there. Like nightmares, it is annoying, irritating, disturbing.

B005LAIHPE|5.0|Read a few reviews and set my expectations fairly low. I didn't think the story line was going to be cohesive and just thought this movie was going to be some good eye candy.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised and I like the movie a lot. It was a bit slow in the beginning, some of the characters (as opposed to the actual actors) were a bit over the top, but seeing Brooklyn Decker always keeps me interested. I even caught myself pumping my fist in triumph when the good guys succeeded (trying not to spoil anything here, so I'm being generic)!<br /><br />I would watch this movie again and again and recommend it to anyone interested in seeing an action movie.<br /><br />I can't wait to get it for my step-father who's a retired Navy chief. This will replace Top Gun as his favorite \\"Pro-Navy\\" movie.

0312576463|2.0|I should know by now if the book is recommended by Oprah, I dont read it anymore. Its not worth it, a typical Oprah book.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I was so happy to receive this dvd, and at a great price! It came earlier than estimated and was brand-new, as advertised.
B006LSZECO|2.0|For me initially this book began slow.  Yes, you do have a missing woman which really should have drawn me in but it was just so wordy and forced that I actually put it down and considered not returning.  I went back because I had a friend reading it and she suggest I continue to give it a chance.  Eventually it pulled me in and I couldn't put it down.  At some point for me it took such a ridiculous turn, that was just so far fetched, that I can't even imagine an episode of Criminal Minds attempting to cover.  Unable to sleep this morning I finished the book.  I closed my iPad and literally said outloud...\\"well that's just stupid\\".  It does keep you turing the pages but good lord it's just, well stupid.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, the characters are easy to identify with. Its very well writen. I liked this book so much that I read the second book immediately after I was finished.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's free. It's fun. It's addicting. Get this game, you'll love it. With all customizations, gadgets, and missions, the fun never ends. :)
B0085A9HXS|3.0|Let me just start off by sayin this movie in Blu-ray format was hard to come by at my local stores in town so I bought it on amazon based on the reviews about the fighting scenes. The fighting scenes are good but the acting/storyline is pretty bad. If I was to compare this movie with Ip Man it would be no contest, Ip Man is probably one of the best fighting movies of all time. But this is a watcher for people that like martial arts.
B00436GNVC|4.0|I'm even sorry that I came here in 2010, listened to samples and wrote this album off that way. Glad I (generally) don't do that anymore. This album is actually more akin to her first album than it's not. Sure there is a misstep or two here and the upbeat numbers are a 360 degree turn from the few upbeat numbers on her debut, but come on guys. The ballads here are *not* bad. In fact, most of them are good. And they still fill up the majority of the album. I will admit I don't care for \\"Well, Well, Well\\" much because of the tacky, high-pitched chorus but tracks like \\"Too Hurt To Dance\\", \\"Don't Forsake Me\\", the beautiful \\"Endlessly\\" and \\"Hard On The Heart\\" really do recall the past fire in her ballads. And the album starts off fresh (and unabashedly unlike the Duffy of the past) with the uptempo \\"My Boy\\" which is my favorite of the speedier tracks. The chorus is a bit repetitive, but come on people. It's fun! She also strikes me as a prettier Angelina Jolie on the cover of this album. Stunning really.<br /><br />Overall, I expected ruins before I heard this. But then all of those ballads crept in and I was reminded of her first album which I gave a listen about a half hour before. I think the few upbeat numbers while not perfect, help distinguish the album tracks more than her previous effort. I have to say this album is a winner. This will no doubt be my first Duffy album. If you liked her first album because of the emotional ballads she brought, then go ahead and pick this up. Its upbeat numbers are slightly modernized, but the ballads are generally the same as before.<br /><br />4 stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the whole series of books. I am retreading them again. I would reccommend this book to anyone ages 21 and up.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Every once in a while, I enjoy reading a good \\"Who done it.\\"  I was captured after reading a few pages of \\"Gone Girl: A Novel\\".  The chapter style of the book proves once again how important \\"the point of view\\" plays into deciding on guilt or innocence.  Of course, the role reversal mid way of the book adds completely different \\"points of view\\" which really adds to the depth of the book.  Did the \\"amazing Amy\\" commit the perfect crime? If you are a fan of CSI then you will probably find the police investigation immature.  The ending of the book is another reason I did not give this book a higher rating.  Not that the ending did not fit the story, I was just left feeling like I wanted to see justice.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Iam a big fan of the series. Have read all the 5 books. Will have to say that the series really brings the characters to life!!!.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, suspenseful, wondering what was going to happen next, quick read . I would read more books by this author.
B00062IDCO|4.0|Throughout this season, I felt like the producers and writers of Star Trek Voyager just realized what the show needed. But, coming in the 7th season, it's too little, too late.<br /><br />First, the characters. Tom Paris and B'elanna Torres finally get married. It's about time. Why did it take so long? Think of all the potential episodes with them as a married couple that the writers missed out on because this development only came in season 7.<br /><br />Likewise, we finally see Seven of Nine grow. As much as I loved Seven in the previous seasons, her character was essentially in stasis. Two of my famous episodes, Imperfection and Human Error, show Seven really develop emotional bonds. We also see her fantasize and her internal frustration as she's prevented from reaching her goal to become more human. But again, this all comes far too late in the show, so we don't get to see the consequences of these changes until the very last episode.<br /><br />The Doctor gets several great outings, including \\"Author, Author\\" and \\"Critical Care\\". These are also the episodes with the deepest moral point in the spirit of the best of Trek.<br /><br />B'elanna gets a surprisingly strong episode with \\"Lineage\\". It was nice to see her struggle and come to grips with her past, including finally talking with her father. But again, I would love to have seen more of THIS B'elanna, but there's just not enough time.<br /><br />Of all the crew, I feel only Captain Janeway, Neelix, Seven of Nine, and the Doctor get proper swansongs. By the season finale, I felt like I was only just beginning to warm up to some of the supporting characters.<br /><br />Also, in terms of plot lines, season 7 really begins to realize the promise of having a ship stranded in the Delta Quadrant. The \\"Void\\" was a perfect argument for why the Voyager crew should stick to Starfleet's - and Star Trek's - ideals so far away from home. It should have come in season 1. We also get more interesting aliens and a greater sense of exploration. Again, too little, too late.<br /><br />The finale, \\"Endgame\\", was a big letdown. It was partly a rip on TNG's \\"All Good Things\\", partly \\"First Contact\\" redux. While the episode gave us plenty of Borg and time travel, what we didn't get is a farewell to the Voyager crew. Kathryn Janeway takes up most of the screentime, with a bit of last minute characterization involving the Seven-Chakotay romance. We barely get any denouement at the end to welcome them back to the Alpha Quadrant.<br /><br />With TNG, by season 7 I felt like we already knew the crew pretty well and the writers were getting tired (despite some great episodes like \\"Pegasus\\"). With DS9's season 7, we got a satisfactory conclusion to the story arc and the characters' personal stories. But with Voyager, I feel like much of what we saw in season 7 really should have come much earlier in the season.
030758836X|5.0|I'm always leary of the hype when a book is praised as this one has been.  Thankfully, it was not oversold!  The writing is clever and witty.  The main characters are both nutty but in ways that make them relateable and make you think, yeah, that sounds like something I would say.  Overall, a really good book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game to play when you want to relax a bit.  Challenging without being frustrating.  5 stars very well deserved!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|What more can I say, it just works. Much better then the small battery icon that's built in. I also like that it's running after charging so you know the true battery level.
B0083EM24C|5.0|I picked up a used copy of Passion Pit's first CD \\"Manners\\" on a whim -- the rainbow-ribbon cover looked intriguing, thought I'd give it a shot.  Loved just about everything about it, including (if not especially) the two surprisingly chill acoustic renditions.  Also hugely enjoy \\"Little Secrets.\\"  Only down side to \\"Manners\\" was singer's falsetto could be a little thin & grating on the aural nerves at times.  In any case, I've been eagerly awaiting \\"Gossamer\\" for a long time, knew it would be amped up based on hearing \\"Take a Walk\\" on local radio.<br /><br />Man, I thought \\"Manners\\" was thick & heavy in the synth department, but \\"Gossamer\\" often goes for all-out wall of electronica, rivaling M83 for \\"most heavily layered multi-mega-tracked synth bomb\\" or something like that.  Been listening regularly for a couple months now, wavered back & forth between 4 & 5 stars.  4 stars would be attributable to catchy but vacuous pop tracks like \\"Carried Away\\" and \\"Hideaway\\" -- a little too reminiscent of Lightning Seeds, maybe played at 45 RPM when it should be 33.  Also could have used a few stripped-down acoustic versions such as grace \\"Manners,\\" but alas, \\"Gossamer\\" is a bit too dedicated to being LOUD and UP.<br /><br />But I had to go 5 stars based primarily on the lyrical & musical triumph \\"Take a Walk,\\" the goofy/groovy retro-70s grind and catchy chorus of \\"Cry Like a Ghost,\\" and the undeniable strength of the last 3 tracks, which rival any back-to-back-to-back triple shot you'll ever hear on any synth album ever.  \\"Love is Greed\\" is so happy & boppy & joyously backgrounded with female choral vocals that you'll almost miss the surprisingly melancholy lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Where We Belong\\" is the perfect coda to an album that is a most curious fusion of lyrical ambivalence and musical transcendence.<br /><br />\\"It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy\\" is the closest thing I've got to a personal anthem right now.  Can't get enough of the shimmering keyboard washes and driving bass.  The singer (mostly) checks his falsetto at the door and is content to whisper-vocalize, except for the bridge, which he seems to cede to the background ladies, and the rousing chorus, where he harmonizes with them.  Musical brilliance, well done!<br /><br />It's not fair, it's not fair -- still I'm the only one who seems to care...The singer (mostly) checks his falsetto at the door and is content to whisper-vocalize, except for the bridge, which he seems to cede to the background ladies, and the rousing chorus, where he harmonizes with them.

B0014D6PCO|3.0|This first of the Batman Trilogy is the weakest in terms of performance & story however, I recommend watching this in order to get to the third & final of the series. They simply get better, improving in the actors cast, performance & story. It comes together perfectly. Go ahead watch all three back to back, we loved it.
1451608659|5.0|Growing up, Dominique was my favorite gymnast to watch and the Magnificent 7 will always be one to remember.  As the years went by, I wondered what happened to her, while being fully aware that a gymnast's career is very short compared to other athletes.  I remember hearing about her emancipation in the news back in the day and then just a couple months ago, hearing about Jennifer (the sister she didn't know she had).  In this memoir, Dominique shares about her family's roots, growing up, training at Karolyi's ranch, training for the Olympics, all the pressure she faced, the diversity amongst her previous coaches she had, how things changed after Atlanta '96, trying to make a comeback, starting her own family, and discovering her long lost sister.  I never knew Dominique had attempted a comeback in elite gymnastics, on her own terms.  How that attempt ended is unfortunate, but the honesty in this book makes it worth reading so much more.  I enjoyed hearing her story of her life's moments and memories.  There is so much more to an event in someone's life that is unreliably covered in the media and by reading this book, I got a bigger picture of what went on.  It seems that her life is going really well now and she was able to come to peaceful terms with her dad.  There is an honest feel to the book and despite many hardships, it is very positive and uplifting.
030758836X|3.0|The story started slowly, but builds into a great story, well crafted. Then the author jilts the reader by failing to deliver in a \\"no way out\\" fiction category.  And it quits just when you expect some justice for the culprit and freedom for the victim.<br /><br />When the major character is trapped by the villain in a way from which there seems to be no escape and no way to punish the bad guy, we expect the author to conclude the story in a way that delivers it, satisfies us in some clever conclusion.  Gillian Flynn completely fails to do that and, as another reviewer put it, see seemed to get tired and just quit, and didn't come close to finishing the story.<br /><br />So read it for a good story, but prepared to feel cheated that there is no ending.  It satisfies none of the reader's expectations that we should have him in this genre.  Too bad.
B0046H95PO|5.0|This is Agatha Christie on top form. As the author of classic British mysteries [[ASIN:B004ZGLDVK Hundred Thousand Dragons, A (Jack Haldean Mysteries)]]Agatha Christie is the writer I turn to most for inspiration and sheer enjoyment. I love the way we get to know the characters so quickly and the mystery builds so well. Poriot is cut off from any outside help, so he has to rely on nothing but his own \\"little grey cells\\" and does it superbly. The ending is brilliant and very satisfactory.<br />Great stuff.

B0073COMKW|5.0|The warm white has the same color and feel of a standard incandescent bulb.  It's just above 800 lumens so it compares well with a true 60W.  No humm, the light comes on instantly.  So far so good.  Minus 1 star do to length of time installed, we will see if the product last more then a month as many LED's have overheat issues.<br /><br />Update: I've had these installed for almost a month now, and simply love them.  I'm in the process of replacing all my standard bulbs in the house with these a few at a time.  Love the warm white a lot better then the daylight white.  Still looking for a good CAN led bulb, and exterior flood.  Well update once I find one.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I heard that this book caught the attention of a major publisher and will be published, although I'm not sure of the publisher.  It is already of the quality of epics put out by the major publishers, and its 600+ pages that will fly by.<br /><br />Some comments for the well read that are familiar with the best selling fantasy epics - this is perhaps as good as Name of the Wind, Game of Thrones, and the like, and at the least is in that league.  And your getting it for $2.99.  It contains a coming of age tale and an ancient evil but there is so much more, and its so well done, that it wont feel old hat to you any more than Name of the Wind (another coming of age tale) did.<br /><br />This book is a bit more straightforward in its prose than some others.  Ryan is not trying to be Rothfus.  Nor is there as much detail on cultures, scenery and the like as there is in Martin.  None of that is a negative in my view, a LOT happens in the 600+ pages.  Overall, the writing style is closer to Brandon Sanderson's straightforward style than Martin or Rothfuss, but the plotting is more complex and the characters more in depth than Sanderson's.<br /><br />The level of plotting, tightness of the writing, and general maturity level seem high -- while perhaps not quite on a level with say Martin, those that, for example, found Mistborn too simple will likely find this more sophisticated.<br /><br />The characherizations are generally excellent, and the charachters feel distinct and real, and painted with reasonable but not overwhelming depth.  The main character has internal dilemmas and angst, but the author doesnt let that overwhelm the story.  The supporting characters also feel real.  Its there for those that like 3 dimmensional and \\"real\\" characters, but you are not going to get lost in anyone's head.<br /><br />In isolated spots the plotting is ever so slightly dodgy.  For example, the main charachter falls in love in a week, either because the woman reminds him of his motheror just because.  This sort of thing is there, if you look for it, but in general the level of plotting is excellent and the minor writing sins forgivable.<br /><br />I hated the fact that the prologue and \\"cut scenes\\" were in italics - I'm sure it was done very deliberately for style, but I find italics annoying to read for more than a paragraph - but in general the book is well editted for an indie book.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a book store quality epic at an indie book price.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was curious about these books as they are on the top of all book sales for months now.  I was surprised and actually quite enjoyed them.  Yes, they are about SM-BD etc but the books aren't all encompassing about it.  It does make one think about their own sexual fantasies and ask themselves what would you do, how far would you go, what is normal etc...  Anytime a book can make a person think like that is always to me a good thing.  I liked the overall story and would recommend.<br /><br />Side note, this was the first book I purchased for my Kindle Fire. Though convenient to purchase, download and read, maybe I'm just old fashioned.  I prefer a paper copy book so I know where I'm at in the book or can flip back however many pages/chapters.  Also, I cannot finish this book then pass it on.  I can only do so by loaning my kindle out.
B008602KQI|4.0|Wonderful movie...great casting!I didn't expect that the movie would be able to portray the book as well as it did. The director could not have found a better Katniss! Looking forward to the sequel!

0307341577|5.0|This novel was very well written and was read in less than two days! I just couldn't put it down, and had to find out what really happened on that cold dark night when the family was murdered. The novel opens almost 25 years after Libby's family has been slaughtered in what was deemed a satanistic ritual by her brother who has been convicted of the murder and is serving a life sentence. At this point in Libby's life, she is a depressed 32 year old woman who has no family, no friends, and now no money. In a bid to make money but still not actively engage in \\"real\\" work, Libby meets up with a man offering money for her to speak at an unconventional convention for \\"fans\\" of murders, a \\"Kill Club of sorts\\".<br /><br />As Libby goes on different quests posed by the \\"Kill Club\\" she begins to question events of that fateful night, and then questions her brothers guilt in the crime. What Libby learns of herself, her family, and mostly about that night will keep you turning the pages of the novel. The actual events are eventually revealed at the end of the book, but the trip will have you questioning everyone's involvement.<br /><br />You will be glued to your seat devouring this novel.  It is one of the best reads I have had in quite some time.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|My husband was overseas and watched all of the series. Becoming the true follower of SAMCRO. He asked me to check the show out several times adding in these inspiring reasons of this happen and this is great ect. However I pushed it off because it looked to be a biker gangster show and I didn't see how that it would be for me. My husband returned from over seas and again asked to please watch the show for him. So I did, the first 3 Series was on Netflix. I was up about 48 hours straight to finish all 3 series. The 1st episode hooked me and the rest reeled me in. I had to watch season 4 to catch up before season 5 comes on tv. I seen it available to watch on Amazon, bought it, and watched 4th season all the way through. So yes my husband converted me, but its okay cause it made him happy and during my viewing he would watch and comment like a kid who wouldn't shut up lol. I am now a SAMCRO follower.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Now I can take it with me anywhere I go!! My favorite part of this app is that when I click on a pin to take me to the original site it does, and then when I click the back button it takes me right back to the pins I was looking at instead of bringing up a new feed like it does on the actual website!! Highly recommend for the die hard pinners out there!!!!!!!! &lt;3

B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|This lens works great with my Sony camera. The pushers on both sides make it easy to remove the lens from the camera which is very convenient if you want to go back to cam's normal capturing mode. I've taken pretty decent pictures with this lens, almost close to what a \\"pro\\" type can capture. I highly recommended this one to those who don't want to spend hundreds of bucks for a macro lens. Two thumbs up!

0307960471|3.0|I was excited when I scanned a list of books available for review and found a new Harry Hole book from Jo Nesbo.  Nesbo's other Harry Hole books have been excellent.  I have enjoyed the Scandinavian detectives Harry Hole and Kurt Wallander.  As a character, Hole has been interesting because of his faults.  In Phantom, Hole is reformed, and seems more of an automaton rather than a detective.<br /><br />Hole returns after years away after learning that Oleg, his girlfriend Rakel's son, has been charged with murder.  In attempting to clear Oleg's name, Hole uncovers a conspiracy to manage the drug trade in Oslo.  Oleg was a bit player in the drug trade but intimately familiar with several of the key players.  The conspiracy reaches the highest levels of local government, and to Harry's misfortune, the police are deeply involved as well.<br /><br />The story starts off well but becomes increasingly complex, needlessly so, and the ending is impossible to believe.  I don't want to spoil the ending for those who will read the book, but I found the result senseless and impossible to believe based on the actions and emotions of the characters across several novels.  Nesbo has painted an ever more bleak picture of Norwegian society, rife with drugs, populated by police and politicians who work only for their own power, and a population more interested in a tranquil existence rather than stamping out drugs.<br /><br />Nesbo's characters make amazing decisions (clearly while under the influence of drugs) and in several instances Harry takes on super-human strength to survive in fights and through chase scenes while suffering tremendous wounds.  Everything that can be magnified has been, and that leads to the sense that the author has run out of ideas, and has simply ramped up the speed and violence.<br /><br />While the title figure, The Phantom, refers to the bad guy in the story, it should refer to the pale image of Harry Hole that is left after this book.  Which is unfortunate, because Nesbo has developed a real, flawed character in previous books that here is only a pale shadow of what he was.te, because Nesbo has developed a real, flawed character in previous books that here is only a pale shadow of what he was.

B007SPPANM|1.0|The video appended to the head of this page announces this release to contain over two hours of new content.<br />This is not so.<br />That relates to a different release.<br />This bloody release possesses merely 'nearly an hour' of bonus features, which is rather different, wouldn't you say?<br /><br />Very disappointed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was everything I wanted it to be - a nerdy trip back to my childhood of video games, comic books, movies, and other things pop culture. I wouldn't call this a thinking man's book but it sure is a fun bit of escapism. If you're looking to sit back and have a good time, buy this book, read it, and then tell everyone you know about it. If you're a stuffy literature snob, get a life, and then read this book ;-)
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really have enjoyed this game. It's easy to use and a lot of fun for a puzzle lover like myself.
B000ZLJOW4|5.0|A movie for people who find most movies stupid.  Ghost World deals with problems 18-year-olds and 48-year-olds face, without condescending to either. I wouldn't call it depressing.  The humor is very dry. Everything, very nuanced.
B003OA6AOI|5.0|I love the critics who complain about \\"logical inconsistencies\\" etc.  These are entertainment, a vacation for the mind, with interesting men, good looking women, and fantastical plots that need to be treated by the actors as real for the play to work. Do you think Shakespeare's \\"penny stinkers\\" thought the actors were really on an island (The Tempest was actually the first episode of Lost)or criticized his verisimilitude because they couldn't hear the surf, that some medieval character from Monty Python was going to jump out to criticize the logic of using \\"magic\\" in the plot?  Relax, open a beer, enjoy the show. That's what Torchwood is supposed to do - and it does it very well.

B003LXM1RS|5.0|No Ta-dah, it's better. No ballads. There's nothing slow about this non-stop smooth gliding hard driving electro-pop. Get up and dance. Nods to every great dance artist since the BeeGees. Invisible Light is outstanding. So are all the others, every cut is perfect. Plus the cover art is truly Art. Robert Mapplethorpe's Gym Shorts and Derriere(no it's not me). Sub-cultures makes the best dance. Also recommended: Party Monster soundtrack featuring It Can't Come Quickly Enough by Scissor Sisters.

B008Z9YLV2|3.0|-2.5 Stars-<br /><br />Let me preface by saying I didn't read the books, strictly watched this for entertainment and b/c it has been advertised everywhere.<br /><br />I enjoyed some parts, and tremendously enjoyed the concept...found it \\"original\\" - but felt the acting was lacking (especially most of the characters in the \\"games\\"), character development was rushed, and the climax left more to be desired. Some things in the movie were explained well while others were not; like the ability to control the hunger games environment. This was one of the few movies that would have really benefited with a 3+ hr film. Maybe the next chapter will bring more detail and better actors....since most of them were killed off anyways! Don't bash, I do think Jennifer Lawrence did a fine job with her role. Do tell me that Josh Hutchersons character is gone soon though...
034580404X|5.0|I am in love with these books. I had them on PDF, but I wanted the actual books. EL James is an adequate writer. I can't wait to see these books on the big screen!
B000JQUQZO|5.0|A great classic. It is a must in our time, when we need calm, profound thinking in order to understand better human nature.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is a worldwide phenomenon. It went from book(s) to a movie in a split second. I actually saw the movie first and then I went and read the book. I was a bit skeptical about the book being the same as the movie, but I was wrong, it was better. I finished the first book the same day I got it and then went back and got the second and third book. I was expecting the first book to be a bit overwhelming after I had seen the movie. I was wondering how Suzanne Collins would be able to obtain all of the action of the movie and put it into words and still make it have the same affect. She did it perfectly. Every part of the book balanced out and led easily into another action part without any confusion. Some books I've read have had action in them and the authors have not been able to do the same thing with their words. The words they use to describe the characters and what's happening are confusing to me and I can't imagine it in my head very well, but with The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins mastered the action and with one great work, her books are forever on my bookshelf.<br /> I won't give away too much about the book, but basically it's about 24 teenagers who are admitted into an arena and made to fight to the death until on lone person remains. This book is about survival and about how fighting for your life is very frightening and difficult, especially when 23 other people are aimed to kill you. I definitely  recommend this book to everyone who is thinking about reading it. Once you start, it's hard to stop.
B008XG1X18|3.0|hi I'm gonna get on but I no someone who has one and love It so I would to bye
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I really liked the Katness actor and the story ploy was interesting. I was, however, somewhat disappointed in the movie which, possibly, was due to all the hype it got at the beginning of its release. I am not sure exactly what I expected, but would have liked Katness to be more aggressive in the hunt. Also, I thought the scene where Katness and her partner kissed could have been omitted as I didn't think the character portrayed by her would have done that while all the time her real love was taking care of her family and waiting for her to come home.<br /><br />The movie was worth seeing, but I wouldn't give it more than three stars.
B007R11PX6|5.0|This fun movie keeps even my active 3 year old entertained. Both my boys (3 & 6 yrs old) absolutely love this one, and the music and dance scenes are pretty funny.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I really enjoyed this soundtrack.  As does my 2-year old daughter (it's one of her favorite CD's and movies at that). I was disappointed that Chiquitita didn't make the final cut or Waterloo as their rendition was one of my favorite scenes in the movie second only to Christine Baranski's rendition of \\"Does Your Mother Know.\\"
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very interesting read written in present to past format. A little depressing but a definite page turner.<br />I really was taken aback at the ending.
B007SGM084|2.0|I am an avid reader of all genres.  I heard all the hype and decided to buy the Trilogy to save a little money.  I cannot remember the last time a book bored me as much as this.  \\"my inner goddess\\", tearing the \\"foil\\" of the condom, probably appears hundreds of times. Yes, there are several interesting and fun,steamy sex scenes but after a while those too become monotonous! I do not think she is that good of an author.  You want a good story with some sex; do yourself a favor and read the Black Dagger Brotherhood series.  I have been skipping the pages of Fifty Shades furiously just to get through it. If I could get a refund I would!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the variety of games.  they are simple and clean so I feel comfortable allowing children play them. there are a few lame games but there are also many great ones to make up for it
B008RV5K5E|3.0|Well I just finished the movie 2 minutes ago and I just got a feeling of disappointment. Yes I will still see Part 2 but only because I'm interested in how they will pull that off as well.<br /><br />The biggest flaw this movie has is this. Remember in the Batman: Year One animation where they had Gordon and Bruce narrating almost everything in the movie? How you could still feel like you were reading the comic only it had voices and motion? Don't expect that from this movie. They completely took out all narration whatsoever which was the best part of TDKR. There is no \\"This would be a good death... but not good enough\\", no \\"I'll feel better in the morning. At least I'll feel it less.\\" and no \\"The rain on my chest is a baptism. I'm born again\\". Every bit of dialogue that gave you depth for the character and the troubles he has to face are completely stripped out.<br /><br />Now the voice acting was actually well (Aside from Jim Gordon having a high pitch clown voice but that's my opinion) but the delivery of some lines feel rushed and not as powerful as you thought they were in your head. This is because they hired voice actors who never really got into the comic industry and didn't really feel for the character as much as someone like Kevin Conroy or Michael Ironside would. They also skipped a lot of scenes and replaced some with ones that would work better for the animation which I don't mind since they weren't very important ones.<br /><br />The animation is solid and well done. It really compliments the character design Frank Miller had created and worked very well with a lot of the fight scenes. They also got the mutants spot on both on the animation and the flawless dialogue.<br /><br />Basically to sum up the movie, it showed a plot but it didn't tell a story. If you were hoping to see your characters express themselves better in animation with voices and movements that could tell the story in a way that feels real then sorry this movie isn't for you. It's just Batman talking to Gordon and beating up The Mutant Gang. Nothing more, nothing less.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Thanks, Amazon, for great service.  Of course, the movie is great and the service is great.  Getting the link to download the movie on the DVD/Blu-ray release date before even getting the product in the mail was a nice surprise.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a really compelling read from start to finish.  Couldn't wait to read the next book.  It's very well written with very good characters.  Best book I'd read in a while - would highly recommend it.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|This was a highly entertaining movie, we had a family  movie night and we all sat and watched it. Although the movie critics savaged it, I thought it was a very entertaining movie, great special effects and more than enough twists and turns to keep me engrossed until the very end. The lead actor gives an uneven performance, ranging from superior acting to \\"wooden\\" on occasions.<br />I do recommend you watch this in HD or on Blu Ray to get the most out of it. We watched it on Amazon Prime Movie's standard \\"reso\\" offering and  the quality was VERY poor. I frequently watch  movies and series on  the same media this was very poor quality indeed, I am surprised they offer it at such poor resolution, it was way less than VHS quality!<br /><br />Still, a great movie, we watched it twice and enjoyed it both times. (I deducted 2 stars for the poor resolution which took away from our ability to enjoy the special effects!)
B008BM9L72|5.0|I have read the first two books and am currently on the third. WOW would sum up how I feel about them. Not for the faint hearted or anyone of a sensitive nature! These books are very descriptive, no sexual detail is omitted. I actually love the story line too, we can all dream, and these books certainly have me dreaming. I think they should be compulsive reading for all Irish men, and should be on our Medical Card system.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Loved the book. Recommend to anyone who loves a great love story! Cannot wait for the next in the series.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game!  The only bad thing about it is it is addicting.  I haven't read a book on my kindle in ages because I can't stop playing.

B003VANOFY|5.0|Once again Logitech has put out a great product.  These surround sound headphones deliver on their promise.  Great acoustics, zero lag time, comfortable, great controls right on the headphones so you can adjust volume even when away from the source.  I would order another pair if i had more ears! You wont be dissapointed with these.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is a lot of fun to play..each board has a mission briefing which is cool..each board is a bit challenging but easy....I like this game alot
0307744434|1.0|Let me simply add to the count of one-star reviews. I have tried twice to read the book, the second time after every member of my (well-read) book group raved about it. I agree with other one-star reviews that the novel is boring, the prose is not compelling (thanks to other reviewers for helping me understand why), and the characters are not engaging. One specific comment I'll add: Fantasy, in my opinion, is best narrated in past tense rather than present tense, for that \\"once upon a time\\" quality.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and the second one in the series. The author needs to get the third one out as soon as possible!
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Very realistic life story of of a young girl; starting with the rounding up of Jews by French Police during the Nazi occupation of Paris.  On one hand, it shows how people protect themselves by becoming very selfish and on the other how they take risks once they are confronted with the reality of of others in life threatening predicaments.  The story of the reporter digging into this tragedy 60 years later is sad but heartwarming (I cried a few times).  Great acting and direction.  One of the best films I have seen this year.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a gripping highly personal story of one man's experience in the SEAL's.  I detected nothing of security value and the alleged hatred of his brothers is most likely exaggerated.  The fact that he left the service after 14 years should be no surprise.  Fourteen years of that level of strain on your body would take its toll.  The government's policy of outsourcing all non combat jobs leaves nothing for the men to do when not deployed but train or be trained.  That can get old quick!  The dumbing down of our fighting does not help much either as we continue to lose one good American a day in a country that will not change, will not thank us, and will be the same when we leave after spending billions of dollars and losing 1000's of men and women.  We must accept collateral damage.  Winston Churchill learned this two centuries ago.  With today's instant communication, we may never accept it.<br /><br />I continue to be surprised that I have seen no mention of Chuck Pfarrer's \\"Seal Target Geronimo\\". Was I the only one who purchased this book and was amazed at the details about the aircraft, scheduling, and mission provided? It provides 1000 fold more important security info than \\"No Easy Day\\". Where is the outrage??<br /><br />From Amazon: \\"Seal Target Geronimo\\"<br /><br />Publication Date: November 8, 2011<br />The true story of the killing of bin Laden by author and former U.S. Navy SEAL Chuck Pfarrer<br /><br />\\"On May 2, 2011, at 1:03 a.m. a satellite uplink was sent from Pakistan crackling into the situation room of the White House: \\"Geronimo, Echo, KIA.\\" These words, spoken by a Navy SEAL, ended Osama bin Laden's reign of terror. SEAL Target Geronimo is the story of Neptune's Spear from the men who were there. After talking to members of the SEAL team involved in the raid, Pfarrer shares never-before-revealed details in an exclusive account of what happened as he takes readers inside the walls of Bin Laden's compound penetrating deep into the terrorist's lair to reach the exact spot where the Al Qaeda leader was cowering when the bullet entered his head. SEAL Target Geronimo is an explosive story of unparalleled valor and clockwork military precision carried out by the most elite fighting force in the world--the U.S. Navy's SEAL Team Six.\\"<br /><br />\\"No Easy Day\\" does Devgru a great service in finally explaining why the tail rotor was not destroyed. Until this book, this failure has appeared to be a clumsy mistake on the Team's part. It also credits the pilot's skill with turning a disaster into a success. This has not been reported and both items have no security value and should have been noted in any stupid official scenario DOD and the White house invented..lair to reach the exact spot where the Al Qaeda leader was cowering when the bullet entered his head.

1476712042|5.0|i rarely write reviews but this book deserved it. IT WAS SO GOOD!!!! i loved the plot and how the book dragged out making sure you don't feel ripped off. normally books that take forever are boring, but this one was really good. i was dreading the time when this book came to a finish. it a must read!!!
B007PVHANM|5.0|I watched this movie with my entire family and everyone enjoyed it.  The movie was really interesting and informative.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves Bob Marley's music.
B006DHAT5K|4.0|This movie is predictable in the concept, however the thing that makes it very worthwhile to get is you get to see \\"Captain America\\" naked. Several times. I was reading the review of another and she mentioned this fact. That is why I got it. He is so dangerously sexy, as stated in the movie,that it is unbelievable. Watching him standing in the hallway of the apartment building and eating an apple with one hand and a towel covering a specific area with the other. He then dabs his mouth with the towel and if it weren't for a strategically placed object there would be nothing left to the imagination. Mine kicked in vividly.  Also, watching makes me want to play strip Horse. The way he eats a sandwich is also worth seeing. He is holy crap hot, and droolingly delicious to watch. He also is funny and has a fantastic smile and is comfortable with himself. He is a great actor too. I do go on, but it is nice that us ladies get some amazing male scenery to look at. His body/face combo is the bomb in my book. If you want a great movie see Captain America or The Avengers, this one is for entertaining delicious fantasies.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Buying the multiple pack ensures we can watch it whenever and wherever we need to. Owning it lets us watch it as many times as we like. Pre-ordering is the best.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first picked up this book. I had heard a very brief description of it, and it didn't sound like my thing. But so many people recommended it, that I went ahead and read it. I'm so glad that I did. It's exceptionally written, thought provoking, and intense. It's really a must read. I've read it over and over again.

B0000009RX|5.0|Although I grew up in the 70's, my parents were nearly in their forties when I was born. In fact they were of the Madison Avenue Lifestyle generation. As I grew up I couldn't understand why they were far more interested in material goods (cars, houses, latest gadgets) than their own kids. My friends' parents who were around ten years younger than mine seemed much cooler and interested in their kids.<br /><br />When I came across a scratchy copy of \\"We're Only in It for the Money\\", it was the first Zappa album I had heard. The anti-establishment lyrics were dated. Cops were no longer killing creeps (\\"Pow! Pow! Pow!\\") and the hippy movement was accepted to have been more of a fad than a movement exactly as Zappa had described it. The lyrics that really hit me were the ones about my parents. The ragtime \\"Bow Tie Daddy\\" summed up my father's pointless existence in just thirty seconds. \\"Mom and Dad\\" were my parents. They felt that me conforming was far more important than my ability to think or reason on my own. Their expressed emotions were not real and were only used to get reactions from other people. And if cops had still been killing \\"creeps\\", I doubt they would have given it a second thought. The song perfectly described the non-relationship I was living with my parents.<br /><br />Although I feel Zappa got petty during his later years and had never been a nice guy, I admire the way he attacked his targets with brilliant whit which never undermined his message. On this album he had the guts to take on both the hypocritical establishment and the hypocritical anti-establishment, sometimes in the same song. He didn't care who he offended even if it was everyone. This album makes other protest music of the era sound like pop music. I hope that someday another brave artist will have the guts to make music that will force us to see the hypocrisy in people's lives as well as our own.

030758836X|4.0|Flynn has written a beautifully complex psychological thriller that was impossible to put down. Her clever use of the Tom Sawyer themes, the double entendre anniversary clues, and the diabolical complexity of the characters themselves yield to a perfectly apt conclusion. Here we can see the results of parenting, or lack of, and (gasp) only imagine the results of their rather unusual(tongue-in-cheek) reproductive techniques.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Emily Giffin is a very talented writer.  I enjoyed this book immensly.  I have read three other books written by Emily.  It was interesting to see how she made Darcy from a self-centered, conceited woman into a loving, giving mother.
B000KITQK2|5.0|I bought a Taylor T-5 in 2006 for ~$2500 hoping to get a guitar that covered all the bases because I was playing in a country-rock band and wanted to easily switch between acoustic and electric guitar sounds during a single tune. The T-5 is a dream to play, but it was a bit of a disappointment sonically. Plugged into a guitar amp it sounds okay; I can coax some jazz box sounds out of it, but it feeds back easily and doesn't really sound particularly \\"electric.\\" Run thru the PA or an acoustic amp it sounds thin and plinky - not exactly \\"acoustic.\\" So to my ears it falls short in either direction. Taylor sells a outboard preamp for ~$500 that probably enables one to get any sound one could hope for out of the T5, but after dropping $2500 on the guitar, I was a little short for another expensive outlay. So, hoping to improve its acoustic sound to play in an acoustic-electric duo, I looked on several boards hoping to find a less-expensive alternative to getting the best acoustic sound out it. I found two worthy recommendations: First put medium-heavy bronze acoustic strings on it and, second, run it through the Behringer ADI21 V-Tone. The strings were a step in the right direction, but the Behringer pedal has made a HUGE difference. Now I can plug into virtually any system, guitar amp, acoustic amp, PA, bass amp (it offers both 1/4-inch and XLR outputs), and with a little tweaking of the knobs, the T-5 sounds like a big dreadnought. Couldn't be happier. For the money (about $35 if memory serves), this is a real bargain and a crowd-pleaser.

0385742886|3.0|First, I love James Dashner--love him. I LOVE both The Maze Runner series and The 13th Reality series, and I don't think I have ever given him less than a 5 star rating for anything . . . until now. This book was a trial for me. I trudged my way through it, s-l-o-w-l-y, simply because it was Dashner. I don't think I would have finished it, had it been written by anyone else. Part of me wants to say it's because it was too dark, but I love dark books. Besides, a prequel to The Maze Runner would HAVE to be dark.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think it came down to the characters for me. There wasn't anyone I felt attached to. There wasn't anyone I thought \\"might\\" pull through and make it beyond the pages of Kill Order and into the pages of Maze. It was TOO hopeless. The Maze series always left me with some kind of hope, but there was NO HOPE in this book--at least not for its characters. It was almost \\"work\\" to get to the end, because I knew no one in the story (with one unresolved exception) would get there with me.

1455502758|5.0|This brief book is mostly a compilation of essays that Christopher Hitchens wrote in the last nineteen months of his life after he was diagnosed with cancer.  A prolific writer, journalist and speaker, Hitchens' essays were always what I turned to first in both the online magazine Slate, and in Vanity Fair magazine.  What I find most fascinating about these essays is that Hitchens is as opinionated and brilliant as ever, despite the increasing pain and disability brought on by his disease.  He questioned everything, from how society deals with cancer (referring to \\"battling\\" the disease in a way never referred to with heart or kidney disease), to his anguish at the realization of \\"lasts\\" in his life which most of us never have to confront (the last time he traveled to his native England, the movies he would not see and books he would not read, the weddings of his children he would not attend.)<br /><br />This book is witty and wry.  He recounts conversations with well-meaning fans, friends and family which annoy him.  He comments on his empathy for the medical personnel who find doing their jobs harder as his body shuts down and even finding a vein to stick becomes an ordeal.  He tries to tell his readers what the process of dying means, even as he holds out hope that the experimental medical treatments he undergoes may work.  Hitchens is blunt about his journey, and he does not shy away from acknowledging points of view which differ from his own.  An outspoken critic of organized religion and religious dogma, Hitchens nevertheless writes about doubt and about those he admires who do not share his philosophies.<br /><br />As another reviewer pointed out, one of the most interesting chapters is the last one which is comprised of notes for a book about his cancer journey which he did not live to write.  Glimpsing the creative process of a writer like Hitchens is a gift.  The forward by his friend, Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, and the afterword by his wife, writer Carol Blue, provide further insight into the mind of this fascinating man.<br /><br />This edition of the book, published by TwelveBooks, with a simple black dustjacket, a photo of Hitchens on the back, and printed on high-quality paper, is quite wonderful for the reader/collector.<br /><br />Highly recommended.r Carol Blue, provide further insight into the mind of this fascinating man.<br /><br />This edition of the book, published by TwelveBooks, with a simple black dustjacket, a photo of Hitchens on the back, and printed on high-quality paper, is quite wonderful for the reader/collector.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

I absolutely loved all the books. The second book was my favorite because it had the most romance. Each book kept my attention and had me begging for me. Now I'd love to read them all from Christian's point of view. I recommend this book to everyone, men and women. There is much to learn and explore but the romance is what had my attention the most.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I don't want to say too much, God knows enough people have their opinions on this book, but hey, no publicity is bad publicity, right. It is a trilogy that sucks you in to the story and has you wanting more, you connect with the characters and relate to them on one level or another. This is what a good story does I blasted through the first and second books, lingered on the third because I didn't want it to be over. I'd love to re-read this from Christian Grey prospective as this trilogy is written from Anastasia Steele's view point. It is a modern day fairy tale with kinkiness. I recommend these books. I hope the movie will do the story justice.

I absolutely loved all the books. The second book was my favorite because it had the most romance. Each book kept my attention and had me begging for me. Now I'd love to read them all from Christian's point of view. I recommend this book to everyone, men and women. There is much to learn and explore but the romance is what had my attention the most.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I pre-ordered The Hunger Games DVD as a birthday gift for my granddaughter who has read the trilogy of books and was more than eager to see the movie. She absolutely loved it and as it fell one day prior to her birthday, she truly enjoyed the luxury of viewing the streaming video from the computer while waiting for her DVD to ship. I love that feature and will definitely look for it the next time I buy a DVD for her.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Just like the first two books, it was full of interesting events, I just couldn't put the book down...Excellent writing!
0525953728|5.0|This is a book that reminds us that the Bin Ladens will never succeed, no matter how hard they try. A bunch of soldiers who fly into hostile territory, kill the most wanted man in modern history and go back to eat pizza, drink beer and train again as if nothing happened can not be defeated by terrorist. Marc is a humble guy who never brags about himself and  shares with the reader the immense sacrifices that the military makes every day to fulfill their mission, to keep us safe and free. I salute  Marc and all the members of our armed forces. We are blessed by their service and devotion, we can't pay them back, what they do is priceless.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book reads like a good Tom Clancy novel.  It took me a while to remember that this was not the fiction that I am used to reading.  It actually happened!<br /><br />I could not tell if any \\"sensitive and classified\\" information was revealed but I don't think it hurts to let our enemies know what they could be up against.  After reading this book, if I were a member of al Qaeda I would keep a big white flag handy!
034580404X|5.0|I know people think these books are all about sex, However the story line really come's together in the third volume.  Fifty Shades Freed is full of suspense and action.  I suggest if your your not as into the 'erotica', but you still want to know what this 'Fifty Shades' craze is all about, read the third book.  But really... who could read just ONE?!
0743298039|5.0|It took a while to get into the book, but once you stop judging, you were engrossed.  This is a really lovely book, and the writing was so beautiful.  Story about siblings Charlie and Isabelle, then Isabelle's twins, Adeline and Emmaline.  There is an unique twist at the end, which blew my mind.  I don't know which twin survived, which is part of the charm of the book.  The book is completely bewitching, the writing is stellar.  One of my favorite books.  If there is a flaw, it is narrator, Margaret's sentimentality over Aurelius.
B000V63BN6|5.0|Stevie Wonder is one of the greatest artists of all time and this collection gives you all the great songs of his catalog for a great price.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a great book series about the new great propacy including Percy, Hazel, Frank, Annabeth, Jason, Leo, and Piper is so cool and i hope i get The Mak of Athena and find more out about the prophacy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app does a good job of translated the mostly image-based pins on Pinterest to my Android smart phone. Good for whiling away the hours while sitting in the dentist's office.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This is a good arcade-type of game. I have been playing it with my six years old daughter and we love it. Cool features and gadgets. Graphics are not astounding but are good enough. The downside has to do with the compatibility between the platform (kindle fire) and the software. The image has a kind of a hiccups and it can get very slow at some point for this kind of fast-pace games. I have heard this doesn't happen on other devices. It seems to be a really simple game not too heavy programming nor graphics, so, I think they can still work on solving this issues on the Kindle version. Still, is a good and recommendable freebie.
B005LAIHE0|5.0|I really liked this movie quite a bit more than I expected to.  It is one of those movies that I will be quoting and mentioning the funny bits for years to come.<br /><br />After Forgetting Sarah Marshall and I Love You Man, I thought Jason Segel's character would be another of those broadly drawn, vaguely gross and occasionally clueless dudes.  Instead he is very believable, somewhat subdued and quite attractive, but not in a conventional way.  It really is quite an impressive performance.  Emily Blunt has glammed down a bit, if that term makes sense, so we are able to witness the evolution of a very realistic relationship between two people who love each other very much and whose own ambitions create barriers to their being together.  Although the movie is often quite funny, Judd Apatow shows a refreshing unwillingness to go for the cheap joke.  This couple struggles together to work it out, not too differently from the way \\"typical\\" young couples today have their struggles.  People have to deal with their attractions to others, they get drunk and make stupid decisions, they give up jobs and comfortable lifestyles to move to where their loved one is, they try it apart but never stop loving each other.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Bridesmaids and hate that it is being held up as the modern prototype for a comedy with strong female characters.  It is just way too gross for me.  So I approached the Unrated version of The Five-Year Engagement with some trepidation.  Even with the extra envelope-pushing, I still felt like it was a relatively realistic and touching portrayal of a modern relationship.<br /><br />It has been mentioned in previous reviews, but I do feel that the conversation between Violet and her sister in which they are both using Sesame Street voices is a little piece of comic genius.  Not only is it funny, but it beautifully encapsulates these characters and also creates a critical plot point.  You can't ask for more from a scene.  I also loved the ending.  It could have seemed rushed and abrupt, but I really thought it was perfect and organic.  The movie is longish but the pacing seems just about right.  I am happy to find a movie that exceeded my expectations and that I can recommend highly.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|This is such a wonderful album.  Is the best album I have heard so far this year.  So much variety that you never get bored. I did not know what to expect but is a great album.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I thought this movie, while having a few \\" loose ends\\" was a film worthy of the time spent. I enjoy everything from the writing to te acting to the graphics. I did have an issue with Amazon where it wouldn't play on one computer and then I could not transfer to another so I had to buy it again which was a waste of $3.99 thank you Amazon. Lots of politics and human nature and direction to talk about.
B0095NW7R2|5.0|Seriously, I love her SO MUCH! I have never seen an actor who could deliver the snark line after line after line, and keep it as amazingly fresh and well delivered as she does.  She has a great team of writers giving her AWESOME lines to deliver, and they are awesome.  Even just her delivery of surprise lines like \\"NO WAY!\\" is awesome.<br /><br />My wife and I first saw her in Thor, and loved her in it (she was really the only part of that movie we liked), and we were pleasantly surprised to see her in 2 Broke girls alongside Beth Behrs -- even though Beth really just serves as the primary thing-to-be-mocked.<br /><br />Make no mistake, 2 Broke Girls is raunchy. It is NOT for younger viewers. The pilot alone should send that message.  And I can see where the claims of racism, etc. come from.  But, if you are willing to acknowledge that all sides are getting shot at fairly, and there isn't real racism, sexism or anything else terrible on display (just uncomfortable at times), then you should enjoy the show.<br /><br />2 Broke Girls certainly pushes boundries, but the show is incredibly funny, and well acted. You can totally side with either girl in any given moment, and it is easy to sympathize with Kat's character \\"Max\\" when she shows her tender, emotionally-wounded side sometimes, and it is easy to sympathize with Beth's character \\"Caroline\\" -- pretty much all the time.<br /><br />Yes, the show is raunchy, and yes it can be uncomfortable at times, but it is still hilarious, and like I said, I love Kat Dennings.<br /><br />5 stars.

B005LAIHSG|1.0|... another tiresome, politically-correct \\"girl power\\" princess-gets-butch-and-puts-on-armor reinterpretation of a classic tale, with attempts at \\"Gladiator\\"-style slow-motion combat sequences and sets imitating those in \\"Game of Thrones.\\"  I had the misfortune to be stuck on a transatlantic flight with no functional reading lights, and so found myself watching this film out of desperation.  The only redeeming factor was the ever eye-catching Theron.  Otherwise, fans of the fantasy genre should give this one a pass.  Might appeal to teenagers obsessed with \\"Twilight,\\" I guess.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Before starting this book, I was not exactly sure what to expect.  I had heard so many things about it and all of them seemed to be good, which seemed very unlikely to me that I had heard nothing but praise about this book.  When it became a monthly read for an online book group, I knew it was time for me to give it a try.  This story was entrancing and yet dark at the same time.  This isn't some fluffy, happy, cutesy story but it is very deep and emotional.<br /><br />This story is told through the five year old eyes of Jack.  I think he was the right narrator for a few different reasons but it also presented a challenge.  How do you accurately describe some of the horrific things that happen in this book if your narrator is a mere 5 years old and may not understand it?  It's a dilemma and there were times that I felt the author struggled with her narrator, but it also made the story better.  In my opinion, having a child be the narrator for the story made the subject matter easier to get through.  As an adult reading his descriptions you knew what was going on, but it was less gritty and thrown in your face and so it made it easier to deal with.  A story about a woman who was kidnapped and held captive as a sexual slave for nearly a decade and who gave birth in this room to her kidnapper's child is really tough and emotional to read about.  Having it filtered through the eyes of a child lessens the horror a little bit, which allows you to see the story as a whole.<br /><br />I had two issues with this book, one of them is small and one is rather big.  The small irritation is that sometimes Jack talked like a adult, or made observations that no five year old child would ever really care about.  For example, when Jack makes an observation about how people in the world are always busy and never have time for anything and so stressed.  A kindergarten age child doesn't look around and think about other people's stress.  It was moments like that when I felt that the author struggled having a child narrator who couldn't realistically portray what she wanted to portray in certain instances.<br /><br />The bigger irritation was how the adults insisted on treating Jack after they were rescued from Room.  Even his Ma kept treating him as if he should have been acting and responding differently.  When he said he wanted to go back to Room his Ma would get angry with him.  I understand that for her it was a prison cell and a torture room, but for Jack it was the ONLY life and existence he ever knew.  It was never a negative place, it was home.  It's only natural for him to want to go back.  And the other adults did it too.  When Jack took something from a store and tried to leave with it, they were angry with him.  He's a child for God's sake!  And a child who has no experience at all in functioning in the outside world!  It made me angry and it made me dislike most of the adults in the book.<br /><br />The ending of this book, however, washed away any irritation I had with the book.  They get to put their experience to rest and that part brought me to tears.  The moment that Jack stands in the door and says, this isn't Room anymore, my heart broke and I knew that I loved this book.  It's very rare that a book brings tears to my eyes, but this one did.  It wasn't perfect, I mentioned my problems with the book, but it did touch my heart.<br /><br />Also posted to my personal blog and other book review sites.hor struggled having a child narrator who couldn't realistically portray what she wanted to portray in certain instances.<br /><br />The bigger irritation was how the adults insisted on treating Jack after they were rescued from Room.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game is great. I love it. it calms me down and gets me thinking. I love the backeound music. it calms me down out of any horrible mood I'm in. this game is just a great fun game to play.
0525953728|5.0|I received the book on Saturday and finished on Monday morning. It is refreshing to hear from an inside man and there is no hype or bravado. SEALs are very highly motivated professionals; \\"rock stars\\" in the special operations community. I was fascinated to read about how this operation was set up, planned, and executed.<br /><br />It was also nice to read that after ten years of hard work and with countless dedicated individuals pursuing a common goal that we were able to put a finger on the most wanted man on earth.<br /><br />A really enjoyable book. At 299 of text pages I was able to enjoy it quickly and I recommend it highly to anyone who has an interest in military special operations.
B002AT4KA0|5.0|I didnt think I would enjoy the movie The Fast and Furious, but I was wrong, I have enjoyed all of the movies of The Fast and Furious series and I will surley buy the one that I am missing. Sincerely Janice
0345803485|5.0|I do not get why people are saying this is a bad book.  It's a good book, in my opinion, and I should know.  I like to write myself.  This is also my style of writing.  The whole of the book is very believable.  So all you trollers and nay-sayers, just shut up.  you're opinion, although completely your own, is wrong.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a really good story!

B0019HQIGS|5.0|I had heard the Tom Petty cover from this DVD and wanted to see it, I wasn't prepared to see 3 completely different and equally awesome sides of this performer. The \\"solo\\" acoustic set was full of beautiful guitar work, the John Mayer Trio set was the big surprise for me, a whole new side of the performer I'd never seen. The set with the full band was so full, more so than on his previous DVD, but as I mentioned earlier, the JMT set just knocked me over; a different look, a different sound, a whole different John Mayer. For those who doubt this guy's guitar chops, the Trio set should answer all of that and cement his place among the finest guitarists of our time.
B007TML4EI|5.0|A simple concept that is well executed.  I love it when it's you against physics in a budget.  Works well on my Galaxy Note.
B007YOC4RW|5.0|I'm pretty new to Joe Bonamassa's material and I was blown away by his brilliant guitar work and the reverence that can be heard in his presentation of the blues. After hearing this album, I will be looking to add more of his music to my library, and I'm curious to see his live DVD(s). I'd recommend this heartily to anyone looking for good solid electric blues.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This mic is one of the few that offers, great sound quality and power source of its own in this price range.<br /><br />I use it exclusively for the Zi8 and on my \\"Nikon 300S\\" since they are some of the few affordable things out there with a Mic-Input. Now that I have discovered the Panasonic G2 which also has a mic input (you'll need an adapter for the small mic input style) I continue to enjoy this discreet mic with its VERY long cord.<br /><br />I have ordered 10 or 15 of these in the past 12 months for our devices and I haven't had any issues other than sometimes I forget to turn the mic on (I'd get low input) or forget to turn it off (battery dies if stored too long while on).<br /><br />Benefits over the on-board mic:<br /><br />-Less ambient(background) noise, like air-conditioning, chatter.<br />-Higher input volume (you can adjust the on-board volume to get even louder sound on most devices).<br />-More directional, no noise from handling the device (zooming, clicking).<br /><br />If there's a \\"negative\\" for some people it would be that it is mono, but most mics are, and any program that edits video offers to lay the audio on stereo (both) tracks.<br /><br />Overall there's no reason not to get at least one of these for consistently good sound on video recording on a budget.
0879309210|5.0|Since I owned a handful of guitars that needed a little fixing up, I thought this would be a good place to get some pointers since Mr. Earlewine is so well respected in the lutherie business. After reading about half the chapters I began working on my guitars, I read some more, I did some more, now I have a full-on passion for fixing broken guitars and I'm looking to start a side business doing just that. For anyone who's ever thought that it's just too complex or that guitars are too fragile to be adjusted or repaired at home, this book is a must.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Had my wife known about the content and lack of story line of this book she would not have asked me to download it.<br />Some story line evolves in the second book have to make it to the third.<br />Certainly would not recommend it to any one.
