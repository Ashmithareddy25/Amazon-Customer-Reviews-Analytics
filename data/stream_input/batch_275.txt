B00004Y6Q5|5.0|What a movie! And one main dynamic of many things that made this movie so profound to me and others is the pashonate and extreme music. What I can remember most was the wonderful violin line of the closing scenes when all four actors have discovered how there lives had been distroyed by the addiction of drugs. It trully is a sound track to own. I don't usually buy sound tracks, but this is not a sound track, rathor an experience with the mind. This is not a CD of songs, but a journey that you take. If you enjoyed the bumpy ride of the movie then you will love this album. I recomend buying this, It's a \\"winner\\".
B00006GFAB|5.0|Most people already have a couple of KISS compilations. Well then, don't buy another one. Wouldn't that make more sense then buying it and griping? You don't HAVE to buy it. For the rest of you out there, this is a good disc. It would make a great way to introduce someone to KISS. KISS RULES!...
B000062XFG|5.0|Season 2 was Great! This Season is a great experience for all you trekies out there. It was different from all the other seasons. The Original Dr.Crusher was not in it and was replaced by Dr.Pulaski who did very well in the season even if she never had the same relationship with Captain Pichard as Dr.Crusher did. The season was shortened to only 22 episodes instead of having all 27. And it still was very entertaining. This is a Season that is worth the money spent and is great to add to your Star Trek collection.
B00005JL96|5.0|I don't know how they did it.  Somehow, the folks at Disney managed to make a character that is both one of the most ferocious and one of the most lovable characters ever.  Stitch is his name.  Originally designed as a genetic experiment, Stitch escapes from his captivity and lands on Earth, only to become the pet 'dog' of a lonely little girl named Lilo. <br />This is definitely a Disney classic, and has earned its place among the other great films they have turned out over the years.  The extras on this DVD are great--don't forget to watch the theatrical trailers that show Stitch abusing some of the other well-known Disney characters.  It's very funny.  Lilo and Stich is a great addition to any animated film collection.
B000065V41|5.0|My sister and I have to watch this movie every christmas, and we are both 22!  I love the songs and this is my favorite muppet movie.  I love this movie!  Its sweet and funny and really the best retelling of the christmas carol.  Because, it's not too sickingly sweet like some, or too traditional a telling for this day and age like the version with Patrick Stewart that put me to sleep.  A great way for kids to learn the tale, and fun for parents as well!
B00005JL2O|4.0|This is the third installment in the Austin Powers series, and the first two were absolutely hilarious.  This one doesn't quite live up to its predecessors, but it's good nonetheless.  This movie finds Austin up against a new villian, Goldmember, and introduces several new characters, including Austin's father (a great performance by Michael Caine). <br />For the most part, this film is very funny.  If you like the crazy, unpredictable capers of the other two films you're bound to enjoy this one, too.  There are even a couple of twists in the plot to keep it interesting.<br />I really liked this movie, but there are two objections I had to it.  First, I don't like the character of Foxxy Cleopatra.  There just wasn't any chemistry there.  Second, I think some of the jokes are getting a little bit old (like Dr. Evil asking for ransom money and telling Scott to shut up).  Still, I think this movie is worthwhile, and would definitely recommend it.
0316666343|2.0|Oprah would've loved this book. You've got your classic female victim: an innocent young girl. You have your tragedy: an ugly rape and murder scene. You have your female triumph: the victim goes to heaven. You've got your weak, evil or helpless males. And then you have a lot of garbage filling the rest of the pages. The family, which wasn't wrapped that tightly to begin with and we, along with our heroine get to watch. Ick. This is a slobbery, sentimental, poorly written triffle. It should have been called As the Stomach Turns.
B000067CPX|3.0|It has its moments with &quot;by the way&quot; and &quot;zepher song&quot; to name a few, and i mean a few<BR>but the chili peppers just seemed lost in the direction they wanted to take musically with this album whether to continue with the direction attained from californication or go back in time to the sound that represented them with blood sugar
B000002KBU|5.0|I'm mostly writing a review to register my five-star support and counteract the bleatings of the few shortsighted souls who called this work &quot;corny&quot; or found fault with Joni's vocal style.<br />For me, my college years will always replay in my mind with tracks from Blue in the background; I'm forever grateful to the roommate who introduced me to Joni's music.  If anyone reading this review is a big Sting fan, I urge you to buy Blue and check Joni out.  Both artists have always packed a lot more into their music--thematically, lyrically, melodically, etc.--than most any other pop icon out there.
B000075BFK|4.0|Being a fan of Pac's since 2Pacalypse Now, I've had all these tracks since 1998 when they hit the internet by storm.  However, they see new life and light by being introduced to professional production and modern-day technology.  This album is clean and you'd never guess some of these songs were recorded nine years ago, which in itself is scary.  Listening to this album you will find yourself asking, \\"has it really been that long?\\"  Yes, unfortunately, it has.  This album starts off strong in \\"Still Ballin\\" where Pac lets you know: \\"I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try...\\"  Most of the first disc is Pac's \\"Battle Records\\" where he lets all opposition know he's the best and still on top of his game.  In my opinion, that's his weaker material.  When he's at his best is on records like \\"Better Dayz\\" and \\"Thugz Mansion\\" where he's retrospective and shows a more poetic softer side that gained him mass appeal.  After all, he's the self proclaimed ghetto spokesmen.  I'm going to keep this short and say this: If you are a Pac fan, then you'll enjoy this simply because it's the work of a great artist who is no longer here to provide more.  But like he says in the bonus track:  I'M COMING BACK...I'M COMING BACK LIKE JESUS.  EXPECT ME.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Love this album. She is so full of energ. This is a very edgy, addictive album. Love every track but maybe one.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I'd heard of them before from mtv2, etc, but that was before i watched them on saturday night live.. i used to be one of those bandwagon music lovers.. but until the moment i saw them on saturday night live performing \\"last nite\\" i was hooked, i bought their album and since then i have never had it out of my sight.. its one of those albums that you can put in your player on \\"repeat all\\", listen to every single song over and over, and love it again every time. I no longer have to choose what cd to take with me anywhere I go.. therefore, i can say the strokes saved me!!! no question about it folks, the strokes are to stay
B0000004WM|2.0|though samantha fox broke onto the scene as a cross between lita ford and kylie minogue (that would  be early kylie, before she flitted off to japan and reinvented herself and the diva du jour of the ultra-hip queer clique), _just one night_ finds her attempting to expand her audience base into the urban genre. with production and songwriting by full force and c+c music factory, and back-up vocals by full force proteges and powerhouse vocalists cheryl \\"pepsii\\" riley and ex-girlfriend, fox does successfully transition from a pop/rock to a pop/r&b vein, but it proves to be too little, too late. with the exception of the lead track, \\"(hurt me! hurt me!) but the pants stay on\\", which is a stand-out sheerly because it's such a novelty song, the material on _just one night_ sounds like b-sides from more talented artists of the day, like milli vanilli, new choice, seduction and pebbles.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Everyone needs to admit that this movie is rubbish.  If you think this is good, you need to stop pretending that you are sophisticated, sensitive and artistic.  Just because the plot is incomprehensible doesn't make it magical or profound.  Thought provoking?  No deep insights to life will spring forth but you will spend hours trying to decifer what you just saw and whether the rental price was stolen from you.  Or worse the cost of buying this movie on the recommendation of your brooding local bistro who spends all his free time analyzing Jack Kerouac prose.
6305350205|1.0|A laughing Vulcan goes around curing everyone's personal problems by giving them a big hug(if only it was that easy).<BR>A clunky and faulty Enterprise is then sent on a rescue mission with an undermanned crew,despite the fact that the ship was orbiting Earth and could have beamed up as many crew as they wanted. <BR>Kirk and co then embark on a rescue mission down to the planet and are defeated,despite them being armed with phasers and the opposition with primitive weapons.<BR>Kirk then tells Sybok \\"you'll get no help from me\\" and yet in the next scene flies him up to the Enterprise.<BR>Despite being in direct contact with the ship,Kirk doesn't warn them and Sybok and and a few friends enter the ship and take it over with no opposition(no security,nothing). Laughable.<BR>Sybok then somehow quickly flies the Enterprise all the way to the centre of the Galaxy to meet \\"God\\".<BR>It turns out that the alien posing as \\"God\\" really just wants a lift from the ship and this alien is disposed of by a few phaser blasts..........from a ship that couldn't defeat a few primitive inhabitants of the planet.<BR>The only fun scenes in this movie are the campfire and mountain-climbing scenes,but even they are overlong.This is a very silly movie with a very weak story and Bill Shatner deserves every brickbat he gets for it. In essence,he has robbed Star Trek fans of a good Star Trek movie by hijacking ST5 for this rather amatuerish film.<BR>It is sufficient to say that ST5 was by far the poorest performer at the box office of any of the Star Trek films and no wonder.
B00005J9G7|5.0|I'm so excited!  My husband just asked me what I wanted for Christmas, and out of the blue I said, \\"I want a copy of that D.A.D. cassette that we used to have.\\"  And a few minutes later, waaaaaaalaaaaaa...he found it on Amazon[.com]!  Back in the early 90's, we rocked on with D.A.D. until our tape was worn out.  Unfortunately, the record stores no longer carried this album here in the states, so we weren't able to get a replacement, until now!... D.A.D is not a big name band here in the USA, but they should be.  This is definitely a must buy.  You won't be sorry with your purchase.  Every song is good -- no need to skip over any of the songs.  I can't wait to get it...I wonder if I still know the words after all these years!....
0375414053|5.0|Some reviewers seem to be taking this book way too seriously or personally.  Either you get it/enjoy it or you don't.  I thought the humor was great- and yes, over the top.  Some of the \\"nasty\\" remarks about stay at home mothers were hilariously outrageous and (of course!) ludicrous (what some working mothers in their most hysterical, deranged moments fantasize think things are like on the other side of the fence- no need to get defensive!)  This book isn't written for stay at home moms, it is written for frantic-working-outside-the-home moms (is that the politically correct phrasing?) If you are as pursued by guilt, driven by competition, and as frantic with perfectionism as the FICTIONAL character is you may find something to think about.
B00006CXXU|5.0|X-Tina's Back and she's letting it all hang out in every way. She's come along way since her slyly suggestive breakthrough hit \\"Genie in a Bottle\\". \\"Stripped\\" is a beautiful, autobiographical album.  Christina has grown out of the bubble-gummy genre of her fellow teeny boppers and forged into the ever expansive world of grown up rock.  She feels it all, says it all, and shows it all in the album cover.Unapologetically.<br />Every song is great, but my faves are :<br />\\"Fighter\\" featuring biting edgy guitar work by the uber-talented Dave Navarro is a song every girl can relate to whether you have had your heartbroken by a man or any rough situation.<br />\\"Infatuation\\" a sassy, sexy Latin flavored song is a great infectious song that gets stuck in your head..Great to dance to with your fave someone.<br />\\"Make Over\\"a great no BS song about being unapologetic about the way you are.<br />\\"Cruz\\", and of course the muy caliente \\"Dirrty\\"<br />X-Tina has finally made her way out of Candyland and into newer and better territory. I can't wait to see if she can continue to keep it up on her next album!!
6302862949|5.0|OK the story is quite contrived and today quite dated...Save this for your grandchildren to show them what it had been like.<br />THIS is a splendor to the eye. The dancing of Baryshnikov and Hines is worth it all. So the movie...a 1 the dancing I give it 5.
B000021YQV|2.0|In today's generation of nu-metal bands hankering the success to sound original and authentic, only few have captured the attention of true metal fans. Unfortunately, SoAD is not one of these bands. System's fans might beg to differ, but the fact is that SoAD tries a little too hard mimicking talented artists such as RATM and Tool. Lead singer Serj attempts to persue Maynard James Keenan's vocal skills and combine it with Zack De La Rocha's political lyrics. The result is a bad imitation on both parts, leaving SoAD sounding anything but unique. His vocal pattern is somewhat predictable, giving a huge lack of diversity in between his songs. The other members' skills are very mediocre, but compared with bands like Tool, System falls dramatically short because the band members sound as if they are competing with one another rather than contributing music as a unit. <BR> But, I will give credit where it is due. I am very fond of \\"Chop Suey\\" or track 6 of Toxicity. This is the band's highlight song because each member is playing at his full potential. The heavy guitar riffs at the beginning are very complementary to the melodic portion at the end. The piano melody is pretty ingenius and Serj actually puts on a strong lyrical performance. However, 1 song is not enough to change my opinion about the album, for the rest of the CD nowhere near captures the magic of track 6. Your money and attention is much better spent on Tool's Lateralus instead.
B00005JL96|5.0|I saw \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" in the theatre a week or so after it was released.  Initial marketing from Disney didn't inspire me to want to see it much -- to be honest, it looked like the invasion of \\"cute Disney sidekick run amok,\\" and the \\"cute sidekick critter\\" getting his own movie didn't appeal to me.  The addition, the commercial's exclamation of \\"cowabunga!\\" really turned me off.  But then, fortunately, I caught a \\"making of\\" short with Chris Sanders.  I decided I did want to see it... and before it left the theatres, I'd managed to drag all my friends to see it with me, too, and recommended it across web boards and email lists across the net.  I saw it seven times in the theatre and pre-ordered the disc as soon as it was available.<br />The movie itself; well, if you've read the other reviews here, you know the story.  A little alien, who is an illegal genetic experiment by an \\"evil genius,\\" escapes his captors (who have sentenced him to life on a prison asteroid) and crash-lands on one of the islands of Hawai'i.  There he masquerades as a dog so as to use the little girl who adopts him, Lilo, as a shield to prevent his re-capture.  What he didn't expect -- despite having the brains to \\"think faster than super computer\\" -- was that he would come to love his little shield, and want not only to love and protect her from his alien pursuers, but also to be a part of her little family; for Lilo is an orphan, and is as exiled and lonely as he himself is.<br />That Stitch is a mean and nasty creature is a given; his creator, Jumba Jukiba, says right from the start that his \\"Experiment 626\\" was created as a weapon of mass destruction, an unstoppable machine with no other purpose than to destroy.  But Lilo, who herself is not your run-of-the-mill individual (she studies \\"Practical Voodoo\\" to punish her \\"friends,\\" who tease her and exclude her from their play; she feeds a peanut butter sandwich to a fish named \\"Pudge\\" once a week because he controls the weather; she made her own doll and because the head is too big, she pretends bugs laid eggs in the doll's ears), knows that her \\"puppy\\" is the right one from her.  She tells him right away, \\"You ruin everything you touch.  Why don't you make something?\\"<br />Disney doesn't lay it on too thick with this story, and I suspect that is the masterful hand of Chris Sanders in all aspects of its creation.  It's irreverent, but not annoying; it's sweet but not cloying; it's hilarious and silly, but never stupid.  That this alien who was \\"never given a higher purpose\\" finds one \\"all on his own\\" is the true moral of the story.  That family is where you find it, and that love is greater than anything, is obvious without being driven home with a hammer.<br />Lilo is an Elvis fan, so most of the music used in the movie are great Elvis classics -- \\"Devil In Disguise,\\" \\"Stuck On You,\\" \\"Hound Dog,\\" and \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\"  My only complaint was using a new recording (by country/blues artist Wynonna) of \\"Burning Love\\" over the final \\"year in the life of Stitch & Family\\" montage instead of Elvis' magnificent recording, but I guess they wanted a few more original cuts (there is also a cover of \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\" over the credits, as well as two brand-new songs) in addition to the nearly all-Elvis soundtrack... but at least Wynonna kicks it into high gear with her cover, and it's growing on me.  \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is not a musical -- all the music is made to enhance the story only, used only as background.<br />The DVD is an overall great buy, as well; containing not only this marvelous film but also a great collection of extras -- lessons in how to do the hula, a study of the islands of Hawai'i, behind-the-scenes with the magnificent Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois, scenes of the vocal recordings with the actors (something that has become my favorite extra on ANY Disney DVD), story and animation development, music videos, and more.<br />Perhaps I came to love this movie because I've always been a fanof so many of its elements -- animation, Elvis, science fiction -- or maybe it's because I was the sort of child Lilo was -- fanciful, lonely, and excluded -- or perhaps it's all those things and more.  \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is a gentle, quiet, timeless little movie (note that Lilo listens to vinyl RECORDS, not to CDs, and there's not a computer in their house), as sweet as it is funny.  Disney needs to remember the times when their movies were more about people and problems than hype and selling merchandise (although for the first time since \\"The Lion King\\" I went out looking for that merchandise... and found precious little).  Or maybe it's just because it's nice to go to a movie (or rent one, or buy one) and just hear good dialogue telling a good story for a change, and not just special effects and \\"wow isn't this technologically advanced\\" CG animation.

B00006JDVV|4.0|Everyone seems to think that if a movie isn't rated 5 stars then its not any good. However some people seem to forget that 1 is the [bad] rating! <BR>With that said, I wanted to comment that while I'm very much NOT a sci-fi fan, this was a pretty good flic. The dragons were very realistic looking, the special effects were terrific. And while the story was a little less than perfect, the story given was acted out by the cast as best as could be expected. Mathew McConaughey beefed up and shaved his head for this one. This gave him the perfect appearance for his role as a bad @ss merchenary. <BR>  The future has been desecrated by the accidental return of dragons who have been hibernating since the dark ages. Now they are running rampant and have all but destroyed the Earth. All their glory and terror has destroyed everything including adequate food sources and they are starving and feeding on everything that they can find, to include humans and even each other. Without spoiling the show, its obvious that the point of the movie is for the humans to survive and destroy the dragons before the humans themselves are extinct.<BR>  All in all I'd give this movie a \\"Good\\" rating. Not great, but definately not garbage.
B000060OFT|5.0|mercutio in drag is perfect; his whole role as acted is great. He's gay, he's tough, and he dies pretty well. There's a lot of interesting thoughts, how they make the chorus (as done by the newswoman), the prince/chief of police, and mercutio black.  And how can you REALLY criticize leonardo as romeo?  He IS Romeo.  The end isn't bloody enough.  Paris needs to get killed by Romeo, especially as he comes off like such the cornball that he is. But he just disappears instead. Paul Sorvino as Capulet was good.  The Father was very good.  Juliet? My favorite scene that they leave out is her imagining having to pluck and play with her kinsmen's bones and whatnot in case she awakes early in the tomb.  Having Juliet wake up right before Romeo dies is very over-dramatic and so perfect as the play is over-dramatic.<BR>   gunplay in place of sword play just doesn't really work somehow.  John Leguizamo's Tybalt is alright, not his best role, not the best tybalt.  But he has the right look.<BR>   Very visually pleasing, and the pool scenes are all very good.  The Capulet mansion is nice, overall great movie. And great adaptation of the play.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Loved it!  Billy Crystal and John Goodman are hillarious!
0671027344|2.0|i read this book and i know that a lot of people ive spoken to have loved it but i could not grasp the meaning of the entire thing.  it seemed dull, and very unrealistic.  i thought charlie was mentally disabled for the majority of the book until the end when it is explained.  i didn't like the ending either.  i thought it was rather cliche and expected.  this book just did not do it for me, but i can see where people would enjoy it.  if you want to read a slightly more 2002-ish novel on growing up, this would be a good choice. otherwise i recommend you pass it by.
B000002U8G|5.0|I give this album 5 stars because of the amazing one of these days and echoes. The other songs are good too, but it's Echoes that makes this album a classic.

B00006V9A0|4.0|Finally, after 8 years, we get a &quot;best of&quot; album by Nirvana. I myself already own all the Nirvana albums, but I bought this anyway because I'm a collector. This was a pretty well done &quot;greatest hits&quot; album. Most &quot;greatest hits&quot; albums always leave off 1 or 2, sometimes even 3 really big songs by a band, that way you'll go out and buy the albums as well. However, they managed to get every Nirvana song on this CD that's ever been released as a single. However, Nirvana's song &quot;About A Girl&quot; appears on this CD as the studio version from their 1989 album &quot;Bleach&quot;. It's a good song, but the version that everyone was most familiar with was the live acoustic version featured on their &quot;Unplugged In New York&quot; CD. Also, the version of &quot;All Apologies&quot; on this CD is the live acoustic version, but the studio version from the &quot;In Utero&quot; album is what most people had heard. Aside from those 2 things, this was a very well done &quot;hits&quot; album. The newly released song by them, &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; may seem boring and sloppy at first, but then it grows on you and you can't get it out of your head. Nirvana was a great band, but I think most Nirvana fans would agree that their best work was never played on the radio, and you'll have to go out and buy their 4 studio albums to hear it.
0066214122|4.0|This book caught me by surprise, I didn't expect to like it but Mr. Crichton captured my attention from the start. I usually shy away from a story that gets to technical but he kept the tech material interesting. I also was plesantly surprised that he wrote in the first person, which in this story, made the context real and more believable. I highly reccomend this book.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I didn't like Incubus right away, it took some time for them to grow on me because they're so different. They sound unlike any other band. \\"Make Yourself\\" was the album that got me into them. Brandon Boyd's amazing voice and the hard rock riffs got stuck in my head after awhile. So once \\"Morning View\\" came out, I went out and bought it. I loved the single \\"Wish You Were Here\\", heck, who didn't? But the rest of the album I didn't really care for. I was used to hearing Incubus rock out, but they were a little more mellow on this album. After a couple listens though, I fell in love with this album. They still jam out the hard stuff on songs like \\"Circles\\", \\"Have You Ever?\\" and \\"Blood On The Ground\\". Then, they play some really great slow numbers on tunes like \\"Mexico\\", \\"Warning\\" and \\"Echo\\". Then they go into these really catchy numbers, that aren't really slow OR fast, you'd have to hear them for yourself. I'm referring to songs like \\"Are You In\\", \\"Just A Phase\\", and \\"Under My Umbrella\\". I saw these guys on tour for this album and it was just an amazing show. Although this album is very different from anything they've done before, it's still something that Incubus fans would really like. It has hints of sounds from \\"Make Yourself\\", but overall it's pretty different. I would recommend this album to anyone.
B00005UEAR|5.0|They just keep getting better and better!  For anyone reading this review who has not heard Dream Theatre, they are probably the most musically talented rock musicians around and definetly the best kept secret.  They are a band of five classically trained musicians who have chosen to create &quot;rock/heavy metal&quot; symphonies.  I would best describe them as a mix of Metallica (for the dark lyrics and driving rythms), Yes (for the classical feel of rock and roll), and Kansas (for the complicated rythms and instrumental solos); only more talented musically.  Their songs will never see radio play time due to their length and complexity, but then again most mainstream popand MTV heavy metal fan can't understand or appreciate Dream Theatre's music.  If you are a true and knowledegable music fan with appreciation for classical music as well as heavy metal, buy this album (or Scenes from a Memory).  You won't be disappointed.<br />For those of you who are Dream Theatre fans, I won't bore you with my detailed analysis of the album as others have already done a good job.  I will only say that I think &quot;Blind Faith&quot; is one of their best songs ever and the piano and acoustic guitar of &quot;Solitary Shell&quot; is only the latest evidence of Dream Theatre's talent.<br />I didn't think Dream Theatre could improve on Scenes from a Memory (a concept album just begging to be made into a movie), but I was wrong.  Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is probalby the best of a long line of great Dream Theatre albums.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool fans waited 5 years for this album to come out, and once it did, I found nothing to be disappointed about. When they put out &quot;Aenima&quot; back in 1996, people heard a dark, creepy, insanely brilliant album unlike ever heard before. Kinda like Pink Floyd, only more dark and sinister. Now that &quot;Lateralus&quot; has come out, we see they've changed a lot, but then also not so much. The singer, Maynard James Keenan, still usues his trademark singing style, by going from a soothing melodic whisper one moment, and into a dangerous raw scream the next. Adam Jones also has his trademark guitar styles. All 4 members of this band are EXTREMELY talented in their field. This album is still epic, dark, mysterious and emotional, but it's not as creepy and chaotic as &quot;Aenima&quot; was. The average song on here runs about 8 minutes long, which you would think would seem boring and repetitive, but it's actually very amazing the way they do it. If you weren't impressed by the radio single &quot;Schism&quot;, you should try listening to more enthusiastic tunes like &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;Parabola&quot;, &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot; and &quot;Lateralus&quot;. I think this was quite possibly the best album of 2001, and if you're a fan of this band you'll probably agree. I would recommend this album to lots of people, whether you're a fan of Nine Inch Nails or System Of A Down.
B00006690G|4.0|The eminem show, this album is bit different to his previous two albums, where as the slim shady, marshall... lp where on the representing em's witty lyrics and flow, this album is more on a serious note. Eminem potrays his personal life (his mother, kim, halie, etc) in this album in a very a clever and a honest way. Also there are mentions of the incident of 9/11, hence the verbal jabs at Chainey. The lyrics are the best aspect of the album. Em's respected as one of the best MC on the rap game, which he proves in the Whie america, Till I colapse. The combination of his lyrics and his effortless flow makes this album very impressive. the only downside of the album are the beats, there is not a single beat that hooks. <BR>Best song - Till I colapse<BR>Lyrics = 9/10<BR>Flow = 8/10<BR>Beats = 4/10
B00000253N|5.0|The great thing about Bob Dylan is you never have to skip tracks when you pop in one of his CDs. This is blatenly evident with Blood on the Tracks. Starting with &quot;Tangled up in Blue&quot; and ending with &quot;Bucket's of Rain,&quot; Dylan takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through hell. Each and every track will bring out emotions in you that you didn't even know you had. There is so much pain in this album that Bob even remarked once, &quot;How can anyone enjoy something so painful?&quot; Well, Bob, the way you turn your pain into art is beautiful and breath-taking. The way the songs weave together is incredible. There's no one on this planet that can write a song like Bob, sing a song like Bob, or convey emotion like Bob.<br />BOTT is not an essential Bob Dylan album. It's an essential MUSIC album. You'd be hard-pressed to find 10 other albums that can stand alongside BOTT. It truly is THAT good.
0385493622|5.0|This book is a delicious read.  I enjoyed every word.  All of the history was interesting, and the technical level seemed perfect to me.  If you know anyone that has any interest in mathematics you should get them a copy of this book.

0345448898|1.0|This book does appear to offer an enchanting world to read about, but be warned. The world is a lot darker than what readers of Harry Potter are accustomed to. In fact, the feeling I get from the writing is that the author is a disturbed and creepy man. I can't bear the thought of this writer \\"speaking\\" to children through his writing.<br />I loved Harry Potter, but this book is not in the same area. Readers beware.
0679746048|5.0|For a long long time I had been wanting to read this book. I had seen the movie like a year ago or may be more and the movie had had such a great impact that I had made up my mind to read this memoir. And then I saw it gleaming, all shiny and new and I could not help myself but pick it up. <br />After a long time I finished a book in one sitting. Girl, Interrupted is about a girl being interrupted, being forbidden to grow up and locked in an asylum. The Mclean Institute for Mental Health located at Massachussets. Famous for accomodating people like Sylvia Plath. The title of the book is taken from<BR>Vermeer's painting : Girl, Interrupted at her music and its an awesome book. <br />Kaysen takes us through the entire journey of being mad. Right from the detailed and minutest explanations of a parrallel universe to various mental conditions that exist. She has described people, sane and insane, drawing perceptions, all breathing and living, waiting to be free. <br />After reading this book I just had two questions hovering in my mind:<br />Is there any sanity left? Are sane people really sane?
B00007E8V4|5.0|Sup fellow rockers, System Of A Down is an awesome band.They will eventually become the next KoRn (best band in the world).I thought they really did somthing with there evil creation toxicity,but now this!I cant wate to see what they will condure up next!<br />             ROCK ON SYSTEM!<br />P.S. Maybe the Next KoRn thing was a little far fetched.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I think that the Marshall Mathers LP is a a great Cd. I particularly like how Eminem expresses about what he thinks about a lot of things(which reflects my feelings about why certain things happened, i.e. Columbine. I personally think sometimes that Eminem makes more sense about why Columbine happened than a lot of the people over there[but that's another story]) and I also think that a lot of the songs are great.<br />This CD is a must-buy for every Eminem fan.
0688170528|5.0|I read this book a few months ago and i cant even describe how great i thought it was. i read it for 3 days straight and i finished it wishing there were more. i'm always recommending it to all my friends. even thinking about the story now brings tears to my eyes. its one of those books that you read that really changes you. its so bizarre. i dont however think the lifetime movie based on this book did it any jutice at all. i was just horrified by how it included almost nothing from the book and so much was so drastically changed. i think a superb major motion picture could be made for &quot;the pact&quot;. anyways if youre reading this, get this book now!
B00006690G|5.0|I think that the Eminem Show is one of the best CD's of 2002. I'm continually amazed at how Eminem raps about many things(i.e. how the \\"estabishment\\" views him, his relationship[or lack thereof] with his mother, etc.). I certainly respect him, what he does(even though I don't agree with certain things) and I'm certainly a huge fan of his.<br />This CD should be in everyone's collection, even though you may not agree with everything that he says.
B000002WYT|5.0|With twelve jazz and rhythmic filled tracks, \\"Crash\\" has become a DMB favorite among die hard fans, like myself. \\"Crash\\" has been debated to be the best DMB album. In my opinion, it most certainly is. Some highlights of the CD are songs like \\"Two Step\\", \\"Drive In Drive Out\\", and \\"#41\\". Many singles have come off the CD also, such as \\"So Much To Say\\", \\"Crash Into Me\\", and Tripping Billies\\". The CD ends with a mellow Dave classic, \\"The Proudest Monkey\\", which contains classic Dave Matthews lyrics, about monkeys in trees, and feel good sax music made by Leroi Moore. Carter Bueaford makes a big contribution to this album, with his creative cymbal & woodblock dynamics, and his ability to make his drum set speak to the audience. \\"Drive In Drive Out\\", \\"Say Goodbye\\", and \\"Too Much\\" represent some of his best work on this album, and throughout his entire percussion carrer. Five experienced musicians with tons of dynamics under their belts have come together in the studio and created \\"Crash\\", the ultimate DMB album, and in my opinion, DMB's best work ever!
B0000009S3|5.0|A lot of people think Miles Davis or Herbie Hancock gave the spark to the jazz-rock movement in the early '70. Wrong!! With all due respect for those two giants of modern music but Mr. Frank Zappa produced this gem towards the end of the sixties, long before anyone thought jazz and rock could be in one sentence. The album contains music at its purest form. Great compositions (analyse &quot;the gumbo variations&quot; for one), excellent guitar solo's and room for others to show their abilities on their instrument.I love this one and I'm greatful to Frank to the end of my days for making this one. Buy it and step into Zappa's universe!
0879306033|5.0|This is one serious book. A comprehensive technology guide about all those vintage synthesizers we love. CleverJoe is a keyboardist and long time analog freak, and this is truly a good resource for all you genuine analog lovers out there (you know who you are, lurking in the shadows...). Lots of pics, chapters on Moog, ARP, Korg, Yamaha, Buchla, many more. Of course there will inevitably be some grumbling from a few people who don't see their fave synth covered, but the book is not meant to be a complete price or synthesizer reference guide. Instead it is a wonderful trip down memory lane, with extensive background information on the evolution of synthesizers, insights into the business side of the builders, and the history of some of the most amazing synthesizer built.
B00005JKCH|2.0|This movie reeked for the same reason most other superhero flicks did;they killed the villan.Why the studios don't think we will come back if they don't have the Hollywood ending.Most comic heroes didn't kill their adversaries.The Green Goblin killed himself after many years of battling Spidey.Why not stay true to the comic?Superman did;Lex Luthor made it through three movies.Why introduce a character that is a formidable enemy,just to kill him off in under two hours?<BR>If you select the pop-up fact feature on the dvd,it details everything the director butchered from the original comic.On it's own i did find it entertaining and fun to watch.It still would have been better had the Goblin cleverly escaped Spidey and exclaimed \\"We'll meet again Spiderman!\\"
B000000WZ4|5.0|I first came to Ultra (and Depeche Mode) through \\"It's No Good\\" back in May 1997.  I was immediately pulled in by that song and knew I had to buy the album, which I did.  But \\"It's No Good\\" only scratches the surface of Ultra and all that lies within it--the brilliance of the lyrics (of course, all of Martin's lyrics, I soon learned, are brilliant), the orchestrations and melodies, its range of emotions, and the amazing vocals from both Dave and Martin.  Dave's singing on \\"The Bottom Line\\" is just so rich, so resonating, so full--words really can't describe it; his singing throughout the album is great, too.  And Martin in \\"Home\\"...simply breathtaking, almost soaring--almost makes you wish he'd do more singing for the band (just almost, since Dave *is* the voice of DM).  I agree with the previous reviewer who said that \\"Home,\\" \\"Insight,\\" and \\"The Bottom Line\\" are the best tracks on the album, but there's so much more here.  There's something to find in each and every song.  <br />Musically--and lyrically, too--Ultra is a very dark album, plunging into the realms of human nature and passion and emotion, capturing man in all his weaknesses and failings and in his potential (I think Dave's prior drug problem might have factored into these perspectives).  The frustrated, unfulfilled desire of \\"Barrel of a Gun.\\"  \\"The Love Thieves\\" and the neverending tale of the search--often failing--for love.  The resignation to fate in \\"It's No Good.\\"  Fate and frustration.  Climbing and falling.  Struggling but never quite getting there.  Elusive love.  For all this darkness, though, I can't help being uplifted by \\"Insight,\\" the hopeful, inspiring, almost re-assuring track that concludes the album's listed songs.  Despite a deck stacked against us, we fight onwards, we keep going, keep giving love, trying to put things right.  To do otherwise would be to cheat ourselves, to cheat life.<br />All in all, a tremendous album, the one that sparked a passion for Depeche Mode in me.
B00006LHYC|4.0|Granted I am not a big fan of most pop music today, most of it I think is pretty disposable and has the depth of a dixie cup. I was just at Barnes and Noble this afternoon when out of curiousity, I thought I would take listen of Laura Pausini's US debut album \\"From the Inside\\". Much to my surprise, I found myself addicted to the infectious melodies of \\"I Need Love\\" and \\"Surrender\\". Unlike some of today's young pop artists (Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton), Laura actually can sing. Her voice isn't weak. She reminds me a bit of Michelle Branch but with a stronger voice. I was immediately sold on \\"I Need Love\\" but it was really \\"Surrender\\" that made me buy the cd. Thankfully I knew where I could buy a cheaper copy of \\"From the Inside\\" ...(saw a copy in the used bin at a record store). As I am listening to \\"From the Inside\\", I am definitely convinced that Laura is something special. Sure \\"It's Not Good-Bye\\" is a bit schmaltzy but in a good way as opposed to Celine Dion whose music makes me nauseous. For some reason \\"From the Inside\\" has that same pop/rock feel that I hear on M2M's second album \\"The Big Room\\". After hearing \\"From the Inside\\", I definitely am curious to hear Laura's previous albums. I think Laura is a gem and something special.
B00005JKZ2|2.0|MIB II is worse than the first, which I thought was just okay.  This movie has a flimsy story, good special effects, some funny scenes, and a story that weakens as the movie goes on.  I like Tommy Lee Jones, love Will Smith; but MIB II only gets a C grade from me.  If you want to see Will Smith in a better movie, I recommend Independence Day, or even better: Enemy of the State
B00006RU5B|5.0|Finally, after what seems like an eternity of waiting, its here! This album is definitely the best C.D. of the year, and probably the best thing any soundgarden fans have heard since '97. <BR>Chris Cornell's vocals bring something to the band that De la Rocha never could...melody and an emotion other than pure anger. Finally, a singer who can sing who isn't always so [royally cheesed] off to go along with an awesome band. The remaining members of Rage ( tom, tim and brad) are excellent on this album. The chemistry from the 4 members of this band is great. Every single song is a winner. I can listen to this one straight thru over and over.<BR>Tom Morello is the best and most unique guitarist alive, and Chris Cornell has the best vocals in music today.<BR>Many of the songs sound like soundgarden of old, being played over some classic rage instrumentals. I am a huge fan of both the old bands, but I have to say, this Audioslave is definitely a band better than Rage, and better than soundgarden. they take the best of both bands and combine their talents to make the best album of 2002. A must buy.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina finally came up with something original.  I like the majority of the tracks, and I definitely think she deserves credit for having co-written most of them.  Here's my opinion on each track:<BR>1) Stripped Pt. 1 8/10: Okay intro. Music could've been better.<BR>2) Can't Hold Us Down 9.5/10: Good lyrics and good message. Nice upbeat song.<BR>3) Walk Away 10/10: This is my favorite song on the entire album. Christina shows her vocal capacity and I really like the jazzy style to it.  <BR>4) Fighter 7/10: This song is okay. It took me a while to get into it, but eventually I grew to like it.<BR>5) Infatuation Interlude 9/10: Nice intro to the next song.<BR>6) Infatuation 9.5/10: I was really looking forward to hearing this song ever since she sang it on the Winter Olympics this year. Really good beat.<BR>7) Loves Embrace Interlude 10/10: Good background music and intro.<BR>8) Loving Me For Me 10/10: I am normally picky with ballads, but this one has a very nice, mellow beat and excellent vocals.<br />9) Impossible 7/10: Mediocre song. It kind of gets redundant and boring after a while.<BR>10) Underappreciated 6.5/10: So-So. Not the best, nor the worst.<BR>11) Beautiful 10/10: Very good song, good beat, nice lyrics, vocals, and message.<BR>12) Make Over 6/10: Probably the worst song on the album. Christina and rock do not mesh well together.<BR>13) Cruz 10/10: Very nice song. I really like the chorus.<BR>14) Soar 9/10: It took a while, but I eventually grew to like this song. I particularly like the end.<BR>15) Get Mine, Get Yours 10/10: I didn't really discover this song until after a couple of weeks, but once I got into it, I couldn't stop listening to it. Very good beat.<BR>16) Dirrty 7/10: Okay song. I don't think it was good enough to release for a first single, and it doesn't really go with the album. Good dance song though.<BR>17) Stripped Pt. 2 9/10: Nice!<BR>18) A Voice Within 7/10: I don't really listen to this one that much, but I don't mind it. It's okay.<BR>19) I'm OK 9.5/10: Too long and repetitive, but overall a great song with a powerful message.<BR>20) Singing My Song 8/10: Pretty good song. Nice way to end the album, too.<br />Overall, I don't think there's anything out there like this album.  It's really unique, and a lot of people can relate to the songs that the album contains.  Christina continues to show her talent, and the compilation of songs, except for Dirrty, really flows.  If you are a Christina fan, or like soulful music and ballads, I suggest you buy this CD.  I think it is probably one of the best albums of the year.  Thanks for reading!
0694003611|5.0|\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the classic, heartwrenching tale that combines a suspenseful plot with a heartwrenching portrait of the frailty of human nature.  It's right up there with \\"Go Dog Go.\\"  <br />I will warn you that this novel, though brilliant, is not for the faint-of-heart.  If your toddler can't take a little GORE or SEXUALITY, you should definitely stay away from this one, and stick to the books intended for the kiddies who aren't yet such great listeners--I recommend \\"The Complete Kama Sutra.\\"  This one is worth your money; buy it!  You've got to experience this for yourself and see why this disgustingly blasphemous account was banned in 46 states.
1878424319|3.0|The early chapters on how we come to be &quot;domesticated&quot; and why we need to be impeccable in our speach are well argued and worth the price of the book.  The sections that follow are less interesting and seem to be a restatement of common themes.  Also, the lessons of the Toltecs seem to be taken directly from the Carlos Casteneda series, perhaps because there was no new material to suggest otherwise.  The audio reading by Peter Coyote is excellent and you do get to learn the pronunciations of words like tonal, nagual, and mitote.  All in all, an okay book for adults - a great book for kids.
B00005JKTE|3.0|This film is not that strong though it has some strong points. The strongest being Cate Blanchett and the lush and splendid cinematography. Those two strong points are blended to great effect as Cate Blanchett's extraordinary beauty is presented against several breathtaking backdrops. Cate Blanchett conveys a very rich poetic substance which makes everything else around her seem prosaic and that is the problem with this film, everything except Cate Blanchett and the beautiful landscape seems prosaic. The supporting cast is not bad but they just do not compare with that central actress. The male actors who play Cates respective lovers seem to have been chosen for their profiles moreso than for their acting talent as neither are any kind of match for Cate so we don't believe she would look twice at either of these men she is supposed to be in love with. There is one other actor in the movie that is good and thats the grandfather but his character remains merely a background figure. The story is also a little unlikely. Sending a young girl with no discernible talents except her ability to speak French into a dangerous situation without any real task to perform seemed ridiculous. The whole time she is in France I was trying to figure out what her mission really was but could not figure it out.<br />Visually this movie will entertain you and Cate amid those great backgrounds will please your eyes and poetic sense as a painting would but the various elements of this story just didn't ever come together.

B00006J3T4|5.0|No big words here. This is essential. An even more fascinating work than his previous two solo studio works. I remember how I loved Golden Heart at first listening and Philadelphia too, and this is the third one in a row. A rare thing in these dance-laden, squeaky-voiced musical troubletimes.
B00005JL2O|5.0|I found this movie to be the best of the three austin power movies.  Almost non stop laughing.  This is just one of those movies you can't wait till christmas to get!<br />Some of the best characters are back, such as fat bastard, all of Dr. Evil's henchmen, Mini-Me, <br />And of course the movie follows the previous two in the \\"sequence\\".  What i mean by this is that there is a \\"shape\\" on the radar and everyone starts calling it diffrent names.  This is where the Osbournes make a appearance.  And of course some of the topics and planes that Dr. Evil comes up with are totally ironic and funny.<br />Mike Myers did an awsome job, and im quite sure you will enjoy this movie.<br />~hope this helps
B000063CPL|4.0|Brave New World pleased the majority of the Maiden fans by its old school flavored metal and the reintroduction of vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith.  Armed with three guitarists (Smith, Murray, Gers), the band sets out on another world tour which concluded here with Rock in Rio.  While this album has its flaws, it's an overall essential part of your Maiden collection.<br />Before we go into the goodness, my only complaint with this is that the tracklist isn't chosen well at all.  This focuses too much on Number of the Beast and Brave New World.  Good albums, but I was hoping for some more varied material like Powerslave, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and Piece of Mind (all of which only have ONE song to represent them!).  There's not even a Somewhere in Time song, which happens to be my favorite Maiden album!  Oh well, with the band going strong, they'll no doubt make another live effort and then perhaps we'll get some more of the songs we need.  That said, let's get the lowdown:<br />\\"The Wicker Man\\" - A part of Jerry Goldsmith's \\"First Knight\\" score makes it before the song kicks in and somehow it fits well.  While not quite up to par on the album (mostly due to Bruce's raspy voice here), it's a well-rounded effort.  This is still an excellent way to kick off the concert and the band probably used this as a warmup song.<br />\\"Ghost of the Navigator\\" - AH, here's where Maiden gets extremely good!  Simply good.  Stays up on par with the original studio recording.<br />\\"Brave New World\\" - Bruce really shines here and the band's playing outdoes the original studio recording!  So far, so good.<br />\\"Wrathchild\\" - GREAT.  This is the best live version of this song.  Adrian Smith truly shines here as well.  Too bad it's the only track from Killers.<br />\\"Two Minutes to Midnight\\" - I would probably say it's the weakest live, but it's still a good song.  I love the way they incorporated Janick Gers into the solos.  Sadly, it's the only track from Powerslave.<br />\\"Blood Brothers\\" - The BEST track from Brave New World and is performed exceptionally well.  Bruce really sings it with passion and the backing vocals by bassist Steve Harris and guitarist Adrian Smith fit well, too.<br />\\"Sign of the Cross\\" - The only track from Sign of a Cross (but not missing much, so I'm not complaining.).  EXCEPTIONALLY WELL.  This outdoes the original not only because Bruce sings it better than Blaze did, but the instrumentation is a notch better as well.  The three-guitars enhance this song tremendously.<br />\\"The Mercenary\\" - Ok song, great performance.  I guess I shouldn't complain because it's good, but I would've really preferred \\"Out of the Silent Planet,\\" or it making way for another song from the aforementioned underrepresented albums.<br />\\"The Trooper\\" - EXCELLENT!  Simply brilliant!  The best live version of this song.  The scorching dual guitar solo by Smith and Gers is awesome and Dave Murray is still great after all these years.  The only thing wrong with this song is that the chorus sounds a little weak because only Smith is doing the backup vocals, and it's not all the time.  Still excellent, though.<br />\\"Dream of Mirrors\\" - For some reason, I never really cared for this song, but it's just brilliant here.  This one outdoes the original studio recording.  While it's good, Brave New World has TOO many tracks here.<br />\\"The Clansman\\" - One of the best tracks from Virtual IX (the second and last Blaze album) and it outdoes the original.<br />\\"Evil That Men Do\\" - What, only ONE Seventh Son song?  Great performance.  Takes a little to grow on you, but give it a chance.<br />\\"Fear of the Dark\\" - THE BEST VERSION OF THIS SONG EVER.  Bruce sings his best here and the band's playing of this song has never been better.  Makes the album version pale by comparison.<br />\\"Iron Maiden\\" - Their infamous title track.  While not bad, Bruce's vocals aren't that great here (possibly due to mic problems).<br />\\"Number of the Beast\\" - Excellent performance.  The solos are fantastic as ever, especially Dave Murray's.  Not quite up to Live After Death or the album recording, but still a great performance.<br />\\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" - THE BEST LIVE VERSION OF THIS SONG, EVER!  Brilliant!  I could say that word a million times here!  Janick Gers' extra guitar licks really enhance the song and Bruce belts this one out even better than on Live After Death (and that's saying a lot, people).  One of the best tracks here.<br />\\"Sanctuary\\" - The only track representing the first album.  Good track choice and decent performance, but why not Running Free and Phantom of the Opera, too?!<br />\\"Run to the Hills\\" - Really good way to close out the concert.  Excellent performance, but too many tracks from Number of the Beast.<br />There are also some extra videos (Day in the Life, Brave New World) which are nice, but kinda useless if you already have the Rock in Rio DVD.  All in all, I rate this 4 stars and the second best live album.  This is still a great double CD set and a must-have for the Maiden fan.  I wish the tracklist was better, but I'll accept this and move on.xcellent performance.  The solos are fantastic as ever, especially Dave Murray's.

0453005071|4.0|It's been a while since I read this, but I remember all of the stories being pretty good.  I'm only weighing in here to point out that it was Stephen King himself who censored this book.  In a speech to a library association, which you can read at , King states that after his book (specifically the story called \\"The Rage\\") had been mentioned in connection with 2 school shootings, and the FBI requested an interview with King, he called his publisher and asked them to take it out of print.  While this is unfortunate censorship that King may have been driven to, he ultimately censored himself.
0316666343|5.0|The book &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; has to be my absolute favorite novel. This book is such a well-written story, it allows the reader to see from a new perspective -- the dead. My opinion is near professional, an avid reader, a journalist, a student, and an aspiring author. You should take my advice, along with most of the world's advice in going out and buying this book, and of course, reading it!
B00007E8V4|5.0|What can I say, not only was I very pleasantly suprised with this album, i have fallen in love with a few songs that i wont ever stop listening to. Some of this album was already released on the internet so i had a taste of what this album would sound like. But then I heard songs like Boom! and Roulette and it made me change my view completely. Not only does this album show their true musical talent, but it has tracks that most anyone could like. The timeless-ness of Roulettes, the anarchist lyrics of F**k the System, the amazing vocals on Innervision. All in all, this album, along with all of System's albums, is a must by for anyone who appreciates any good music.
B00006YXEK|5.0|As George gave us inspiration during his life through his music, he left behind a very inspirational piece of work for us to remember him by. While George will be remembered as the \\"quiet Beatle\\" his music is all but quiet. This album, like his others, is full of music with meaning that prompts listeners to reach inside and search not George's life but our own. \\"Brainwashed\\", the title track is hauntingly true. While this track is pretty obvious, the other songs are less forward and are fun to analize. George has had so many great songs that to say this was his finest moment would be too subjective but if George is one of your favorites, \\"Brainwashed\\" too will be a favorite. I highly recommend this piece of work.

0871137380|5.0|The book is a minute by minute account of raid into inner city Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993. After the movie came out, I had never really thought about reading the book until recently.  In doing so I fonud that Mark Bowden's explaination of the raid at Mogadishu was more than in depth, but with such detail that it felt as though you were there.  Bowden clearly exhibits the tactical precision that the Delta Force and Rangers carry out during the assault.  Mark Bowden also shows what these soldiers were faced with and what they had to do now that their hopes of successfully completing their mission were shot when the crew of Super-Six One was shot out of the sky.  Aside from watching the movie, the book let me realize that there was a lot more that went on than the securing of two downed MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.  Mark Bowden helps to realize the idea and inspiration that can be found during the raid at Somalia in 1993, 'LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND'.

B00005RY7X|1.0|Wow, this has to be the most pathetic record I have ever heard in my life. Just think, for only $15 you get to listen to some skanky grease-monkey bang his head and sing about parties. This guy has a very diverse lyrical vocabulary. He starts off with parties, then moves on to partying, then finishes off with partying till he pukes. Andrew WK is the Robert Frost of heavy metal. Did I meantion the awesome musical composition as well? Every bloody song sounds the same, and Andrew has failed to realize that there is more than ONE key on a piano. Its lame, its a joke, it just really sucks bad. Dont ruin your cd collection by adding this piece of crap. And in the great words if WK : \\"PARTY HARD!PARTY HARD! PARTY HARD! LETS GET A PARTY GOIN!!\\"
B00005YU1O|5.0|A bona fide landmark achievement in the field of animated movies, 'Waking Life' is a film destined for cult status.  The unconventional animation technique used here is hypnotic and serves to energize what would otherwise be a wearisome movie.  There is a coherent storyline present but it's periodically overwhelmed by the frequent metaphysical diversions that the lead character engages in with a variety of philosophically minded individuals.  These vignettes are purposely designed to be enlightening, outrageous, trivial, astonishing, dignified and even boring.  Unequaled in form, function, style or substance by any film in recent memory, you will likely find 'Waking Life' either an invigorating experience or a stultifying and tedious 100 minutes.  Fans of the director, Richard Linklater, will have a head start on this challenging and offbeat movie that is not without rewards.  A rare film that actually benefits from repeated viewings.<br />The DVD presentation is a great package, containing many entertaining extras that provide insight into the story and explain the unique animation technique; wisely, the movie is presented in a widescreen format.  There is the usual requisite deleted scenes and theatrical trailer, but best of all are the animated film shorts by Bob Sabiston, who designed the animation for the film.
B00006L83N|5.0|*** How To Ruin Awesome Music 101, November 23, 2002 <BR> <br />I could not disagree with this posters review more. Bring on the strings. Turn up the piano, bass, guitar and KEEP THE VOCALS. They Odyssey is their best (next to V and divine wings) and I hope they keep it going for a long long time. This is not a simple metal band such as the reviewer above thinks they should be. They are much more than that and the more \\"symphonic\\" they make it the better imho. I love the OVERTURE to the title track, just like I love Dream Theater's OVERTURE on their 6 Degrees. Now get out there and buy this \\"Odyssey\\" quick!
B00006JDVV|4.0|Very intense at times and probably the best looking dragons in film. I found the plot a little weak and watching the American mercanary (Matthew McConaughey) make a very foolish tactical mistake by cramming his column into confined space and exposing his troups to the Dragon Lord was ridiculous. Other than that faux pax it was an entertaining movie. Far better than the much maligned Dungeons and Dragons which also had some great dragons but really lousy story and acting.
B00005JL2O|3.0|No matter what you thought of the movie as a movie, the DVD is very flawed.  Not the image or the sound, mind you -- they're great.  And, yes, even the extras are sort of fun.  No, what's wrong with this disc is the &quot;Infinifilm&quot; coding.  In order for that to operate, other features on the disc are disabled:  &quot;fast forward&quot;, &quot;pause&quot;, and &quot;rewind.&quot;  That is, you can only stop the film outright (no freeze-frame pauses), and you can only jump forward and backwards by chapters (no zooming ahead or backwards).  Bummer.

0316548189|5.0|Nelson Mandela is a born story teller. He tells us his life in details from his childhood to the historical vote of 1994. He is a real artist in his way to link his past experiences, even those of the time when he was a child, to his present consciousness, which enables us to link the past and the present in the most enriching and enlightening way. He hides nothing about his life and about his commitment to the freedom of South Africa, insisting on the fact that the freedom of the Blacks could only be achieved if the whole South African, if all the segments of the population could become free in South Africa itself. He insists on the fact that even the whites were not free before 1994, under apartheid, because they were the slaves of prejudices and misconceptions of what humanity and human values are and have to be. His inspiration is deeply christian, but also deeply rooted in African traditions, because he is an Africanist first, hence he assumes this fundamental value that all Africans share, when their traditions have not been warped by outside influences or actions, that all men and all women and all human beings are brothers and sisters, deeply equal, but in their variety, in their diversity, in their multiplicity. To negate this diversity is the first and most egotistical sin of any human being because this leads to the rejection of one particular type of human beings just because they are different, no matter what the difference might or may be. Hence his struggle meets the struggle of those who want to free humanity of social segregation and social unequality, among whom he met, and worked with, the Communists who he always refused to reject when he finally made up his mind that the only road to freedom was a road on which all freedom fighters, no matter who they may happen to be, have to walk, struggle and even fight together, and this struggle is far from being finished and completed today. This book is a book of hope that shows that a free mind, or a people aspiring for freedom, cannot be in any way destroyed by even more than twenty-seven years in prison, because even in prison this mind, this people will fight to improve the lot of everyone. The struggle for freedom never ends and freedom means understanding the others, even your oppressor, because in everyone, even in this oppressor, there is some desire to free themselves of what has to be called their alienation, and we are all alienated to something or some situation because our eyes are never wide open enough. Even the eyes that are widest open are somewhere, more or less, shut to something they should learn to see, they should learn to appreciate, even if they don't know what it is yet.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Perpignan Universityple aspiring for freedom, cannot be in any way destroyed by even more than twenty-seven years in prison, because even in prison this mind, this people will fight to improve the lot of everyone.

B00006X06U|1.0|This item is so expensive that music lovers on a budget deserve a warning.Ms. Mitchell, like any great artist, has her share of delusions and bad luck, unfortunately this particular recording delivers little else.    The bad luck would appear to be Ms. Mitchell's over-long professional association with Larry Klein, who claims credit for \\"re-contextualizing\\" these songs.  Be assured that setting Ms. Mitchell's idiosyncratic melodies to what Hollywood schlock-mills think of as \\"classical\\" orchestration yields little beyond cringingly bad sound effects. This is music bought by the inch and it's no bargain at any price.Ms. Mitchell once mentioned the late Igor Stravinsky as an influence...you will listen in vain to find his influence in this recording.  The delusions are more problematic; Ms. Mitchell's songwriting has suffered before from sententousness and preachiness.  There's plenty of that here.  Plan to sit bolt upright in that straightback chair and hear W. B. Yeats poem, \\"The Second Coming\\" mutilated by such a superficial re-write as to suggest that Mitchell hasn't a clue as to the meaning of one of the great poems of the 20th century.  Mr. Yeats is surely spinning in his gyre, begging for someone to turn the stereo off.  You will too.    There are some good points.  Ms. Mitchell is one of the great songwriters of her generation and if you can ignore the endless mechanical sawing and puffing of the orchestration, her singing is fine on seven of the 22 tracks.  Wayne Shorter, like a true friend through thick and thin,is with her here, and as usual he sounds splendid.   Skip this and buy something that Ms. Mitchell recording before meeting Mr. Klein. (Taming the Tiger is the only unspoiled recent recording.)  I've read that Mitchell claims this will be her last recording. In spite of hoping that she hasn't sunk to making such claims at her ad-man's advice, I hope that it isn't true.
B000066NW0|1.0|This is a great CD, but don't buy it to play on your PC.<br />It sounds awful on a PC. This disc has been doctored so that it plays differently in your PC than from your hi-fi CD player. You might just as well listen to it on a mobile phone.<br />Poor Avril - she's been conned.
B00006SFBD|4.0|I am a HUGE Opeth fan.  This is an amazing album with great songs. Their song writing has progressed since Blackwater Park...but...the thing I cannot get past is the production.  Yes, you can hear every instrument and this is the problem.  The production of Blackwater park was also very good but the dynamics were much better.  When the brutal guitars and intense black metal vocals came in you FELT it.  The production on the new album does not have the PUNCH that the last album had.  They need to return to their old producer...still a great album ...buy or die.....cannot wait for damnation....

B00006CXSS|5.0|After watching Saving Private Ryan, I thought that I would never watch another movie about war. SPR was both so graphic and horrible and touching at the same time that I thought the genre had run its course; I felt SPR was the pinnacle. <br />I was wrong. <br />Band of Brothers will forever change the way I think about war and especially about WWII and the veterans who served in it. I most appreciate Band of Brothers' unflinching eye and willingness to portray the complete--often courageous and often very, very ugly--experience.
B000002S4R|3.0|This is a recording of a fantastic opera which fails to deliver what the work deserves.  Fans of van Dam or Moll will be happy to hear their favorite singer, but fans of Wagner may wish to look elsewhere.<br />Karajan is infamous for casting voices inappropriately, usually casting small voices for large roles. Besides Jose van Dam's title role and Kurt Moll's Daland, both of which are excellently done, the roles are poorly cast.<br />Vejzovic's Senta is inaccurate at times, as is Hofmann's Eric. They cannot even sing all their notes correctly. Karajan most probably miscast these voices himself. Both sounded vastly overmatched by Wagner's powerful score. This is a difficult opera in the first place, of course, but our soprano and tenor do not help it succeed.<br />Van Dam sings the title role nicely, perhaps dramatically different than one might expect, but agreeably. To buy this set is to support his performance. Kurt Moll is an operatic god, but unfortunately sings a small role. A Kurt Moll fan will be happy nonetheless to hear his voice here.<br />The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra members play very well, and very cleanly. Karajan's control is excellent, and his interpretation interesting and dramatic at times, but unfortunately, one gets the sense he sometimes slows the pace, introducing unduly long fermati between phrases in difficult arias, to let his poorly-chosen Senta and Erik meet Wagner's challenge. I regret to say they don't.<br />A listener might wish to try the relatively recent release by Levine and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, with Morris, Voigt, and Heppner, all of whom do a wonderful job, for an enjoyable recording.
6304510861|1.0|This would have to be one of the worst movies i have had the displeasure of watching. For one the story has no .... logical explanation. the writer does not explain any of the weird occurances to the audience, we're just supposed to accept that Bull Pullman just swaps bodies with that guy. I know its a movie, but even the most far fetched story line has to make some explanation to the audience. Then, the dialogue i find is boring, and does not help develop the characters, i think the script would probably be be about two pages long. The cinematically, every1 praises it, but i think it jsut tries too hard in that department to do these 'artsy' shots. Overall I really hated this movie. Although it did have a killer soundtrack, feat NIN and marilyn manson, and i did like marilyn's little cameo appearance in that porno.
6305971145|5.0|I have been watching this film on Beta video since I was a little girl. Now that I am married, my husband and I were just talking about how much we love this movie and how we would love to have it for the Christmas season this year. I was shocked to find that the movie was re-released, on DVD, no less, and widescreen, which is what my husband and I prefer. I purchased the above movie a few days ago and cannot wait to watch it with my husband and have as a keepsake for years to come!!    Thanks for re-releasing such a &quot;warm fuzzy-ing&quot; movie!!
B00005JHAB|3.0|No one will ever confuse THE WEDDING PLANNER for a timeless movie about the dangers of marrying someone you do not know well enough or someone whom you know only too well.  Director Adam Shankman nevertheless presents a sweet romantic comedy that deals with such somber elements as basic compatibility all the while deflecting the audience's attention to the fluff that is the plot.  Jennifer Lopez plays Mary, a woman whose job as a big time wedding planner allows her to distance herself from the distant rumblings of her own never to be marriage.  Enter Matthew McConaughy, as Steve,who is all set to marry the surface perfect woman: bright, bouncy, blonde.  Further enter a young Italian whom her father has chosen as Mary's husband.  If it is true that the course of Mary's and Steve's true love never runs smooth, it is also true that the predictable unfolding of the paper thin plot is far more humorous than one might think, thanks to the chemistry between Lopez and McConaughy.  What the movie suggests as a subtext is that leaving oneself open to the uncertainties of love necessarily entails about an equal chance of pleasure as pain.  The pairing of Mary with her unwanted Italian suitor gives the flip side of the pleasure that the audience feels sure is inevitable with Mary and Steve.  For this earnest and decent Italian, love is an emotion worth the risk.   <BR>For Mary and Steve, it was worth the risk too, but it could pay off only for two of the three.  Beneath the sugary ending of forced happy endings, love is truly a gamble, even if the odds are stacked against you.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I grew up listening to my dad's 8-tracks during the 70's and know all the songs by heart (like the little girl in Lilo&amp;Stitch).  I HAD to have this CD.  Hearing it again, it's obvious why Elvis was so successful.  You like rock?  Elvis did it.  You like to dance?  Elvis did it.  You like love songs?  Elvis did it.

B000002LK1|5.0|This is the first album I ever bought where I enjoyed *every song* on the album.  Impressive.  Definitely worth buying.  I had the cassette in 1990, and now I've upgraded to the CD... I liked it *that* much!      ***Also, I recommend picking up the World In My Eyes CD-single***:  It includes two more fantastic songs \\"Happiest Girl\\" and \\"Sea of Sin\\" which in my opinion should have been appended to the Violator album.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I am a big soundgarden fan, so when i heard that chris will be the new rage singer i wonder how is it going to sound like. <BR>and when i finally heard it i was astonished by it. the album exibiths Chriss Cornell powerful voice the remarkable singing style combined with Rage's creative way of palying, new guitar lines palyful arrangements. Chris lyrics are powerful, deep and poetic. I missed soundgarden unusual rythmic pattern but it was replaced(if it is the right word) by progressive sound of rage against the machine. this album is excelent no less. music evolve and so the listener.

I liked the first three parts describing what problems he had when he started at IBM and what he did about them.

B00006WUWP|1.0|This movie is about as weak and unfunny as they come. Minime's character is brought to new lows (sorry, no pun intended) and does for midgets what \\"Birth of a Nation\\" did for Blacks. Filled with fourth-grade bathroom humor, unfunny gags, the nonacting of Beyonce (but hey, her scenes work with the sound down). Nah. The second Austin Powers film was not bad and the crude humor was at least mildly amusing. This time around, the crude humor is just crude!
B000002P9E|5.0|Already wore out LP and cassette versions. Jim Steinman crafting around femal vocalists (as he did with Pandora's Box) and some influence from Stevie Nicks anchor this compilation of the songs from the movie. It stretches as well into knock-down blues and doo-wah (normally we hate doo-wah, but any musical form has its top 5% that anyone musical can enjoy). A lot of fun, a lot of energy, in a mixed bag. At this price, how can you go wrong?

B00006LSM3|5.0|\\"Brainwashed\\" is an excellent album... and George's voice is in incredible form... since everybody else seems to be writing so much, I won't go into depth reviewing the album... just want to say that \\"Brainwashed\\" should definitely be nominated for a Grammy for Best Album of the Year... the lyrics are extremely witty and interesting and the music is varied and melodic... to me, it is even more enjoyable than Cloud 9... and if George won the Grammy, it would be a fitting tribute and honor for such an important person in history.
B000066F6H|4.0|The Hives, coming from Sweden, could very well be the world's greatest punk band currently running. How? Two notable things: <BR>1)They avoid the pitfalls of current punk rock...there's no nasal, whining vocals (Blink 182/White Stripes), there's no self absorbed, pity me self-rightousness (Good Charlotte/Nickelback) nor political preaching (Int. Noise Conspiracy), avoids insincerity (The Vines) and The Hives totally lack any hip hop influences (Sum 41).<BR>2)They reach back and transcend the influences of the late 70's/early 80's punk. \\"Transcend\\" is the key word here. Other than just emulating the styles of the past, the Hives take the styles of Mod, punk and hardcore and make them their own.<BR>Often compared to the Rolling Stones (mostly because of the antics of lead singer Howlin' Pele Almqvist) this really touches base mostly with the early Jam and 1977 sound (Mod has always been and remains cool). \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" takes off from it's \\"New Rose\\" style riff to inflict real danger and menace upon it's listeners (\\"Gonna do what I please, gonna spread the disease, because I wanna\\"). The oft-maligned \\"Find Another Girl\\" shows diversity in the songwriting and throughout the disc they title songs after themselves in a Jon Spencer self mythological type thing...not a bad idea, afterall, who's cooler than Jon Spencer??<BR>The Hives bring life to a genre that's become increasingly boring in it's sameness simply by being old school punks. They are arrogant, rude, exciting and they don't care about rampant capitalism, broken homes, hip hop, skate culture or whether Mall Rats or MTV like them or not.<BR>Punk's not dead after all Wattie, it's alive and well and living in Sweden.
B00000342V|5.0|These days, the movie soundtrack amounts to little more than a commercial tie-in, and others have a good amount of material that's not even featured in the films they represent.  But Curtis Mayfield's soundtrack to the 1972 film \\"Superfly\\" is a standard-bearing classic, and it's quite possibly the most vivid character in the entire film.  One needn't see the movie to appreciate this album (though it helps), which is centered around the theme of the drug trade and the repercussions it has on inner cities.  From the first note, Mayfield blows you away.  The soulful swagger of \\"Freddy's Dead,\\" the achingly beautiful \\"Little Child Runnin' Wild,\\" and the tender and sensual love jam \\"Give Me Your Love\\" show why \\"Superfly\\" is one of most influential albums of all time.  Soul rarely gets better than this.  On the deluxe edition, we get one disc of the remastered recording, and the other disc has instrumentals, unreleased material, ad spots, and we are even treated to Mayfield giving his $.02 on \\"Superfly\\" the film and the making of its soundtrack.  This album is a must-own to begin with, but the second disc of bonus material makes it all the more irresistible.  If you don't have this album, get the deluxe edition.  If you have the original version, then you should make the upgrade and still get it.  \\"Superfly\\" is an incredible masterpiece that could very well be the definitive soundtrack.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|Well, well, well. I have been the biggest Mac fan since I was 8 years old, and I thought that this year--the 25th anniversary of 'Rumours'--would be commemorated with something a little more appropriate than this package. Perhaps even a \\"Rumours Sessions\\" multi-disc set, which would undoubtedly sell like lightning. However, the waiting public is thrown this two-disc rehashing of the normal Mac repetoire, and squeezed in are some lackluster album cuts that puzzle me with their presence. <br />Don't get me wrong, some of these deserved to be hits ('What Makes You Think...\\", and the ORIGINAL 'Silver Springs'). But my opinion is simply that this could have been an extended-length single disc, minus the fluff. Consider 'As Long as You Follow', and 'No Questions Asked'. These two tracks were placed on the original 1988 green-sleeve hits package simply as an incentive for collectors to buy new material otherwise unavailable. What are they doing here? Their recording and production--long ago forgotten--was an on-record audition for Buckingham's replacements in 1988. Are they really 'the best' of the band? No.<br />Explain to me, also, why the live version of 'Go Insane' was left off of the live reunion album? If it is 'best\\", it should have been on the album... but here it is on 'the very best' of. I'm just stumped, but I purchased this just to have it (it is unavailable elsewhere), and it is one of the saving graces of the package. <br />Nicks' 'Paper Doll' (from the long-deleted box set of over a decade ago) appears here, and is a welcome treat. McVie's 1990 single 'Skies the Limit' which was a smash hit anyone would recognize (and was too late for the 1988 hits package) appears also--and here you can have it without purchasing the otherwise lost and dull 'Behind the Mask' album. So, there are bonuses that bring things back to life. <br />It sits on my shelf, I guess it has won. I'd recommend casual buyers to search out the 1988 single disc \\"Greatest Hits\\", and die-hard fans would probably want this new 2-CD package. Sorry, Mac, luv you guys, just make sure to drop me a line if you ever release a 'Rumours' box set.
B00005JL96|4.0|not suprising for disney of course, disney is always great. i put in this movie expecting the expected. light entertainment with some good laughs. this movie was different. i was a little disturbed. lol. i mean its a story about this little ferocious monster that destroys everything he touches. and he's really mean and disgusting and obscene. and this broken home with two sisters. very instable. the little girl is sick, you know? disturbed or something. but it was funny. the director took a different appraoch. i personally liked the social worker, &quot;cobra bubbles&quot; the best. ving rhames supporting the voice. he was great.

B00005JLWL|5.0|I am a huge fan of Christian Bale, so naturally I had to see this film.  He delivers an A+ performance for an average script.  The message has been done before, but it's still entertaining.  The action sequences were for lack of a better word - awesome.  If you like the Matrix, you'll enjoy Equilibrium and if you like Christian Bale - you'll love it.
6301966988|2.0|No need to worry. While Swayze's characteristically vacant performance as a murdered Manhattan yuppie who follows his girlfriend forlornly around their apartment may have spoiled *Ghost*'s chances for greatness beyond recall, they were never very good to begin with. As a romance, it's admirable only for the ease and swiftness with which it dispatches any hope of a happy ending: no sooner have our perky young protagonists moved in together than one of them is killed by a mugger, and has to spend the rest of the movie trying to get around his incorporeality in time for the big action finale. We never really get to know his fiancée, the charming but utterly ineffectual Demi Moore, who drifts here and there on the whims of the script like a paper bag on an idle wind. The scenes between them would lack emotional resonance even if they were played by competent actors; they're considerably less poignant than the infectiously happy newlydeads in *Beetlejuice*. Meanwhile, the movie occupies itself with Swayze's revenge mission, which is only occasionally engrossing-- and we learn by slow degrees everything we had figured out by the first twenty minutes.  <br />The movie's ideas about the afterlife are simplistic, at best. Swayze and other innocent bystanders ascend to heaven in sparkly tractor-beams, while the film's designated villains are dragged off to what one can only assume is eternal torment by bad special-effects who grumble a lot, as if they were missing Frasier.<br />The film's most interesting characters are in the supporting cast: a grim, paranoid ghost who haunts the subway trains, and Whoopi Goldberg's phony medium-who discovers, to her confusion and consternation, that she really can communicate with the dead. In the end, everything is wrapped up in the expected ways; the villains are elaborately disposed of, and Our Hero even gets a brief respite from mortality in order to chat with Demi while bathed in a distinctly unflattering light, before his wide-eyed spirit ascends to the big investments consultancy firm in the sky. Apparently, the filmmakers are trying to convince us that the yuppie-love of Pat and Demi is Greater Than Death Itself, but they're both so utterly unremarkable that it's difficult to care, and the scene feels dishonest and manipulative. In fact, \\"dishonest and manipulative\\" is a pretty good summary of the movie as a whole.  <br />Not wholly without merits, it's still not worth the price of a rental.  See it on TV, unless something else is on.
B00006CXXU|5.0|With her new CD, Stripped, Christina is definitely turning heads. Completely different than the shy girl we met on her debut album, Christina shines. With upbeat songs like \\"Dirrty\\" and the empowering \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", Stripped is a CD for anyone. If you don't already own this CD (who doesn't?) it should definitely be on your Christmas list. Let's just hope you've been dirrty rather than nice ;)
B000069AUI|5.0|After falling in love with Coldplay with &quot;Parachutes&quot;, I was very excited to hear &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. They have some really original songs in here, that have a totally different feel than &quot;Parachutes&quot;. Politik and Daylight are good examples. It's nice to hear a band that doesn't always sound the same. Sure they still have really sweet and touching songs, like The Scientist, but they reached new musical heights with this album. I definitely recommend it!
B000002KIE|1.0|I picked this up outta the bargain bin for [$$$] because I liked PIL, and I'm sorry to say it, but I really hate the Pistols. 'Ol Johnny's better in PIL, where he actually has lyrics that interest me (if you dunno what I mean, then listen to the oh-so-true \\"She Doesn't Like It\\" and beautiful, epic \\"Warrior\\" from his \\"9\\" album). \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" is meaningless political fluff. John Lydon even says so today. He says kids these days who try to emulate the punk look of yesterday are regressing, and it's true. The one main qualm I've about this album is the song \\"Bodies\\". I didn't expect John to be so narrow-minded about a topic like that. I hope he doesn't still feel that way about it, because whether or not he thinks it's wrong or not, women still have the right to choose. \\"Never Mind\\" is way too amelodic and tuneless for my liking, and politics are hollow and phoney anyway, so this ain't a CD for me. Punk, as 'ol John would say, is a sham, and I gotta agree with him there. I love John's silly squeaky voice, and his voice only works well with melodic music behind his vocals, so I'll stick to his PIL. As for all you followers of the Sex Pistols... listen to what you wish, but they were corporate, they were a joke, and Johnny at least had the decency to let you know it.
0151008116|5.0|May not make you believe in God but will certainly help you face the tiger in your own lifeboat.  A tour-de-force of docudrama reminiscent of Henry David Hwang's retelling drama M. Butterfly. Best book of the year according to our book club gurus!
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have 5 other Beck CDs, but this is the one that I think is his best (even better than Odelay).  This is a great CD to listen to if you have just broken up with someone.  It is like &quot;Mutations&quot;, but on an even deeper level.  Nigel Goodrich (sp?) helps make this album really shine with his fine production skills.  And believe it or not, Beck really has a good singing voice...it's just that he is not known for it.  Don't be expecting any crazy samples like you found on &quot;Odelay&quot; or overall craziness that was on &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;.  This album is one to be cherished.  Other than &quot;Disintegration&quot; by the Cure and the first 2 Joy Division CDs, this is the best depressed CD that is out there.
0399226907|5.0|My daughter enjoys this book immensely. It is educational in teaching kids about the developement of the butterfly. Two other books I would like to recommend are \\"The Foot Book\\" by Dr. Seuss and \\"One, Two, Three: This Book's for Me\\" by Stuart Samuel.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's follow-up CD to &quot;Parachutes&quot;, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is an even stronger album than the first and that is saying something.  All of these songs grow on you, and the first time I listened to this CD, I knew I was listening to something great.  However, you just don't hear songs like track #4, &quot;The Scientist&quot;, every day.  That song is incredible and worth the CD's price of admission alone.  &quot;Politick&quot; and &quot;Clocks&quot; are other outstanding songs.  If you like British bands like Radiohead, Travis, the Verve, etc,, then you owe it to yourself to pick this album up already.  Even if you don't like those groups, you STILL need to pick this album up already.  This CD will be referred to as a classic 20 years from now.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Holy smokes!  What it must take to be a salesman!  This movie is great.  The only problem I have with it is the miscasting of Al Pacino.  I didn't believe him for one moment as Roma, a super slick real estate agent.  Much more believable was Jack Lemmon as the salesman in a slump.  We agonize with him as his back is against the wall and he tries vainly to make a sale in the rain.<br />What's not to like about htis movie?  It's gruelingly good.  I felt like I was one of these guys.  Alec Baldwin made me mad.  Ed Harris made me wonder.  Jack Lemmon made me cry.  And I laughed.  I laughed a lot.  This movie works on about a trillion differnet levels and taps into a lot of different emotions.  <br />And I was surprised to learn that Alec Baldwin had actually been offered the Roma role before Pacino signed on.  This movie, already great, would've been even better had their roles been reversed.  Baldwin has never been better and Pacino has never been worse.<br />The language.....  Makes Martin Lawrence look like Jerry Falwell.  But it's never grauitous.  Every \\"damn\\" is well earned.<br />The opening scene is classic.  It never really reaches those dizzying heights again, but it never sinks lower than great.<br />Again, the most unfortunate thing about this movie is Pacino, who is usually sensational.  The movie works in SPITE of him.  For a movie to be this good with a characterization as bad as his really says something about the caliber of the script.  I can't imagine a bad adaptation of this material.  It's that strong.<br />And talk about an enseble cast!  This movie is all talk- and that's a good thing.  It is one of the most dynamic, dramatic movies I heave ever seen.  And with it's origins as a stage play, it is 100 percent character driven.  It's intense and it's suspensul and there are no car crashes or explosion or chase scenes.  In other words, this isn't your typical mindless bullcrap.  It is smart, it is tight and it is perfect.<br />One of the few movies I've watch over ten times- this one's a bona fide winner.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I was eagerly anticipating this CD's release.  What do you get when you take Rage Against the Machine minus their lead singer, Zack DeRocha, and add the most dynamic personality of Soundgarden in Chris Cornell?  Surprisingly not another RATM, but a band that sounds like old Soundgarden, and believe me that is a VERY good thing.  Yea, the CD sorta lags near the end, but Tom Morello proves that he is a more than capable replacement for Kim Thayil and the rhythm section is underrated.  Don't believe me?  Just listen to the first 3 tracks which are the best ones on the CD.  If you liked CDs like &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; and &quot;Superunknown&quot;, then this CD is an essential purchase for you.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima is the best opus I've ever listen to!!!<BR>Strictly nothing to let...Exploration of many different styles that avoid you to classify it. Metal, indus, hard-rock...? None of those can describe what it is, the only word is TOOL itself. This is nothing else than TOOL and once you've put the disc in your stereo, you just can't stop it before it ended by itself.
6305508550|5.0|Office Space is one of the funniest films created. If you have ever had a job working in a cubical Office Space will be even funnier. This filmis a must have for anyones DVD collection.
6304698623|4.0|I had never seen the original (Shirley Temple) movie when I watched this for the first time and I think I would have thought less of it if I had.  I really was able to appreciate the fresh take on this story and the gorgeous visuals.  The sequences where you see Hindu parables are exceptionally well done. The art direction in this movie was spot on, down to the correct colors for the victorian era girls clothes.  I also thought the casting was great and that the performers were adroit at bringing their characters to life.
B000077VPU|5.0|I could watch over and over, there were more than once the I had a tear or two going down my cheek. I also know friends who have pasded away with this terible diease. Thanks for the awsome entertainment<BR>Sincereally Wendy
B00005Y228|4.0|I got this for my wife right after it came out and she really liked it.  This is a great gift for a woman/girl between 16 and 25.  We heard all of these tracks about 6 mos before they came out in the US when we were in Amsterdam.  They are crazy for this stuff there.  It may be played out now, though.
B000002LEE|5.0|This is what I recommend...<br />Put on you finest headphones, lay back in the reclining easy chair, turn the speakers to 11, and submerge.  You might also need a bib for this one...
B00005V3Z4|5.0|It took a trip to the U.K. to discover the merits of this mesmerizing, deeply personal film. Although released in the United States in 2001, \\"Donnie Darko\\" never came to a cinema near me, and thanks to a relatively silent press, I didn't even know what it was when it came out on video. <BR>Then in October 2002 I was in Northern England and began seeing reviews of the film. (It was hailed unanimously.) But what sealed my fate was hearing the hauntingly beautiful \\"Mad World\\" by Gary Jules. As soon as I got back home, I rushed to the video store to rent the film. Within two days I had watched it twice and before I returned it, saw it another time. I have since purchased the DVD and watched the extras and listened to the commentary.<BR>I love the film because every time I watch it, I notice something new, which causes me to engage in a whole new set of mental Olympics. This is thought-provoking, genre blending filmmaking that helps me forget all the dross that, more often than not, Hollywood inundates us with. And it proves true visionaries still exist. But what's more, \\"Darko\\" paints a more realistic portrait of the '80s. Although many '80s films focused on insider trading and drug use, few tackled the political situation as created by Reagan and Bush. Many of us living during the \\"finger on the button\\" '80s lived with a real sense of doom, which was very reminescent of the \\"World is Coming to An End\\" rhetoric spouted by Frank.<BR>Furthermore, \\"Darko\\" creates a more realistic portrait of teen angst. Then, and now, everything couldn't be put in a box and topped with a bow, as John Hughes wanted us to believe. Life is more complicated than that. Teens experience dark moments that can't be cured by a wild party and buxom babes. <BR>Richard Kelly's script goes beyond your typical Hollywood fare. It represents something archetypal and deeply symbolic. This is a stunning freshman effort. What's more the music immediately struck a chord with me as I loved Tears for Fears' superior album \\"The Hurting.\\" \\"Killing Moon\\" also has been my favorite Echo & the Bunnymen song. <BR>\\"Donnie Darko\\" is, without a doubt, the most important film to come out of 2001, and will exert an influence for years to come.
B00007E8V4|4.0|in my opinion its almost as good as the first album but better than tox. steal this album is much harder than toxcity but not as hard as the first self titled album which i think is the best one ever. they havent been able to make anything like there first one but this one is close enough. with most songs being rock hard this is much better than toxcity....dont get me wrong it wuz a great album but it wuznt SOAD. it lacked the craziness. steal this album is harder and if u liked the first album then youll love this one.
B000009EUM|5.0|This is a splendid cd.  I have listened to it a million times and I still love it!!  This cd got me through many allnighters in college.
B000001E18|5.0|When i first got this album i hated it and thought it was one of their worst. Today it typically falls in the top 4 when i think of U2 albums. There are so many layers and so much meaning in the 10 songs on this record that you will listen to it over and over and become more amazed each time. The music is so diverse from 'Numb' to 'Stay' and all the fun stuff in between. This U2 album is not for everyone, if you're a Joshua Tree fan, Zooropa may not be for you. But if you're into the whole U2, this one is definitely worth a shot.
1558908382|4.0|This movie has so much ridiculous humor in it that it makes it a classic of comedic cinema.  Plus, this brought John Cusack back into the limelight in my opinion.  Jeremy Piven also gives a wonderful performance as Cusack's old high school buddy.  See this movie simply because FX plays it constantly, and you can see it for free.  Believe me, it's worth it.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Pure rock'n'roll. Great songs. This album is the best heavy music since... too long ! Melodic, musicians at their best...<BR>Deserve to notch up a notable success. This is for conquistadors ! Album of the year guaranteed. Stoner forever !
B00001ZULV|3.0|Esta etapa que abarca desde 1978 hasta 1997, es ms bien pobre que buena: Los lbumes de excelente rock progresivo de la tapa de Peter Gabriel se han dejado a un lado, privandonos de obres maestras como &quot;The Knife&quot;, &quot;Cinema...&quot; y &quot;At the beginning&quot;.<BR>La tapa de Phil Collins esta bien reprensantada, amargando al personal con pop del faciln, del cual solo algunas obras se salvan de la quema: como &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Turn it on again&quot;, &quot;I Can't dance&quot;, o la mejor del famoso disco &quot;invisible Tocuh&quot;, &quot;Land of confusion&quot;, el video de este tema es uno de los mejores que existen. Por otra parte, del disco &quot;Calling all the stations&quot; el mejor en mi opinion, a lo largo de toda su dilatada carrera, incluye en este recopilatorio el sencillo &quot;Congo&quot;, Gigantesca cancin que nunca obtendr el reconocimiento merecido, por cierto del bloque del grupo original solo quedan los incansables Mike Rutherford y Tony Banks, ayudados ahora por la magistral voz de Ray Wilson
B00005JKJA|4.0|When I first heard about this movie, it didn't convince me to go see it. Then when all the buzz at the oscars started, it made me curious. This movie was very thought-provoking, it made you think beyond the box, it pushes you to differentiate reality from dreams. There's alot of surreal scenes, and scenes that don't make sense, but it makes you draw your own conclusions. <BR>There's no right or wrong conclusions. I like this movie because it's edgy, bizarre, unique, and surreal. David Lynch did an excellent job of bringing out the bizarre imagination in all of us.
B000001FN8|5.0|Esta disco esta totalmente hundido en la miseria, y de ello se han encargado los fans. Solo existen dos albumes del grupo por encima de este, en cuanto a calidad y belleza se refieren,El magistral &quot;Love Drive&quot;, y el multiventas &quot;Love at first Sting&quot;. Aunque sobre-producido este disco es perfecto en su gnero (tras cuatro aos de ausencia se nota la claribendia del grupo a la hora de componer).Klaus Meine increible como siempre y Schenker y Jabs compliendo en las guitarras, pero sin mostrar nada digno de verdadera mencin.<BR>Contiene enormes canciones en la estela prefabricada de los 80, como &quot;Passion rules the game&quot;, o el clsico &quot;Rhythem of love&quot;.<BR>Por otra parte temas oscuros como &quot;Walking on the Edge&quot; personalmente el mejor de todo el disco, con subidas y bajadas sobervias y cambios de guitarra excepcionales. Luego esta una brillante balada marca de la casa como es &quot;Beleive in love&quot;, y para acabar dos canciones muy similares pero excepcionales en su individualidad: &quot;Don't Stop at the top&quot; y &quot;Every minute every day&quot;.<BR>Sin duda alguna esta es el mejor trabajo alternativo de estos alemanes, que dejaron a la hora de fabricar este disco su ciega fe de abarcar diferentes estilos en sus discos.
0790731002|4.0|Very fun flik. I HATED the boring original. While Val Kilmer is no Michael Keaton, he still makes a pretty good Batman (Unlike the horribly cast George Clooney.). And Jim Carrey as The Riddler is the best Batman baddie. The film has great action, and I must say; it may be, dare I say, the best superhero movie I've seen. That's right, better than Superman or Spider-man. But X-Men may be a little better. The film has a fun little sense of humor, but purposly makes it corny. Anyway, a good movie. My grade: B+
0066214122|5.0|I'll admit that I'm a science fiction fan...and a software engineer.  But even if I weren't, I'd like Prey.  <br />It is a compelling read, centered around an interesting topic.  It is grounded in enough science fact to be good science fiction.  As any good writing, the author pulls you into the characters' world.  <br />If I had the time, I'd have read it cover-to-cover @ a single sitting (of course, then I'd be sad that there was no more!).<br />Do yourself a favor - buy this book and then pass it around to your friends.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This CD is absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! This is the greatest Moby disc ever! From incredible tracks that make me think about everything, such as &quot;Guitar Flute and String&quot;, &quot;Natural Blues&quot; and &quot;Porcelain&quot;(which is my favorite MobySong ever), to fun jumpy tracks   like, &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Bodyrock&quot;, &quot;Machete&quot;, and &quot;Find My Baby&quot;. Not to mention the classic track &quot;South Side&quot; featuring Gwen Stefani. If you like Moby, buy this CD! If you like quality music, buy this CD! If you appreciate life, BUY THIS CD!!!
B00007E8JP|5.0|As most people know, this cd consists of songs that were cut from System of a Down's previous two releases, their self-titled debut and the fairly new &quot;Toxicity.&quot; Quite honestly, I think that this cd is better than either of their other two releases, which I also liked a lot. This song has some VERY stand-out tracks, such as &quot;Inner Vision,&quot; &quot;Highway Songs,&quot; and &quot;Ego Brain.&quot; It also has their Ozzfest 2002 opener, &quot;I-E-A-I-A-I-O.&quot; If you liked either of System's previous cds, get this cd now. It's a perfect mix of their heavy roots and their current, more melodic style.
B00005QGAT|3.0|Well, hmmm.  I finally decided to get this CD because I got tired of playing the LP and explaining to my kids that an LP is not a \\"big CD\\".  This CD has been re-packaged.  You don't see the original Michael face, you get what appears to be his next face and nose, off the \\"Thriller\\" album.  You also get some \\"bonus\\" extra tracks.  If you're a die-hard Michael fan I suppose these are nice, but I want to listen to the music, not listen to Quincy Jones talk about this album. Listening to the Jackson kids' demos are kind of fun -- once. Complaints aside the music is what I bought the CD for and of course the music doesn't disappoint. Just skip those last \\"bonus\\" tracks.
B00005JLWL|5.0|Today I had an epiphany. I invite all followers of cinema to join me.<BR>The way is simple. There is a movie out this weekend. You've probably never heard of it. You've probably not seen the trailer.<BR>The movie is called \\"Equilibrium\\" and it will knock you on your [rear]....<BR>I invite you to think of a fairly common scenario: You see ... [an awson} trailer and it convinces you to go see that particular movie. What disappoints you is that after the film, you realize that all the really good parts of the film were already in the trailer and you saw them coming a mile away. Here is a new one: The trailer for \\"Equilibrium\\" kicked your [rear]... You sit down in the theater. You watch the movie. It is something new. It is smart. It is shot in a way that resembles but surpasses \\"The Matrix\\" and the action sequences are of a kind you've never seen before. Before it even has ended you already want to see it again. You want to watch the opening sequence and almost fall out of your chair just like the first time. But then the end comes. The last sequence. The final showdown. You can't bear to have it end. This is amazing. This is surreal. This is everything you've ever wanted an action movie to be; Extremely well written, smart, kinetic without resorting to wires or bullet time: pure, physical movement that surpasses even the most scripted Jet Li movie. You're riveted. Enthralled. This is new, exciting and so far beyond even what you expected that it can't end, you don't want it. You have to see the rest, but yearn to watch it again already. This was my afternoon.<br />This film is something special. Unique. It's science fiction, with the intelligence and character of \\"Gattaca,\\" but the stylings of the most hyperkinetic Hong Kong action film. It's low budget, shot in 20 days, and yet will make you think, react, and emote to the characters, plot, editing, and generally the whole film as a whole.<br />What am I saying? I'm saying this: Most of you in the next couple weeks were planning on seeing a movie. You go often, but not all the time, and usually exit the theater apathetic, sometimes smiling, but normally underwhelmed maybe even asking yourself why you wasted the money. Here is a film that has little to no studio support and will blow your [rear]... back into your seat. It's what you've wished you could have seen on screen each time you plopped down those eight to ten bucks and walked inside. This film is different. Go see this film. \\"Equilibrium\\" is worth it, and since you're going anyway, go this weekend. Support this film, let it kick your [rear].... You WILL thank me later. It IS worth your money.<BR>Watch the trailer. See the movie. This is what you've been waiting and yearning for.
B000002UAI|5.0|If this album was a bit \\"substandard\\" by Beatle standards as some reviewers claim, how come (1), it was a huge seller, and (2), why do I listen to it all the time, perhaps as much or more so then the others?. Amazon, there are fourteen tracks on this album, you only list twelve. 5 stars!
6305949980|1.0|This movie is dark and depressing. It has forever ruined Christmas for me. Christmas is supposed to be about love and peace, not torture and death! Totally disturbing! The only positive thing you can say about it is the level of creativity is high but what a terrible direction to take with it. Do yourself a favor and pick some other show. If you value your sanity you will steer clear of this film at all costs.
B00005JLWL|5.0|The biggest question I have about this movie is: Why didn't Dimension promote it (more heavily, if at all)? I saw not one commercial; in fact, I'd never heard of \\"Equilibrium\\" until yesterday, on a gun-related Web forum. I figured that unless there was some really good word of mouth, it wouldn't be in theatres long, so I rushed out last night to see it. I wasn't disappointed. (The answer is, Dimension had already made back their money on foreign pre-sales and didn't want to risk cutting into their profits by spending a lot on domestic advertising.)<br /><br />Sure, there's a lot that's familiar (the whole \\"1984\\" milieu), but that's not necessarily bad. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer has taken a lot of influences (\\"The Matrix\\" is an obvious one, \\"Metropolis\\" less so) and molded them into a movie that's both familiar and refreshing, with some nifty twists. It's not perfect, but it's very, very good, and eminently watchable. Although the pacing could have been tightened up, it was shot extremely well and looks as if it cost much more than it did. The \\"gun-kata\\" scenes were suitably over the top (there were more than a few \\"Oh, yeaahhhh!\\" moments), while still managing to skirt the edges of possibility. Take note that it's no more a \\"gun fu\\" movie than it is a samurai-sword movie; instead, the weapons are part of who John Preston (Bale) is and what he does. The story itself follows Preston's journey from unfeeling tool of the State to fully human (and flawed) savior.<br /><br />What's funny is that viewers are giving the movie rave reviews, while the \\"mainstream\\" media critics are panning it. I suspect it's because the movie's conservative bent offends their delicate statist sensibilities (the State is supposed to be good and benevolent, not evil).<br /><br />I peg \\"Equilibrium\\" as a sleeper: It won't do huge business in theatres, but it's destined to become a cult classic when it hits DVD. Still, I plan to see it a few more times before then.
0066214122|2.0|I must admit I was really not thrilled by this book at all. It was not only very predictible, but he could have left out all of the technical explainations, they were BORING and the average person would have no clue what they are talking about! Oh and the &quot;transfer&quot; thing, (those who read it will know what I am talking about) was disappointing! Man, how many times has that already been used in Sci Fi stuff!? Not only that but something about the thought of all of mankind at risk, and this guy almost being killed like three times in one day - then thinking to call his kids at home a dinnertime was a bit... I don't know, just stupid. It really took away from the moment.<BR>I had planned to buy a few more Crichton books... but I think I'll pass.
0060282983|4.0|I just loved this book. In my extremely deprived childhood, I never read Charlotte's Web, so I decided (being 28) that it was about time I actually read it.<br />Well, it was worth it. The bottom line is, regardless of how old you are, definately pick up this classic. It's worth your time.
068981528X|5.0|My twins, 2 1/2, enjoy this book. Though it has more words per page than they generally have patience for, they follow the story very well. And the story is quite amusing, which makes it a pleasure for a parent to read. I highly recommend it.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie is amazing.  To watch it once is not enough, Ive seen this movie only a few times, but of course I was never able to figure out the storyline.  I am not going to explain the plot, because simply, I would confuse myself.  This movie has got as low as 1 star from some reviewers...why?  Im writing this review to say that there IS A SOLUTION to the film!  I didnt figure it out, but I read it on the internet at some page which I will not give away, because it would spoil it.  Then again, no matter how much I TELL you wouldnt spoil it, you have to watch it for yourself.  Now...to all those people who see this film as amazing, thank you for actually seeing the genius here, even if it is confusing...The way Lynch directs is highly underrated.  The film was ignored from the acadamies.  I was reading the reviews on this, the fact is that this film isnt for everyone...but if you like a film that makes you THINK, then go for it!  To all you narrow minded people who said \\"stupidest movie of the year,\\" then you obviosly dont think about how a movie can affect you, or maybe you just dont think at all.  THERE IS A SOLUTION TO THE MULHOLLAND DRIVE PUZZLE!!!
0385335482|5.0|I am an avid reader. Mostly I read among the horror, suspense, and mystery novels which I have read for quite awhile. My sister, a non-reader, held this book in her hands and told me to read it, cinsidering the fact that this is so different from my usual selection of books. I am truly not a shopper. I am unfamilar with the brands that the main character, Rebecca Bloomwood, often chooses throuh. But beside those facts, this book is absolutly hilarious. Sure, it's not realistic but it will make you laugh. You may not be a shopper but I can garauntee you will yell at Becky's stupidity and laugh at the consequences. This book is appealing and will come as a cute book you can venture when you have not often read books such as these. This is truly an enlightening read and will make your day.
B00004SCX6|5.0|\\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\", Britney's second album, is full of great songs. In my opinion, it's the best of her first three albums. One of the songs, \\"Dear Diary\\", was co-written by Britney. This album includes the lyrics for the four singles which are \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\", \\"Lucky\\", \\"Stronger\\", \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\", and \\"Dear Diary\\".<br />Below is a list of the twelve songs in this album that tells how good (in my opinion) they are.<br />1. \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" - 5/5 points. This was the first single. Who does not like this song? It's one of the best. It has a great beat.<br />2. \\"Stronger\\" - 5/5 pts. This is another very good song. It gives you energy if you hear it and makes you feel \\"stronger\\".<br />3. \\"Don't Go Knocking On My Door\\" - 4/5 pts. A good song with very good lyrics. This song sounds similar to many of the songs in this abum. The beat is not bad, though.<br />4. \\"(I Can't Get Know) Satisfaction\\" - 4/5 pts. This song is not bad, but the beat does not change much in the songs in this album. Britney should find something new. Also, the chorus is repeated over and over again in this song. You get tired of hearing it.<br />5. \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" - 5/5 pts. This is such a very good ballad co-written by Shania Twain. It's very relaxing. You will not get tired of hearing it.<br />6. \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\" - 5/5 pts. Even though this song has the same old beat, the lyrics in it are very good. If someone loves you, they should love you for what you are. That's what it basically says.<br />7. \\"Lucky\\" - 5/5 pts. \\"Lucky\\", the second single out of this album, talks about a superstar who has it all, but has nobody close so she is sad. It is a slower song. It is also very relaxing.<br />8. \\"One Kiss From You\\" - 3/5 pts. This is not a bad nor a good song. The beat does not \\"match\\" the vocals. The lyrics are nothing special.<br />9. \\"Where Are You Now\\" - 5/5 pts. This ballad talks about a girl who cannot live without knowing where the person she loves is now. \\"Where Are You Now\\" is a beautiful ballad that sounds incredibly good.<br />10. \\"Can't Make You Love Me\\" - 4/5 pts. The beat in this song is very cool. This song is great for dancing. It tells that you can never make someone love you.<br />11. \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\" - 5/5 pts. This is another ballad. None of Britney's ballads are bad. They are all very good and relaxing.<br />12. \\"Dear Diary\\" - 4/5 pts. This ballad was co-written by Britney. It talks about a girl who falls in love for the first time. It's not a long song and does not repeat any part.
B000068QY7|5.0|WOW! we've all heard of this band before but have never heard them like this.

B00006RAKP|5.0|This collection reflects a goldmine of classics and represents a career of remarkable achievement that already spans over 40 years. You can hardly find another artist who constantly had released more albums and hit singles to become million sellers than Sir Elton John. Nowadays his worldwide record sales are still climbing with high intense. This last double-LP had already sold nine million units - 5000k in US alone - and will last as another great success. Although two or three dozen wonderful songs are missing, such as \\"Song for Guy\\" or \\"Healing Hands\\", this retrospective is nearly complete concerning the claim of beeing a best-of. On the other hand you have to admit that this is a quite commercial release that only gives a superficial view of his musical range. But if you wanna hear a high-carat masterpiece of popular music of the 70s, 80s and 90s you should get this one.
B0000027D5|2.0|... as one might think, considering that this album was, a few years ago listed in an Entertainment Weekly article as one of the hundred best albums of all time--and rated fairly high within that one hundred, as I recall. I bought the album a few years ago on the strength of that.<br />I was initially rather disappointed. The versions of Santana's most popular numbers Black Magic Woman and Oye Como Va are rather perfunctory, and much of the rest of the album is devoted to lengthy jazz fusion tracks.<br />Recently, having purchased a car with a CD player, I have resurrected a number of neglected CDs including this set. It has not improved. While there are some excellent numbers with inspired playing there are a number of negatives that count against this album and in my opinion exclude it from any all time great list.<br />1. Poor recording quality. While live albums, for example BB King at the Regal sometimes provide a fine example of a musician in tune with an audience, this is not one of them, and it is replete with squealing feedback and poorly engineered instrumental balance.<br />2. Way too long, with far too many long noodling solos that go nowhere. Although there is some fine playing by Santana on lead guitar, there is also a fair amount of showoff trickery and repetition that adds nothing to the music. There is also one track of over nine minutes that is nothing but a percussion solo. Samba Pa Ti, which is an exquisitely pretty tune is largely thrown away, Black Magic Woman is cursory, and so on. Some of the later tracks on the second album, though overblown, provide some good driving music, with occasional whimsical quotations from pop tunes.
B000075BFK|2.0|I wonder if the producers of this album actually ever listened to Pac.  To waste the raw lyrics of someone who can write no longer by combining them with some sort of R&amp;B/Jazz mess of an instrumental is to defame the memory of him.  The inflections of his voice are all but drown out from the overboosted inappropriate background.  The actual lyrics are tough to hear at times as well, definitely not true to Pac.  I've had it for two days, turned it off mid CD (Disk 2) at one point out of sheer disappointment.  If the producers let Pac be Pac, and not THEIR interpretation of him, this CD would be incredible.  Sadly enough, there is not one truley raw song on either CD, one even sounds country-music like.  I gave it two stars out of respect for the man, the album rates negative.  See mine on ebay later today.  I would pay quadruple for a CD of the raw tracks that he laid down before his demise.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is an astounding novel written by Frank McCourt who writes about the arduous times he goes through as he relives his childhood.  Taking place in the 1940s, the reader is aware of the hardships bestowed upon the unfortunate.  When Frank was only 4, he moved from America because of their poverty stricken state, to Ireland, the country of his forefather.   At his very young age, McCourt recalls his father drinking up all their money to where their mother who has kept her pride turns to begging, just to keep bread on their table.  Being the oldest child, Frank is treated like an adult and watches over his siblings and is strong for his mother who mourns over the death of her babies.  Frank McCourt writes his novel in his Ireland voice using terms such as \\" fiddler's fart\\" that shows his colloquial diction  acquired from the streets of Limerick,  and \\"tis'\\" which demonstrates his formality.  As he grows up living his life with endless hunger and poor health, he is determined to move back to America where he can get a job and support his family.  He is aware that his father never brought home the promised wages, and he feels it is his duty as the oldest, to be a man and care for his family by bringing in the wages.  This story made me laugh as Frank learned how to deal with situations as he grows up and cry as I felt  pity for him when he feels deserted in life and doesn't have a scrap of food to come home to.  It made me appreciate life and realize how fortunate I am.
0060536969|2.0|I have always been and will continue to be a fan of  Michael Crichton but &quot;Prey&quot; was a disappoinment.  Since publishing &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; the author has written several screenplays in the guise of novels in which technology runs amuck.  This novel follows the same theme but is tiresome.  &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is more fun and for that matter more believable under the circumstances.  The audio book was poorly narrated--at first I thought the bateries in my machine needed changing so I changed them but the narration remained slow.  Also, the narrator continuously pronounced Nevada the irritating way Nevadans resent.  For those interested in the audio version, don't waste your money on the unabridged version--buy the abridged for a quicker and less tedious &quot;read.&quot;
B00005JKCH|3.0|Casting Tobey Maguire is the best thing about this movie; casting Kirsten Dunst is definitely the worst, ... just zero charisma, and her red hair is so blatantly fake it's not even funny.  Uncle Ben and Aunt May are also played by underwhelming actors...after Maguire, only William Dafoe pulls his own weight here.<br />The special effects were also second rate, especially compared with for example \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\"---you often feel that you're watching a video game because they're so choppy and cartoonish-looking.  The fight choreography is also lame...c'mon, in this day and age you could probably find better combat scenes in any 3rd rate B-movie with a fraction of this film's production budget!<br />One nice thing about this movie is the political subtext: at the film's ending, we see Spidey swinging by an American flag atop a skyscraper while Maguire's voiceover recalls his Uncle's last lecture: \\"With great power comes great responsibility.\\"  A nice counterpoint to the post-9/11 Bush jingoistic warmongering, but probably will be missed by most viewers.
B000009O8A|5.0|I noticed there is a &quot;I Spit on Your Grave (Millennium Edition) (1978)&quot; What is the difference between the other DVD release (other than interviews and photo gallery). Is there a RATED and UNRATED version of this film? Is this DVD different from the original release? Just want to know If this is an edited version of the film or wich one is UNRATED or the same as the original release.
0452281881|4.0|This book is a riot! It has everything...sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, and plenty of back-stabbing.  I laughed all the way through it.  I can hardly wait to get my hands on \\"The E Before Christmas\\".  Happy reading!
B000001FO4|5.0|even after all these years, for some reason, cinderella continues to be lumped in with the likes of hair-meal lightweights like winger.  but anyone who really listened, especially to heartbreak station and this record - it's just not the case...sure they've<BR>got the hooks and the ballads, but they back it up with bluesy,<BR>ballsy feeling.  anyone who doesn't appreciate the likes of &quot;gypsy road&quot;, &quot;fallin' apart at the seams&quot; and &quot;coming home&quot; may be just a little too snobby for their own good...
B000000OSG|4.0|\\"Use Your Illusion II\\" is a completely different kind of album than \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" and \\"Use Your Illusion I\\". This album is loaded with mellow and slow songs.Civil War: This is one of the best songs Guns N' Roses ever put out. A great epic addressing political issues. It speeds up at the end, which sounds just wonderful.14 Years: I like this song. It's a great bluesy rock tune with piano incorporated greatly.Yesterdays: This song is pretty, but it gets kind of boring... Fast.Knockin On Heavens Door: Beautiful guitar at the beginning. It sounds really wonderful, but it gets to sounding weird at the end with a gospel choir.Get In the Ring: Hilarious song. Very fun listen. This is the first hard rockin song on the album. Enjoy it while it lasts.Shotgun Blues: An okay bluesy sounding song, but nothing special.Breakdown: Sounds awful at the beginning, but the actual song is good. We could have done without the really low voice though, it kills the feeling.Pretty Tied Up: I like this song a lot. It has some interesting lyrics and some catchy music.Locomotive: The hardest rockin song on the album, but it's pretty long and repetetive.So Fine: Great song by Duff. It starts out slow and pretty, but it builds up into something cool.Estranged: Very emotional, relaxing song. Great guitar work. This is a slow ballad-type song.You Could Be Mine: This is the closest to \\"Appetite\\" either one of the \\"Illusion\\" albums gets. Wonderful rock here.Dont Cry: This version has alternate lyrics, but the music they sing on the verse is slightly different as well. I like this version much better than the original, as the lyrics are much more emotional and the vocals are at a lower pitch.My World: The vocals sound cool, kind of like some gothic-industrial stuff, but the music in the back absolutely .... Very rap sound. Kind of creepy song.Overall, this is a great buy if you like music, but if you are expecting the hard rockin sound of \\"Appetite\\", maybe you should go with part I.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie breaks all the rules of horror and sets its own.  There are gruesome killings, but we never see them happen.  The victims are people we never meet, but get the gut feeling we wouldn't be to fond of.  The murderer (Spacey) is revealed and arrested long before the climatic finish, and the great finale spares a gore show in favor of pure suspence and psychological terror.<br />The movie follows a pair of detectives as they slowly but surely track the killer, who leaves a string of victims by the specific sin they had commited.  (The first victim is labled for gluttony, then greed, and so on.)  These city detectives are the rational cool headed Somerset (Freeman) and the cocky young Mills (Pitt).  Somerset is single and takes his job very seriously when others don't.  He relies on logic and research.  Mills has a lovely wife and lives in what appears to be a nice home, although it often shakes due to its location.  These simple differences help to portray the differences in these two characters who are fairly distant, though they work together the whole time.<br />The movie from here becomes completely psychological, and its antagonist portrays a very grim image of the world in the theological sense.  But the thrill and suspense lies in whether the detectives stop the killer before he finishes his cycle of Seven, not to mention the eerie surprise that awaits at the climax.<br />The setting is in New York, and most of the scenes are very gloomy and dark.  There's a lot of imagery to go along with the plot, so rather than pass off the more gruesome scenes as just that, pay close attention to everything.  There are clues in unexpected places as well as some interesting tidbits that relate back to the literature used for reference of the Seven Deadly Sins.  The music is well fitting and quite frankly really good, but don't bother getting the soundtrack.  The best and most important songs are for some reason, not on it.<br />If you want a good slasher film, don'tlook here.  If you want a real pychological thriller, then don't miss this.  From the acting to the theme, it's a real treat.
6304873441|2.0|This was, I have to admit, a cute movie... but that's it. It is mostly incorrect when it comes to historical facts. First of all, Demitri (the guy that &quot;Anastasia&quot; falls in love with) in real life was her cousin who lived in the palace with the family... ok, so now we're teaching kids that it's ok to date family members? Secondly, though Rasputin was a pretty shady guy, he was generally liked by the Romonof family because he helped relieve their son's, Alexis's, haemophilia. Well, those are just a few things that I can think of off the top of my head, but seroiusly, if you're going to make a historical film for kids, the least you can do is try to make it just a bit more correct.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus' latest release, the oceanic Morning View is arguably their best work to date! I rushed out and purchased this cd on the day it came out and it just blew me away! Each song captures and personifies a different image, mainly of what is going on in Brandon Boyd's life and is lyrically brilliant. From the blood pumping energy rush of &quot;circles&quot; to the laid back, harmonic flow of &quot;11am&quot;, Morning View is a must have for any Incubus fan!! For those who own their previously released albums: Fungus Amongus, S.C.I.E.N.C.E and Make Yourself and have not yet heard Morning View, it may come as a surprise. Morning View is by far Incubus' most laid back work to date, but i believe it is their best and it still hasn't left my CD player. Morning View opens with the rocking, but catchy &quot;Nice To Know You&quot;: a perfect intro for the CD and a great listen. &quot;Circles&quot;, along with &quot;Blood On the Ground&quot;, &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; and &quot;Have You Ever&quot; are the more heavier songs on the CD, each song sending fat guitar riffs and mind blowing lyrics out of your stereo. &quot;Wish You Were Here', &quot;Warning&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;11am&quot; are the type of songs you can listen to while lazing on the beach, gazing out into the ocean. &quot;Are You In?&quot; is a feel good song, party song, &quot;Mexico&quot; is a brilliantly written acoustic melody and &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; is a something very different! And &quot;Just A Phase&quot; is a masterpiece! Morning View is one of the best CD's I own and i highly recommend it to any Incu-fan or music fan in general!
B000000132|5.0|This is a beautifully poetic album. The songwriting is masterful and the band's delivery is nothing short of exceptional. Not for the average listener who wants simple hook-based commercial music and themes, this album/CD takes the listener on an evocative journey. <BR>Songwriting reminiscent of classic YES with vocals and harmonies reminiscent of THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS, it is a curious stew of wonderful sounds and deep messages.<BR>This album not only makes you think, it makes you feel.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I don't care if it was \\"enigmatic\\", \\"complex\\" and so on. This movie simply did not make sense. Sure i have to \\"look further into it\\" and I need to \\"try and understand the key aspects\\" but... it made me mad. When i watch a movie i don't wanna sit there and try and think about what the heck this is supposed to be about. I did not understand it at all, and it bored me to death for another part. Anyone that likes david lynch are the people out there trying to be noncomformists and all that other hibble jibble. Non-comformists are just like everyone else. People that try and be different, when everyone in the whole world is doing the same thing And when someone is like \\"i like david lynch because hes great and profound\\" they're really saying \\"i like david lynch because i wanna be different and confuse people with my big words\\" a david lynch movie is like putting these letters \\"alfajfdlkajf;af\\" and then having someone try and explain what i was trying to mean...
B00006WUWP|4.0|I couldn't resist renting this as double feature with the underrated Bond film, \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service,\\" especially with the delicious Blofeld/Dr. Evil connection.  With fifteen minutes left 'til closing time, I dutifully trotted down to my local video shack, and picked this up in DVD form and hunkered down for a late-night campfest.  The opening had me howling, and plenty of other good jokes held my attention thoughout.  Mike Myers isn't just a great gag man, he also is one of the most inventive filmmakers around today, in terms of seeing the potential use of the medium for fantastical and playful disruptions of \\"normal\\" perception.  He just has a great sense for the unexpected, and a delightful ability to balance it with the painfully obvious.  Still... Has Dr. Evil really gone all soft and squishy on us?  Only \\"Austin Powers IV: Mooncroaker\\" will tell!
B00004VWA7|5.0|This album is an essential for any bassist who aspires to excel on their instrument.  Jaco was and still is the GREATEST bass player of all time.  This album is perfect and timeless.
0788816454|1.0|This has got to be the worst adam sandler movie ever made. His accent, his mother, the whole thing, it just plain ... I'm a huge Sandler fan, but if you are looking for a laugh, watch the wedding singer or big daddy. Use this movie as a balance for a coffee table or something.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Forget about all of the other Metropolis DVDs out there, this is the Kino restoration that ran in the theaters in 2002. While it is still not in the original 1927 edit, this is the most complete version known to exist. Title cards are used to describe the still-missing scenes, but many scenes have been added by Kino for this edition.<br />This is also much longer than the much sought after Laserdisc.<br />A highly recomended Silent Classic Science Fiction story of a two class world. The underground workers who keep the city running, and the above groung businessmen who live off of the undergrounders work. Trouble errupts when litigation between the two breaks down and a mediator is suspected of being a spy.<br />This 1927 movie seems like todays current headlines.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The first time a friend brought me this Norah Jones's CD, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, I was absolutly thrilled; and I immediatly run to a shop the next day, to buy it.After listen to it again calmly at home, I've loved it. It's totally original, the timbre of her voice is a kind of unique and very pleasant, the sound in general is very calm, smooth, delightful. The accoustic sound, I so much love, predominates. One can notice several influences, from jazz, to country, to Carole King, but Norah jones's sound is very much her own. Two days ago, I saw on Tv a concert of her in a small theatre in Los Angeles, and I was even more enthusiatic about her. Her posture on stage is of a great simplicity, of humbleness, really lovely, and I was thrilled to see how young she  is. I predict ( and wish) her a great future in music and look forward for her next CDs.
0066214122|2.0|The concept for this book, especially in the hands of Crichton has huge potential.  Unfortunately, it falls short of the very bar that Crichton, himself, set.  The novel is obviously very well researched and there is an extensive bibliography at the end.  I only wish Crichton had spent similar effort on the plot and the characters.  The plot is fairly linear and predictable and the characters are mostly shallow and stilted.  This is one of those rare cases where I wish the editor had indulged the author a bit more to allow him to render a richer environment and a deeper plot.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This last Diana Krall's Cd, Live in Paris, is, together with her two first albums &quot;Stepping Out&quot; and &quot;Only trust Your Heart&quot;, her best. I saw her last concert in Oporto, Portugal (September 2002), just a month before this Live Album in Paris was released and I was absolutly overwhelmed by the astonishing change operated in her. I had seen her live, also in Oporto, portugal, five years before (in 1997) and I had been quite dissapointed with her performance : extremely cool with the public, there was absolutly no interaction with the audience, and her piano (and piano solos) could be hardly  heard. This time , the change was amazing: not only, in jazzistic terms, she had return to her debut style (the one of her two- and best- first albums), performing strong and very good piano solos, bet she was also much more at ease, more warm, more talkative.I had also the pleasure to meet and greet her personally, as the Public Relations Manager of the hotel she stayed in. I'm loking forward for her next album.

1565847032|5.0|A very insightful read, which puts one's current views in question. An important piece of literature, which should be scrutinized by the masses. A book for those who are interested about USA's foreign policies, and how it affects the world.
B00005JKNF|1.0|I'm not about to cower in awe of what so-called &quot;critics think.  As quite an eclectic connosieur of film I found this one lacking in most everything except cinematography.  But even that doesn't save this film which literally put me to sleep.  My only motivation for staying awake was the gnawing belief that surely  at some point a plot would finally emerge to justify enduring the lack thereof heretofore.  But it finally dawned on me as the credits rolled that I had been had.  What I don't understand is why the critics or Alton think that sitting through hours of watching people, one would barely tolerate in real life, chat about nothing for 2 hours constitutes an important film or even entertainment for that matter.  And I happen to like good English film. But if I am to give up 2 hours of my life, I just think there should be a point.
B00005JL2O|1.0|The first two Austin Powers movies were great; the third BOMBS.  Mike Myers should stop now...
B0000787FH|5.0|The mix sounds a little different for this edition -- which is something I haven't quite made up my mind about just yet -- but the real find here are the rare tracks found on the bonus disc, which range from brilliant (an early, more vemonous take of \\"You Little Fool\\"; a completely altered \\"Little Savage\\"), to weird-but-enlightening (\\"The Land of Give and Take\\"; rough, early run-throughs of \\"Man Out of Time\\").  All things considered, this is essential listening for the Costellophile and a great way to kill a few hours.  Or years.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica is still one of the heaviest bands on the planet today and 1988's \\"....And Justice For All\\" is proof positive that even when they brach out in stunning new directions and experiment with longer compositions, they lose none of thier power. many have complained about the sound quality on this particular LP and that, to me, is a silly quibble. While Jason Newsted is indeed inaudible on these tracks, that one flaw doesn't detract from the pulverizing attack of Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett(who sounds downright superhuman on every solo) and James Hetfield. The sprawling effect of tracks like \\"Blackened\\", \\"One\\" and \\"To Live Is To Die\\" is matched only by the poetic anger and unmitigated rage of the lyrics and Hetfield's barking delivery. Sonically, \\"One\\" is a precursor to the more streamlined approach they've taken to lately with it's gentle melodies and layered acoustic guitars. On \\"....Justice\\", Metallica grow from being a great metal band into a great BAND period.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool's 5th release is an amazing addition to the rest.  Songs like &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;The Patient&quot;, and &quot;Parabola&quot; really get your blood flowing.  Not only is this album amazing, but it is SMART.  Although some may consider it just to be &quot;math rock&quot;, others consider it to be pure genious.  And they are absolutly right.  Maynard breaks the barriers of his past vocal abilities to give you a new, clean, fresh cut sound that will pierce your ears.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Gosh, this music is so personal, so beautiful, so upfront, it's unreal. You won't find a more honest album than this anywhere. George confronts his impending death with an easy smile on his face, with utter strenght of mind, with complete mirth and joy, with melodies  so incredibly beautiful and soothing, I'm speechless. Anybody with a spiritual bend should listen to this album, and you will surely learn something ... George, once I'm dead and gone I hope I'll meet you somewhere - I'll be the wiser for it! Thanks in advance.<BR> <BR>On a technical note, I've never heard more accomplished slide guitar playing than here. Every single note is right on spot, tasteful to the extreme. Just listen to the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\", which seems to take you to the high heavens. Another favourite of mine is \\"Pisces Fish\\", a song of majestic sentimentality, heavy and uplifting at the same time. The ukelele-based \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" is pure fun and shows George in his most relaxed, \\"Zen\\" kind of mood, a true. light-hearted gem. You can almost see George fiendishly grinning through the recording ... I could go on, but I don't care ... Thanks, George. See you sometime soon ... Hare Krishna, Hare Rama.

B00006YXEK|5.0|The final album from George Harrison is the best and most emotionally/spiritually inspirational album of his career if you ask me. Rising Sun, Stuck Inside A Cloud, and Pisces Fish are among the most touching songs he's ever done. I can't say enough good things about this album. However, I agree with the person who recommends not buying the Limited Edition. The short DVD is not worth it.
B00006JSS8|5.0|I had a dream last night in which I was trying to explain to Stevie Wonder what a genius I think he is.  Words can only fail in trying to express appreciation for some of these beautiful songs he has written that reach eternity. Really, what can people who appreciate his music do to express their appreciation that could ever make any difference to him?  I think he so enjoyed creating and performing his music that that was simply enough for him.  Thanks, Mr. Wonder, for your gift of song that made me happy throughout my life.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Following a decade after the enormously successful and critically acclaimed \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" \\"Hannibal\\" was a sequel that I (and many others) had questioned the quality of. After all, most sequels that come along this late are usually pointless and can't capture the magic of their predecessor or just flat out stink. \\"Hannibal,\\" though surely a different film, does not stick to routine sequel formula. This film stands by itself. Anthony Hopkins returns to his role as Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter and Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as FBI Agent Clarice Starling. Both actors do superb jobs, especially Julianne Moore (who I have always liked) who had a lot to live up to. Clarice, having just been accused of botching a drug-bust, is temporarily stripped of her duties as an FBI agent and is put to the task of revisiting an old-case of hers: Hannibal Lecter. She is given the job of tracking him down, and after receiving a letter from \\"H,\\" she slowly, but surely, pinpoints his location: Florence, Italy. Problems arise as another detective in Florence is on Hannibal Lecter's trail after receiving word of a large award granted by one of Hannibal's victims, who wants nothing more to see \\"H\\" suffer and who will pay any price. The movie relies on a lot of gore. Gallons more than \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" did. Exposed brains, exposed intestines, exposed skulls, it's all here and it's about as nasty as it's R-rating will allow it to be. But still, the movie maintains it's dignity, despite being an all-out gorefest. The movie is both beautiful and terrifying. Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) did an excellent job directing. Like the title says, he does a superb job of balancing style with substance. Purists will hate it because it is a lot different from \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and even \\"Manhunter.\\" But, really, the movie is it's own movie, and if you keep that in mind, you too will enjoy it.
B00006ALGL|5.0|absolutely one of the best CDs in 2002...live set on kcrw-los angeles was unbelievable...purchased this cd from his own website (damienrice.com or townsend records.com in the united kingdom since that is the only way you can get it asap)...<br />a today's cross between david grey/dave matthews/ryan adams...the next irish import...<br />great interpretation and emotion...if you are a true music buff, get this before he becomes a household name...<br />good luck, damien...
B00005QIPH|5.0|Ok, it's not the most dramatic thing you'll ever hear, but it's constantly changing, upbeat, and original.  Personally, I'm influenced by reviews and this one was recommended to me-so now I'm telling you-BUY IT!-you will not be sorry!  And one review said it had &quot;obvious hook-iness;&quot; what do you want??? Other albums get criticized for a lack of hooks.  This is one awesome cd.
B00005MAM2|5.0|The first thing anyone who has seen this movie before will notice is it has been re-dubbed.  Most people say that it is not as good as the original...however, pronounciation of the charachters names is more accurate as well as the fact that there was a more direct translation of lines.  Also if anime holds any importance to you as an enthusiast, you would be watching it in the (audibly) unchanged subtitled version.  Picture is clearer, sound is refined and every aspect has been remastered.  Once the best Anime movie always the best.
0151008116|2.0|I bought this book because it was nominated for the Booker Prize.  Frankly, after reading it I was surprised the Booker committee had picked Mr. Martel as the 2002 winner.  The book starts out fine -- Pi is an engaging character with an interesting life in Pondicherry. However, half way through the novel, Mr. Martel kills off Pi's family in a shipwreck and then it becomes a gruesome tale of survival at sea with detail descriptions of evisceration.    <br />I really don't understand how some your readers described the second half of the book as an &quot;incredible&quot; journey. It was a bloody, horrible story.  And why does the inside sleeve of the say it's such a &quot;wondrous storytelling that it may make you believe in God.&quot;  Give me a break!
B00006CXSS|5.0|If I had to pick one word to describe this film it would be \\"captivating\\".  Once you start watching you can't stop. I wanted to be one of the first to own this amazing film.<BR>The DVD collection comes with behind the scenes action and interviews with some of the brave men that still live on today from Easy Company.<BR>If you don't already own it, buy it!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD will make you melt.  I was completely captivated with every song.  His voice is so sensual/sexy, his lyrics are so magnificent & romantic, & the music is unique & sensual soft rock.  This CD is complete ear candy & so smooth & sweet.  I absolutely love JM.  The lyrics in \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" are so reverie & enough to make a woman melt into a \\"castle in the sky\\".  I don't think a man could ever again write such beautiful lyrics.  Furthermore, every other song on this CD is just as enchanting.  I absolutely love this CD & I can't wait until his next masterpiece.  What a charming young man.
0316666343|3.0|Opinions seem to vary on this book - all the way from one star to five.  I'm in the middle.  The Lovely Bones held my attention long enough for me to finish it.  The writing, in places is weak, but then the person telling the story is a 14 year old and the text reads like a 14 year old might speak.  I thought the viewpoint (that of a young girl in heaven) of the main character was different and interesting.  Descriptions of heaven were not too clear nor appealing, but how many readers know what heaven is really like?  I was confused by the mother's reaction to everything, but admired the father.  The little brother, Buckley, is likable, the sister, Lindsey, is not. The likability of this book - more than most - seems to depend on the reader's taste.
0441009425|2.0|Perhaps the cover text about &quot;Best Sci-Fi of the Year&quot; raised my expectations too high, but I was disappointed in this book.  Although it has some interesting devices and some reasonably plausible science, the characters and their interaction with each other and their world simply wasn't compelling.  There's no real hero; maybe an anti-hero.  In addition, the &quot;epic&quot; plot line taking place over centuries merely serves to confuse and to rip you from one locale you're just starting to be interested in to the next, 50 -100 years later.  As a measuring stick, I'd give Peter Hamilton's Night's Dawn (The Reality Dysfunction) series five stars.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is just powerful, high energy rock that hybrids not so much the style, but the ingenuity of two of the top rock bands of the 90s.  Cornell can sing and scream like a demon and the music is nearly flawless.<br />Definitely worth buying if you like rock at all.
0060930187|4.0|The Bell Jar, written by Sylvia Plath, takes the reader on a very in depth and personal trip through depression.  The book is written through the eyes of Esther Greenwood, the priveledged college student struggling to find reality and her true self throughout the book.  While she should be having the time of her life, Esther sinks deeper into the depths of severe depression.  She loses most of her sense of reality, which distorts her mind and eventually even her vision.  What Plath leads the reader to believe is that Esther is brought to depression due to her lack of relationships with others.  Esther seems to make minimal effort to form any kind of relationships,  which leads her into isolation from the world and her life.  Although she does form friendships with some characters throughout the book, in her mind she still cannot relate to them.  <br />This book was very appropriately named, because when Esther reaches her deepest points of depression, it is as if a bell jar has come down over her, which isolates her from the world.  Her mind and vision become so distorted that it is like she is looking through its glass and living her life from underneath it.  What is interesting and unique about this book is that it is written through the eyes of Esther.   Sylvia Plath is able to take the reader through all stages of extreme depression in some intense and disturbing detail.  She must have experienced some form of depression in her life to be able to describe depression so accurately from the viewpoint of Esther.<br />The Bell Jar is an incredibly creative, yet disturbing book with an intirely new aspect for the reader.
B00003CX5P|5.0|-MOVIE-<BR>Now, call me crazy but I liked it.  Sure, Jar-Jar gets on your nerves, and the acting isn't exactly the cream of the crop, but its Star Wars and in the end it does live up to its name.  Episode I had to be made to tell the story and to set the stage for the subsequent episodes.  The effects were (and still are) out of this world.  Lucas poured his heart into this, and it turned out to be stunning.  The Podrace scene is the big adrenaline pusher, and the lightsaber duel at the end is just plain cool.  We waited for this DVD, and we weren't dissapointed.  The movie looks fantastic.<br /> -SPECIAL FEATURES-<BR>The Deleted scenes were really a joy to watch, and the little featurettes before them make it all the more better.  There are various \\"Making-of\\" documentaries, as well as the Web documentaries, but the one thing NOT to miss is \\"The Beginning.\\"  It's an hour-long documentary that covers the entire scope of the making of Episode I.  Even if you thought the movie stunk, this documentary is a joy to watch.  I even enjoyed the Audio Commentary.<br />Overall, it was an OK movie, and a great DVD.
0066214122|3.0|I will admit first off that I did read this novel in the course of an evening, i.e. I was &quot;riveted,&quot; so at least in that respect, the novel served its purpose.  But, Crichton is Crichton is Crichton, and I'm getting rather bored of seeing characters in his novels being flown off to remote locations via helicopter.<br />There was one thing that was nagging me through the whole novel, and ironically (I suppose), it was what drew me to &quot;Prey&quot; in the first place: this is Crichton's first novel written in the first-person.  I was kind of &quot;giddy&quot; to see him try something new.  And he gets away with it except for the fact that he is also writing &quot;Prey&quot; in the PAST tense, and therefore, we know from page one that the narrator has already survived the events of the novel.  So, for a writer of suspense and of scientific-thrillers, Crichton sort of defeats the purpose of his own genre.  <br />What &quot;riveted&quot; me were the descriptions of the science, nanotechnology (again, very Crichton, very well done), and the story, well...knowing the narrator is alive and well, you can kind of figure everything out as you go along.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I wasn't a fan of Christina's first bubblegum pop cd, but I think Stripped is wonderful. Christina has a great voice and her talent comes in mixing styles and writing her own lyrics. I loved her soulful songs along with her more flirty fastpaced songs. She sends a great message of female empowerment and living life to the fullest. I think Dirrty is a good song but NOT a good representation of what the cd actually contains, which is strong heartfelt songs.      Overall I think this is a great CD which is really a coming out for Christina considering the amount of control she had over it and her ability to contribute to the writing of the songs.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Im thinking about making a movie called '9-11', featuring prominent British actors, where canary wharf tower and MI6 HQ are destroyed by hijacked airliners. Is that going to be okay with everyone this side of the Atlantic? Good, just checking.
B00006IU73|4.0|I've listened to this four times so far, and each time it grows a little more on me.  This is my first PT CD.  After the disappointing (to me) Spock's Beard release of \\"Snow\\" I decided to give the prog music a rest for a while  Then I stumbled on this, and was impressed by the reviews, and decided to give it a shot.  <br />It just keeps getting better.  The lyrics are sometimes hard to understand, which hurts the CD a little, because there are some really nifty lines.  The music goes down a variety of paths, sometimes heavy and modern, sometimes light and retro.  Most of the music is done with a deft touch, only occasionally is it overbearing or artsy for art's sake.  One thing that impresses me is how the whole album is good; this is a CD you can listen to all the way through and not get bored with.  In another few weeks, it may be a five-star review for me!
B00005JKZ3|4.0|-MOVIE-<BR>Well, Men in Black was a great movie and I had high ambitions for the sequel.  In my opinion, it falls short of its predecessor.  Some of the jokes just seem to be recycled, and the whole story (while entertaining) was just lacking a little something.  MIB II does have its funny moments, and witty remarks.  As with the original MIB, the special effects really blew everyone away.  I wasn't sure that they would be able to keep up with the industry this time, but it seems that they pulled some new tricks and the visual effects look great.  As always, it looks superb in DVD format.<br /> -SPECIAL FEATURES-<BR>Well, basically it's take-it-or-leave-it, folks.  If you didn't like the movie then there's not much hope that you'll even care about the special features, but I thought they were interesting enough.  My one suggestion is to see the Blooper Reel.  Who doesn't like blooper reels?  There are also the basic \\"Making-of\\" featurettes that are nice to watch and even insightful at times, as well as an Audio Commentary with the director.<br />Overall, the movie was pretty good, and the DVD features are nice in addition.

B00005U1YO|5.0|I love the first two albums, but this one is the best.  All the songs are great for dancing, tripping, cleaning or whatever you do to this kind of music.  And the last song &quot;The Test&quot; with Richard Ashcroft is amazing and otherworldly.  It's the best song they've ever done.  Period.
B000024A70|5.0|Queen's Greatest Hits I is arguably the best Greatest Hits compilation ever released by any band. On the 17 tracks contained here, many are considered to the greatest pieces of pop music ever written. Kicking off with the official Song of the Millennium, 'Bohemian Rhapsody', Queen's first six of years worth of singles is immaculately collected here. Includes other classics like 'Another One Bites The Dust', 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love', 'We Will Rock You' and 'We Are The Champions'. This CD is absolutely essential for any collection anywhere. It is also a very good introduction to the phenomenom that was Queen.
0316666343|4.0|Though not a masterpiece this book was very interesting.  It deals with horrible traumas in a touching and gentle way.
B00006CXSS|5.0|i just watched yesterday the last of the dvd's (part nine and ten) and i must say it really touched me. i hadn't expect so much realism and brutality for a non-cinema war series. the acting is outstanding, the story is great and the characters are truly intense. the sound is great and can in my opinion really be compared with the outstanding *saving privat ryan* soundtrack.<BR>for me as german it was especially interesting to hear so much *german speaking* in the original english version. one of the most emotional scenes to me, were when the german officer was about to handle his 9mm luger to captain winters and winters said, they are allowed to keep their guns. it was one of this very special moments when yesterdays enemys stay eye to eye and probably could have been good friends under different circumstances.<BR>for everyone who is interested in world war 2 and especially in the normandie invasion and the following year, this series is highly recommended.
B000062Y98|1.0|Let me start this review with the following qualifier.<BR>I am not a rabid fan of this band. I have thought the three<BR>previous albulms to be excellent, but I don't give this<BR>release the same amount of praise. There is way to much orchestration and 'noise' going on for my taste.<BR>The musicianship is as good as you could possibly ask for,<BR>but I don't think the songwriting keeps up.<BR>Yes it is a departure in some ways for them, but not a step<BR>forward I am dissapointed to say.<BR>Not in the same category as Nightfall on Middle earth.
1587990717|4.0|Interestingly many of the reviews are biased against the book. The concepts are contrversial, yet intuitive, although most people will fail to grasp the essence of the book which is to draw attention to the fact that we humans too readily ascribe our fortunes to skill, and misfortunes to random events. The book is well written, and will easily be reread since there are many insights that can be referred to repeatedly. Taleb's writing style is, at times, difficult to comprehend, however is well worth the investment. I found the book most enlightening.
0060916540|4.0|&quot;In seconds my whole outlook changed.  The weary frightened hours of night were forgotten...I could do something positive.  I could crawl and climb and keep on doing so until I had escaped from this grave...helplessness had been my worst enemy.  Now I had a plan.  The change in me was astonishing.  I felt invigorated full of energy and optimism.  I could see possible dangers, very real risks that could destroy my hopes, but somehow I knew I could overcome them.&quot; (p113)  TOUCHING THE VOID is an inspiring book to me.  In it Mr. Joe Simpson writes of his tramatic experience that brings him beyond his physical abilities to rely on a spiritual connection.  As he courageously descends a mountain in the Peruvian Andes with a broken leg, his iron will propels him to survive while literally crawling across snow, ice, and rocks.  I am deeply indebted to Mr Simpson that he recorded his thoughts, feelings and the tools that assisted his survival.  I feel that I have learned how to better address challenges in my own life.  Mr Simpson identifies three tools: a &quot;voice&quot;, a watch, and patterns.  He writes that, &quot;the 'voice' and the watch, urged me into motion whenver the heat from the glacier halted me in a drowsy exhausted daze.&quot;  The battered climber would use his watch to pace himself and also to ground himself when he would become distracted by the pain, confusion, and dehydration.  A consistent 'voice' would dispasionately drive him forward saying, &quot;Get moving ... don't lie ... stop dozing ... move!&quot;  But it is Mr Simpson's use of patterns that is most enlightening, &quot;a pattern of movements developed after my initial wobbly hops and I meticulously repeated the pattern.  Each pattern made up one step across the slope and I began to feel detached from everything I thought of nothing but the patterns.&quot; (p68).  I have applied the principle of patterns to my own challenges.  It has been successful for me because it helps me to focusmy energy.  This diary from Mr Simpson has inspired me and provided me with tools that help me to maintain my spiritual connection.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting the opportunity to buy this set in stores.   Everytime I am in Best Buy I look to see if it is there.  I have thought about getting the Friends set, but that show just doesn't pack quite the same punch as Seinfeld, and so I have been holding off, waiting for what I really want.  I absolutely LOVE this Seinfeld...It is a classic show of our time.  So many cultural references and our own american quirks are touched upon that being on DVD would almost be like an encyclopedia for life.  I hear and see references to this great show all the time...and it's like \\"oh yeah, that's the one where...\\" and everyone instantly knows what you're talking about.  Unfortunately for me I don't believe that I have seen all the episodes, and I am dying to do so, in order of release, so I can truly understand the full character development of these brilliantly crafted individuals.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is sooo bad, can you say titanic 2, I,m suprissed that rose dawson didn't come back on screen and tell of a love she had while she was a nurse in Pearl Harbor(tear.) the really wanted to have the succss of Titanic but it flopped with the critics and movie goers. It is now obvious that they had way too many of the P.H. DVD's made because they try to resell in in new packaging. whats next Pearl Harbor the waist of time Edition  with 2876 hours of bonus footage. Stay away from this Hollywood version of pearl harbor. plus faith hill's song is trying to be a total rip off of the Titanic song.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is an excellent book that serves as a wonderful introduction to managing your money. I highly recommend this to younger people (16 to twenty-something) who aren't really sure what they want to do with their life. <BR>Most people decide to be an accountant or a dentist or a teacher or whatever (i.e. - they focus on a _ job _). If, after reading this book, they decide to become financially independent - they would then be able to focus on whether they want to travel, spend time with friends and/or change the world etc.<br />This book helps people see new possibilities, and would make an excellent gift. To see what the book covers you can visit my site, found through the 'more about me' link, where I have some detailed summaries of it.
0345442989|5.0|I was walking past one of the many bookstores in the very nice town of Deventer one day, when suddenly the store's owner came out, and practically dragged me into his shop, saying: \\"I just got some of those Star Wars pockets you read so much, wanna see them?\\"<BR>Although I was rather baffled, I did concur, I DO read SW novels a lot, and I DID wanted to see the new ones he had.<BR>Under a minute later I had bought \\"Star Wars: Cloak of Deception\\". So far, I have no cause for regretting the purchase, quite on the contrary in fact.<br />Cloak of Deception is one of the best Star Wars novels I've ever read. The characters were very well developed, all events and actions seemed logical, the plot was virtually airtight and the author managed to give the readers a very nicely balanced mix of both action and plot.<BR>One of the things I liked most about this book though, was the fact that it picks up a lot of the threads left by Episode I. As some other reviewers already mentioned, The Phantom Menace failed to make sence at all times, giving the impression that there were a lot of things going on behind the scenes, but which remained completely hidden to the viewers. <BR>Read this novel, and you will find out what all those things were. It awnsers all kinds of questions left by episode I, such as: Why are the outlying starsystems being taxed? How and why did the Trade Federation and the Sith team up to blockade Naboo? Where did the Federation get its droid army? What were the \\"false accusations of corruption\\" which cost Valorum his career? <BR>Read this book and find out.<br />The only downside I could find to this book was the fact that at some times, things tended to get somewhat dull, mostly because the author sometimes tended to work out people's motivations or the significance to some situations a bit TO far. Hardcore action lovers are therefore the only people who just might not like this novel. <BR>For the rest, this book is pure SW greatness, up there with Shadows ofthe Empire and the Thrawn trilogy, easy.<br />Many thanks to the owner of a certain bookstore in Deventer, Holland, for getting me to buy this!
B00006AG5N|5.0|This new Cd from Elvis Presley proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that his music will be timeless. Ok, so `I want you, I need you  I love you` shoudl have been on it, as well as `Little Sister`, with `Wooden heart` and ^Shes not you` the ones that could have been left out,  but the magnificience of his singing, whether in the real hard rockers (^Jailhouse Rock`, `Hard Headed Woman`, `Hound Dog` and `Big Hunk of Love`), ballads of the old, and new variety ( `Dont`, `The Wonder of you`, `Cant help falling in love`, nd `Suspicious Minds` ), Gospel ( `Crying in the Chapel^), Country and Western ( `A fool such as I`), R&B (`One Night` and yes,  `Heartbreak Hotel`),  neapolitan pop (`Its now or never` and `Surrender`), as well as treatment of message songs ( `In the guetto`),  or just the straight mid tempo rockers ( `All shook up`, `Dont be cruel`,  `Return to sender`, `Burning Love, and Way Down), shows all the way through. The re-mastering, incidentally is practically flawless. These songs sound as new today, as some of them did, as early as  45 years ago.  And the bonus song, a recent # 1 in England and throughout the world,  is a real gem, too. Buy it, and youll find yourself listening to it, over and over, to no end.
B000021XR5|5.0|Stone Temple Pilots' No. 4 begins with a great reintroduction on the already classic-sounding Down, where Scott gets back to the old voice singing \\"Pleased to meet you, nice to know me.\\"  This album, like each successive STP album that comes out, was my favorite when it came out (now that honor is held by Shangri La).  \\"Heaven and HotRods\\" may be one of Weiland's best lyrically, and I get goosebumps with the \\"coming down\\" bridge.  This song alone is worth getting the album.  You want to hear Scott standing right in the face of his addiction, listen to these lyrics a few times (You can get it if you really want it/ but you'd better off just leave it alone)  If you're reading this review, I'm sure you've heard Sour Girl, which I fell in love with the first time I heard it.  Some say it sounds Beatlesy, but I think it's more Beach Boys inspired.  Glide is a terrific track.  No Way Out and Sex & Violence are two songs that anyone familiar with STP will enjoy.  These are sure to be in set lists for years to come.  Any Nirvana fan would appreciate Weiland again addressing addiction on the eery \\"I Got You.\\"  (as my mind begins to wander to the spoon).  MC5 is a very cool track, although probably one of STP's shortest songs.  When I heard the album the first time through I finally got to Atlanta and thought maybe my player had skipped cd's to the Doors.  The Morrison-like vocals are a tribute from Weiland to one of his idols and makes for the best track on the album.  If you are at all a fan of the Doors you are probably also an STP fan at heart.  The lyrics are great (as always) and this is right up there with enders \\"Where the River Goes\\" and \\"KitchenWare and Candybars\\" (though nothing tops \\"Twelve Gracious Melodies\\").  These guys know how to make great complete albums.  There's not a song I skip on this, because I want to hear every song.  <BR>I would love to recommend this album to anyone who's never really listened to STP, because you'll become an instant fan.  As great an album as it is, Tiny Music took me a few times to listen to it to really appreciate it, but this album caught me the first time.  The songs are all very catchy and if you're anything like me, you'll find yourself singing along to it a lot (usually trying to do Scott's harmonies with him).<BR>I think this album will be a nice end of the first decade, and is likely to close the book on the hard rocking STP.  They seem prepared to move rock to a new level and do something different. Scott has said \\"somebody's got to save rock'n'roll.\\" For anyone interested in loud, thumping guitars mixed with some more relaxed and melodic music, this album makes a great listen from start to finish.
B00000JMG7|5.0|As a devoted long-time fan of Rory Gallagher, I was delighted at the release of this excellent 2-disc set.  The live performances are particularly notable, as Rory was always at his best when performing live.  The cuts range from classic originals to excellent cover versions of blues standards.  I would highly recommend this set to old and new fans alike.  This is nothing less than an artistic triumph for one of the greatest musicians of all time.
0679745203|1.0|You know, in most books, the author has a certain TONE that comes through in the writing. In this book, the author seems to be saying to himself \\"I shall write random over-the-top poetic things that those HUMANS will interpret as a modern masterpiece and WORSHIP me for! Heheheheh...\\" Seriously, this book is like a mix between David Lynch's \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" Jhonen Vasquez's \\"Happy Noodle Boy\\" strips, and \\"Crossroads\\" (with Britney Spears!). It's really long, really random and really really cheesy.    [update: I now study at a university at which Ondaatje used to teach. I hear from the faculty that in real life he actually IS the self-absorbed prick he comes across as through this book. How satisfying it is to finally know I was right.]
B00003CXZ3|5.0|this movie is a masterpiece.  there are so many layers to it that one viewing is not enough.  a must see for any fan of art or cinema.
B000002LLC|4.0|This album is pure fun and truly an entertaining, playful romp. DO not take this album seriously, otherwise you may be quite disappointed. Here we see Madonna in her Breathless Mahoney character, singing to 1930s style music. From a vamp in \\"He's A Man', a torch singer in \\"Sooner Or Later\\" \\"What Can You Lose\\" and \\"Something To Remember,\\" camp artist \\"I'm Going Banana's\\" or Betty Boop inspired \\"Cry Baby,\\" this album is quite a departure for Madonna. \\"More\\" is like the full blown version of the storyline to Madonna's earlier video,\\"Material Girl.\\"  While Madonna does not have enough vocal versatility to completely pull off these songs, I have to applaud her for trying and having fun with it. I wonder what these songs would have sounded like had they been recorded after her vocal training for Evita? Anyway, the theatrical feel of this album is superb. You can almost imagine this album being a soundtrack to a musical production, though it's too bad that only three are from the movie Dick Tracy. If you're looking for more personal tidbits from Madonna, than you might want to skip this one. However, if you're looking for an album which will put a smile on your face and which may bring out the Broadway wannabee in you, the look no further

Its Chester Thompson on Drums,<BR>Banks doing everything else,with really a &quot;no name&quot;<BR>singer. This is another for the &quot;GENESIS&quot; collection.
B00006RU5B|4.0|It's not a bad album, in fact it's pretty good, but it's no Rage Against the Machine... But that is probably because they are not Rage... Yes, 3 of the band members are but if you change the lead singer it's going to be different.  It would be like Led Zeppelin without Robert Plant... it just wouldn't and will never be the same as Rage. I didnt expect it to be like Rage anyways.. yes there are the basics of Rage still there but the sound and flow is different.<br />    My favorite song of the album is probably \\"Cochise\\" because well it was the first song I heard and it stuck in my head. <BR>\\"Well I've been watchin'<BR>While you've been coughing<BR>I've been drinking life<BR>While you've been nauseous<BR>So I drink to health<BR>While you kill yourself<BR>And I've got just one thing that I can offer<br />Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me<BR>Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me, Ya<br />I'm not a martyr, I'm not a prophet<BR>And I wont preach to you<BR>But here's a caution<BR>You better understand<BR>That I wont hold your hand<BR>But if it helps you man<BR>Then I wont stop it<br />Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me<BR>Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me <BR>Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me <BR>Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me, Ya <br />Drown, if you want<BR>And I'll see you at the bottom<BR>Where you crawl<BR>On my skin<BR>And put the blame on me<BR>So you don't feel a thing <br />Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me<BR>Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me<BR>Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me<BR>Go on and save yourself<BR>Take it out on me, Ya\\"

0743455967|4.0|If you read the negative comments about this book, ignore them for these reasons:<br />1) King never says you have to write 8 pages a day.  He simply states that is what a \\"career\\" writer should aim for.  He didn't start out writing that way (if you pay attention).<br />2) King explains that the sections about his background are there to explain his motivations for writing.  This book is hardly an autobiography.<br />3) King is opinionated about his writing style, yes, but it sure seems to work for him.  Don't be so weak to think you HAVE to follow in every one of his footsteps to write your own successful novel.<br />If you want read this book for any reason other than your personal motivation for writing or to learn a little about King's background, DON'T DO IT.  This is not a book to be judged alongside the merits of his fiction.  King even states that this book is aimed more at the questions he receives at book signings, and one question he NEVER receives.<br />Personally, I really liked the book and took away some good advice that I will consider with my writing.  Give it a shot.

1577311523|1.0|I sensed I was in trouble with this book when I read an endorsement from Deepak Chopra, the Martha Stewart of enlightenment.  In writing this review I have no delusion about changing the minds of any true believers, those seekers of the truth.  There are enough of you to keep this author prosperous for years.  <br />Instead, I am hoping to stop those readers who are earnestly looking for more out of life from wasting their money.  This may be the worst book of its type I have ever read.  It goes nowhere.  It offers no new insight, nor does it take existing ideas and present them in a new, creative way.  One critic refered to his writing as gibberish.  I think that's being kind.  I actually got angry reading this book.  OH!  I was very much in the \\"Now\\" when I had this reaction. <br />You could read this book a hundred times and not find anything useful.  Here is the gist of what I think he's saying.  Don't spend time worrying about things you can't control or change.  It leads to frustration and in extreme cases to serious illness. Take the energy you would spend worrying and apply it towards positive, constructive thoughts and actions in everything you do.  <br />There are so many authors who say it more precisely, more insightfully and more creatively.  Invest your money in them.  <br />Eckhart is a charlatan.  He has figured out one of our modern era's greatest shames; you'll never go broke preying on the needs of others.  Mr. Tolle is to serious insight into life as John Tesh is to serious music.

0802130208|4.0|This book is one of the funniest books that i've read in awhile, and I cant believe how disgusting the main character, Ignatious J Reilly is. You start out the story wondering if this guy is serious,and if he really acts this way, and by the end of it you know that yes, he does act this way, but you love to read about him. I found Ignatious to be one of those characters that you &quot;love to hate&quot;, but I also just loved to read about what stupid thing he would do next, so although he disgusted me, I almost feel that I didnt hate him in the end.In fact at some points in the end of the story, I even felt sorry for him about the way that he was treated. I didn't give this book 5 stars for one reason: Ignatious and his valve. He constantly is talking about his &quot;valve&quot; which I think is one of the most disgusting things that he does, but is still quite funny at the same time. Following around Ignatious through all of his out-spoken encounters in New Orleans is so funny and I really enjoyed this book.
6305265666|5.0|I have probably seen this film at least 10 times.  I may be a tad biased, though, because I LOVE Drew Barrymore.  She is the best actress in the world, as far as I'm concerned.  She does a brilliant job in this movie, and everything about it is just so romantic and touching.  Prince Henry is the most charming prince I've ever seen in any film, and he's easy on the eyes for the women out there. <br />I highly recommend this film to anyone, but especially girls and women across the globe.  It's a &quot;chick flick&quot; but has a wonderful story behind it (Cinderella with strength, wit and ultimate beauty).
B00006V9A0|3.0|This is Nirvana's long awaited &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. Unfortunately, the only new song is &quot;You Know You're Right,&quot; which was also known as &quot;On the Mountain&quot; prior to this release. It is a good song, but not worth the price of the album by itself. Most of the other songs were singles of their respective albums. <br />I have never felt Nirvana lended itself to a &quot;Greatest Hits,&quot; at least one that did not offer something unique. 'Nevermind' and 'In Utero' (especially) are among the best rock albums of all time, and 'Nirvana' is no substitute.
B00005JKCH|5.0|After being married to a comic book-crazy husband for just over 2 years, I had to surrender and admit that \\"Spiderman\\" was a great film.  The story line was impeccable, and so were the special effects.  There was just enough romance to keep the interest of my completely female brain.<br />I was glad to see that the movie kept the moral aspect of \\"Spiderman\\" instead of turning it into a pop culture nightmare like some producers do.  If you are a woman (or not) and are skeptical about watching/buying/renting this movie, I would recommend giving it a chance.  At the very least, it will entertain you for a while.
6304698623|5.0|I saw this movie on TV maybe a year or two after it came out in 1995. I remember enjoying it back then but I had since forgotten much about it. Thankfully, it's now available on DVD from Warner Brothers and it should be your very next movie purchase.<br />If you haven't seen this movie yet order this DVD asap and when you watch it take the phone off the hook to make sure there are no interruptions, then gather the whole family around the TV and enjoy a truly family movie masterpiece. However, this is not a kids movie, there are many mature themes presented, in a gentle way though. And there is a scary monster briefly in a fantasy scene. Probably best for kids 8+ (but others will have different opinions on this).<br />At the end of the movie mom will be crying but this is no cause for alarm- these will be very happy tears. Don't be surprised if Dad is holding back tears too.<BR> <BR>The credits at the beginning have the style of being for a children's movie. I was wondering if this was for children only. Then, the opening scene looks like something from a stage play and I thought if this is the way the whole movie looks I wasted my money. But that first scene was a fantasy scene (as you realize later). What happens next is the movie itself starts and within moments stunning beautiful cinematography of a river or lake in India with a huge Buddha head in the water and two children sitting happily on top of it! When a stunning scene like this is early in a film, you know you're watching something special.<br />In brief, the movie is set in 1914 and little girl, Sarah, is sent to a boarding school in New York, New York (after spending all her life in India) when her father must fight for Britain in the First World War. The girl is played by the beautiful and radiant newcomer Liesel Matthews. DVD notes say that thousands of girls were auditioned for the part of Sarah.<br />The whole movie is told from Sarah's point of view and there are very few movies that have true cinematic magic, but this one does. For example, the scene where she parts with her father is one of the most tender and touching moments I've ever seen in all cinema. Several other scenes are spell-bindingly magical too.<br />Sarah becomes friends with most of the other 20 or so girls in the boarding home and soon teaches them how to awaken their sense of imagination, tells them wondrous stories of mythical India, and that \\"all little girls are princesses\\". However, the wicked and stern headmistress, played to perfection by Eleanor Bron, will have none of this imagination stuff from the girls. In fact, they can't even talk during dinner!<br />As scenes unfold, so does the cinematic magic. The music score is also wonderful and is brilliantly effective in the movie climax- which I now consider one of the greatest moments in all movies.<br />The cast is perfect. Several of the girls seen in the movie went on to other movies and TV shows. Although they are seen very briefly, take a close look and you'll see:<br />-Camilla Belle (only 9 years old here). She appeared in Jurassic Park: The Lost World and you've seen her in other movies and TV shows too.  Too bad she's only seen very breifly in this movie.<br />- Kaitlin Cullum (9 years old here too). She played the part of Elizabeth in TV show Grace under Fire (1993) and was Katelyn in Galaxy Quest movie. She was also played the part of Eve Plumb/Jan Brady in TV movie \\"Growing Up Brady\\" (2000). She also won Best Young Actress Under 10 in the Television 1994-1995 17th Young Artists Awards.<br />-Heather DeLoach (as Ermingarde) is the \\"Bee Girl\\" from the Blind Melon music video<br />The DVD is double sided- TV format on one side, wide-screen on the other. You get three theatrical trailers- the one for this movie and two from Secret Garden (1993 and the black & white trailer from the 1949 movie). You also get production notes and brief bios with still pics. <br />The best movie of 1995. Best cinematography as well. It didn't winthese awards in 1995 but it should have. One of my top 10 favorite movies.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I loved this movie.  I really did.  My husband and I first saw it at the movie theater with some friends.  We had to &quot;settle&quot; for &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; because &quot;Harry Potter &amp; The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; was sold out.  Needless to say, I was delighted by this movie and wasn't a bit disappointed that I had to wait to see &quot;Harry.&quot;  <br />My favorite aspect of this movie is &quot;Boo.&quot;  You can't help but love her.  I want a little girl just like her.  She is precious.  And I thought the main idea of having children's laughs worth more than screams was absolutely brilliant.
6304698658|5.0|This one is probably the best one out of all the National Lampoons series.The first one is a classic movie as well,but christmas vacation tops them all in my opinion.Every christmas season I watch this one ,it's funny from the beginning to the end.A surprise visit from Clark's cousin Eddy makes this movie even funnier.I think cousin Eddy made this one a classic,I <BR>mean with out cousin  Eddy it wouldn't be as funny.<BR>This is a must own for every National Lampoon's fan.
B00005JLWL|5.0|Equilibrium has been rightly compared to The Matrix, but whereas The Matrix is mass-market science fiction, Equilibrium is exceptionally rooted in the classic, masterful tales of Orwell, Bradbury and Huxley.  It is brilliant in its dystopian imagery and script.  Characterizations are spot on.  And the patiently told story is bolstered by well-timed suspense and incredible action sequences.  Ultimately, The Matrix is about mind-bending special effects, and those effects in the end can not cement the often shaky script.  In Equilibrium there are relatively few special effects.  Yet the action is visceral and thrilling.  The pulsing gunshots are profuse and hypnotic, enhanced by variable camera moves and speeds.  Imagine a Zen martial arts master, fluid and peaceful in his moves.  Now imagine him with two-semiautomatic pistols and hidden supplies of ammunition--this is a Grammaton cleric.  And that's all I'll say.  The acting is competent and believable.  Christian Bale sells the struggle of his character skillfully.  Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, Sean Bean, Angus McFayden and William Fichtner gracefully lend their usual skill and aplomb to director Wimmer's dystopian universe.  It is unfortunate that this is a limited release, and that very little has been accomplished in the way of marketing.  This movie deserves more, and old school sci-fi fans deserve to see it.
0345409671|2.0|Having read almost the entire series now I can say this is not one that I would ever go back and read again. I found this book very difficult to finish, not because it was hard to follow but just because it was so wordy, and extremely boaring. It took much longer to get through this then I expected it to. I had to force myself to finish this book. I couldn't just skip through it and then read the others and expect to know what was going on. So I eventually finished it. The series as a whole is great, but this book in the series is not one that I would reccommend, or say is the best, I wouldnt even call it the 2nd best. In my opinion it was more like the worst.<BR>        I like the idea of useing Memnoch, and writing a book about him. His actual historical background is really interesting. However had it been done in a different way then it was and had it not been as lengthy and wordy as it was then maybe it could have been better. Anne Rice seems to have this problem. She sometimes gets to discriptive and leaves NOTHING to the imagination. She uses 500 pages to say what some could say in 300 and it still be as effective. I am now reading The Vampire Armand, and it is MUCH BETTER than Memnoch was... I would definatly reccommend TVA....
B00006JKOM|5.0|Although somewhat-overlooked in the band's catalog, 1976's \\"Too Old To Rock 'N' Roll, Too Young To Die\\" has always been one of my very favorite Jethro Tull albums. It was originally conceived as a soundtrack album to a planned stage musical about an aging rocker in his late 50's named Ray Lomas (whose story is told somewhat by the amusing comic strip included inside the album, AND whose face has a passing resemblance to Tull leader Ian Anderson). The stage musical never happened---you'll have to ask Ian Anderson for the reason why---but the album survived, and it's a true rock beauty. Since the songs were originally intended for the theater, Anderson had to take extra care in making these tunes hummable (even the harder-edged stuff), and hummable they most certainly are. While only the cheerful title track of the album was any sort of hit for the group, every single song here is a memorable winner. There are great melodic Tull rockers on display like \\"Quizz Kid,\\" \\"Taxi Grab,\\" \\"Big Dipper,\\" \\"Pied Piper,\\" as well as whimsical songs like \\"Crazed Institution,\\" \\"The Chequered Flag,\\" and the aforementioned title song. And Ian Anderson lays down some beautiful acoustic numbers as well, like \\"Salamander,\\" \\"From A Dead Beat To An Old Greaser,\\" & \\"Bad Eyed And Loveless.\\" Great songs, all of them, and all played to perfection by Anderson, Martin Barre, John Evan, Barriemore Barlow, and their new bassist at the time, the late, great John Glascock. David Palmer's handsome orchestrations to some of the songs is also a plus. And not only has \\"Too Old To Rock 'N' Roll...\\" been remastered for better sound quality, but there are now two terrific bonus tracks included at the end---the outstanding Anderson acoustic showcase \\"A Small Cigar,\\" and the fun \\"Strip Cartoon,\\" both songs guaranteed to make you smile.\\"Too Old To Rock 'N' Roll, Too Young To Die\\" is a great Jethro Tull album, certainly ranking somewhere in the band's Top 10 best. Like Ian Anderson himself says, you're *never* tooold to rock 'n' roll. :-)
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is so good! There's a newly restored 24 second 'Castle Anthrax' section, great commentaries by the Pythons (except dead Graham Chapman), and another disk of extras (I especially love the Lego version of the Knights of the Round Table.) This is a Python fan's dream. Ni!
B00003CX5P|1.0|The chariot race looks fantastic, and Natalie Portman is believable in a fantastic role, but other charactors are unbelievably weak and charmless, and Lucus' plotting doesn't even bother to be consistant with the first three movies.  This is just bad.  And as we all know, the next one doesn't get any better, despite some great leading actors and actresses that don't appear here.
B00006RU5B|3.0|First off there are a few misconceptions about this album that need to be cleared up. One: just because Tom Morello is involved doesn't make this a political band. Two: this album is not Rage Agaisnt The Machine finding a new vocalist, this is Chris Cornell trying to form a new Soundgarden with Rage's leftover parts. If you go into this one with either of those two misconceptions in your head, it's gonna be hard really getting into this disc. On the positive side, Morello, Commerford, & Wilk did a pretty good job of altering their playing style to suit Cornell's vastly different vocal style. It has been said the gap between Cornell and departed Rage vocalist Zack De La Rocha is equal to that between Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Chuck D of Public Enemy. All things considered, they made the transition fairly gracefully. On the other hand, they may have bent too much. Alot of the raw power (especially the prominent bass chords) that made RATM special feels too reined on most of this one. I guess it makes for a better Rock record overall, but if you were a fan of Rage's music, you'll feel more than a little empty. Bottom line, this is not the new RATM, it's closer to a new Soundgarden disc. If that's not okay by you, definitely steer clear. Otherwise, enjoy.
B000003TA4|5.0|My favorite band is Led Zeppelin, my favorite song is \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", and my favorite album is NEVERMIND! This album contains some of the greatest material ever recorded. It is by far Nivana's masterpiece. The realistic angst in Kurt Cobain's words are the deepest and most truthful ever written. 5 stars is not enough to say just how much i love this album! It will without a doubt go down in history with such albums as Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Zeppelin IV, Are You Experienced? and Nevermind The Bollocks. The best songs on Nevermind are: \\"smells like teen <BR>spirit\\", \\"in bloom\\", \\"come as you are\\", \\"lithium\\" and \\"drain you\\". I will continue to crank this masterpiece landmark album forever more!!!!
B00003CXS4|4.0|\\"Snatch\\" is a movie that takes a little patience to get into. The first 15-20 minutes are a bit confusing. There are a lot of characters to introduce, and Ritchie's fitful editing style - reminiscent of music video-style flash - is something the viewer will have to get used to. But once it settles down and we get into the flow of it, it is a very entertaining, even hilarious, movie.<br />Brad Pitt does a superb job and shows once more why he is not only a big star but a fine actor. All the actors in this are excellent. It's a film about confusion, dumb plots, and drastic mistakes made by people who think they're smart when really they are all dumb as lamposts.<br />This movie is made with real flair and an ear for \\"talk.\\" I would suggest watching it with ENGLISH SUBTITLES ON. This is the great innovation of DVD and it makes the picture a bit more coherent. There is a section when Pitt delivers one of his prodigious mumbles that the subtitles simply give up. It is actually totally invented by Pitt. Don't worry if you aren't getting it all the first time you see it. It's really a small tour de force by Ritchie and needs to be seen at least twice to get the full effect..
B000002J03|5.0|Zeppelin's \\"II\\" is simply put, the most influential hard rock album to ever be stocked on shelves.  It fuses blues and straight-up rock to a perfect degree, and includes elements of folk, and even traces of metal in it as well.  This album gets off to an exceptional start with \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" and its infectious riff (the electrifying guitar solo is also one of Page's best, and is worth waiting around for through the dark and imaginative midsection).  \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" is another classic that goes from light to heavy in an instant.  The slide guitar and gong are nice touches.  \\"The Lemon Song\\" is pure blues mayhem with wild solos, Plant sounding annoying (as usual), and a hot bass line.  \\"Thank You\\" is a surprisingly good love song that has some great drum outbreaks, all credit to Bonham.  Next up are \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Living Loving Maid\\"(She's just a woman).  These two tracks go together perfectly, with both of them being medium-paced, blues-based rock tunes.  Heartbreaker contains a superb solo, first unaccompanied, and then played together with two other guitars.  \\"Ramble On\\" showcases John Paul Jones' bass playing expertise, and has some of the greatest lyrics of all of Led Zep's songs (inspired by Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\").  \\"Moby Dick\\" is built upon a fantastic guitar rhythm section, and the monster drum solo by Bonzo is a brutal dose of percussion at its finest.  Finally, the album ends with \\"Bring It On Home\\" to bring the album to a close, and this song features Plant playing an electric harmonica, and Page's explosive riffs shredding through the otherwise peaceful tune, half way in.  All of the songs on \\"II\\" differ from one another, which makes one view this album as more of a compilation than a one-themed release, and this variety accounts for it being considered one of the greatest albums of all time.  It still sounds fresh today, due mostly to unpredictable rhythm changes and top notch recording quality.  If you like rock music, or any of the other genres that branch out of it, you will not be disappointed.  I strongly recommend this album.  <BR>Peace
B00003CXCD|5.0|Responding to the viewer from St. Augustine who thought Peck was far to old for Hepburn.  Lets get the facts straight.  \\"Roman Holiday\\" was released on Jan 1, 1953, having been made in 1952.  Audrey Hepburn was already 23, not 22 when she made this movie. Gregory Peck was 36, not 37.  Yes, thirteen years is quite a difference but nothing compared to what we see in movies today where established leading male actors are cast alongside female leads who are 20-30 years younger.  Peck looks distinguished because of his professional attire, dressy by todays standards.  Women in that time would dress to match and often looked more mature than they really were as a result.  The point of \\"Roman Holiday\\" is that Hepburn has left all the \\"trappings\\" behind when she ducked out on being a princess for a romp around Rome with the dashing Peck.  This explains her simple and more youthful clothes during most of the film.  A leading man of less stature than Peck would have been overshadowed completely by the radiant Hepburn.  This is a great film! Don't miss it! Thanks, CAL
B00003CXXS|1.0|I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I am of the third installment in the Jurassic Park series. Everything about JP3 is so disappointing. This may sound like this is coming from someone who had high hopes for JP3 but actually NO, I had low expectations for it but to my shock & dismay, this movie missed meeting those by a mile. Bloody Hell, I had better expectations with Rocky & Bullwinkle back in 2000 and at least a few of them were met even though that was [...] can fodder.<br />The entire plot is so ridiculous. The thing begins with someone who gets lost on an island after a skydiving accident, one dies, and it all just simply goes downhill after that. Sam Niell who did such a great job on the playing Dr. Alan Grant in the 1993 original Jurassic Park movie, does such a clumsy job on playing the character, almost as if he were forced into the acting studio against his will. I couldn't have thought of a much worse acting crew either. I can't blame him for the hollow character acting. The others fell completely through the trampoline with absolutely absurd character playing, and absolutely pointless plots, no sense of chemistry, and little, if any sense of writing was put into the plot. Where there was chemistry in the characters in the first movie, there is none of that in the same ppl in this third installment, and instead are those that seem to have the brains of a raisin.<br />There are some occasional good moments with the plane crash scene being well filmed and a sense of intensity of them trying to get out in time but overall, even that doesn't put any merits into the film. Neither does the awesome, stunning views of the misty valleys, rainforests, and the mountains, even though they're great too look at. In fact, the landscape felt like the most interesting thing in the movie besides T. Rex.<br />Overall in fact, Jurassic Park III feels more like a scrapped version of the first in the JP trilogy as at least in the Lost World, there was some ground being broken as T. Rex got onto the mainland, but here, it's all confined to the small island of Isle Sorna with the same old, same old, script that felt more like it was taken out of the recycle bin and made into a movie without depth put into it. There is nothing groundbreaking nor anything that got me into a state of excitement or thrills. The ending was just plain laughable with a sense of the lack a climax and unfinished filming. When I left the theatre in bitter disappointment, I felt like I had flushed [$$$], and 90 minutes of my life down the toilet!<br /> I have no idea of what they were thinking when they made this film but what I can say is if it was the same person who write the original one in 1993, Jurassic Park III is his first complete misfire. This addition to the trilogy was a total disappointment. I'm not pleased!d being broken as T.

B00006NSZ5|4.0|basically i enjoyed the album. my favorite songs are mostly the ones from eminem himself. run rabbit is one of the best on the album. its like a 3 minute song of just him rhyming. the next i'd say is 8 mile. about a 6 minute. i feel myself only listening to eminem since he came out. there have been few cd's that i listen to once i here something from eminem. also 50 cents has some good songs on the album also. i used to listen to 50 cents years ago from just buying mixed tapes. now hes signed on shady records. i think its a plus for them. well i just can't wait to here something new from eminem.
6305807086|5.0|How Being John Malkovitch was ever made I'll never understand. It is so bizarre, different, clever and out-there that no production company should have ever approved it. Yet they did, and for that I am ever so grateful.<br />Just the story synopsis sounds so crazy. A puppeteer working on the 7 1/2 floor (originally built for midgets) finds a portal leading to the head of real life actor John Malkovitch, allowing annoying entering it to be Malkovitch for 15 minutes before being spit out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Wow. And the movie is so much more weird then that. The first time I saw it, my mouth was wide open in shock. How did this movie get made? It's so crazy it's wonderful.<br />With such a the head-trip of a story, it's easy to skip over the wonderful performances by the cast. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz look and act positively convincing as a poor, ugly and strange couple in New York. Catherine Keener is superb as a power-hungry, greedy woman who Cusack and Diaz both fall for, and of course Malkovitch as himself is both strange and intoxicating. Is it how he really acts? You never really know. And that's part of the charm of this wonderful film. The line of reality and fiction at times becomes fuzzy. A characteristic that writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze play even more with in their follow-up Adaptation.<br />Of course, all this weirdness means this film isn't for everyone. Some will scoff at it's \\"too cleverness\\" or walk out thoroughly confused. But for those who love the theater of the absurd, this will be pure paradise. One of the most unique and memorable films to come out under the Hollywood radar in a long time. This gets my high recommendation.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This movie is superb. The scary atmosphere created here is excellent. Horror movie directors should learn from this masterpiece. PS. Anchor Bay version is good, but Elite version is better.Recommend highly.
B0000640VO|5.0|Well I think that people that only like watching stupid hollywood movies eating popcorn and drinking coke won't like that one, but for all others, this movie was a total success, and not for no reason! This movie makes you want to smile once you've seen it, you're suddenly happy and you just feel good.. I have no idea why but so it is! It shows you how small things in life can be enough, how people can change your life.. This movie is really great and I recommend it to you... <BR>However, I have no idea how the english movie is, I have it in french.... <BR>Have a nice movie!
B00005LOUQ|4.0|Many purist find it hard to watch this movie because they consider the book and the animated versions the only true versions. I too love the book and the Boris Karloff narrated version. I happen to like all the versions of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; as well, and they are all unique and special in their own way. I look at this movie the same way. Both versions are great. Even people that are not fans of Jim Carrey should enjoy this movie. His portrayal of the Grinch is excellent. The Grinch and his dog and Cindy Lou are so funny and true to character, for you not see they are like what Dr. Seuss would picture them is blindly protesting. The whole family should get at least a chuckle out of this movie. Just like the animated version it will make most people laugh and cry. Ron Howard did such a good job I'm hoping he will remake several others.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This Dvd is clear and crisp with nice menu options. It gives info about the cast of characters. This movie is a stirring tale of a prince who must leave his kingdom after fighting a god turned demon which inflicts a powerful curse which will kill him. Along his way he runs into a monk and eventually ends up in a place called Irontown. Here he meets a wolfgirl named Mononoke.<BR>This is where the story really picks up. If I tell anymore it would be a spoiler for you. But I have to say this is by far one of my all time fav anime's that I own. The story is great, the voices very nicely chosen for the characters and a overall great DVD.
B00005QCVY|5.0|Even though some years it is overly shown on TV I still love this movie and never tire of it. I think what makes it one of my favorites is that it tells much more than a Christmas story. It tells us that no matter what we do, we matter. We touch so many peoples lifes during our lifetime that like a butterfly flitting across a blue sky in Illinois may lead to the wind a Sailing ship needs in the Sea of Japan. Well a little overstated maybe but we do in fact cause ripples in the fabric of our civilization. We all may never impact so many as George Bailey does, but we certainly can make a difference even if it is just one we touch. Anyone no matter what age should enjoy this movie.

B00005JLSC|5.0|It is the 1920s in Chicago and we enter this musical film through a saucy nightclub to see Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) performing a duo act of All that Jazz on her own. Only later is it revealed what happened to her sister who was supposed to be the second half of the act. Next we meet Roxie Hart (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) who is a naive girl with big dreams of stardom who goes to the slammer for killing her lover. From the moment she enters and we see a brief flash of her imagining herself on stage, we are aware that this film is half reality and half Roxie's dream. Ambitious Roxie has to find a way to get herself out of prison and onto the stage. To do this she creates an innocent persona that is designed by her smooth talking lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) for the media to bring the public to her support. With his help and the sassy matron of the women's prison 'Mama' Morton (Queen Larifah) Roxie eclipses Velma Kelly's prison girl fame. Her matronly values and repentant attitude have the public enthralled and the jury in tears. But with her newfound celebrity Roxie's head is sent spinning again with plans of musical fame. However, it becomes increasingly obvious that her popularity will be dreadfully short lived if she doesn`t craft a way to remain in the spotlight. Teetering on the brink of superstar celebrity and death row, Roxie will have to give the performance of her life if she wants to save her neck. Filled with beautifully choreographed catchy musical numbers and a pleasing sweep of fast dramatic action, there is never a dull moment in this film. It's a triumphantly enjoyable thing to watch.<br />The greatest reason for this film's success is due to the stunning ensemble of actors many of whom (with the exception of Queen Larifah) we aren't familiar with hearing sing. The cast all excel in both in their musical numbers and acting performances. Catherine Zeta-Jones looks stunning and is fun in her catty diva role. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is perfect for her part of the innocent, but still determined and quietly vicious, Roxie who will stop at nothing to become a star. Like in the striking film Nurse Betty, Zellweger's character again confuses reality with her dreams and her subtle facial shifts and movement meaningfully represent her psychological conflict. Most surprisingly, Richard Gere delivers a fantastic performance as the slimy lawyer proving that this actor can really do comedy well. Then there are notable performances in minor roles that leave an impact such as Queen Latifah`s sultry money-hungry matron, Christine Baranski as the hilarious news reporter Mary Sunshine, John C Reilly as Roxie's neglected but still loving husband Amos Hart and Lucy Liu as the vicious ball-busting heiress Kitty.<br />Those familiar with the famous stage show of Chicago will not be disappointed because this film maintains its focus on the musical and dance numbers as the centerpiece. In fact, the meaning of Roxie's psychological confusion between reality and fantasy is wonderfully accentuated by the film's ability to quickly cut between the drab, harsh reality and the glamorous, jazzy corners of Roxie's imagination. The director Rob Marshall excellently filmed all the dance numbers to focus on particular moves as well as capture the full action of the performances for the fullest effect. This movie is a fine example of how a musical film can succeed where its pertinent counterpart (as both films focus on a female on death row) Dancer in the Dark failed. The musical numbers all take a vital role in both accentuating plot detail and enjoyably moving the film along. Likewise, the story does not take itself too seriously preferring to revel in the fantastic music and thrilling story rather than focus on any specific moral meaning. That isn't to say that this film isn't emotionally engaging.

I'm driving down Route 21, ripping along, and Queens of the StAge are playing.  \\"Song for the Dead\\" comes on and there's this wicked riff, truly the musical embodiment of an evil grin, at about a minute-ten left.  Chunky, salty, grinding, and I'm really into the pounding sound.  Crash fade.<br />Three seconds later, THEY PLAY IT AGAIN.  The best riff on the song, and they do it again, rip it up, and let you have it.<br />Oh man, that's a band that delivers the goods.<br />See, I'm a sucker for good formulas well executed.  The interstitials of a guy pretending to tune in \\"Queens\\" songs and DJ talk-ups, I dig.  I'm a huge Slayer fan, but \\"Six Shooter\\" is the best death metal song of 2002.  I get it, I really do.<br />Haven't enjoyed something this thoroughly, through all the tracks of an album, since Kilgore released \\"Search for Reason\\".  Sure, there's fourteen distinct tracks on here, and not every one is a balls-out rocker, but each song deserves headphones and some uninterrupted  attention... unless you're driving down Route 21.<br />Then all ya need is track four.  And play it baby, play it.
B000002A73|5.0|My cd broke because I played it too much. That should really be enough said in a review, but its not like me to fake out like that!<br />After the somehow disappointing Radio KAOS(Which is, well, really okay, but not on par with either Pros & Cons or Amused), many years went by, and suddenly Amused to Death appeared. Unlike ANYTHING he has done before, gone is the last of the PF sound that was ever so appearent on Pros & Cons *SNIFF* and here is the new sound. It starts off very comfortably with \\"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard\\", a song I use to listen too every time I am trying to relax. It works. All is well, as there are background chatters and the usual effects who keeps your attention all the time. Great.<BR>Then it starts to be different from before. \\"What god Wants\\" and \\"Perfect Sense\\" is very good if you can forget Waters earlier work, and are interesting to a point. I found my self skipping them after some time, as they became a bit uninteresting. Waters Tossed us a nifty rocker too, \\"Bravery of being out of Range\\", which is pretty cool! Then a lot of pretty okay songs follow in the middle of the album, before it finally picks up to the highlight, the grand finale.<BR>This is it.<BR>It starts with \\"Watching TV\\". Wonderful lyrics, and a really memorable guitarplaying, the melody is so sweet and undescribable. Its strong, said e`nuff!<BR>On to \\"Three Wishes\\", a modern version of \\"Genie in the Lamp\\", the lyrics are really interesting, and the song works perfectly as a bridge from Watching TV to the next song, <BR>\\"It`s a Miracle\\". Its the next best song on the record, the melody is so haunting and beautiful its hard to not press repeat even before listening to whole of it. <BR>But still, just to confirm that we always will love Roger Waters, \\"Amused to Death\\" appears. It is one of his best songs ever, both solowise and PF. A genius song about modern society`s effect on humans, on how we manage to break our self down with our technology, combined with the best lyrics on the records, the most atmospheric and brilliant melody and a good voice, its impossible not to love Amused to Death. I first heard it a dark winter morning on my stereo, with snow falling. The effect of you and \\"Amused to Death\\" playing alone, is to hard to describe.<br />Simply amazing, or should I say the perfect evidence of what music really is. <br />Unfortunately, my original copy was stolen, so I had to buy it again. I bought the gold version, which I still has, but after going to many rounds in the player, and into the hands of curious parents and friends, it became literally (Am)used to Death. Now I have to buy another one, but no matter how many copies or how much I have to spend on Amused to Death, I will always be sure I can listen to it every day.
1570193800|4.0|This version of A Christmas Caril is done by the Cambel playhouse and stars orson Welles as Scrooge.  Being an hour long its abridged but one hardly notices what was left out from the story.  There was one glaring omission however which is quite poignant and which helps to underline the message Dickens was trying to convey when he wrote this classic.  The part I'm speaking of is the appearance of the two deformed children which peer out of the robes of the ghost of Christmas present and are labeled Ignorance and Want.  They should have included that scene in.  Apart from that I enjoyed listening to this broadcast from the golden age of radio.  Welles is a great actor but at times he comes across like a self righteous prig.  Nevertheless he was quite good as Scrooge.  i recommend this recording for those who love radio shows and audio dramas.  At the very least its another wonderful way to enjoy this well loved story.  This audiobook contains 1 CD and is a full cast presentation.
B000002C1V|5.0|A lot of people are discovering Pink Floyd, maybe everyday. It very seldom starts with The Final Cut, maybe due to its rare radioplay, or the fact that its not that known. People tend to look after Wish you were here or the Wall, and overlook this masterpiece. <br />I`ll make it short, as someone else here went deep into the album. This is one fantastic record. <br />The overwhelming melodies and advanced songs from The Wall are gone, left is the raw sound of a songwriters imagination. Waters did well on Final Cut, every song is special and needs to be heard. My favoritesongs are with NO doubt &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, &quot;The Gunner`s dream&quot; and &quot;Two suns in the sunset&quot;. I have always been very weak for good use of Sax in rock, so its no wonder these songs score high. One of the only problems with this record, is that incredibly irritating &quot;bombing and airsounds&quot; that appears sometimes, without a warning. The rest of the record is pretty low, so you have the volume turned up. Suddenly it bursts out in a massive noise which makes everyone who`s listening wonder what this is. I like details like radiochattering and backgroundsounds, but in these cases, it is way to overdone. <BR>Oh well, lets not make one little detail ruin it. <BR>The Final Cut is a underrated, overlooked and forgotten PF record, hitless as it may be, it is almost perfect, and it can easily be compared to Pros &amp; Cons of Hitchiking which I really recommends. <BR>It really was the Final Cut, but sometimes you save the best for last.<br />And I got a feeling this aint the Final Review for the Final Cut..as more and more people discovers the now legendary group, Pink Floyd.
0151006903|4.0|Expect the unexpected from Eco. Playful with words, concepts, and history, Eco will twist your conception of Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa, his court, the third and fourth Crusades, paradise on Earth, religious dogma, relics and their sources, till it becomes difficult to tell the real from the unreal. So much so that when two thirds into the book Eco changes from his variant of history to an out and out Cabellian fantasy, complete with unicorns and other less savory creatures, it comes across as merely another short step in the journey of his accomplished liar and linguist protagonist Baudolino.<br /><br />And what a main character Baudolino is! For every major historical event, from Barbarossa's sieges and compromises with various Italian cities and popes to the discovery and placement of the Three Magi of Cologne, Baudolino is not only there, he is the major instigator.  From the opening of the book, when we meet him as a young boy worming his way into Friedrich's graces with his quick wit and tongue, Baudolino is an engaging rascal, full of himself and his own (justified) ability to turn the course of history with a well crafted falsified parchment here, a poem (as presented as by someone else) there, or a quiet word with the Emperor carefully couched in just the language the Emperor wishes to hear.<br /><br />But this also brings up one of Eco's major themes of this book, on just what is real and true. If people believe in it, does it matter that the relic worshiped as the Holy Grail is actually a common wooden bowl? If the lie will serve a greater good, is it really a lie? If someone, somewhere, declares that something exists, then does it really have an existence? Where is the line between fantasy and reality? Of course, at the same time that Eco is investigating these points, he is also rather savagely satirizing various religious beliefs and demonstrating the hilarity of the life and death dissension of various religious sects over incredibly tiny differences of interpretation of some element of dogma.<br /><br />As usual, Eco is not an easy read. Besides his liberal sprinkling of Latin, German, and other languages throughout the text, the ideas and history he is presenting are not for the faint of heart or one totally ignorant of this period.  Without at least some knowledge of this historical period and Catholic religious dogma, a good portion of what he is saying will be overlooked. A good dictionary should also be a constant companion while reading this, as he often uses some very uncommon words, and sometimes intends some of the lesser known meanings of other more common words.<br /><br />There are some elements that don't totally work here. I felt his inclusion of a locked room murder mystery within the main body of the work was not really necessary from either a plot or character development standpoint, and plot elements that are linked to this could have easily been handled differently. This element almost seemed like it was tacked on as an expected thing for an Eco novel. The long fantasy section seemed to go on much too long, with rather tiresome long lists of the various creatures and their characteristics.  Most of the characters other than Baudolino seem rather two-dimensional, and if they had been given some further rounding, I think Eco's satirical side could have been sharpened. None of these faults are really major, but they do detract somewhat from what is otherwise an outstanding novel.<br /><br />Different, difficult, discerning, and ultimately deserving of an attentive read.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd...ion of some element of dogma.

0517201658|5.0|Colleen McCullough's The Thorn Birds is quite honestly the best book that I have ever read and probably will ever read.  This novel made me feel every emotion possible.  I was clapping, smiling, and jumping up and down whenever Ralph came to Meggie at Matlock Island.  I was crying for the last portion of the book, starting with Dane's death and continuing through Justine, Meggie, and Ralph's reaction.  I was so angry whenever I read of Luke's mistreatment towards Meggie.  I was screaming at Justine to marry Rainer.  I weeped for the Cleary family whenever This is the first novel that I came to know and love the characters, and I did not want to end the story because I did not want to lose touch with the characters and their lives. McCullough did an excellent job with her descriptions and development of plot.  Though many of the other reviews say McCullough is extremely verbose, she writes no unnecessary words.  Every word furthers the plot along of gives us a more vivid description of the characters or their feelings.  By the end of the novel, I felt as if I had lived on Drogheda.  I felt as though I was in love with Ralph de Bricassart.  <BR>  I would recommend The Thorn Birds to anyone.  Young and old will enjoy this read because of it's array of characters and emotions.  Mothers will be able to relate to Fee and Meggie's feelings and anxieties.  Young women will be able to be swept off of their feet by the romance of Meggie and Ralph, and later on, Justine and Rainer.  My recommendation would extend more to a woman than to a man simply because of the romantic nature of the novel.  I, as a young woman, could relate very closely to Meggie.  I also feared Meggie's life as my own; not wanting to ever be in such a state of longing and pain or to be tricked into marrying a man, such as Luke O'Neill, to find myself alone, homesick, and confused of the future.  <BR>  If you would like to read an extraordinary novel which will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotionsand befriend an amazing group of characters, I would suggest reading The Thorn Birds, an emotionally stimulating novel.
B0000640VN|5.0|I don't like writing reviews unless I have something new to bring to the table so here goes:  Cute, dark in my opinion romantic comedy, treat for Meg, Hugh, Liev, Breckin fans but here's what I'd like to say that will hopefully benefit someone:  I saw the sneak preview before the movie came out which was basically the directors cut, pre-market research.  WITHOUT viewing this first, the edited version makes no sense, and is implausible in every way.  At lease with the directors cut, in FANTASYLAND the plot makes sense.  Without that all crucial mysterious relationship, it does not make sense that Stuart would be so desperate to get Kate to take the jump.  His reasons for doing so are the central reason for the plot, the impetus that everything revolves around, and removing that factor is inexplicable to me...for those of you who have remaining questions upon seeing the theatrical version, viewing the Directors cut will fill in pretty much all of the blanks.  I just can't imagine why they chose to omit them later ... take a look at how many previous reviewers here are so baffled by Stuarts panic throughout the movie ....  total mystery to me why they would leave the whole central plot point out of the final cut.. go figure ..great movie anyway (directors cut version 5 stars, theatrical version zero stars ...
B00005JLWL|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this completely unhyped film, I thought \\"Taye Diggs in an action movie?\\"  I had to drive 2 hours to St. Louis to see it, but boy oh boy was it worth it.  Simply put, this is the best action movie I have ever seen.  Christian Bale puts in an amazing performance.  The fight scenes are the greatest of all time.  They aren't done up with special effects like the Matrix, they focus more on physical ability and coordination.  I was blown away.  Bottom line is YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.  It's original and creative, yet not too deep.  It will set a new standard for action in movies.
0140185232|5.0|Being an Indian, and being engaged in my own fashion, in the same quest as Larry Darrel, the book's main protagonist, I found this book, in short, helpful and life-affirming. Highly recommended.<br />As Maugham traverses decades and characters in an insightful, somewhat ironic style, he says what he has to say so effectively that the reader stops noticing the words and descriptions, and starts 'listening' to the story, forming his / her own pictures.<br />When Larry starts to 'loaf', and chooses his life's work as the study of life itself, to find the reasons behind misery and evil, I began the journey with him. All that he goes through, from life as a coal miner to that of a German farmhand, and the experiences of standing in one's clothes, with no belongings at all and as a result, feeling free and unbound, was for me a personal confirmation: Of beliefs deeply held, conclusions formed independently, of the utility and the meaning in following a path that 'everyone' has always said, is destructive. The characters that he meets and connects with on his great journey are sharply etched, and honest in their own respective ways. Even the author plays a part (different from a plain first person narrative) in the unfolding events, and surprisingly, doesn't take away from the book at all!<br />Finally, after Larry has met his Guru, and gone through a discipleship and training where he gets his answers, when he chooses his path for the remainder of his life, the values that come through in his choice: humility, strength of character, and the basic understanding and detachment from worldly (binding, trivial) pleasures, give hope.<br />The Razor's Edge is a single, real, believable account of a life worthwhile. For me personally, having my thoughts and deepest convictions echoed by someone who lived in the West and arrived at the answers through the \\"simple\\" tools of reason, honest living, and an indomitable will to go out in search of the answers, is priceless and immenselyliberating.<br />The description of the basic ideas in Vedanta is excellent. The basic distinction with Western religions: That one doesn't have to take anything on faith but is free to question anything and everything honestly, is well brought out. Life can be experienced vicariously through books, and social conventions, but all real learning only takes place empirically, through DOING.<br />What also comes out is that each individual has to seek and find one's own answers, *earn* one's own answers in fact.Some help comes from 'outside' if one has earned it, or craves it.<br />A remarkable book, one that has increased my respect for Western civilization and thinking manyfold. To anyone who's seeking similar answers about life, I humbly recommend The Razor's Edge as a primer on life and philosophy. Two books that could provide some more incomplete understanding and some answers, and a point of departure, are 'The Tao of Physics' by Fritjof Capra, 'Small is Beautiful', by E M Schumacher. I say incomplete, because ultimately, we have to go out in search of answers ourselves.<br />Like Larry. And that's the value of this book.
B00006CXXU|3.0|This album has a touch of pop, soul/R&B, rock, Latin, jazz, and blues.  Christina says this is the real her, so its good she gets to be herself, but I'm not feeling her as much.<br />The Good:<br />-LYRICS, which all but 2 songs co-written/co-produced by Christina (the other 2 done by Alicia Keys and Linda Perry--she worked with Pink).  Many songs have deep lyrics that relate to the problems (past and present) in her life (breakup with boyfriends, in particular, one who treated her wrong; her mother being abused by her father) and inspiring lyrics about being strong and surviving the pain.  The only 2 \\"non-deep\\" songs are \\"Dirrty\\" (about sweating and partying in the club) and \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" (about casual sex).<br />-GOOD SONGS: \\"DIRRTY,\\" which I hated at first, but it grew on me and compared to the rest of the album, it's one of my favorites; \\"BEAUTIFUL,\\" which is an inspiring song about everyone being beautiful; \\"CAN'T HOLD US DOWN,\\" her comeback song aimed at Eminem and those who call women whores if they have lots of men, but praise men for having lots of women; and \\"INFATUATION,\\" the song she sang at the 2002 Olympics, it's about her mother warning her to beware latin lovers, but Christina is infatuated.<br />The Bad:<br />-Not really any power ballads (like \\"I Turn to You\\").  Most songs are mid-tempos.<br />-I don't think her voice sounds as good on this album as it did on the previous one.  The music also sometimes covers up her voice.<br />-This album is miles away from the 1st one; it might have been better if she would have given us a transition album so we could get used to the new (or real) her.  If you only like cookie-cutter pop (like her first album), don't get this album.  Parents, this isn't really the best album to buy for your younger children (say, ages 5-11).  If you want to see a more grown up Christina, get this album.<br />-If you are a casual Christina fan, get the \\"COMPLETE\\" album instead; it's like a greatest hits with songs from this album and the first album as well as some from the Spanish album, Christmas album, \\"Lady Marmalade,\\" and \\"No Body Wants to Be Lonely\\" (duet w/ Ricky Martin).  I've only found it here on Amazon.com so far.

6304025831|5.0|The trio of director Martin Scorcese and actors Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are back in this fast-paced slam-banger that gets better by the minute and never lets up until the very end. Those who like casino and/or gangster movies will find sheer joy in this film about both. Scorcese has proved himself to be a truly remarkable director and this film shows why. He knows how to handle characters, scenes and even adds in a few of his own tricks. Many have cited this to be a copy of &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; but this isn't true at all. Sure, it has some of the qualities that made &quot;Goodfellas&quot; so cool, but &quot;Casino&quot; is its own movie doing its own thing. Acting: everyone here is excellent. Of course, DeNiro and Pesci are absolutely remarkable, but so is Sharon Stone as DeNiro's wife. While the film runs at about three hours, it feels much shorter due to a fast pace and a relentlessly thorough screenplay. This ranks as one of Martin Scorcese's best films.

0790731231|5.0|After &quot;The Godfather parts 1 and 2&quot; were released, it was hard to believe that Hollywood was ever going to produce a gangster movie that would even equal the quality of those two Hollywood gems. Enter director Martin Scorcese and actors Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta. These four made a film that not only expanded on the qualities of the first two &quot;Godfathers,&quot; but also provided different characters and situations not seen in gangster movies of old. Needless to say, it was an instant classic. The four have gone on to become film legends (though DeNiro was already there) and the film is a cherished gem in Hollywood that is still not even 20 years old. Many people cite this film as Scorcese's best, although &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; was a bit more poignant. But no one denies that this is an excellent film with imagination, scope, and a take-no-prisoners attitude. One of the coolest films ever made.
0743455967|3.0|On writing is a version of Steven King himself as a child.  He talks about his mother and her jobs, plus most of the places he lived as a child.  He is a fowl-mouthed writher who gets right to the point.  Although, reading this book might inspire you into writing a novel, don't think it is going to happed in one day.  He describes a toolbox as useful elements in the writing process.  King also describes other writers in their ways of writing, such as H.P. Lovecraft, James Joyce, Harper Lee, and John Grisman to name a few.  <br />Writing is a true dedication in order to write a story you must have your mind set.
020530902X|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone. Even if you only write the occasional e-mail, &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; is a worthwhile companion for the most casual of writers. The book is clear and concise, weighing in at less than a hundred pages. The 4th edition does not stray from the formula of previous editions, but it does add a handy glossary and modernized examples. If you own the third edition, there is no practical reason to go out and purchase the new edition.
6302859204|5.0|This is a story that could make anyone be a believer, that there is other life forms in the Galaxy. It was very well acted by the cast and people behind the scenes did an excellent job. They have made the story seem so real and so true and the most terrifying alien abduction story's in the history of mankind. They have done a great job in making the alien visitors look so real that you couldn't tell the difference if they were really there. Though, the incident in the ship was different from the novel that was written by the real Travis Whalton and Mike Rodgers, but it is still great movie to own and it is to bad it is not on DVD yet because it would be good to watch it in a (Letterboxed)Widescreen format, so people could watch it in the way it was played in theatres. But hopefully someday it will!

0517548232|5.0|I have always been interested in the way business and money effect nearly all aspects of life.  It can befall every persons wants, needs, dreams, hopes, and in some cases even religion.  Ever since high school I have pushed myself in following a business career and even now I'm striving for a degree in Economics.  I have always pushed myself to create new techniques in finding that simple solution to money, but have always come up short.<br /> Henry Hazlitt's Economics in one Lesson could not have a better book for me to stumble upon.  In the beginning of his insightful book he stated his theory, or lesson as he would put it.  This simple lesson completely blew away the average persons thinking on the whole economical thought.  He basically described how one needs to think out of the box.  What I mean by this is that one should not see economics at the immediate but at the long term effects of any act or policy, also not to just follow the consequences of one group but for all groups.  <br /> As I read through the chapters of Mr. Hazlitt's book, I read about hundreds of fallacies in the everyday business world.  He had seemed to bend all beams of light to a completely new perspective.  The one thing that I enjoyed most about this book was the author's way to seem to totally contradict the average mans thought on the topic.   He had credible thoughts and sources to back his lessons up.  He described how our world works in favor of itself.  He used an excellent example of this with his \\"broken window\\" theory.  A baker's window is broken in by a stone that a kid threw at it. The baker has to spend money on the window which benefits the glass maker.  This same money was supposed to go towards a new suit.  All that is seen here is that the baker spent the money on a window and not a suit.  If you were to think out of the box you would also see the unseen.  The baker now cannot buy his suit which makes the tailor that much poorer.  <br /> Hazlitt described in one simple equation how taxes discourage production while also showing how our government is not entirely effective.   Let's say our national income is two hundred billion dollars and government taxes produced only fifty billion dollars of that.  This means that only 25% of the national income was being transferred from private to public purposes.  The government spenders forget that they are taking money from A in order to pay it to B.  Perhaps they see A but because B is soon to be able to live a much more lavish life by all the money transferred to him; they forget the effects on A.  B is seen; A is forgotten.<br /> A second instance of the author's brilliance is his discussion on inflation.  As he points out, inflation has led to nothing but economic disaster.  It encourages squandering, gambling and reckless waste of all kinds.  It's the creator of fascism and communism and leads men to demand totalitarian controls.  People tend to confuse money with wealth, and feel that if they had twice as much money that they would be twice as rich.  Hazlitt proves this to be a naïve thought.  The total quantity of money multiplied by its velocity of circulation must always be equal to the value of the total quantity of goods bought.  Double the quantity of money and you exactly double the price level and so on and so forth.<br /> As you can see, Henry Hazlitt used a completely different form of thinking on Economics.  He had just not focused on the current situation but instead the long term effects.  He used the most basic form of scientific reasoning when creating his ideas on the subject, and that is why I believe he has made an excellent argument in proving that the current economic standpoint of our world is extremely short from being flawless.  Hazlitt covered every topic in the economic world by totally revising it to a more reasonable perspective, one that was otherwise unrealized.  He created his ideas by incorporating historical instances with current issues and then unraveling it to show its trend and effect on everyone's life.  Henry Hazlitt wrote this book more than 50 years ago yet it still covers the very topics in today's newsstands and news channels.  He has created a simple guide that explains how we can improve our very way of living by channeling new methods into our economical standpoint.  In conclusion, I feel that Henry Hazlitt has effectively stated his argument in a strong, clear, and fair manner in his book.
B00006JK1R|4.0|The problem with sequels is that they become topheavy with the expectations of those that saw the original, the producers relentlessly (and shamelessly) striving to seduce every possible viewer that is seeing it just to catch their favorite character or situation. God forbid that you leave out the little dog that talks, or the googly-eyed guy or the neuralizer. I mean, after all, someone might walk away disappointed saying, &quot;Gee, I sure wish they included those weasly smoking guys!&quot; I can only think of a few that I really liked better than the original - Like Godfather II, and even that does it's share of pandering the audience. Even so, it is suprising, and refreshing when a sequel works at all. Happily, MIB II does its job, and seduces without pandering. Well, maybe that is generous. I suppose I could get used to a little pandering, as long as it is really taseless.  Everything is there, but each refreshingly different enough from the original to keep our attention. Sure the story is fairly predictable, but after all, this isn't Our Town. Here Frank is a grown-up agent and is hanging around with the dog guy. They need to find &quot;The Light&quot; or the world will end. K (Kevin) is the only guy who knows where it is, and he, of course had his ming erased at the end of MIB I. He needs to get his memory back, and, well, you get the idea. it's pretty much fun, albeit mindless. It is good for a yuk with the kids over popcorn on Saturday night, and Lara Flynn Boyle would keep my attention even if the movie was a dog (no pun intended). If she reads this, or if you know her, tell her that I hope that I see her in the sequel.
6305696071|5.0|Movie Review: Pretty Woman<br /> Pretty Woman is an old tale-with a whole new twist.  This sweet and provocative film can be paralleled to the Disney classic \\"Cinderella\\", yet its success as \\"best entertainment for the romantic\\" cannot be matched by any other movie in its genre.<BR> Vivian Ward (played by Julia Roberts) is a prostitute on the frequented streets of Los Angeles.  Her mouth is as big as her 80's style hairdo and her dreams for love in the future appear to be unrealistic.<BR> Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) is a hotshot businessman with only one thing on his mind: business.  Never the twain shall meet, right?  Wrong.  On one fateful night Edward takes a wrong turn in his flashy car and meets Vivian, who is out \\"working her corner\\".<BR>These two opposites engage in hilarious and innocent flirting until Edward decides to keep Vivian for one week for the hefty sum of four thousand dollars!  For Vivian it is the chance of a lifetime.<BR> Throughout the movie you learn a little bit about what makes each of them tick and why, while they come from opposite ends of the spectrum, Vivian and Edward make the perfect pair.  Yet after one week is up, will all-business Edward throw his morals out the window and confess his love, or will Vivian just return home four thousand dollars richer?<BR> This is a movie about finding true love in the most unexpected places, giving respect in order to earn it in return, and the uniqueness of each person.  It will teach you that you never stop learning in life, and that where affairs of the heart are concerned,<BR>anything  ( or anyone) is a possibility!<BR> Pretty Woman  will have you laughing out loud one minute, and swooning the next.  If romantic comedies are your kind of film, this one is sure to become your favourite by the end of the night!
B0000026NC|5.0|I really love this album, and ever have since the day it came out.  Yeah, it's not &quot;early Floyd&quot;, but that's fine.  They're totally different things, as far as I'm concerned.  I can like Momentary Lapse of Reason, Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, Division Bell without prejudice.<br />For some reason, &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; just sounds perfect for a live album.  It may not have the perfect mix of Floyd tracks, but it has a lot of the good ones.  Gilmour gives the guitar performances of his life, especially in Comfortably Numb - someone else said it was a story in itself.  They're dead on.  I don't usually go for guitarists, but this is absolutely gorgeous stuff.<br />I also admit to really loving &quot;Sorrow&quot;, especially this rendition.  It goes on forever, and that's okay.

0316666343|5.0|You must IMMEDIATELY go out and buy the book, &quot;The Lovely Bones,&quot; by Alice Sebold. It is haunting, powerful, sad but insatiable. At times, I just had to look away and contemplate.  There are parts that I had to stop reading to dry my eyes.  The book took me to lonely but unavoidable places which in real life, I can't seem to avoid going some days.
B000067CPX|5.0|they've done it again.  the chili peppers have managed to blend slappy bass tabs with the funk-mellow guitar and percussive snare all complemented by anthony kiedis's soulful alto.  this is definitely the most mellow and introspective offering from the peppers.  i read that kiedis has for the most part given up on his hard-partying ways and now drinks a pot of green tea when he wakes in the morning.  this is in marked contrast to the on stage antics of flea (most notably at woodstock '99, when he came out on stage naked as usual but did a one handed cartwheel while wearing his bass.  awesome!)  this album is mellow, but at the same time it rocks.  some of the songs sound psychedelic, others sound like pure pop-rock, but all are definitively chili-peppers.  amazing disc!  two thumbs way way up.
B000002UB3|5.0|i think this is truly the beatles swan song albulm. it's a well-known fact that the beatles were in serious decline as an ongoing band by the time this albulm was recorded, but they came through with an absolute masterpiece. <BR>in my opinion, harrison's contribution was bigger here than on any previous beatle recording, and for that reason, this record reveals the absolute height of their work. not only is his song writing  at it's absolute peak in &quot;here comes the sun&quot; and in &quot;something&quot;, but his guitar work is similarly brilliant. his solos on &quot;you never give me your money&quot;, &quot;something&quot;, &quot;octopus's garden&quot; are, simply stated,  perfect . and it's abbey road that shows us just how brilliantly george developed  as a singer. his singing voice developed from an interesting, but strained sound to a sweet, angelic lead instrument and perfect complement to paul and john's lead vocals.<BR>in short, great, timeless songs and arrangements -- even &quot;maxwell's silver hammer&quot; is worthy of serious praise for paul's bass work alone. virtuoso musicianship -- george, of course, paul showing pure brilliance on bass. virtuoso song writing, and the beatles magic. this record will last forever.
B00006LFGD|4.0|This is a lovely album, especially for anyone who loves duets.  It is especially beautiful when Ms. Streisand joins in harmony with someone who has an equally powerful voice.  A few of her partners who only have a mild voice are often left in the dust.  A jarring note on the album for me was the duet with Ray Charles.  He is wonderful on his own, singing songs in his unique style, but paired with Barbra was not a good listening experience for me.  She was too loud and didn't seem to be in sync with him much of the time.  The Josh Groban pairing was wonderful, as is her set with Johnny Mathis.  Too bad she sang with Frank Sinatra so late in his career.  He sounded old and tired.  A reviewer commented that some of the men were outclassed, i.e. Don Johnson, etc., but those particular pairings were interesting because they were not of the norm.  &quot;TELL HIM&quot; with Celine Dion, both strong singers, was an exhilarating and exciting duet.  Whether these duets were old or new, the album is terrific to listen to.
0380789019|5.0|I just finished Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere.  Both my friend and myself read through it at a ravenous pace, as the book is difficult to put down.  For all its fairytale otherwordliness, this is no children's story.  This deals with adult themes and situations.<br />The setting is London's underground tunnels and rooftops - an alternate reality that exists in the spaces inbetween.  Richard, the main character, is an ordinary man who stops one day to help an injured girl and finds himself thrown in this alternate reality.  No one from his previous ordinary life can see or hear him, and he is forced to deal with this new and confusing world.  In this world, rats can speak and a raggedy earl holds court in abandoned subway stations.  Here is where the book becomes an engaging fantasy in a dark milieu.  Richard, not having other options, joins a quest to help the girl avenge her family and hopes someday to return to the surface.<br />Previously, I had only read Gaiman's graphic novels, and Gaiman can paint a picture with prose just as well as with colored inks.  The settings and characters are lavishly drawn, and each scene is fully imaginable in three-dimensions.  The connections between real London locations and the underworld add a touch of reality.<br />The book touches on the theme of homelessness, and &quot;invisible people&quot;.  The people of this alternate universe look like vagrants to ordinary Londoners, if they are seen at all.  To most people, they are invisible.  This is a metaphor for all the invisible people in our world.  Gaiman even touches on the fact that service people can be invisible, as Richard greets the doorman of his office building for the first time after experiencing being invisible himself.<br />The setting reminded me of the documentary book, The Mole People, if it were taken one step further.  Neverwhere poses the question whether the homeless man talking to himself is crazy, or is it just that we cannot see what he sees?
6302914191|2.0|While the Twin Peaks series is one of the best things ever to appear on a TV, these tapes dont do the series justice.  First they attempt to pack 5 episodes on each VHS tape, and in order to do this they are done in very low quality.  Both the audio and video suffer, though the audio is really the worst part.  After viewing the tapes a few times, it seems like they may actually be getting worse, the audio has almost completely dropped out in some places. My advice is to get out of the dark ages and get the DVDs
0684803356|5.0|This book is beautiful.  I don't know what else to say.  It is also extremely sad.  Don't be surprised if you finish this book at 1:00 AM, on the floor, crying.  Although I don't have a copy of the book in front of me, it has a quote along the lines of <br />Everyone must do what they can, you can do nothing for yourself but perhaps you can do something for another.<br />This is a main theme in the book, though I think that it is even more - it is directly applicable to each of our lives.  The beautiful thing is, is that this help that we can render to each other is not some lofty political idea of either the right or the left.  It teaches us that each one can do his/her best, but that is all that they can do.  Robert Jordan, the main character, vividly demonstrates this.  From the United States, he has given up a safe job as a Spanish Professor at a University in Montana, to become a demolitions expert for the Republicans (anti-fascists) in the Spanish Civil war, in the 1930's.  Pained by the loss of his father to suicide, he refuses to end his own life prematurely, choosing instead to delay the pursuers of the guerrila group he has fallen in with, when he has the chance of surrendering to them and saving his own life.  <br />As much as I want to, I cannot describe the beauty of this book.  In three and one-half days, he falls in love, is betrayed by the guerrilla group's leader, strikes a blow for the Republic, and makes himself the All-American hero.  But the real beauty is reading about someone who just enjoys the beautiful things of life, the air and the meadow and Maria and the sandwhich of meat and cheese with wine to wash it down that he eats in the countryside in a time and place when people were as human as they are now.  Among the many tragic elements of this book are the leaders at the top of the Republic, who seem to spend their time smoking and drinking and letting military secrets slip that cause untold anguish for those beneath them.  Also tragic isJordan's reading of the letters to a dead Fascist soldier (that his group had killed).  This soldier has a woman waiting at home for him and worrying for his life and...it just all ties together, showing us, as the quote at the beginning indicates, that \\"no man is an island\\", even the enemy is human, was born, will live with the same fear and pain that we do, and will die.  We hate each other but are so similar that it's painful when we discover that someone else on the \\"other\\" side could have been our own brother.  The Fascist soldier and the Republican aren't really that different, and the woman that waits at home for him cries just as much as Maria does.  This book is so big and terrible and inspiring and real.  This book strikes a blow for a kind of pragmatic idealism.  Realize that the world is a messed up place but that eveyone can do what they can.
B00006LSM3|5.0|The first sound you hear on this disc is George saying \\"Give me plenty of that guitar\\", and very prominent indeedj is Harrison's wonderful guitar playing, especially his slide playing. Although there a couple of fairly pedestrian songs here, most are excellent, allowing his guitar to soar. Highlights include the sprightly \\"Any Road\\" (which sounds like a Travelling Wilburys song) and his wonderful uke-driven version of \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\"; and the majestic \\"Rising Sun\\" and the transcendent instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\", in which he out-does David Gilmour and Pink Floyd. \\"Struck Inside A Cloud\\" is a sad song that holds out hope in its sheer beauty. The album closes with the title song, which decries the materialism and status-seeking of the world and presents God as the way out of that mess- it's a rocking song that turns into Indian music and finally into a Hindu chant-it's similar in many ways to his earlier song \\"Living in the Material World\\". This may be George's best album, although it's hard to top \\"All Things Must Pass\\". It does surpass his last, fine album \\"Cloud Nine\\" though- although it's nowhere near as commercial.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Jeff Beck's stunning comeback album following the BBA fiasco. This is a true high point in the history of rock guitar, solidifying his position, along with Jimi Hendrix, as the greatest guitarist of the rock era.

B000000WA4|1.0|This is a concept album?  I have two words:<br />Dream Theater.
0316666343|3.0|I resisted this book at first because of its subject matter, but then finally relented. While I will admit there are some lovely passages regarding family, friendship and loss, the end of the story was a real disappointment. Sebold ruins the story by giving us a completely contrived, utterly unoriginal and downright hokey description of Susie's reunion with a lost love. Where did this come from? Teen movie of the week? I understand that Sebold is using the voice of Susie - so the perspective is that of a teenager's - but that is not the point of the story. To me, the most poignant part of the story was Susie's gradual acceptance of her separation from her family - and from earth. To throw in a reunion at the end seemed tacked on and simply there to provoke an emotional response from the reader. I hate when writers, filmmakers, etc. feel they have to give in to what they assume the mass audience wants. I honestly was OK with most of the loose threads Sebold leaves. (Though not all, more on that later...) In fact, I thought the story was more authentic because of some of the loose ends. In real life, murder doesn't wrap up as neatly as in the movies, clues don't always pan out, etc. But please, Ms. Sebold, trust your audience's intelligence -not all of us need romance and a roll in the hay thrown in where it clearly doesn't belong. And some of the loose ends you left (Ruth - for example) really should have been given more of your attention. I'm not sure why you threw in George Harvey returning to the neighborhood at the end, either. Did you just get tired when you came to the end? It seems as if you just sort of gave in and finished the novel without giving it enough thought. The first review I read on this site came from a 15-year-old. That sounds about the right age group to enjoy this story. And they'll appreciate the romance, too.
B000002UA5|3.0|To put it bluntly Ummagumma is absolutely the strangest and weirdest album I have ever listened to, but in its own unusual way it's also somewhat listenable. The live disc is without a doubt superior to the studio one because of great renditions of older Floyd songs, especially Astronomy Domine which just sounds fantastic here. Unfortunately the studio disc is more problematic. I do enjoy parts of it and there are a few songs that are really cool to listen to, but all in all it's just a strange garbled mess, which in all honesty could very well sum up the whole album. For one thing there are hardly any lyrics to be heard throughout the 86 minute running time, and when there are they don't make much sense or are hard to decipher. But really the album seems to me to be almost one continuous piece of music that has its moments, but for the most part is just weird. To be fair this is the only Floyd record I own, so I can't really say if this is their worst one or not, but for me at least it seems like it may very well be. The songs I've heard from Dark Side and the Wall off the radio sound 10 times better than anything off of this with the exception of Astronomy Domine. That one song, which incidentally is the first song on the live album, deservingly earns 5 stars all by itself, but since the rest of the album unquestionably doesn't live up to that one shining moment, thus the album as a whole gets only 3 stars. It certainly isn't a horrible album, it's just a very strange one. Very, very strange indeed!
0321146530|4.0|Everyone who's read about XP has wanted a book like this forever, so a decent performance was bound to be a happy occasion (a hot dog is a feast to a starving man). I would disagree with the last reviewer and say that the first part of the book is the good part, when the author works through his 'money' example. At the end of it, there's a great moment when Beck acknowledges the importance of metaphor, claiming that he'd done the same exercise a number of times, though this time, he had picked a better metaphor and it subsequently went a lot faster. I have to laugh at this. This is a case of obiter dicta (giving away the key to something in passing). But the funny thing is that Beck doesn't notice how important it is. He proceeds to just meander through the rest of the book. Then, the book just goes down the rathole as we feel like we're being treated to a prof who's run through his material and is just waiting for the bell. The section on patterns is abominable, ending with a thing on Singleton that says something like 'Don't use global variables, your programs will be happier,' which is a ridiculous capsulization of an issue that a lot of people have discussed many times before. A Singleton is globally available. It's not a variable. Mail servers are globally available too. Guess we shouldn't use them either.<br />Let me also say that I am really kind of fed up with Kent Beck's Opi Taylor writing style. It's ok when the focus is on the KISS side of the equation and generally positive, but his snide little sideswipes throughout this book on everything from the open-closed principle to the idea of doing specifications (another searing, strong argument that boils down to the root of the word being the same as for the word speculation (!)) are really laughable. Makes me wanna say, yeah, who needs a spec if all they are doing is the 10 millionth payroll program or a currency converter. Don't look to Kent Beck for big answers, as a matter of fact, by his own half-conscious admission, he's as much in search of them as we are.<br />So why 4 stars? Per the subject, the Woody Allen principle. Another hysterical part of this book is at the very end he shows a list of things someone else suggested, none of which are covered in the book, as if he had to tell us, at the end, that he knew just how much was missing.ious admission, he's as much in search of them as we are.<br />So why 4 stars?

0688170528|1.0|I read this book on the basis of the many glowing reviews previously written and I was very disappointed.  The characters were unsympathetic and one-dimensional. I guess I don't understand the &quot;small town&quot; mentality but it seems a little sick that the parents never wanted anything more from their children than for them to fall in love and live happily ever after without ever experiencing what else is out there.<br />The writing is also quite mediocre and the trial is not very credible.  I'm very sorry to have wasted the time that I spent reading this book.
6305169187|4.0|You know, after reading some of the negative reviews of this EXCELLENT ACTION/ADVENTURE Sci-Fi movie, I can't help being curious about what the snob-rules club finds interesting. My guess would be stuffy, boring, endlessly wordy \\"art\\" flicks. <br />This picture has plenty to offer - action, humor, suspense, loveable and quirky characters, patriotism, phenomenal special effects & a killer soundtrack ... what's not to love? <br />It's two and one half hours of FUN entertainment with just enough plot to hold it all together. <br />It's science fiction - it's not meant to change the world, challenge your intellect or interject a new world philosophy. I feel sorry for those folks who can't relax enough to watch a well acted, well directed and well presented movie without over-analyzing every aspect of it. <br />Sometimes you need a movie with deep meaning. Other times you just need a little Armageddon...
B00001QEE9|5.0|I love this movie because it brought back a childhood memory in vivid color. I got mine out of a boxed set released a couple of years ago so I don't know if ti is as full featured as this one. Watching the original trailer.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|When I first saw Guy Pierce in \\"L.A. Confidential\\"  he was the only thing I didnt like about the movie(too whiny).  Now watching his exceptional work in \\"Memento\\" and \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" I only wonder why he isn't winning even higher praise(he puts Crowe's tortured math genius to shame any day in my opinion).  <br />Guy Pierce plays a man without the ability to create new longterm memories since he was injured in a breakin where his wife was raped and murdered.  Since then he has taken it upon himself to avenge this great wrong by tracking down the attacker a man he calls \\" John G.\\".  He tatooes \\"clues\\" that he finds on his body so he won't forget them.  <br />The movie is directed from the end to the beginning, the ending of each scene being where Pierce has forgotten that bit of short term memory. This allows the viewer to feel as confused as Pierce and claw at what is going on along with him.  You cringe when you see how cruel the world can be to him, and you cringe when you see how cruel he can be to the world.  carrie anne moss also gives a great perfomance.  <BR>-cjw
B00005B6C9|5.0|After hearing from each brother on individual LPs/CDs, this effort combines some of their most innovative combined efforts in years and gives them all a chance to flex their creative wings.  The techno side comes out on Robin, and the &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; Maurice himself shows what a great instrumentalist and vocalist he is and always has been.  Barry is being incredible creative in ways he has never shown, and it makes for a fun record to listen to!  Well done, boys!  I have, and always will, look forward to the next recording.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System has done it again. all of the songs on this cd are absolutely awesome. the beginning of the cd is a little reminiscent of the stuff from toxicity but as it goes on you can really see their sound evolving. S( and to mr \\"music fan\\" this means evolving in general, not specifically from toxicity )songs like Mr. Jack, Ego Brain, and roulette are unlike anything system has done before and are some of the best tracks on this cd. as always serj's lyrics are intensly political yet poetic. and of course serj's one of a kind voice and some awesome guitar riffs don't go unnoticed. for any system fan this cd is a must so go out and buy it!
B00005JKCH|2.0|There was plenty to enjoy in this film.  The action sequences were good, and I felt that the character was treated fairly well.  However, the CGI could have used a little more work, and the dialogue was actually quite bad.  <br />It wasn't a bad film.  But it didn't really break any new ground.  Better than the live-action Batman films by a mile, worse than the first Superman film.  Also not as good as X-Men.
0066214122|3.0|Prey is an entertaining read but fails to live up to a thriller such as Timeline. I think one of the reasons is that Timeline had so many subplots and different settings that it was impossible not to be enthralled. Prey is interesting in the fact that Chriton's display of his scientific knowledge about nanotech is exciting but I felt the book was a little one dimensional where Timeline (I think his best) forced sweaty palms on the reader. I just didn't get as much of a thrill from Prey
B00006CXSS|5.0|Are the best mini-series ever made. Each episode is well made and acted beautifully. You must see them all.
630522885X|1.0|I can hardly believe how bad the quality of the Fox-Lorber DVD version of this film is.  I have the privilege of access to a local University library with an extensive laserdisc and DVD collection, so I was able to see both this DVD version and the criterion collection's out of print laserdisc edition of this film.  The difference between the quality of the dated laserdisc and this DVD was like night and day - the laserdisc was incomporably better.  Why Fox-Lorber does not simply pay for the Criterion print is beyond me.  For Fox-Lorber to buy the DVD rights to this film and then release a version of such shamefully low quality is ridiculous - it seems to me alogical, as if though it would have made more sense for Fox-Lorber never to aquire the rights at all.  In truth, because I enjoy this film so much, I feel that this DVD is an act of wanton cruelty on Fox Lorber's part.  I would advise discriminating viewers to avoid this DVD; I despair because I can now not own a copy of the film for myself in the forseeable future.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Everyone who buys this is taking a big GIANT ... on this bands legacy. Kurt Cobain wore a shirt that said \\"corporate magazines still suck\\" on the cover of rolling stone. Come on now, \\"I know you're right\\" is a great song but don't spend your [$$$] for a cleverly packaged single. I guess Grohl and Novoselic just didn't want to deal with that horrible excuse of a person in court anymore. So they let Courtney love completely bastardize the legacy of this awesome band by ripping off all Nirvana fans. Thank God \\"i know you're right\\" was leaked onto the internet.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Great album. One question though: is it just me, or dose Cochise sound a lot like Whole Lotta Love? Go back and forth between the two songs and you'll know what I mean.
B000002GFU|5.0|\\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" still beckons to be heard, a rare feat for any popular recording that has aged beyond 30 years. Cat Stevens completely transcends the self-conscious trappings that plague many musicians and delivers a sparkling testimony about the life of a seeker.<br />Though undercurrents of melancholy run through many songs, Mr. Stevens does not give in to sadness and depression. Instead, the theme of love lost in the classic Wild World absolves his lost lover and warns her about the ways of the world. He confronts dying with an unflinching resolve in But I Might Die Tonight and appeals to the ideas of Zen in the muscular, celebratory Miles from Nowhere. Mr. Stevens raises the eco-flag in Where Do the Children Play, which still sounds relevant despite a few archaic (at least to current American sensibilities) words such as \\"lorry.\\"<br />He visits the quest motif more than once---perhaps an indication of his own state of mind at that time---in the jaunty On the Road to Findout and the plaintive dialogue that captures the essence of the generation gap in Father and Son. In Sad Lisa, he confronts a quest of a different sort, chronicling the narrator's efforts to deal with some form of mental illness, though it's not entirely clear if Lisa is real or an apparition only the narrator can see.<br />Mr. Stevens also delves into the possibly related themes of contacts with UFOs in the metaphorical Longer Boats and experimentation with psychotropic drugs as he catalogs images and experiences that merge Into White.<br />The stellar band that supply the musical textures here are in fine form, especially second guitarist Alun Davies, long the unsung hero on the best of Cat Steven's recordings. Mr. Stevens and Mr. Davies interweave melodies and ideas so seamlessly that it's almost impossible to separate one from the other. The rhythm section here ranges, whether nearly muted or unleashing torrents of energy, never intrudes but always anchors the songs. The strings on \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" sparkle like moonlight on the ocean, offering subtle relief and counterpoint without choking out the music as they do on some of Mr. Steven's later recordings.<br />Mr. Stevens made many excellent recordings, some good ones, and one transcendent one, \\"Tea for Tillerman.\\" I hope that he has found the peace he sought and am thankful for this gift he left us before entering the life of contemplation and devotion that beckoned him.\\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" sparkle like moonlight on the ocean, offering subtle relief and counterpoint without choking out the music as they do on some of Mr. Steven's later recordings. <br />Mr. Stevens made many excellent recordings, some good ones, and one transcendent one, \\"Tea for Tillerman.\\" I hope that he has found the peace he sought and am thankful for this gift he left us before entering the life of contemplation and devotion that beckoned him.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I am a Xtina fan, and once I heard her album was coming out I was excited beyond words; however, I've never been so disappointed in my life.  I was strictly under the impression this would be an R&B record, as she once stated.  Only, it isn't.  I like all kinds of music, but Stripped's real appeal to me are her soul ventures.  \\"Walk away\\" , \\"Loving me for me\\" , and \\"Impossible\\" are great songs.  \\"Get mine, get yours\\" and \\"Dirrty\\" get tired after a while.  \\"Stripped\\" should've been a song instead of just an intro and interlude.  Eventually, I got more into the album, and found that \\"Soar\\" and \\"The voice within\\" made me miss the \\"Music Box\\" Mariah.  I'm not very in love with \\"Beautiful\\", but the video is great.  \\"Make over\\" is her best experimental song.  A great improvement from her \\"Genie...\\" days, but still not exactly what I was hoping for.
0790729725|5.0|This is a classic movie.  I was hooked the very first time I saw it and whenever it comes on TV I watch it when I get the chance.  Finally I bought the DVD.  The movie has excellent direction and a superb cast.  Watch out for Michael Imperioli (Christopher Multisante of The Sopranos) in a bit role that is memorable.  The movie is by turns very intense and funny.  Any fan of gangster/mafia films with love this movie!!!
B000002BQK|5.0|5 years, (and 2 actual original LPs) after its release, &quot;Butterfly&quot; is still the best Mariah album since her debut, and &quot;Daydream&quot; hit the shelves.  Believe me, a classic of Mariah albums!  The ballads are beautiful, and the uptempo tracks are great.  Every Mariah fan should have this.  Mariah has yet to surpass the nerve she hit with this LP, and I hope she hits that nerve soon.
B000077VPU|3.0|I've been waiting for this on DVD since the DVD format came out.  I watched the televised portion of the concert, and I bought the VHS concert.  To have such an array of stars astonished me.  From Metallica to Liza Minelli.  Let's just say I'm grateful I still have a VCR and the VHS version of this magnificent concert.<BR>Although it brought out the same emotions it brought out on the VHS concert version, the DVD lacks the sets of Metallica, Gun-n-Roses, and Extreme.  Those sets were a large part of the concert because they completed the variety of the show.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I bought her second CD misunderstood and loved it, so decided to buy this one. She has a wonderful, and soulful voice, and I love to listen to her.  I ham almost 41 years old and I really enjoy this chicks music!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider-Man is a movie that has become one of the most successful films of all time. It has made over $791 million world-wide an is a top DVD and VHS selling world-wide. The comic strip is the most popular in the world and now the films are hitting the big screen. It holds many records at the box office and made a huge $117 million in its opening weekend. There are now Spider-Man comic books, Films, Cartoon Films, Console games, merchandise and much more! This is now a franchise and nothing can stand in its way! The sequal Spider-Man II will hit the cinemas in 2004.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo &amp; Stitch is incredibly fun and delightful.  Set in beautiful Hawaii, it combines a zany, uncontollable little rascal alien that passes for a dog(Stitch) with a cute, funny, little troublemaker girl(Lilo).  The DVD is chock-full of tidbits including a cool How to Hula demonstration.  This movie has some adult humor and bigger words that kids might not comprehend, but that's what makes it a great movie to buy for both kids and adults.  Good stuff.
B0000214G6|5.0|This movie was outstanding. The dom/sub thing was so subtle that it really pulls you into the story without even realizing it. There was such a fine line between sexual excitement and true fear. It was like one was bleeding over into the other. Extremely sexy.
B00005JLWL|4.0|Went to see this even though i knew next to nothing about it. Similiar thematically to Minority Report; similar theatrically to the Matrix, with the CG city scapes, color filtering, and innovative martial arts gun battles. I'll just make random comments that hopefully will ring true when you see the film; i'd rather not repeat the plot that is summarized somewhere else on the internet. Costumes are slick. Fight scenes are sexy, cool and bad to the bone. The CG city background was futuristic enough to work for the film; they might have been better, but at least they weren't so virtual, they looked fake. Not sure why the cars were so late 80s/early 90s american vehicles. They should have done a little product sponsorship like Lexus in Minority Report; people always like to see cool new things; it broadens their horizons. Seeing re-painted chevy's does not. However, the auto-handguns used are the sort that make gun-geeks weak in the knees.  Great story for such a muted romantic angle, they could have done more there.  No cool, power woman characters. In this day and age we should see tough,...ladies showing up the men in every other film. It shows a little lack of vision or imagination on the part of the film makers. Even in Metropolis (the early 20th Century flick, not the anime), they were working the female heroine angle.  Science fiction is known for having innovative, bad hotties dominating the screen, so it's a glaring oversight. The scenes and shots start out truly cinematic with some memorable shots, but they never resurface as they give way to audience-minded action thrill shots later. I mean, why not throw in more bizarre, euro-style shots of water or something just to give it the sophistication you started out with? Again, scifi flicks give film makers a suitable genre to try out the nifty, cutting edge stuff that people no longer tolerate from Arnold movies. The entire picture is filmed with a color filtering that is similar to the matrix...same dark, fallcolors like green and burgandy. The colors sort of carry this feeling of a strange reality, like a dream or memory...a nice touch which borrows on the strength of themes from the Matrix, but overall the film didn't achieve the plot, thematic and cinematic achievements of the matrix. Equilibrium borrows a lot, but fails to capitalize on it and take it further or elsewhere. A disappointment after such a strong beginning. Go see it...enjoyable and entertaining.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Maleficent is probably one of the cruelest disney villians from any disney movie, she ranks number 1 right up there with Cruella DeVill, Ursula The Seawitch and Jafar from Aladdin. The story does not let down, and this movie is simply a masterpiece, the voices are well done, the story is good, do not be mistaken It his movie appeals to me because of the story and not because it has a beautiful princess and a prince, I heed you watch this not only for the story but for the Wicked Maleficent, as she is the true definitive word of Disney Villian.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|As contrived as t.A.T.u. may be, there's no denying this album has a kind of over-the-top grandeur, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for misunderstood teens...The roaring guitars and hard beats are better than the contrived pop of their American and British counterparts. The track selection is rather skimpy; only 8 songs, followed by two Russian versions and a slightly extended version. The latest Russian counterpart to this album has about 15 songs, the best of which should have been added. Listening to this is a guilty pleasure, like listening to ABBA.
0380789035|2.0|I was really expecting more out of this book; the incredible premise behind it is probably much too difficult to live up to. Jesus is referenced only once in the entire book...two lines are used to describe him as a 'lucky son of a virgin'. Little details about all the deities takes up most of the space in the book and not enough attention is paid to the 'modern gods'.<br />And why would gods like Odin and the rest even remain at all? The only example of a modern day pagan god that seemed believable in the slightest was that of Eostre, which was humorous in depicting our fascination for mumbojumbo (I wonder if she is in league with Deepak Chopra?).<br />Nope, sorry, I just can't swallow this whole theory of the importance of mythological characters.  Greed, technology, media have ALWAYS been important to people.  The way many of the mythological gods are treated seems a little too precious as well.  There really wasn't much of a reason to care about the protagonist either.

0440217563|5.0|For most of my life I have been madly in love with Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice.  Now another man has entered my life:  Jamie Fraser!  From someone who has read thousands of books, I can honestly say that the OUTLANDER series is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure to read.  VOYAGER is the third installment of a fabulous time travel, adventure, historical and romance series.  Claire is now in her late forties (but still looks great!) and returns through the stones back to the eighteenth century and to the love of her life; the tall, handsome, intelligent, romantic red-headed Scottish Highlander, Jamie Fraser (who also still looks great).  I am so much happier now that the couple is back together--I just wish things would slow down a few days and they could have a nice reunion (after twenty years).  But no, as in Gabaldon's other books, there is never any rest for the weary!  Something exciting (or terrifying) happens on every page!      There are a few inconsistencies in this novel.  \\"Red Fish Blue\\" fish was written well after Claire read it to Brianna.  Also, after everything Claire did--giving up not only her life, but her daughter--why did she so quickly leave before finding out the truth about Jamie's marriage?  She refused to even hear an explanation.  But there are only a few contradictory scenes; everything else in this book is delicious!    And of course, Jamie is still (thank heavens) romantic: \\"Christ, I do want ye!  I want ye so badly that sometimes I think my heart will burst wi' the joy of having ye.\\"  Or, \\"Then kiss me, Claire,\\" he whispered.  \\"And know that you are more to me than life, and I have no regret.\\"

0451167716|5.0|\\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse...\\" just gotta love that line...classic Vito Coreleone. That is from the single greatest Italian-mafia novel ever: The Godfather. Written by Mario Puzo this novel has it all: sex, violence, the workings of a hierarchal (don't know if I spelt that correctly, forgive me)organized crime group. Puzo executes this story line flawlessly with plenty of wacks, assaults, and dead horse heads. Pick this up if you want a great action packed read w\an exceptional story line. Don't pick this up if too much gore bothers you, or if illicit sex in a novel bothers you.<br />\\"Keep your friends close but your enemies closer.\\"
0066214122|2.0|A disappointment.  While the premise of nanotechnology run amok is full of possibilities, the characters in this novel are utterly forgettable - especially the protagonist Jack.  It seems that the author wanted to make sure no one was left behind in the plot development so we're left reading lowest common denominator character development.  Main characters die off and....who cares?  Even the other characters in the novel seem oddly unaffected by the unfolding events within the story.<br />This book isn't horrible.  There are a few moments of spooky tension but overall it's not up to Crichton's other work.
0872860175|5.0|Howl and Other Poems by Allen Ginsberg is quite possibly one of the greatest American epics ever written. With its nightmarish violent and sexual imagery this will last forever. Let me just tell you if your new to Ginsberg (which I am not)I would recommend reading Reality Sandwiches or Kaddish first; if the overtly homosexual imagery in Howl doesn't bother you. Reality Sandwiches is a bit more toned down than Howl although in my opinion not better. Ginsberg's epic is a psychological drug induced (Ginsberg wrote Howl while under marijuana's influence) head trip into the minds of his fellow fallen hipsters and junkies. It is about a howl of defeat and a stench of death. If you are a beginning writer and\or wish to write w\more freedom I highly recommend picking this up not only for enjoyment but also for a style book of sorts because Howl shows how to free onesself in the literary sense (trust me I'm a published poet and have been reading Ginsberg for awhile he is one of my main influences). The first part (the actual poem Howl is divided into 3 not including holy, holy)is one long sentence never utilizing a period until the end. I could write a whole essay on Ginsberg but I'll leave you with the man, the myth, the legend; just pick up his work if poetry interests you and definently pick up Howl if you are not too sensitized.<br />\\"...the mad man bum and angel beat in time; unknown, yet putting down what might be left to say in time come after death...\\"
B000066NW0|3.0|Ever since the pop culture started in the early 90's, many artists had the oppurtunity to get their names heard many times. It seems to annoy alot of people (including me) when they think they're special, they've created something unique, or just want to be very very popular, who knows, (including such artists as Emimnem, Britany Spears, TLC, etc.)? Is Avril Lavigne part of the group?.....who really knows? A young girl (cute by the way) that just started her own music career and has already been called \\"Poser\\" or \\"Fake\\" or \\"Annoying\\". I wouldn't call her any names or insults because for one, she just started. Two, I'm pretty sure there have been many music producers and representatives telling her what sounds good to people, how she should create her music. I'm sure she's an artist for writing her own lyrics but for her music.....I'm positive that she can give out a better performance.<br />As for her album, \\"Let Go\\"......what can I say. First of all, its not bad, but is this in the rock catagory, cause its defenitly not in the punk catagory. But with songs like \\"Complicated\\", \\"I'm with You\\", and \\"Losing Grip\\", I just feel that you cannot not listen to her voice. I'm sure they're alot of people who agree with me. Yes, she's pretty, she has good vocals, and she has a bad-ass attitude, but while listening through the album and the music, I'm sure she can do a better job next time.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|I recently copped the 8-mile soundtrack mainly because of the overwhelming fire from the lead single \\"Lose Yourself\\", everytime I hear the song I get goosebumps, and truthfully that doesn't happen unless there's some PAC in my ear.  I knew Eminem would be supertight on this cd, and he is! \\"Rabbit Run\\", and \\"8-mile road\\" are superbly done!  Having only heard Obie on the \\"Eminem Show\\" I was curious to see how he would do on another topic and solo and he made a believer out of me, close your eyes and \\"Adrenalin Rush\\" is KRS-like, with Obie hard pronouncing each syllable and spitting each rhyme hungrily with an obvious urgency for his own superstardom, and from the first verse of \\"Rap name\\" on the sampler he shoots off.  Now I had never heard 50 Cent personally but I heard about him and was anxious to hear his work.  Like Obie says in \\"Rap Name\\" Shady knows talent cause 50's laid back flow and smart-aleck punchlines rip up \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"I got places to go\\", his freestyle on the sampler confirms what most had already told me about 50, very hot!  Jay-Z shines with Freeway on \\"8-miles and runnin\\" he starts off the song with \\"the Renegades are back\\", and you can almost envision a Renegade album in stores!  Most would say that the R&B cuts are out of place but I don't think so, not being a big fan of Macy I'm happy to say that she was very impressive \\"Time of my Life\\" will have you singing the hook and not even know it, and Taryn's \\"Wasting My Time\\" will have your mama's stamp of approval for sho'. Rakim's addition to the soundtrack (R.A.K.I.M)is definitely a banger, his flow seems so effortless yet still though braggadocious in nature complex.  If you listen to the R's earlier work and this cut it's easy for me to see that he hasn't lost a step with this one.  Young Zee another artist who I had not heard personally really shines on his track \\"That's my nigga fo' Real\\" his witty rhymes and laid back flow go hand in hand with this laid back track, great song for ridin' withyour \\"best\\" partna's.  Other songs like D12's \\"Rap Name\\", Gangstarr's \\"Battle\\", and Xzibit's  \\"Spit Shine\\" are all noteable and though they are tight songs they're just honorable mentions when compared to the previously named cuts.  The only disappointing track on the album is NAS's \\"U Wanna be Me\\", the production to me is pitiful and even if you want to listen to these rather bland disses spit by NAS the track alone makes it hard to listen to.  Overall a great Soundtrack in the movie or not!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is probably the most relaxing music I have purchased in a very long time. Her voice is beautiful, the lyrics (from most of her own songs) are mellow, and the music is mesmerizing. Enjoy a nice bottle of wine with this music.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Reading some of the other reviews on this make me sick.  How can anyone give this album a bad review, how is Trent able to make a bad album.  He Can't, it is imposable for him to.  The whole album is a big F**K YOU!! to god.  The is a dark and tranquel masterpiece.  Trent's violent lyircs give the album something more, it helps out where some of the music is lacking.  The instrimental tracks are great, Help Me I'm In Hell is a well composed track it gives the listener a chance to clam down and think.  In a whole this ablum is great.
B00000GBHA|4.0|I was listening Rodriguez first time while travelling around Africa in a little white van with the worst tape recorder ever; and that's the way to listen him. You do not need bass boost, expensive stereo system, etc; you'll keep listening the most interesting and questioning lyrics and the most genuine instruments unpolished. If you feel bored, depressed or confused - stick \\"Cold Fact\\" on and quaranteed, you can feel only better about the world you're living in!
0316666343|4.0|I found the actual story itself good but it was the questions raised in my own mind that the most compelling.  Placing myself in Susie's place lead me to thinking about what the scereno would be like with my life today, as opposed to a young girl  It also stirred a strange sense of peace for me as I thought about the transitions we make through life, and the hereafter.
B000002H70|5.0|This was the first Cure album i bought. It wasnt the last, but let me tell you, it was the best. Every song, though they may be slow, melodic,and to some maybe even boring at times, catches you and holds you in until the end, then starts right back over with the next track. &quot;Pictures of You&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; are my favs on the album, but this is one of the few that i never skip a track on.
B00000JNNY|4.0|I love the Oldies because they evoke pure emotions that defy generational trends. I really love the track &quot;Trust in Me&quot; because it is unhibited in its power to show the strenght of a passionate women in love and at peace with her man.
B000003S5H|5.0|This album was the soundtrack to the best years of my life. <BR>When I play songs like 'la femme d'argent' and 'all I need' It takes me back to balmy sunny days in early spring, walking the lonely peaks and ridges of mid-wales.. <br />Thanks Air .<br />Buy it, and if you like the music for the same reasons I do, then buy 'premier symptomes', but don't expect much from '10khz legend' or 'the virgin suicides' - they are much less optimistic pieces of music; and '10khz legend' treads an uncomfortable path between contempt and despair.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I have a friend named Margaret who in a discussion about music told me she really doesn't like Hip-Hop or R&B music. She is a rocker like myself, so I told her that I understand her feelings. I know that I once felt that hip-hop and R&B were basically bad rapping over uninteresting beats, or bad singing over uninteresting beats. Either way, it seemed to me at one time that the music was boring and had little to offer rockers like Margaret and myself. Then I told her about \\"Miseducation.\\"<br /> When I was in high school, I happened to hear \\"Do Wop' prick my smug rock ears from a friends car radio. I asked him who this was and he tole me that it was Lauryn Hill. I was so enchanted that I had to buy the CD when I saw it at a local record store the next week.<BR> <BR> <BR>I told Magret that the album is full of great hip hop beats, soulful instrumentaion not heard since the do wop era, and rap skills on par with the best male rappers out there. However, more importantly, it is an album of Lauryn Hill's beautiful voice. A voice that swims through a past of pain, broken-hearts, love for men, her child and her world. The hip-hop, and R&B qualities of the album are all great, but it is Lauryn's powerful voice that makes the album a masterpiece worthy for even the smugest rock guy or girl.<BR> <BR>She bought the album a few days after our conversation and we have been huge Lauryn Hill fans ever since.
B000000W6R|5.0|I don't even know how to start to write this review.  First of all i think that i'm one of the biggest smashing pumpkins fans in the universe so i know what im talking about.  This was my first cd of theirs i bought about 5 years ago and this is what got me hooked.  The song la dolly vita is only the greatest song ever known to man.  Plume is the next best on the cd, awsome accustic and singing.  Then there is the one that can't be forgotten is obscured which is one of the coolest songs you'll prolly ever hear in your life.  For the last song Spaced that song is even awsome too but you have to listen very closly to the words for the song to be good.  If you are reading this review go and download the song la dolly vita right now i promise you wont regret it!
B00006CXXU|2.0|First of all I am no Christina fan. I find her annoying. I find her voice annoying and this album is pretty much annoying. the reason why I dont like this album is because its not just so long. but it contain to much of different music,style,vocal ranges,arrangements and beats that it becomes a big whole mess. The lyrics which often feel like theyre written by someone else ( Im sorry that I am not a virgin. sounds Like Britney not Christina). and the lyrics for the song Im Beautiful. Please Who in earth do you think you are. This album will proabbly do well because there are so many TRL fans that love Christina but I Do not think shes going to the right direction. There are some songs on it that I think are allright but I think Christina should grow as a person before growing as an artist.
B00006LIRI|3.0|Not sure why U2 decided to put together this compilation but I suspect there was significant pressure from the record label.  Why try to select only 14 songs (2 are new cuts) from their multiple records which have so many fantastic songs on them that were left out?  I think I could burn a better &quot;Best Of&quot; myself on my computer...and are they really serious with the Batman track?
B000067DNC|5.0|This season is by far one of the best - how can you not rate this lower then 5 stars? For all you interested Season 3 will come out on DVD between January and June 2003, hopefully the former! This is confirmed. Also Season 4 will be comming out on DVD in September 2003 - MGM is speeding up the process of releasing these DVD sets. There is still no word when season 5 or 6 is due out on DVD and I can't wait to see the new season 7 episodes which will air at the end of this year - Yes thats right Sci-fi channel has confirmed it Season seven is a go with all the original cast returning including the return of michael shanks. If you think season 2 was good wait till you see what is comming - it will blow you away!!!
B00005LANG|5.0|This is my favorite Marley album. The pulsating grooves of &quot;Natural Mistic&quot; and &quot;Heathen&quot; are minimalist simplicity at its most powerful. Bob was a rebel, a mistic figure. I only recently learned of his powerful influence in Jamaica's social and political life. He was their guru, their guiding light, and rightly so. His mere presence brought calm amid the turmoil of his country. His music is a perfect expression of his beliefs - the lyrics, the steady and hypnotic riddims, the melodies - every element in perfect accord with the others. The most amazing thing is, these guys were basically inventing this new music at the time they were coming out. To those who don't know (?) who Bob Marley was, this cd would be a perfect introduction, because it is not too heavy with political content and there are some &quot;accesible&quot; songs, such as &quot;So Much things to say.&quot;  A great and joyful work by the most important figure in Jamaican music, and one of the most important EVER. Period.
B000067CPX|5.0|Words cannot describe the joy that overcomes me when I put in By the Way.  I've listened to it all the way through at least 60 times now, probably more.  I haven't been captivated by a Album like this since the early 90's.  It's everything the Chili's are and should be...funky rock radio staples(By the Way, Can't Stop, The Zephyr Song), soft catchy ballods(Dosed, Tear), and experimental (Cabron, Venice Queen).  All the songs are great.  The only flaw on the entire CD are the lyrics on Throw away your Television, which sound like they're from a High School band.<BR>I was very dissapointed to hear the album being criticised for being a more mature outing...as I already have on Blood Sex Sugar Magik in my collection.  The funk is still thier, you just don't realize it because of the beauty of the CD.  Which is a great way to sum up the entire album...beautiful.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavinge. The New Artist from Canada, or they say. I just bought the album about 2 days ago. I used to only listen to \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Sk8ter Boi\\".Lets just say if i hadnt previewed the other songs from her CD, I would not have the album today.<BR>\\"Let Go\\" Is an EXCELLENT CD to wake up to, to listen to when your down, or when you want to. The first time i opened it and played it, I listened to the Whole CD straight, esp. the Bouns Track, and then looked at the media on the CD for the PC. I'll tell ya now, This is the only CD I listen to now, and I will buy her next CD. I put it on my car's CD Player everytime, I can never get enough of her. I am even looking for Nokia 3390 Ringtones of her songs!! I Love Avril Lavinge. Avril Lavinge ROCKS...
0451191153|5.0|Hi ... <br />I read this book almost 5 times and came to buy this time through Amazon as lost my previous copy ..just got the chance to write a review .<BR>you can imagine i am a die heart fan of this book ..<BR>just remember quoting one sentence from the same .<BR>\\"To say somebody I LOVE YOU first you need to learn how to say I\\"<br />amazing .. a superb book ..
0066214122|2.0|Take a billion or so nano-particles, add a pinch of The Invasion of The Body Snatchers, a dash of the egg farm plus 3 rungs of the ladder escape from Aliens, 2 tablespoons of the cardboard characters in Jurassic Park, sift together with a reproducing strain from Andromeda, mix thoroughly in the Nevada desert with a pound of concept from the Forbin Project, then add pages and pages of highly technical nano-data in the spirit of A Brief History In Time...and you have PREY, Michael Crichton's latest.<br />It is far from his best work, very derivitive, preachy at times and, if not viewed politely, could be thought of as half-baked.
0688170528|5.0|This was our book club book for November. It generated the most lively, involved discussion in months. Everyone know 'kids&quot; like Chris and Emily and we are all parents, so could understand the anguish and angst experienced by both sets of parents. Also, there was a long thread about &quot;how well do you really know people, even your own spouse&quot;. The fact that you can be close to someone yet they can still have many, many secrets you'll never know was an interesting sub-theme to this book. We also liked the fact that the author jumped almost seamlessly from person to person without the usually jarring feeling the reader experiences. I generally don't like books about suicide, but this one had a good voice.
B00007GZR5|1.0|This film attempts in every frame to be \\"important,\\" and fails on so many levels it's almost funny.  From the get go, its somber approach of a dead mans search for his dead family through an imagination of classic painters falls flat.  The effects are nice, but after 2 minutes of them, you expect the story to go somewhere--and it doesn't.  The acting is one note, and so incredibly somber throughout the film has little emotional texture.  Really a miserable, depressing film.
0553582445|5.0|15 years have passed and FitzChivalry has grown older and weary of the world. Or so he thought. His isolation from the rest of the world had only brought his hunger for contact to greater heights with Chade's visit. Once again, he found that he has to play the role of the Catalyst that threatens to make or break the destiny of the Six Duchies. <br />Hobb cleverly avoids making the mistake of many epic writers whose sequels circle around a fixed amount of information. With this new series, character development is aplenty, as Fitz struggles against dark memories of his past to strike out meaningful life for himself. What is more intriguing in this series is that it began to explore the half of Fitz's life that we didn't manage to examine in the first series, the Wit. While the Farseer series explored the magic of Skill, the Tawny Man began centering on the magic of Wit - its lore, its use and more importantly, its implications on the fate of the Six Duchies. The imagination and creativity that flowed to develop this new angle was impressive, showing yet another dimension of the magical world. And one begins to form the links between the Farseer and Liveship Traders as Hobb begins bridging the two magical worlds together, creating a multi-dimensional universe.<br />Like all Hobb's books, Fool's Errand promises and delivers a well-rounded characterisation, with their flaws. Fitz is as stubborn as he once was 15 years ago, only older and more willing to listen and only to the Fool and Nighteyes at that. They have fears, rage and emotions that we can adapt to as a real person, very much alive rather than a 2-dimensional caricature. <br />I have been an avid reader of Hobb's books, including the Farseer series and the Liveship Traders. She has shone a delightful new light at fantasy's favourite creatures, dragons, and magic. When I decided to pick up Fool's Errand, expectations were high that I will be brought to that magical world once again. I was not disappointed.
0060254920|1.0|....- suddenly, those monsters were fleshed out for me, thanks to Sendak and his scary illustrations. This book creeps me out to this day. Those ugly monsters with their pointy little fangs, claws and horns are nasty looking. I have mentioned this book to my friends and they all agreed with me: this story is not for children.
031286504X|5.0|Totally surprising, combines apocalypic setting with hordes of vampires.  GREAT!  Last half of book is short stories also.  Good and fast read.
B000002LEE|5.0|... This was the best album Jane's ever made, and arguably the best album of the late 80s.<br />First heard this album in 1989, and it stopped me dead to hear 'Summertime Rolls' and 'Mountain Song' on a friend's mix tape. 'Up the Beach' gets your attention, and there may not be a song ever written with more energy than 'Ocean Size' - unless it is 'Ted Just Admit it'. Those songs get me through cold winter days, while 'Summertime Rolls' is just that - a perfect song about warm weather and mellow days.<br />Everyone who knows Jane's Addiction because of \\"Been Caught Stealing' and 'Jane Says' has only begun to scratch the surface of this band - they were the most interesting, risk-taking, challenging and successful band of their day - and the best cover band ever as well - check out 'Deadicated' for their version of 'Ripple', and their first album for covers of V.U. and Stones songs.<br />I would buy this album and their first album before 'Ritual' in a heartbeat.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album has really grown on me!  A lot of cds I've bought lose their spark after about a week and end up actually in their case with other fallen stars.  This one, however, has pretty much remained in my cd player for about a month now.  My favorites include Track 2:  A funky hip-hop beat and collaboration with Lil' Kim.  I'm not much on the whole rap/hip-hop thing, but this tune demands extra volume in the car!  Track 4:  I'm SO glad she's thrown some rock and guitar in this song!  It's great!  One of few POSITIVE break-up songs out there!  Track 14:  My favorite ballad on this cd!  Crooned to perfection by Christina's AMAZING voice!    <BR>Tracks 15 and 16:  Once again, a great beat!  Very fun to listen to!<br />Overall, this album illustrates Miss Aguilera's soul-searching journey from &quot;Genie In a Bottle&quot; to what she is today.  No more teeny-bopper Britney-ish stuff!  At first I thought it reeked of a little too much girl-power.  But now I realize that she's just singing about her own experiences and how she's grown from them.   Songs with messages...and a REAL voice behind them!  Two key ingredients that make this an excellent album!
B000002GFC|5.0|There have been many Cream compilations since their breakup in '68, but this is officially the first exclusively put together for<BR>the CD format. The great thing about this collection, which contains 20 all time Cream classics, is that you are finally hearing<BR>the music for the first time the right way. All the classics are here including their first U.K. single &quot;Wrapping Paper&quot; released in<BR>'66. A cool booklet on the band's history with updated new liner notes and some great new pix will not disappoint any fan. All<BR>the material contained on this disc was remastered from the original master tapes utilizing the APOGEE ELECTRONICS' AD<BR>100 REFERENCE STANDARD 20 BIT ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTER and UV22 SUPER CD ENCODING.<BR>For any one who understands all this tech talk great! If you don't the difference when listening to this new CD version against<BR>the songs from the old Cream CD's from a few years back is a real 'Creamer'!
B00006LSM3|5.0|Beautiful.  Strong melodies.  Passionate lyrics.  Gorgeous guitar.  If McCartney recieved a Grammy nomination for Flaming Pie and Dylan got one for Time Out of Mind, then Harrison should at least get a nomination too because this album is better than both of those.  Well done, George.
B000000IVF|5.0|Well, Cream's swan song Goodbye has been finally given a total overhaul, sonically speaking, and issued on a gold CD by<BR>Mofi. This CD also incorporates a reproduction of the original poster included in the original Atco release back in '69. This<BR>LP featured a half live/half studio collection of treasures and is a total blowout on this ULTRADISC II gold CD. For the price<BR>around ... you can't go wrong and yet get any better as far as having Cream right there in your own private listening<br />room! Whether they are in concert \\"Sitting On Top Of The World\\" or in the studio with \\"Doing That Scrapyard Thing' it is all<BR>marvelous from beginning to end!
B000069HKH|5.0|I reviewed this album when it first came out, and gave it 5 stars. It gets better everytime I listen to it.  I recently saw Bruce in concert, and the songs work just as well in a concert setting.  Makes a great holiday gift!
B00000016K|5.0|Heavy! DCC have really outdone themselves with Cream's '68 instant classic Wheels Of Fire on a limited edition gold 2<BR>CD set. When I say outdid themselves by that I mean besides the digital overhaul to the gold format, all the cover art has been<BR>reproduced right down to the origina silver wrap used on the original Atco 2 LP set in '68. On the CD box, the CD sleeves &<BR>the special inner slipcase (get this!) houses a special cover with the albums recording info on the outside & on the inside the<BR>LP's colorful pyschedelic centerfold. As for the sonics... No buts! This release absolutely is a MONSTER and if you really<BR>want to hear this powerful 'tour de force' in a huge shovelful of richness and not lil'spoonfuls then you have got to get this CD<BR>and get Cream in big fat rich heapings that your ears will easily digest and your soul will thank you for. All 3 Ginger Baker's<BR>cuts smolder, especially \\"Passing The Time\\" with its recently discovered unedited long solo which had been edited at the last<BR>minute. For a real grip on the band's BLUES POWER wait till you hear 'Slowhands' overdubbed double lead on \\"Sitting On<BR>Top Of The World\\" & \\"Politician\\" you can feel the git's electricity like a live wire wrapped around you! 'Supreme de la<BR>creme'! And for a bonus cut an outtake from theWOF sessions 'Slowhand's' tuneful acoustic \\"Anyone For Tennis\\" released as<BR>a single in May '68 and released on the movie soundtrack The Savage Seven in '68 is added on. Just wait till you get to the<BR>other studio cuts! Live,crank up the volume, warn your neighbors and get ready to hear this live set like like never before, its<BR>all systems go & blow! If you dig headphones then you got the concert right there in your head so just close your eyes! All the<BR>tunes hit like a Mack truck and the sound engulfs you as if you are sitting dead center. \\"Toad,\\" \\"Traintime,\\" \\"Spoonful\\" &<BR>\\"Crossroads\\" just burn & burn & burn! A overwhelming sonic experience!
0451191153|5.0|Okay, the person who originally said this didn't say 'mind-tuck', but for the sake of decency (and I don't want to be scolded by the Amazon censors), 'mind-tuck' will have to do.  But I think y'all know what I mean.<br />This book, which I've had in my \\"Will Someday Read\\" pile since my junior year of college, has finally been read - 14 years later.  And well worth the wait, I may add.  It's probably for the best that time has gone by and life experience has accured for I may not have been able to appreciate all the intricacies and intrigues of this novel back when I was 19.<br />The book is definitely a page turner.  Ayn Rand has a superb sense of pacing in drama.  If it were written by anyone else, it would have been a pure fluff soap piece.  The characters are fleshed out to the point where they seem quite real.  Every sentence that comes from a character's mouth is consistent with the groundwork Rand has laid for that character.<br />Roark, the fiercely independent architect.  Who doesn't want to be more like him?  How can you beat Roark's reply when asked \\"What do you think of my work?\\"  Roark's response? \\"I don't.\\"  BURN!  Roark is the person you want to be at your high school reunion.  The person you want to be when you run into that ex. Unflappable, determined and single minded, never wavering from course.<br />On the flipside is Peter Keating.  A whiny, self-important, wishy-washy fraud of a man.  A well-dressed, blubbering mess. A man who wants nothing more in life than to be admired by others.<br />Dominique, the intelligent femme-fatal, able to get any man she sets her sights on but only wanting the one that gives her the most chase.  She mirrors Roarck in her intensity and singlemindedness.  A strong woman with incredible faith that things will work out in the end.<br />The monologues given by some of the key characters were - at least, to me - breathtaking.  Roark's vituperative speech about 'second-handers' had me talking back to the book, much in the manner of 'screen talking'.  At other times, I had to get up and pace around my apartment. So much happens in this book that it would be impossible to 'summarize' the plot here.  I can only describe my reaction to the book.<br />This novel left me feeling as if I had ended a long term relationship.  I didn't want it to end and didn't quite know what to do with the time I had previously reserved for reading the book.  I began looking for the Roarks and Keatings in my own life. When faced with a tricky social situation, I asked myself, \\"What would Roark do?\\" I found myself re-reading passages and mentioning the book to all who would listen.  One good friend of mine decided to take my advice and borrowed my bedraggled and marked up copy to read on his trip to Korea.  When he came back from the trip and called, the first thing he said was not about his experiences in Korea, but instead, \\"Man, that was a 900 page mind-'tuck'!\\"  I couldn't agree more.in the manner of 'screen talking'.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Very good. I didn't even expect it to be this good. I enjoy this better than my Soundgarden album almost except for Black Hole Sun and Spoonman.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|Yes, yes.  I know that this isn't exactly Tom Hanks at his Academy Award-winning best.  However, this under-rated, oft- maligned film from the mid-eighties is very, very funny.  Tom Hanks plays the everyman attempting (mostly in vain) to redo his dream home in this somewhat predictable comedy.  As expected, anything and everything goes wrong- from projectile turkeys to falling bathtubs, the jokes come fast and furious once the inevitable setup drags along.  Shelly Long is actually tolerable in this film as Hanks' fiancee, and look for a wonderful performance by Alexander Godunov (Die Hard), as Long's former love interest.  If you're looking for a good old-fashioned laugh more along the lines of The 'Burbs than Big, then give this one a shot.  The scene of Hanks trapped in the floor and screaming about Care Bears is worth the price of admission alone.
B00005A46T|4.0|This Album Was Good But The First One Damn That Album Was So Good Its Always Going To Be My Favorite.Iowa Was Good But The Last Song Iowa And The Song In The Middle Gently I Diddent Know What The Hell They Were On But Honestly SlipKnoT Is One Of The Best Band Ever Up There With Slayer And Soulfly And Sepultura Hatebreed Is Also A Great Band If You Like Heavy Music.
B00005JL2O|5.0|the first two austin powers movies were very funny, especially the first one. The second one was a good follow up but it just stole all the jokes from he first movie and slapped some themes on them. This third one is much diferent and much more funny than the first two though. Mini me, Dr. Evil, austin, his dad, and goldmember are all great characters, with tons of great lines and jokes. Beyonce is not to good as the new \\"powers girl\\" elizabeth hurley is the best out of the three of them, beyonce hardly plays a role in the movie and her only purpose is to scream out phrases like \\"SHAZAAM!\\" if you have an issue, heres a tissue, but this movie has very little. it's the best in this growing series
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is awesome. Incubus shows how much they have matured musicly. Under My Umbrella is my favorite song on the album. It is a good album to relax to. It is also very neutral meaning even my Momma enjoyed it and all she listens to is christian and country music. So two thumbs up or five stars or whatever.
0783226063|2.0|Fans of the book will not really like it, it doesn't even come close to holding it's own against the book, the movies a absolute mess compared to the book. So dune fans will find this film very very disapointing. And people who know nothing about dune whoa are just watching the film will find themselves asking &quot;what the? &quot; every minute of the movie. Alien had much better effects and that was made five years earlier, the shields look horrible, the ships look horrible, the combat looks horrible, and the acting and voices are laughable, I couldn't give it one star though cause I'm a big fan of the book
0790744759|5.0|If the United States survives all these mid-east termoil one of the most historic films that people will remember will be this wonderful MGM musical.The brilliant colors, termendious costumes, wonderful story line, sing-a-long  songs and great acting and Judy's very best all makes for one enchanting movie that can be watched over and over again.  This is Americana at it's very best.  It is ashame that we don't have these kinds of people in Hollywood anymore. Thank God for film.  It's wonderful that classics like this will never be forgotten.  Just wish AOL/Time Warner would hurry with the DVD.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album's title was chosen purposefully, believe it or not.  John Mayer knows where the music industry is in terms of its content, and realizes that it will only be the 'squares' (or people with actual musical taste) who will like his material.  This rules out cynics (like our beloved editor above who needs to be 'edified' with his music) and bubble-gum teenie boppers.  <br />I for one applaud John's efforts.  Unlike some people say, John's songwriting style is quite varied throughout the album.  Are you guys deaf or what?  If you want totally consistent songwriting, go listen to Tantric.  Then come back and listen to real music.  You'll see that John throws an intelligent mix of up-tempo anthems in with ballads and still manages to reach his audience by conveying concepts that each of us can relate to ('No Such Thing,' '83').  And I'm sorry that he can't write about anything except things that have happened to him, Mr. Rick Wright...  After all, what else would he know?  The only way to convey a thought effectively is to find the best way to relate the material; John chooses (very appropriately, I might add) to communicate to us through the vehicle of experience.  Maybe you would have preferred he speak on the difficulties of being a senior citizen... oh wait.  He's NEVER BEEN THERE.  Sorry.  My mistake.<br />Any guitar player that knows his pick from his pickup knows that John's got skills.  I myself am a fairly accomplished guitar player of 6 years and still find his music challenging to play.  One of the main things that I love about his style is the jazz chords.  In popular music nowadays, the extent of this you hear is maybe a minor 7 chord here and there to spice things up.  Listening to Room For Squares, I think I've heard the best conglomeration of dominant chords thrown together in a beautiful folk style that's accessible to everybody.  Outside of artists like Fiona Apple and Diana Krall (both of which are vocalists), I haven't heard this many jazz chords in a mainstream pop record.  Talent like this is rare... I know this because I work in a local recording studio and see the trash that comes in to record what they call music.  And just when I'm about to get discouraged about the future of music, an artist with comparable talent to John or better walks in the door, and my faith is renewed.  And anyone who dares call him a Dave wannabe is sadly mistaken.  In a world of imitations, this is one example of a man who is completely and utterly original, yet happens to have a similar voice to another great original artist.  <br />To sum this review up, I'd just like to say that everyone should stop listening for flaws with so much intent that you ruin the wonderful experience you could be having.  You're looking so hard for a reason to be disenchanted with the way music is nowadays, and there is good reason to think that; but instead of 'guilty until proven innocent,' why don't you give the new guys a chance?  You're never going to find that perfect musician you're looking for that will meet your expectations, so why don't you just sit back and enjoy the ones with a few flaws, just like the rest of us?<br />Oh, and by the way, I'm not a melodramatic teenage girl, and I still love this album.
B00000AFWW|5.0|The final word from Hole(sad to say)and probably their best hour. Covered in a glossy pop polish, the album still speaks to punk fans(I would hope)with a handful of tight, hard-rocking songs and Courtney Love's gutsy vocals. It's a head-swirling collage of tide-tossed, sunburnt images, rivalling some of the best rock of the 1990's. I don't see how you could find a more fantastic piece of hard-pop music than \\"Boys On the Radio\\"(which, in an earlier incarnation, was once called \\"Sugar Coma\\" with different lyrics). I can't get enough of this record and always want to share it with those who still remember what the essence of rock and roll is(and should be)all about. (**those seeking the Japanese bonus track \\"Best Sunday Dress\\", try searching out the CD-single of \\"Celebrity Skin\\" pressed in Australia. It's fairly easy to find in import bins or on-line and features \\"Best Sunday Dress\\" and the demo-version of \\"Dying\\" as extra cuts). A+
B00007E8O5|5.0|It's a real shame Road Runner Records refuses to promote one of the greatest guitarists of our time. Jerry Cantrell has come back with a vengence to put all of the Alice-in-Chains clones in their place, and he succeeds briliiantly with this masterful collection of heartfelt songs, breathing new life into rock. I bought this immediately after having previously purchased the first volume that came out earlier in the year, and I can say that the new set of songs is well worth the two-disc price.
B000002I2G|5.0|Every Doors album was an experiment, not just this one. (It just depends on your perceptions and whether your mind is open to differnt ideas). They're all different albums. They're all good too. Don't listen to anyone who says The Soft Parade is bad. Listen to it for yourself. You might be pleasantly surprised, like I was. Actually, this and Morrison Hotel are my favorite Doors albums. (They don't contain all the greatest songs, but being concept albums, they are my favorites.)<br />The concept of Soft Parade being loss of freedom, the burden of fame, and therefore searching for meaning, or &quot;something new&quot;. Jim seems really bummed on this album, but in an optimistic way, like he's looking ahead to the future....<br />It's a great album. Even if it doesn't have all the biggest &quot;hits&quot;, at least it's more cohesive than Waiting For The Sun or LA Woman.
6305972591|5.0|I first saw this movie at about age 8 or 9. It scared me to death. Even at 25 you wouldn't catch me anywhere near a corn field. The music is really creepy and adds to the overall feel of this movie. Other reviewers have said this movie was bad or that the short story was better. I am a HUGE Stephen King fan and have read almost all of his books. I HATED the short story and thought it was boring after seeing the movie version. I grew up watching scary movies and most of them don't scare me anymore. This one does and probably will for the rest of my life. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good scare.
B00007BH5C|5.0|This movie soundtrack stands as a work of art on its own, taking themes from the 2001 Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings and expanding, deepening, and blending them into different musical themes appropriate to the story line of The Two Towers.  Familiar tunes from FotR such as the hobbit theme, prologue themes, fellowship theme, Anduin river theme, Moria orc theme, and Lothlorien themes are a basis.  Mixed in are completely new melody lines and instruments -- for the Nordic-based Rohirrim, for the tree-shepherd Ents, and for Gollum, the creature who held the Ring for 500 years and still covets it.  This is a masterful mix, with powerful orchestration.  Several unusual instruments, including a Norwegian fiddle and wooden chimes, are used.  New vocalists such as a different boy soprano Ben Del Maestro and Emiliana Torrini are featured, as well as Elizabeth Fraser who sang the Lothlorien Lament for Gandalf in the Fellowship movie.<br />Since purchasing this CD, I haven't had it off either the car player or the computer CD.  It is wonderful, and immerses you into what will be the movie experience of The Two Towers.
B00006CXXU|5.0|christina has a voice that will &quot;stand the test of time&quot;. I am glad that she has teamed up with such great producers for her album.this album shows that she has very much matured. she is not one of those &quot;bubblegum&quot; teenager pop singers, she is very stylistic,in every way. I think this album is going to be a crossover album on all levels, and with that, I think that she will be among the superdivas (Aretha,Chaka,Whitney,and Mariah).
1572702486|3.0|Evil Under The Sun was the first Agatha Christie book that I have read.  I am not sure that I will read another one of her books or not.  The book did have a good plot, but it was rather slow moving.  It took approximately sixty pages for someone to die,which to me was a long time.  Before, Arlena Stewart Marshall was murdered, the book was a little confusing to me.  The book did, however become a little more interesting after the murder.  The best part about the book was the way the Hercule Poirot explained the murder.  He explained the exact movements of everyone who was involved with the murder.  Altogether I thought that it was a fairly good book despite some of it`s faults.
B000002A46|5.0|If you are into soul and gospel then this is your album.Although Mariah Carey has changed musically we will always have this cd.She wails like Mahalia Jackson and brings you to your knees.If Mariah Carey were to ever go full blown gospel she would bring people to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I was really excited when I heard that Rage was getting a new lead singer, because in my opinion Tom Morello is one of the most gifted guitar players out there. However I was throughly dissapointed with this album...to be blunt: Thank you, Chris Cornell, for absolutely ruining what used to be one of the best bands in music today. Cornell knows how to do two things: scream, and scream louder. He ruins any creativity that Rage used to have and lacks the versatility De la Rocha gave to the group. Audioslave's bassist and drummer are nothing special, and without De La Rocha throwing in his mix of funk and hip hop, Audioslave is simply Soundgarden part two, which doesn't appeal to me at all.
B00005JLWL|4.0|Is it the Matrix?  No, but it's close enough for now.  The film has great visuals and spectacular fight scenes.  It has it's slow parts but those just sucked me in because they took the time to let the characters discover things and let the audience pick up on it.  The movie deals with a society that uses drugs to eliminate emotions in order to prevent another world war.  Those that choose not to take their \\"dose\\" have a completely different approach to their environment.  It's a battle between the imposing government and the \\"feeling\\" rebels.  It's a very interesting film with an art film flair and plenty of great action.  Certainly worth seeing at least once.  I'll be checking it out a second time soon.
B00005RY7X|5.0|OK, a word of warning about this album.  Prepare yourself for some really happy, turbo-charged, rebellious kick-ya-in-the seat-of-the-pants punk/metal hybrid, REALLY heavy guitars accompanied by keyboards pounded kamikaze style, replete with some rude but mostly positive lyrics.  And most of the songs clock in at 2 to 3:15 minutes so they are a quick burst of adrenaline!  As Andrew WK loudly declares from the get-go, \\"IT'S TIME TO PARTY!\\"  Twelve anthemic songs with the loud, rough-voiced Andrew WK, and there are NO soft songs here.  I MEAN IT!!!  Use the following from \\"It's Time To Party\\" as a guide:  \\"Don't even try and deny it/'Cos you're gonna have a Party tonight/And you know we're gonna do it tonight/We're gonna lose it all/When you open your door!\\"  Ready?  Alrighty-then!<br />\\"Party Hard\\" is the ultimate party song with metal-up-your-you-know-what that exceeds that old time favourite, \\"Rock And Roll All Nite.\\"  The attitude's the same, except that it makes KISS sound like Savage Garden.  Come to think of it, Andrew WK makes Metallica sound like Savage Garden, but anyway... Remember these lyrics, you'll be screaming them soon:  \\"So let's get a party going (let's get a party going)/Now it's time to party and we'll party hard (party hard)/Let's get a party going (let's get a party going)/When it's time to party we will always party hard.\\"<br />\\"Girls Own Love\\" starts out with a piano before accompanied by drums then that familiar crunchy punk/metal sound.  This is more punk.  It acknowledges that the other sex has the monopoly on the rules of love.  I mean hey, they can take your heart and run it over with a steamroller.<br />Don't let that ditty from \\"Party Hard\\" fool you, because coming right after it, is a song whose key lyrics are:  \\"You better get ready to die/You better get ready to kill/You better get ready to run/Cause here we come/You better get ready to die!\\"  This guys really means it, but in a fun sort of way.<br />\\"Take It Off\\" continues the fun hyper-energetic romp.  The chorus of \\"Forever and ever\\" made me think that Andrew WK is a punk/metal version of Meat Loaf minus lots of pounds and chockfull of attitude.<br />The pounding stomp of \\"I Love NYC\\" is reminiscent of an AC-DC song, except AC-DC never had a swathe of synthesizers pounded along with the guitars.  <br />\\"She's So Beautiful\\" is probably the most extreme love song I've heard.   It's a close cousin to \\"Party Hard\\" rhythmically speaking.  It begins with a metal guitar, and then... BOOM!  It seems geared towards all those pinups, adult magazine models, and for me, the lovely singers I've had the pleasure to hear and movie stars I've seen on video and the silver screen.  So this song's for you, ladies.<br />\\"Party Til You Puke\\" is anarchy run wild, with these lyrics:  \\"We dent, We rob/We choke, We gun/We kill, We stab/We rob, We steal/Party 'til you puke...\\"  But how can one feel downright disturbed with the fun guitar/keyboards smashing its way into one's skull?<br />The rest of the songs?  \\"Fun Night\\" is the kind of song that might have worked well for KISS during their Asylum/Crazy Nights era.  Do I hear some teeth gnashing and makeup melting with envy?  \\"Got To Do It\\" has a stomping rhythm reminiscent of Generation X's \\"English Dream.\\"  And so on.<br />If GG Allin had traded in the hardcore misanthropy and directed that energy towards something positive (not that he shouldn't have sold out, he had to be himself, right?) and accepted some more polished punk up-the-YNW, he might have sounded like Andrew WK.  By the time you finish this album, you'll have shaken to it so hard, it'll be a while before you realize your head has been flung clear from your body.  It's THAT ENERGETIC!   Pores will be forced open, you will make the guys in ZZ Top as bald as Mr. Clean!  Heck, it even opened the eyes of an emotionally jaded cynic like me.  Definitely one of the albums of this year.  Now excuse me, it's time for me to crash exhausted to the ground and wakeup years later.
0380789019|4.0|This one combines the historical novel, an urban planners vision of London, romance, and the sci fi genre.  A life imagined underneath the London underground in modern Victorian times is really fun.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|It's hard to say if this is Bowie's best album, Ziggy and Alladin were more culturally significant and Low and Heroes ingenious and influential. It is however, my favourite Bowie album: everything (well almost everything) works incredibly well, lyrically poignant (sometimes even downright scary) catchy and poppy but still experimental JUST ENOUGH so something interesting is always going on, and AS FOR THE GUITAR WORK...best guitar work EVER on a bowie album, and it could almost make Hendrix jealous.<br />To me this is a flawless album, every song is unique and individual but somehow fits together cohesively. Obviously 'Ashes To Ashes' is a new wave masterpiece with BRILLIANT synth lines (and with a killer video clip.) It's No Game part 1 and 2 are weird, disjointed but wonderful (love the psychotic way the Japanese singer performs) and Scary Monsters and Scream Like a Baby are also stellar. Why wasn't 'Teenage Wildlife' a single?? Catchy as all hell and the second best track after 'Ashes.'<br />I think the closest track I come to disliking is 'Fashion' but that's just because I'm not a huge Funk fan. For what it does it does well though.<br />This album is faultless, experimental without becoming unlistenable, catchy, and lyrically Bowie is at the top of his game. If this isn't a good enough reason to have this album, I don't know what is.
0060989157|5.0|My only regret is how quickly I devoured this book.  It was like being a spider on the wall through the lives of these four men, their families and thousands of girls, girls, girls.  Back in high school in South Florida, I'd always heard rumors of one girl at school who had some *things* done to her backstage after a show by Tommy Lee, specifically.  It was one of those things that I'd dismissed as an elaboration, UNTIL I read The Dirt as a 32 year old.  The members of the band certainly were creative in their boredom.  I finished the book half in love with, half frightened of Nikki Sixx, sure that Vince isn't half the lover he continues to proclaim to be, reassured that Tommy Lee is the lovable freak he projects, and astonished that Mick Mars was able to contain his bodily pain so well for so long.  I hope it's not a joke that The Dirt will have a part 2...  I'll be first in line to buy it.  Someone said it really well in another review -- this book is not for the faint of heart.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 was on Last Call with Carson Daly a few weeks ago, and at that point, I had never heard of them. When they came on, the only thought in my mind was how much the lead singer looks like the lead singer of Train. But then they started playing, and they were a mix of old-school funk, new age rock, and a little Rx Bandits, being that it seems like every instrument in the band has the &quot;leading the band&quot; feel. It's a very dominant band, and an even more dominant CD. The effects are used at the right time, and the songs are some of the most well-written songs I've ever heard under or above ground. Maroon 5 may be too soft for some people... But if you truly want to hear great music that you really don't hear everyday, check out Maroon 5. I'll be looking for them on tour...
B00003CXCW|5.0|I have read a lot of informations and critical reviews about \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" but I have never seen this film until buying from amazon.com. This film is a real masterpiece. The cast, screenplay, scenes are magnificient and amazing. I recommend you to see this film with great feelings. This film is good as three beautiful films I have seen before. The first is Citizen Kane, the second is Rebecca and the third is \\"Sunset Boulevard\\".
6305313687|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the most riveting films that I have ever seen. Ed Norton, no slouch whatever his role, puts forth one of the finest roles he will ever play. Eerily believable, his twisted logic will at somepoint challenge even the most liberal of thinkers to question where their beliefs come from. Even if you are leary of buying this without seeing it go to the store and rent it. This is one of those movies that kids should see and discuss.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|The 8 Mile is a superb soundtrack album and should be in everyones CD case or collection. The album features talented artists and a variety of music which fits the movie on the spot. Eminem does a great job at arranging artists to do these tracks and I hope to see more of this out of Shady Records.<br />The album starts off with \\"Lose Yourself\\" which has probably been playing on each East Coast Radio station 100 times a day. This song has a great motivation meaning, the awesome beat, and lyrics make this song shine. Following up is \\"8 Mile\\", the almost equal to the previous track. The beat supplied for this song is interesting and creative and I liked it. The lyrics are excellent for the beat and the flow of the music also. \\"Run Rabbit Run\\" is a creative piece of work and has a smooth flow throughout, I loved this track just as much as 8 Mile and Lose Yourself because how Eminem is such far beyond a genius with his lyrics and meter ability. Following these tracks is \\"Places to Go\\" and \\"Wanksta\\" by 50 Cent. These tracks have addictive beats and lyrics and keeps wanting you to hear more from the talented artist. \\"Rap Game\\" is decent along with \\"R.A.K.I.M.\\". I know D12 has the talent to do better and I have never heard RAKIM before but I suprised with how fair the songs beat and words worked together. \\"8 Miles and Running\\" ft. Jay-Z and Freeway, the song seems to fit and actually works with Jay-Z's unusual lyrical beat, I was impressed by Freeway and think he did a better job ultimately. That's My Ni**a Fo' Real is a great song, it keeps me laughing and smiling everytime I play it. Xzibit's \\"Spitshine\\" is okay but to really hear what Xzibit's has in his pockets go check out his recent album (Eminem is on it!). Gang Starr does a great job with \\"Battle\\" and is another good track. But I really didn't listen to Macy Gray or Boomkat because they didn't fit in the whole soundtrack. The disappointing songs were \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" and \\"You Wanna Be Me\\". In \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" ishas a great beat but Obie Trice just screws it down the bumhole. And Nas just shows no talent in \\"You Wanna Be Me\\". Overall this album is worth the price and should be played out loud on your home or car speakers.
6304675348|4.0|Think about it.  If \\"Scream\\" were not made, you would never have been treated to \\"Scary Movie 2\\".  Just kidding.  While the above statement is true, There is no denying that this movie was influential.  Some would say that the teen slasher genre pretty much was over with \\"Halloween II\\" a long time ago, but people have liked these movies for over twenty years now, so good or bad, it's a subject matter that people are interested in.  <br />What \\"Scream\\" did was add new hipness to the slasher flick.  Two different characters in the movie make fun of the bimbos who literally \\"flash and die\\".  They are aware of the \\"rules\\" of the game, and as their pals are being run through the carving bar, they are able to analyze their role in the play, and make their moves to increase their own chances of survival.  <br />This was a brilliant move.  And Rose McGowan and Neve Campbell became a new breed of slasher movie actress.  I know this is all silly, but these movies have their own little world, and there really are rules.  These \\"new breed\\" actresses may still get chopped up, but darn it, they know why, which makes them liberated in my book :).  <br />It's a fun movie.  Enjoy.
0151008116|5.0|Yann Martel has come a long way since his first novel, &quot;Story of Keybab&quot;, and this shows through in this Booker Prize winning novel, &quot;Life of Pi&quot;. Comparisons to Ian Hennessy's masterpiece, &quot;A Tale of Chipps&quot;, are unwarranted, and though the opening chapter &quot;Meat and Potato&quot; will prompt some to recall the work of Robert Courvoisier, in particular his maiden opus &quot;Chikken in a Baskit&quot;, the following two chapters, &quot;Chicken and Mushroom&quot;, and &quot;Steak and Kidney&quot; will put pay to such shallow-minded ideas. There is little wrong with this novel, and I can't highly recommend it enough, although some will find the penultimate chapter &quot;Lamb and Peas&quot; a little hard to swallow.
B00004TCPJ|4.0|This is a performance of a well worn warhorse which Horowitz was uniqely associated with for half a century and more. It is an extremely idiosyncratic reading and full of special insights. The piano playing is not quite as specatcular as it was earlier in Horowitz's career but by any standard it is still remarkable.<br />Comparisons with others such as Ashkenazy, Argerich, Bolet and others is largely spurious. You should buy this disc for what it is... a special document of a performance that many thought would never happen, so late in Horowitz's career. This playing is as enthralling as it can be frustrating and that is the point. Horowitz was in transition from the the earlier fire eating virtuoso to the later more introverted and poetic man of the last decade of his life. <br />Shortly after this, following a less successful London performance and a pretty disastrous Japanese tour, he suffered a major mental and physical collapse. From that collapse he emerged a greatly changed musician as much in tune with Mozart and Haydn as with the great romantics. His fab fingers never failed him to the end.<br />Recording is not great but the piano sound is okay and fully conveys the electricty of Horowitz's playing. The orchestra under Ormandy, who collaborated with Rachmaninov himself, doesn't quite get the recorded balance it should which is a pity. It is such a shame that RCA and CBS made such a repeated hash of Horowitz's recordings throughout their associations with him. The sound is a lot better in its remastered version but it is no Sony or top drawer Decca.<br />The second sonata is a fabulous performance and fully demonstrates Horowitz's amazing ability to sing and voice the musical lines in an unparalleled way. Here is the famed independence of fingers and musical imagination that won him fans among his colleagues and infuriated so many critics over the years. This reading is also the result of a lifetime's experience and the drama is almost incredible. He made arecording in the late sixties of this sonata and in broad lines the conception is similar. The two are well worth having but this later one is, for me, more viscerally exciting. Some of the phrasing and voicing is very touching. Spliced from two concert performances, there are some sound mismatches but the resulting whole is very satisfactory.<br />Enjoy!!
0375414053|4.0|Normally when one hears the words \\"spoiled rotten\\" they think of children.  In this case, it's a working mom who can't figure out which way is the right way or right track to get on with her life.  In reality, hopefully most of us will  not endure or feel the need to indulge ourselves into such out of touch predicaments to find somewhat of a balance.  It's kind of a nutty book which has some truths.  It's a unusual read simply due to when it's all said and done, we wonder if is she better off by having gone through self filled misery.  In the real world, moms of all personalities and careers whine about everything that goes wrong and some of what doesn't.  To try and do what is right for yourself, home and family, regardless of if you work outside the home, read this book and then read a great self help book for real moms and balanced family life:  Mommy-CEO, Revised Edition, by family columnist Jodie Lynn.  I have heard both authors on NPR discussing motherhood and I must say they were both great contributors to moms but as the talk goes out to more and more stations, Lynn has more down to earth answers.
0553106635|5.0|I have to admit, I have a derelict and dusty box filled with the trilogies, quartets, and quintets of past, and I have yet to re-read any of them. They just don't feel right. But after reading the first novel in this series, I have read each book at least twice. Martin's multi-layered storytelling and full, dimensioned characters make you want to see what happens to them, and the plotlines are beautfully laid out, a serpentine structure that gets better as it slowly uncoils. In addition, martin knows how to keep an audience without the feeling of making the reader tired of reading. Jordan has nothing on this guy, and he never will.
B00005OAIE|5.0|When my friends and I bought tickets for John Mayer, we said hey this looks like a good time... little did we know that we would all have a new favorite artist after the evening. It was the best show I have been to, captivating the entire audience, for the whole time. I listen to the cd all the time and would suggest it to anyone who just enjoys an artist with a strong, unique voice, who can play a guitar incredibly, and writes with original, creative lyrics. This cd will definitely not be a waste of your money.
B00005JM09|1.0|Ever since \\"Terminator 2\\" was released in 1992, I've always loved that movie, I never liked the original one until I saw the second one; at that point it all fit into a very complex story combined with incredible action sequences.. it was (and still is) one of my favorite movie sets. I just recently heard about the third addition to the line of Terminator movies, and I was very enthusiastic at first, until I came online and found out some details about it.<BR>Firstly, without James Cameron directing it.. the film will certainly lose that classic quality it had in the previous two films. Oh, and about the female terminator... this is of course going to decrease the film's projected revenue. I'm not a sexist or anything, but the majority of people who enjoy the \\"Terminator\\" movies are men, and men don't like to see some broad kicking Arnold's [rear] - it's degrading to his \\"hero-legend\\" (although Schwarzenegger evidently doesn't seem to mind). My prediction for this movie is as follows: With the exception of eye-catching special effects, and of course Arnold killing people, it will more than likely consist of... total, and complete garbage.<BR>This movie will more than likely reduce the number of casting directors that will want Schwarzenegger to be in any other movies, therefore ending his career (well not entirely, but somewhat).
0399230033|5.0|My 23-month-old son loves this book.  We read it multiple times every night.  The illustrations are so cute and there is always something new to find (check out the neighbor's house each time the animals parade to and from the zookeeper's and what each animal keeps in its cage) and each little extra really adds to the narrative. If your child loves animals, like my son, I highly recommend this book. It's simple, but very well done.
B00003CXI1|5.0|If you value your Sanity, forget Buying this film, don't even watch it, if you do you'll regret it for the rest of your life. Last Christmas I made the mistake of seeing this film in the cinema, and now I'm hooked. I waited a few weeks to see the Philospher's Stone, and I just had to see The Chamber of secrets on its day of release as a result. I have since read all four books just to get my fix. There are three dates I am looking forward to in 2003:- The release of The 5th Book, the Release of the Chamber of Secrets on DVD/VHS and the release of the 3rd Film in the Cinema. Believe me when I tell you childrens films don't get any better than this (Except maybe Darby O'Gill and the Little People). It has it all, family humour and action that will keep everyone from the youngest, right up to Granny entertained for hours. So I only have one question left to ask, why are you still here and not in front of the TV watching possibly the best film in the last decade. Forget Lord of the Rings, Forget Starwars, this is Entertainment that only an all star British cast can provide!!
B00000I8UF|5.0|This is one of those cheerfully swinging recordings that, while never shallow, provide one with joy rather than gloominess or unrest. All the musicians are fully up to their tasks, playing wonderfully in ensemble form, driving (but not bullying) the music along in a very natural, dynamic fashion. Of course Blakey was one of the great pulsating, roaring drummers of jazz, and he is here heard to great advantage, as in the suite, and in e.g. \\"The Blues March\\", with its very exact title (it produces the blues allright, but in the form of a march). Tenor-player Benny Golson is not only a great soloist, but also a remarkable composer, and, for that matter, the tunes are all excellent. A record hard to fault even if one chose to be pedantic, but one does not feel the urge, because one is so irresistibly swept along by the verve and beauty of it all. - ...
B00000I07P|4.0|Take yourself back to the days when your hair was long and Rock was cool as only Bon Jovi know how (Stay away from his Pathetic solo albums though!)Slippery When Wet transformed Bon Jovi from minor-league wannabe rockers to global superstars like Def Leppard and G'N'R. On the back of hit singles \\"You Give Love a Bad Name,\\" \\"Never Say Goodbye,\\" and, of course, \\"Living on a Prayer\\" this album goes from strength to strength. From the scantily clad car-wash girls on the inner sleeve to the \\"You lost more than that in my back seat,\\" lyrics, the album is blissfully untouched by irony and subtlety, which actually adds to its charm. Slippery When Wet won't change your world, but it will, undoubtedly, rock it
B000002JSV|4.0|I've always been a big fan of a band's \\"black sheep\\" album - the one that never sells as much or gets as much airplay as it's commercially successful (read:slickly produced) brothers. I've always loved R.E.M.'s 'Fables of the Reconstruction' and Weezer's 'Pinkerton' probably because they were darker and not nearly as overplayed as some of their other albums. <br />'Powerage' has always been that album for me with AC/DC. You rarely, if ever, hear one of these tracks on the radio. And it's a damn shame! From the opening number, 'Rock n Roll Damnation' to the killer closer 'Kicked in the Teeth', this album rocks as hard as anything they recorded prior or since. <br />I always think of this album as the first in a trilogy that also includes their best:'Highway to Hell' and ultimately their most classic: 'Back in Black'. But without this one, I don't think the other two would have been possible. 'Gimme a Bullet' is pure rock/pop genius, which most certainly lead to 'Love Hungry Man' on the next album, and then finally evolved into their most commercial hit ever 'Shook Me All Night Long'.<br />The production is better than on anything previously released, and they seem to be playing with a real joy and understanding of good blues music, only turned up to 11. 'Down Payment Blues' has to be their most hidden gem ever! What a fantastic song! I've seen them live twice and always wished that they had played this one. <br />And then there's Bon's much-missed voice, lyrics and sense of humour. Although the subject-matter does seem a little darker on this record, it's his one-of-a-kind take on the world that gives the songs their added depth. And then the Young brothers are so in-synch with one another on this album, it's as if their guitars have melted together into one riff-producing monster....<br />Buy this album! For the sinister 'Sin City' and it's wild guitar solo, for the anthemic 'What's Next to the Moon?', and for the joy of discovering these amazing songs that will certainly never grow old on you!
0380977788|5.0|I saw this book at an airport and thought it looked interesting.  Boy is that an understatement.  Neil Gaiman takes the reader through a spooky, creepy world, even and especially for adults.  There is a great deal of commentary interwoven throughout the book on how we live our lives and raises questions about how we SHOULD live our lives, but doesn't give the answers.  There is so much symbolism in the book, yet it can be interpreted in many different ways.  I would recommend this book to anyone, and especially to book clubs or college classes that include contemporary fiction.  This is a work to buy and read over, and over, and over.
B000002U9W|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums to go unheard. I think it is more underrated than pink floyd's album \\"animals\\". Floyd fans are split into 2 groups with this one. Some love it, some hate it. I love this album. It has to be one of my favorites. The first song, AHM suite, is normally called, \\"annoying\\", \\"silly\\", \\"stupid\\". but they, forget one word-\\"AMAZING\\" from the country riff to start it off, to Gilmour's wonderful guitar work in the middle, and to the chorus parts. It is all good. The next song, \\"If\\" is a fun one. The lyrics are nice, and has a nice tune to it. next comes, \\"summer 68\\" this is my favorite song that Rick Wright sings. His voice takes you somewhere on this song. After that comes \\"Fat Old Sun\\". This is probably one of the most underrated Floyd songs. Lyricly, and musicly great. And one darn good guitar solo at the end, only makes it better. Finally, the album closes with \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" this is a fun one. Its not my favorite, but I like it. And alot of people do. In the end, this album is great. It makes me mad when people say its no good. I wouldnt say this would be good for fans that are new to floyd. They may not like it. but true die hard fans, would love this one.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|My son a music fanatic was 8 when he first heard this cd. Now we hear part of it at least once a day.<br />There is a simple reason why a now 9 year old would rather listen to this cd than any other. It is that in the field of Rock there have been many great music makers. None can compare with the Beatles.<br />If you judge by the quality of songs and music, no rock cd released in the last 10 years is more worthy of purchase. <br />Never equaled, never will be.

Sick of picking up a supposed \\"progressive\\" metal cd that just rips off Queensryche and is actually \\"regressive\\" to the eighties? Then you should try Symphony X, the new kings of neo classical metal. Try eighties Yngwie, then put a touch of Rush and Dream Theater and then you have Symphony X. Add stellar songwriting as well, and you have one of the best bands out there right now. All right, it isn't totally avant garde so it isn't \\"that\\" progressive like in a latter day King Crimson way, but it has enough elements to qualify. Simply put, they rule the roost right now. Perfect Dio esque singing, and awesome musicianship propel this band to the spotlight. Their 1997 opus Divine Wings of Tragedy probably qualifies as the best album to start with as it has a great variety of styles from queen derived soulful schorching metal stormers to middle ages fantasy tracks like \\"The Accolade\\". And Michael Romeo blows Yngwie's overblown self out of the water. Less sloppy and better riffs and songs all around. And he also qualifies as faster than Yngwie many times as well (trust me I'm trying to learn stuff from both). But that's just guitar speak, the music is a refreshing band to please all into neo classical progressive metal.
B00006L3LD|4.0|Hello:<br />It is not a mistery that Incubus' Morning View is an exellent piece of work, such as Make Yourself or S.C.I.E.N.C.E, still innovative and creative. Their music has evolved to better rythms and lyrics, and they still have a great variety of styles to play, not just common rock. Take, for example, the difference in style between Just a Phase and Have you Ever.<BR>The DVD is very limited. It includes the video of Are You In and a backstage that finishes with a live presentation of &quot;Warning&quot;. It also includes the discography of DVD's.
B000000OAA|5.0|Queen had already been in an area between Glam pomposity and Progressive grandeur, which a dose of hard rock and metal bombast by the time they released their third album, Sheer Heart Attack. This album put them on the top of the game, with an awesome splashing of melody power, and beauty that made them one of the best bands of the 70s and should have made them one of the most envied ones. The sheer range of the album goes from metal to ragtime and back. And anybody that considers songs like \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\", \\"Flick Of the Wrist\\", and \\"Brighton Rock\\" not heavy metal has got to be on DMT. Not that this matters really, it just seems they are not as appreciated as they should be in the heavy metal community, or even more in the progressive rock community for that matter. It should be saying if you're a fan of metal classical (I should correct myself and say Deep Purple were also one of the first to add classical to hard rock, though not to this extent) - or classical influenced prog - YOU MUST OWN THIS ALBUM!
B00005R1N3|5.0|Psycho (1960) is actually the first REAL slasher film, and was followed by superior and scarier slashers such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, BLACK CHRISTMAS, Halloween, The Boogeyman, The Fog, and Nightmare on Elm Street. This is VERY SCARY, and it is easily one of the all time scariest movies ever made! This is great. If you happen to find it, BUT or Rent it. WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is the best!! I love it!! All of the songs are great and Avril is a totally cool person. She does everything her own way and doesn't let anyone stand in the way of her dreams!

B00006CXXU|5.0|I've reviewed this before, but I didn't rate each song, so I thought I would do that now.  Here it goes:<BR><br /><BR>*Interludes don't really count so I won't rate them*<BR><br /><BR>Can't Hold Us Down: It took a loong time for this to grown on me but I find that I like it very much, even if I'm not a girl and it basically disses my gender. LOL. *4.5 Stars*<BR>Walk Away: This was immediately placed as my favorite song when I first heard the CD.  There was so much raw emotion that filled this 5 min+ song.  *5 stars*<BR>Fighter: I can't say that I'm a huge rock fan, but I know what I like.  This was a cool song with a new edge.  Good work.  *4.75 stars*<BR>Infatuation: This is a good song.  It's not bad.  I really like the part about \\"Getting lost in el ritmo...\\".  *4 stars*<BR>Loving Me For Me: This is a beauitful song.  It reminds me so much of Jill Scott.  It's nice and subtle and soul-ish. *5 Stars*<BR>Impossible: Xtina sounds like A. Keyes.  You can tell a song by A. Keyes from anywhere.  Good vocals and form.  *4.5 Stars*<BR>Underappreciated: uh...this is all right.  Not bad, but not very good either.  *3 stars*<BR>Beautiful: I liked it then, but now, since the video, I like it even more.  This is a beautiful song.  *5 stars*<BR>Make Over: This is NOT a bad song.   Rock edged.  Nice.  *4 stars*<BR>Cruz: I seriously did not like this song for a long time.  Now that I understand it, I think it's all right.  *4.5 stars*<BR>Soar: A nice ballad.  *4.25 stars*<BR>Get Mine Get Yours:  I loved this song from the very start.  I love how it's about casual sex.  It's a reality that exists but nobody is brave enough to write about it.  *5 stars*<BR>Dirrty: A nice song.  Screw everyone who prejudges her.  *4.5 stars*<BR>The Voice Within: An uplifting song.  *4.5 Stars*<BR>I'm OK: Deep and very intense.  *4 Stars*<BR>Keep on Singing My Song: Long, but beautiful.

B000066744|5.0|Wistful.  Subtle.  Nostalgic.  Moving.  Soul-stirring.  Fanciful.  Passionate.  Painful.  Beautiful.  Tragic.  Introspective.  Haunting.  Metaphorical.  Magical.  Musical.  Heart wrenching.  Mystical.  Majestic.  Fantastic.<br />I adored this movie.  There is something fantastic and appealing about the grand ocean liners, and this film uses that setting as its world.  The cast is superb, the images striking, and the story of the life of the main character is moving beyond words.  The scene as he is stepping off the ship to find a woman really tore at my soul.  The music, a vital component of the plot, is by the remarkable Ennio Morricone, who has been scoring hundreds of films over the past 40 years (including, for example, Wolf, Mission to Mars, Cinema Paradiso, La Cage Aux Folles, Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good the Bad and the Ugly, and Fistful of Dollars).<br />Like many other reviewers, I discovered this film by accident on television late one night in Paris.  I do not know why this film was not more popular, but there seems to be a growing cult of devotees.  This is a film to watch, share with friends, ponder, and watch again.
B00000IO4I|5.0|Exploring the life of a small community of individuals, we see everything -- the tawdry, the stomach-turning, the silly, the &quot;every day&quot;, the moving, and the truly magic.<br />Ms. Horrocks delivers one of the best performances I've seen, full-stop -- not only for her spot-on impressions, but for the nuances of her characterization throughout the film.  It's hard to say, at the end, if Elvie should be on the path to fame, should be simply left alone, or should be institutionalized...<br />Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine give great performances as wonderfully over-the-top, if at times a bit disturbing, individuals, and Ewan MacGregor deftly handles his role in the most internalized and understated performance I've seen from him.<br />I can't recommend this film highly enough.
B00003CX8V|5.0|This movie is an amazing movie. I just saw it yesterday and I must say that this is now one of my favorite movies of all time. This is a timeless tale of love, romance, and wrong desisions. Billy Wilder has done an amazing job with this movie and it is his best in my opinion. Though Sunset Boulevard was excellent, this is better. Many plants and payoffs that work to the greatest effect, timeless lines that come from that golden age of movies, and pretty visuals make this movie great. Also, an astounding performance by Jack Lemmon! I had never seen one of earlier movies when he was younger and now I wish I had! In sight of his recent death and also Billy Wilder's recent death, I also think this is a commemorative movie that they made together. This movie is also known as being Cameron Crowe's favorite film and is known to be shown in History of Film classes for film students for it's impecable excellence. A must own for any film lover.
0446677450|5.0|this book really helped change my outlook on money. it is a wonderful book to get you started thinking about your own financial future.
B000067J1H|2.0|This film wants us to believe its blood and gore and crass Hollywood commercialism is a clever, rebellious attack on the materialism and triviality of the numbing boredom of bourgeois consumerism. Yeah, right. The haute-middle class producers, directors and actors must have laughed all the way to the bank. After all, the producers and actors get to rake in the big bucks and buy their very bourgeois mansions and Jaguars -- while by now a bored, rootless crossection of adolescent males has probably lost eyes or teeth in their attempt to be cool like their screen &quot;heroes.&quot;<br />This film is nothing but the usual Hollywood attempt to cash in on the male market's infinite capacity to queue up to view blood and guts. It is especially galling that this film tries to mask its blatant pandering to the lowest common denominator with a patina of intellectual Freudian imagery in an attempt to impart a high tone to its crass commercialism.  Shortly into the movie it was clear to anyone who has read Freud that Brad Pitt was Norton's alter ego. Too bad the director didn't make the female character also a figment of Norton's imagination -- and have his id (Pitt) and his superego (Helen) battle for mastery of Norton's destructive, puerile soul. At least that might have introduced some higher level themes and might have palliated the gratuitous violence of this dreadful Hollywood exercise in &quot;show me the blood and I'll show you the money.&quot;
B00005OAIE|2.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I do agree with the many people who feel that John Mayer is a true talent.  His songwriting proves that he is capable of having a decent career and he is a good guitar player, to boot. Having said that, one can't help but feel let down by this debut album.<br />On \\"Room For Squares,\\" mayer paints an image of himself being the man up against the odds. The outcast. The one alone at the lunch table. One feels a non-conformist sentiment to his lyrics- a sort of listener-friendly anti-establishment anthem through songs like \\"No Such Thing.\\" This is a bold thing to do. Elvis Costello did it in the 1970's, at the beginning of his career. The difference is, Costello embodied that sentiment with his intense, guitar driven rhythms and his neurotic, edgy look. Mayer's watered-down music seems to cater directly to the very people he's trying to stay away from. There are just as many teenagers and early twentysomethings clad in flannel and denim at a John Mayer concert as there are at Abercrombie & Fitch.  It's sad that a young singer/songwriter with such potential is reduced, probably by his record label, to play the part of NSnync to Dave Matthews Backstreet Boys.<br />In interviews, Mayer talks of being caught at a difficult crossroads by being in his mid-twenties. He refers to it  as a \\"quarter-life\\" crisis. It's this sort of desperately-trying-to-be-humble attitude that hovers over this album. Here is a young man who, at a very young age, has already seen more money than most of us and is singing the blues about it. It's as though he carries a handbook on how to write quasi-deep and thought- provoking lyrics in his back pocket.<br />Have some fun, John! Enjoy your stardom! Your life is great! It was even good when you were righting this album cause you knew you had a record contract! Quit your complaining! Quit sounding like some starving musician playing at a coffee shop in Greenwich Village!<br />Write some songs about travelling the world and shacking up with groupies! Write a song about waking up in some hotel in the furthest corner of the globe after a nasty bender! Something! Anything! Just no more of this self-righteous, shameless attempt at modesty. Even U2's Bono learned this doesn't work!<br />Many praise the straightforwardness and stripped-down sound of his music. But is something really praiseworthy if it is so basic and derivitive?<br />Critics and youngsters alike are quick to hail Mayer as the pick of the current crop of young songwriters and as somebody who will become a major songwriter of the future.  This album fails to prove that.  To hear a truly talented singer/songwriter who is both passionate and innovative (and far more unique), listen to David Gray.  Though he too can't help but be a tad derivative , Gray's music is at least bolder, more provocative, and more genuinely touching than Mayer's.<br />As for Mayer, one hopes that he will lose the boring, stripped-down Dave Matthews-esque act and opt for something sincere and thrilling with his next album. I'm sure he has it in him.rld and shacking up with groupies! Write a song about waking up in some hotel in the furthest corner of the globe after a nasty bender! Something! Anything!

B000063UR2|4.0|This movie is great it is a great movie for kids I watched it when I was a kid to make thwm brave and I am very brave. It is also a great entertainer for adults because it is an action movie and a love movie and a suspense movie al rolled into one. I would reommend that kids Watch the movie Labyrinth before this that is a great move to.

Now i think i understand that this is a cd of unrealsed stuff?  Even with it, its great, and i just love the cd.  Best songs: A.D.D, I-E-A-I-A-I-O, Mr. Jack, Boom, and Chik N Stew.  If you dont like this cd, there is SURRIOUSLY something wrong with you.
0380788624|5.0|If you have the faintest tolerance for technology as a plot tool (e.g. Clancy) and enjoy entering an authors's world construct that is exciting, impossible to predict and imaginative, then you will like this book.  Think of it as a gritty pulse-pounding and technological world but as fascinating as Harry Potter's. The author does not assume the reader is an incompetent and that is a lot of fun.  Everybody I know of consequence in the world of high tech, advanced communication and encryption has read this books and is enthusiastic.  The entire workforce of a government agency in Maryland appears to have read this book. It is a really &quot;in&quot; book and it astounds me how the author learned enough to cover the territory he does so effortlessly.

This book was the first bio I read about marilyn, but since that time, I discovered  others, better. <br />As a great fan, I suggest  \\" enquete sur un assassinat\\" by don wolfe. I dont know what's the title in english...its the continuation of the biography of anthony Summers. Two great books,  and you can feel the last moments of the star, and understand the conspiracy, with official documents , autopsy reports...read it, you will beleive.
B00001MXXH|5.0|I strongly disagree with the editor's comments that this DVD has somehow lost its lustre over time.  I was four years old when this movie was released, and my sister was one.  We are both in college now, and we sat down to watch this DVD together for the first time yesterday, and Jesus, I have no idea how we let so much time pass before discovering it.  It was hilarious; I'm talking squirt-milk-out-your-nose hilarious.  John Hughes's film perfectly captures the high school desire to be free of all the rules and restricions that are imposed upon you and experience life.  For anyone who has even the remotest memory of this time in their life, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a must-see, a timeless classic.   ...And for those of you who love great cinema, this is not just a great comedy, but an influential piece of filmmaking.  Keep your eyes open for the use of 1) actors talking directly to the audience, 2) static camera angles and 3) pop music as a driver for plot movement.  All three are pure genius, and still echo in the work of modern masters like Wes Anderson.  If you don't own Bueller, or god forbid, you've never seen it, go out and pick up this DVD ASAP.
B00005N915|4.0|A Faustian spin through post-war New York and Louisiana, 'Angel Heart' tells a very old story from a surprisingly original and wonderfully chilling angle. The plot, focusing on an increasingly violent missing person's case, is reasonably simple, but the backstory which triggers it is remarkably complex. When you reassemble the pieces at the end it does make sense, but only just. De Niro is superb as Louis Cyphre, the 'businessman' with some collateral to collect, infusing the role with just the right balance of sardonic humour and demonic threat. Mickey Rourke gives what will probably always be his best performance as Harry Angel, a shell-shocked war veteran and disheveled P.I. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Charlotte Rampling as an occultist, and Lisa Bonet as a teen voodoo witch. But the real star here is writer/director Alan Parker. He has an extraordinary talent for the simple but powerfully unsettling image: a slow zoom on the exterior wall of a New York hotel; a New Year's Eve crowd in Times Square; a descending elevator; a sweeping stair; the rotating blades of a fan. These images are simple, cold, yet positively brimming with hellish menace. Trevor Jones's music is the perfect accompaniment, its saxophones careening wildly over menacing rhythms and the ubiquitous throb of a beating heart. It's a thoroughly disturbing marriage which will have fear closing around you with the same grim certainty as the protagonist's fate.
B00003CWL6|1.0|Anytime a movie fails, people call it a dark comedy, because it couldn't succeed in making its audience either frightened, sad or laugh. Not that there aren't genuine black or dark comedies out there (see Psycho--the real version), but a handy catch phrase for failed movie is \\"dark\\". This movie is such. It didn't start out to be a dark comedy- it started out to be a heavy-handed,schlocky symbolistic drama with light moments. It failed on both counts. It can't do anything but try at pretention. Kevin Spacey should have his SAG card revoked for this.<BR>     Also, every film student and his repressive mother goes nuts about the cinematography in this piece, so let me dispell their joy right now. Go watch a 1950's sitcom-- Ozzie and Harriet works best, because thats where the direct inspriation comes from, but any one with a white picket fence. Now colorize it. Now make the color red articifically stand out a lot, through playing with tint. There. You have the exact visuals of American Beauty--an ironic look at the cookie cutter 1950's family updated to modern day. How freaking original. Maybe next they'll tell us that the French are Facist racist intellectual elites or Italians are underworld kingpins or Jews are oppressed, kind-hearted wise men. I swear, if this movie could fit those one-dimensional revisionist history stereotypes into its story, it would. It just got caught somewhere between loading up an SUV and putting its characters into family therapy.<BR>    After watching this movie, one has the distinct urge to enforce Annette Benning to move to Antartica and Meni Suvari to sign a pact never, ever to talk or get within fifty feet of a camera again.
B000002G7G|5.0|I've been going backwards in time with The Velvet Underground. I first purchased their swan song \\"Loaded\\" (which has a few classic songs and a few cheesy ones as well), then I got this CD--their self-titled 3rd album--which is a lot better than \\"Loaded\\". This album is subdued, thoughtful, melancholy and quiet without the pandering to Middle America that diluted the quality of the aforementioned \\"Loaded\\". FYI: I have yet to listen to \\"White Light/White Heat\\" or The Banana Album.<br />While \\"The Velvet Underground\\" lacks the poppie kitsch of \\"Sweet Jane\\" or \\"Rock N' Roll\\", taken as a whole the songs on this CD are much stronger. \\"Candy Says\\" and \\"Jesus\\" are two of the most beautiful songs Lou Reed ever wrote. \\"I'm Set Free\\" and \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" are absolutely haunting, while \\"Beginning to See the Light\\" and \\"What Goes On\\" are solid rockers. Plus, drummer Maureen Tucker's cute, off-key vocals on \\"After Hours\\" are truly a treat. VU's only misstep is \\"The Murder Mystery\\"--a dated, pretentious 9 minute foray into the avant garde. Thankfully, with today's technology you can skip through it.<br />Furthermore, if winning the (fleeting) approval of that tattooed, multi-pierced weirdo clerk at the record store means anything to you (assuming you refuse to shop at Amazon.com), buying \\"The Velvet Underground\\" will probably win your square self some karma points with the hip, painted, and penniless.
B00003CWL6|2.0|American Beauty is a solid movie. Let's just say that from the start. The film is an airtight ship; no leaks or seaweed are inside, and it cruises nicely from one harbor to the next. But with that said, the obsequious nature of critics and filmgoers alike to this movie would be hilarious if not downright depressing. Ultimately, this is the \\"Modern life is unfulfilling\\" argument stacked in the same room as the \\"we should all get along and be politically correct and more left\\" argument. Not that this is wrong or poorly played; but it is not original or originally done. Whats worse, every character falls into the stereotypical roles we would expect to be assigned in this drama. First, the \\"unfulfilling aspect\\". Spacey's career is meaningless; Suvari's life is an empty hull; Benning's misery is compounded by her materialistic world. All the characters act movie-type correctly (Suvari realizes her own emptiness and is hurt by it; Benning has a nervous breakdown; Spacey breaks away from his job and begins \\"living!\\", meaning he works out and desires sex (always, in Hollywood, a good thing)). The only character who breaks out of this is Benning's, whose self-abuse inside the unsold house speaks of a character depth beyond all others, but due to poor editing, script choices, and Benning's own failed acting skills, she is forgotten. Spacey retreads his monotone, boring ranting skills throughout much, but at least he is believable and, if he doesn't take any risks, at least he doesn't screw up a free lunch. However, the \\"politcally correct\\" part invades the rest of the movie to cheapen it further. The gay men are the most sane. The man who hates gays is secretly gay himself. Oh yes, and we shouldn't have sex with someone of a different age, because \\"its just wrong\\". These leftist politically correct values pollute the scenery around the steretypes we watch control the drama. Ultimately, this elitist strike against suburbia is ok, but is forgettable and certainly not \\"incredible\\". Rather, it is mundane. Some may trumpet this, with its British directing and writing, as a blow to American cinema, but I think it fits nicely in with every other tirade against middle America Hollywood produces--it is a most Hollywood of movies.
B00003CXI0|5.0|A truly fun,enchanting film.I have never read the books but the film is great.Harry Potter,the son of a wizard,is left with his evil rellies at birth,after an evil sorcerer kills both of Harry's parents.Only when HP is eleven years old does he discover that he has magical powers,when goaded into anger by his jerk of a cousin.Soon Harry is boarding Platform nine and three quarters and setting off on the Hogwart Express to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft.On the train he meets two other children who are also magical,named Hermione and Roy.I think it was Roy,I can't remember.He swore alot.Once at Hogwarts,Harry,Hermione and Roy must get their hands on the shiny stone that will cause havoc in the hands of that evil guy who knocked off his parents.To do this they must play a dangerous live chess game AND make it past the giant,vicious three-headed dog named Fluffy.(Yes,..Fluffy).There are people who have condemned this movie,due to religion,because of the witchcraft involved.I've been brought up religious but I know that those people are wrong.Harry Potter fights against evil and is always true to good,even when his life is threatened otherwise.He is an empowering character and a terrific role-model for children.
B000000JO3|5.0|.some people think that punk rock start getting bored in early 80's.but at that time were alot of good bands like bad religion or fugazi.......and maybe one of the greatest is minor threat.....and this album specially is one of the greatest punk gems of all times ..........and mayne operation ivy and stuff......you gotta listen to straight edge.....that some years later was covered by NOFX.........this is a pretty heavy album....cuz have most of their early wax recordings and more......you gotta buy it and stop listening to preppie garbage....if you know what I mean
0151008116|5.0|I'm amazed at the scathing criticism I've read here.   This book doesn't deserve it .  Forget about the awards, just read the story and take the time to imagine the scenes in detail, remember that this is a tale, a tale of survival from someone with a different tradition of story telling.  Consider the interesting side trips on zoo-keeping and animals and the search for meaning through religion.  Above all, remember your geometry -- pi is the circumference of ANY circle divided by its diameter, a non-terminating never repeating decimal that is classified by mathematicians as irrational and transcendental but NOT mystical.  Pi is more than just a nickname here.
B00003CXXP|3.0|The Good Things<br />*Very nifty, imaginative special effects.<br />*Some strong imagery and motifs.<br />*Storyline, strange though it is, is fascinating.  I love the last 30 minutes; I've always wondered what would happen if alien archeologists visited Earth...<br />*The characters are all right.  It is interesting to see how the main character starts as an inhuman robot and gradually morphs into an emotional being.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*All of the fairy-tale paralellisms are a little weird (but could also be a good thing, depending on what you think).<br />*Very long and slow-moving.<br /><br />It's strange, but emotional and thought-provoking.  Fans of sci-fi and Spielburg should check this out at least once.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This is one of the best dvds - I can watch it over and over. Cameron Crowe's commentary with his mom is too funny - listening to her recall some of the scenes in the movie from her actual life makes Frances McDormand's performance all the better.<BR>A must have for any rock and roll faithful.

B0000640VO|5.0|I find it difficult to believe that not one person has written a review for this movie. So I shall try to do my very best. This movie simply oozes charm. I bought it on a lark, and not a few positive words from others. And well, because Audrey Tautou looks cute on the cover. I'd seen a few bits of it here and there, and decided why not. I am glad that I did too, because it's marvelous.<br />  This is a quirky movie, and in that way that we Americans will never be able to reproduce. All we do is remake them, and they're typically saccharine sweet at best. We seem to excel at war movies, and depressing stories that crush the spirit of the viewer. And those are good too, but there's only so much one can take before they need a movie like this to soothe their soul. And here we have the French to thank for something other than blowing up a greenpeace ship. Not that I don't whole-heartedly appreciate that. <br />  The story is about a girl who spent her childhood starved of affection from her neurotic, but well meaning parents. Mom dies in a bizarre suicide attempt by a Quebec exchange student involving Notre Dame, gravity, and a little bit of screaming. It has almost no bearing on the plot other than to dispose of the mother, and thus add a dimension of grief to the father, who builds her a shrine of odds and ends; to include a (seemingly) nomadic garden gnome. She works at a café with more \\"interesting\\" people, who have their own little stories, but they are little indeed. She's unlucky in love, thus far, and in life she's so shy that her world consists of working, visiting her bereaved father, and isolating herself in her apartment, where she spies on a curious neighbor who has painted the same Renoir every year for the last twenty years. He also suffers from a genetic condition that predisposes him to suffering broken bones with great ease. Similar to Samuel L's character in that horrible movie Unbreakable, but here it's actually believable.  Everything changes whenshe hears on the TV that Princess Di has been killed, thus she drops the lid from the bottle in her hand, thus it rolls off and knocks loose a wall tile in her bathroom (how's that for contrived?). Hidden behind is a dust covered rusty tin with some small child's treasures concealed within. She decides to reunite the tin with it's now quite grown up owner, and if she is successful, she will spend the rest of her life trying to reunite other miserable people with some form happiness. It sounds sweet, but only through some small cleverness on the part of the writer can it possibly succeed. Thankfully, it does, begging me to wonder if this movie could possibly ever been made in the States...<br />  All of this takes place, and more, with the backdrop of a Paris that does not really exist. The colours are bright, the streets clean, the people amiable. But the photography is outstanding, and helps the movie along in that effortless way we all like to see. Amelie is not all sweet though, as she sees fit to avenge the small crimes of one of the movies myriad of characters. It's all quite harmless, as is the movie, which makes it such a delight to watch. Like eating tiramisu, in a hot bath (I guess). This is definitely a good movie for guys to rent if their lady is coming over, and should yield some form of passion (though I take no responsibility for that comment). Excellent movie for anyone not afraid to read subtitles.
0060989157|5.0|This is actually a far far better read, and more appealling to general readers than you might think. I bought this for my Sister and when it arrived just had to have a little peak inside. Two days later, I am looking for another copy to get her.<br />I normally dont read this kind of thing, but once I started into it I could not put it down.<br />As a story of rock and roll excess, and the metal scene of the '80's and 90's this is interesting enough. From the background of the band at school and home, to the rise to sell out arenas, that makes a pretty interesting read. The Human drama, and raw honesty o fthe book is incredible and makes it very hard to put down. There is an inevitable amount of ego stroking, but the underlying human stories here are quite incredible. The part where Tommy Lee describes going to jail, where Vince Neil lost his young daughter to cancer are compelling.<br />Even if you are not a dedicated fan of Motley Crue, and just have a passing interest in there music, I think you will find this a most rewarding read.<br />Highly recommended.<BR>Grade: A+
0316666343|2.0|I had heard how great this book was, but it was unable to keep with my expectations.  Maybe I was in more in the mood for a light-hearted feel good book when I started, but I just did not find it as wonderful as others talked about.  I do think the vantage of a girl from heaven telling the store was cleaver, but the store beyond that did not keep my attention. I found it highly predictable.
1570629706|2.0|Honestly, I did not like this story. Thier is not much wrong with the general theme of the story, but plenty, I feel, in the way it is told. Its a tell-all-book that refuses to show anything to the reader. This book falls into the very bland and dragging read category, or vbadrc for short :). But what do I know.
B0000029DD|5.0|This is probably one of the most amazing albums i have ever heard. i wish it were longer because every time i listened to it i am surprised when it ends. jeff buckley carries so much emotion in his voice that i can almost feel what he is feeling myself. stylistically and technically the songs on this CD and their arangement are flawless. it will be one of the best 15 bucks you ever spend. personally i can't imagine anyone who wouldn't love it no matter what style of music they listened to.
B000002SE0|5.0|This is an historical recording of Turandot  and maybe the best to find. Why? Beacause of its expression that seems so right for this demanding opera. Too often we hear the duet between Turandot and Calaf  where she totaly dominates or they sing it beautiful together. But here it`s different; Nilsson and Corelli sing against each other with enormous power! And in my opinion it`s how it should be done. Scotto as Liu is also very beautiful. <BR>This version may not have the most beautiful sound, may not have the most beautiful Nessun dorma, if you`re comparing with other versions, BUT it has an icy Turandat and a powerful Calaf  who`s her equal and believes in the Victory!<BR>Go for it!!!
B00005QDW1|5.0|There is not a bad song on this CD!  And the band, the way they play, sounds as good in their own right as Gwen Stefani's recognizable voice.  It's the way you know when a band meshes in their own unique way -  and it's very good.  This is fun music.  Sometimes I was reminded of the Cars.  You'll end up wanting to dance. Steady rock.
B00005JLWL|4.0|For being the one of few who actually went and saw this movie I was very pleased. Christian Bale can always pull off a mysterious and deteremined persona with his dark and piercing eyes. The film in itself is a sweet side note to the glamour effects of The Matrix. Rather a good plot and story line with a good twist as well. There is a bit of suspense for movie goers as they watch their hero unfold emotional but find calm in the action packed fighting sequences in which our hero, Bale, faces unbelievable odds. Fighting styles are very creative and fresh so dont expect just a bunch of random jumping and shooting or karate. Expect a mix of samuari discipline combined with artist precision. Overall It rocked!
0800129806|5.0|This is one of the best movies Hollywood ever put out, not for the love story but for the good against evil! The phrases and prayers said, the lack of sorcery, witchcraft, profanity, and nudity make this movie great! I have never seen King Arther cast in such a good light, basically as a God-fearing Christian man, a true leader! Hollywood meant this to be a love affair story, but the love story takes second place over the fight of good against evil! Everyone was cast perfectly, the scenery beautiful, and the plot believeable. One of the great phrases comes from King Arthur and sums up what this awesome movie is about,\\"There is a peace ONLY to be found on the other side of war\\"!! I would rate this a 10 if I could!
0553573403|1.0|There are several reasons I read fantasy books, including the general leaning toward light that most exhibit, and therefore the fostering of insights they provide.  Another is because there seems to have been an unwritten rule among all of the fantasy writers I have read to date, that no graphic sex, vulgar words, or \\"super\\" graphic violence will be used in their story telling.  I had not read any of Mr. Martin's books, but bought the entire trilogy with these assumptions in mind.  But now we apparently have \\"mature,\\" \\"adult\\" fantasy!  Within the first 60 pages of \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" there is, among other things, the use of the \\"F\\" word several times, a graphic description of a decapitation with a 7 year old boy being brought to the event (he is later shoved out the window of an upper story castle room to become horribly crippled because he witnessed a graphically described incestual encounter between two adults), constant talk of whores and infidelity, graphic descriptions of several incestual relationships, and the graphic description of the \\"wedding\\" night of a man and his 13 year old bride!  I went no further.  This experience has not only caused me to write George Martin off my list of authors to read, but has stopped my romp through fantasy books in general.  I am very disappointed!
0385503954|4.0|McEwan is a writer capable of searing novels (\\"Enduring Love\\") and much slighter productions (\\"Amsterdam\\" - won the Booker prize, but it's not clear why).<br />\\"Atonement\\" belongs to the former category and is his best work to date. It is a complex book, beautifully observed and written. The early passages describe a world not far from the one I grew up in -- the writing is impeccably accurate and wholly believable. The appalling mistake made by a young woman is the keystone to the novel, which, for me, is about unintended consequences, and alternative outcomes. The novel moves on to the British expeditionary force's retreat to Dunkirk in the early stages of World War II -- certainly, the nadir of british fortune at the time. Again the writing is pitch-perfect and you are absorbed by the general sense of helplessness, though it's fair to point out that what started as a rout became the foundation upon which Churchill built for the rest of the war, at least psychologically.<br />Then McEwan starts to play with reality: did his protagonist die in the retreat or did he live? Did he reconnect with his former girl-friend, and for that matter, with his accuser who did him great harm? What really happened, and what is simple imagination? The puzzle this represents to this reader at least is enthralling and engaging to an unusual degree.<br />The resolution at the end of the novel offers an explanation that seems on the surface both logical and satisfying. But there is enough of a question left for the reader to turn the book over in the mind for weeks afterwards.<br />Italo Calvino has the same mischievous delight in moving the reader around from preconception to alternative explanations as does McEwan in this wholly satisfactory novel, that does however leave a faint thread of confusion. I await his next with great enthusiasm.
6305064490|5.0|How can a man go from be happy to misable? But it can happen. George Bailey starts life as happy boy turning itno man, and was around to save to save his 8 years old brother from drowing but then causing him to lose hearing in one ear. As a 12 year old he works in a drug store for kind of a gumpy man (H.B. Warner). The movie starts with some people in a town called Bedfordfalls praying to god to help George Bailey (James Stewart). Which leads us to see a couple of talking things that are supposed to be god and angles (and angles in training). Then we got a flashback of George's life as a 12 years old boy in 1919. When he saves his brother Harry. Then we see him becoming a man who knows what he wants to do tommrrow, the next day and the next year, he wants to leave the little town and see the world. Which he learn from when he tells that his girlfriend Mary Hatch (Donna Reed). After he breaks a window at this big house.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This recording is a fitting tribute to Elvis on the 25th anniversary of his death. Even for purists this is a great compilation. This has proven to be a # 1 album for 4 weeks in a row. For anyone who thought Elvis couldn't sing, take a listen to 'It's Now Or Never'. Most of his biggest hits are here on this 31 song disc. Kudos to the engineer who remastered this set - even the song 'Too Much' has been cleaned up considerably. I have several older copies if this song - all with a burst of volume near the ending. LONG LIVE THE KING.
B0000029GA|4.0|I'm out for dead presidents to represent me!\\" this is common thought for hip-hop artists these days but when it was first recorded, who could have predicted that it would be so true? In 1994 Nasir Jones (aka Nas) made a debut album at the age of 20. The album employed the most influential producers of that time and arguably ever. Though this is far from being a new album, the reason I feel compelled to review it is that it is simply too good not to. It is the quintessential hip-hop album that true fans should study. It is representative of a time when hip-hop was at its creative zenith, where production and lyrics were equal. Though only 10 tracks deep (short by today's standards) it is enough to fill your head with street imagery and the essence of what living in New York is about. It is a shame that the brilliance ended here - Nas transformed into Nas Escobar and consequently killed his talent and potential as the one of the greatest mc's.
B0000640VO|5.0|Think a &quot;happy&quot; &quot;City of Lost Children&quot; and you have this film. The film is still way off kilter but in a very fun way. A light and sweet film with an imaginative look.
B00005AQGH|5.0|I have been privileged to be a 2Pac fan for only four years, and it seems not a day goes by where, just when I think I can consider myself a \\"true fan\\" of 2Pac, something else is either thrown out or I stumble upon something that tells me that I am nowhere near as \\"true\\" of a fan as I was.<br />After buying this CD, however, I had never felt more strongly about this.  Anyone who calls themselves a 2Pac fan cannot be without this album.  Before I had heard this, I had considered All Eyez On Me to be one of the best albums that I had ever heard, and yet and still there were several flaws I could point out on that album, namely the overabundance of guest-stars and the sense that 2Pac had changed his style too abruptly from his \\"Pre-Death-Row\\" days.<br />But all those fears are quelled on this album, by far the most flawless and comprehensive album I have had the honor of hearing.  Comprehensive, in the sense that 2Pac has thrown elements of everything into this album.  With the party banger \\"Toss It Up,\\" there is a song you can move to, something 2Pac seemed to master on All Eyez On Me.  With songs such as \\"Against All Odds\\" and \\"Bomb First,\\" 2Pac's scathing disses are kept alive and well.  <br />However, this album has a lot more of what \\"All Eyez...\\" lacked...for one, there are more songs that deal with societal issues, something that Tupac was the master of before All Eyez on Me, where it seemed as if this was thrown into the back burner for the \\"Gangsta Image\\" he had to don.  \\"White Man'z World,\\" \\"Hold Ya Head,\\" and \\"Krazy\\" all signal that 2Pac will never put commercial \\"gangsta\\" over what made him famous in the first place, his raps about the world's problems.  <br />But the other thing that this album has that cannot be found on any other rap album is the general sense of bizarreness, weirdness, and oddness...not in a bad way at all, but intriguing, by creating the sense of eerieness that is complemented by the fact that this album was his last to be completed during his life, and the first to be released after his death...songs such as \\"Hail Mary,\\" with its eerie beats (and video!!!), \\"Blasphemy,\\" with creepy altered Biblical verses, and \\"Me and My Girlfriend,\\" the now-overly [imitated] rap about his \\"girlfriend.\\"  Also, on the cover 'Pac is posing as Christ on the cover, ironically 2 months after his death...<br />Only God knows what 2Pac would have produced if his future albums were like this or better.  I can honestly say that anything that is released now has to be everything that 2Pac decided to NOT release during his lifetime, the only reason it is being released is so that Suge/Afeni get some $ and we as fans get new 'Pac.  But unless he is alive, fans must realize that although this was the last of 2Pac, the 7 day theory is a treasure that gives us 2Pac at the height of his abilities, at his most flawless, something that no compilation of unreleased works will ever be able to match...
B00005JKJA|1.0|I absolutely hated this movie.  This rambling, pointless, incoherent piece of garbage wasted 147 minutes of my life.  At no point did this movie attempt to tell a coherent story.  If you haven't seen this movie, you already know more about it than you will after you have watched it.  Mulholland Drive is a well-acted, well-directed, and well-filmed drug induced hallucination.  If you like a movie that tells a story, or at least tries to make some sort of sense, stay away from this one.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Do you not realize that a lot of older movies weren't filmed in the widescreen trend that most modern moview are filmed in? This dvd presents Sunset Boulevard in it's original aspect ratio with amazing clarity, so there's reason to complain.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This DVD has EVERY Slipknot music video , including the RARE Wait And Bleed Animated Video, and the live performances are awesome , they get close ups of everyone, theres alot of songs, and plus there a Sid solo, and a Joey solo, and in between the live footage, they show the group getting ready before the concert, and theres so much more great stuff that would take to long to explain.
B000065V3M|5.0|When I heard about this movie being made I thought 'are they nuts?'. Ed Wood NEVER made a good movie in his life, so how could they make a good movie about his life. Well, they did not make a good movie, they made a Brilliant movie. The writing, directing and acting are magnificent. This movie is a laugh riot, border line farce you would think, till you understand THAT WAS Wood!! Yet the movie mines deep pulling no punches, but at the same time reaching into your heart. Depp shows he is one of the best actors of today, Martin Landau demonstrate in his later years just was a true craftsman he is. His Lugosi is dead on target without being one thimble full of OTT. He is funny, sharp and makes you feel so much for the sad actor that faced this bitter end.<br />Just brilliant!!
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore's Fellowship of the Ring score was a revelation. Who knew that the composer of The Game and The Cell had such a mastery of the leitmotif approach to scoring? FOTR of the ring left us with fully fleshed out themes (the Ring theme, the Fellowship theme, the Hobbit theme, the Riders March, the Isengard march, the Lorien theme) and haunting motifs (Arwen's motif, Aniron, Gandalf's lament, the 'Moth' theme, the betrayal theme, Gollum's theme). The Two Towers offers both revised presentations of the old and a stunning collection of new material.<br />Of the old, the Ring theme opens the album in a bold statement, followed by Goldenthal-like strings that take us back into the percussion and male choir of the Moria episode of FOTR. In \\"The Forbidden Pool\\", the Ring theme is most deftly developed, intertwined with Gollum's motif for the moment in the film that corresponds to the Henneth Annun segment of the novel. Also of note is the renewed Fellowship theme, which opens \\"The Uruk Hai\\" in grand style and proclaims the peak of the Riddermark charge in \\"Forth Eorlingas\\". The Isengard March (Shore's answer to Williams' Empire March) is twisted and turned into a charge for Gandalf in \\"The White Rider\\" (hear the opening!) and in \\"Isengard Unleashed\\", the brass is amazingly low. There are many other reprises of the old material, my favourite being the reappearance of, of all things, the 'Moth' motif in \\"Isengard Unleashed\\".<br />Of the new, there is the theme of the Riddermark, stated frequently in a number of tracks (\\"The King of the Golden Hall\\", \\"Riders of Rohan\\", \\"Hornburg\\"), and memorably played for the Hardinger by Dermot Crehan. A lovely theme for woodwinds appears in the second half of \\"The White Rider\\", reappearing in \\"The Hornburg\\". And then there are the action motifs: a minute into \\"Forth Eorlingas\\" will have you out of your seat! Not to mention the action motifs unveiled in \\"Helms Deep\\", which are heavy on percussion.<br />It's a triumph for Shore and hiscollaborators. Darker in overall feel and denser in orchestration that its predecessor, if either were conceivably possible. Kudos to the role call of vocalists: Isabel Baykradian (on \\"Evenstar\\", my favourite track), Sheila Chandra (\\"Breath of Life\\"), Elizabeth Fraser (thankyou Ms Fraser for the opening of \\"Isengard Unleashed\\", it's good to have you back for another score), Hilary Summers (\\"Farewell to Lorien\\"), Ben Del Maestro (\\"Forth Eorlingas\\" and \\"Isengard Unleashed\\") and of course... Emilliana Torrini. Collectively they give Enya a run for her money (and collectively probably cost less as well). <br />\\"Gollum's Song\\" song is rich and duplicitous, as much a song for Gollum as for men in general and all who can be corrupted by the Ring. It's a perfect answer thematically to Enya's \\"May it be\\", which praised Frodo's incorruptability. I suspect, after \\"The Two Towers\\", that incorruptibility will be brought into question.<br />And here's to Howard Shore's incorruptibility. May it be The Return of the King completes the most powerful series of film scores since, well, you know what trilogy I was going to say.
B000075BFK|3.0|I am a huge Tupac fan and I respect his words, beliefs, and most importantly his legacy.  His performance on this CD is wonderful, and like any material from Tupac, all you have to do is really hear him and you just can't help but to believe in him and what he says.  It's like that on Better Dayz, his \\"new\\" album.  My problems stem from something else.<BR>I simply can't shell out money for this.  What Better Dayz boils down to is a small group of people behind the scenes simultaneously ruining 2pac's legacy and making money off of him while he's dead.  \\"Late Night\\" and \\"Who do U Believe In?\\" have already been publicly released and any 2pac already has heard \\"When we Ride on our Enemies\\" and \\"Ghetto Star\\" a hundred times by now.  And that's what it really boils down to.  A record company is re-releasing these tracks and throwing in numerous remixes just so that they can make more money.<BR>Look closer at the tracklist.  A song with Nas' name on it???  Are you kidding me?  If 2pac was alive, there would be no way he would do a song with Nas, rather he would probably be releasing new material blasting his styles.  Thankfully the rumor that Jay-Z was going to be on \\"Better Dayz\\" was not true, but why would they even rumor that?  Pac blasted Jay even more than Nas, and they almost put him on Pac's new CD???  It's outrageous how much they're [messing] up his legacy.  A song with Tyrese???  I don't think so...<br />It's stuff like this that just can't make me buy this CD.  Sure \\"Thugz Mansion\\" and other songs are great, but there's all kinds of re-released songs and remixes that simply cause me to think about how people are simply commercializing his stuff so that they can make more money.  God, I love the new stuff, but I refuse to enrichen those who ruin someone's legacy just to make a quick buck...

B000000W6R|5.0|Pisces Iscariot is as Smashing Pumpkins as Mellon Collie. But needless to say, this is the &quot;underground&quot; album by them. No videos were put out for this album, and no &quot;hits&quot; are on this album, minus of course the &quot;Landslide&quot; cover Billy does. I found this album on the street in 1995. I've been listening to it since. Definately worth listening to. It's a roller coaster of a album. Some songs to sleep by, some songs to HEAVILY rock by. One of the most perfect albums ever. And not many know about it. It's like Weezer's Pinkerton in some ways, if your a weezer fan.
B000050IE6|5.0|What can i say? One of the best metal albums ever written! Combining the amazing expertise of legends such as Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Camel and many more prog acts along with death metal, this provides the most amazing and unique blend of contemporary metal i have heard! Dont be fooled by the slow, long and echoing intro to album opener \\"The Moor\\". It soon enters an amzing acoustic melody and finally the band come in, and what an intro it is! Thundering double bass drumming alongside fierce and melodic riffing and then come the vocals. At first it may seem like you've just foun another slightly hyped up death metal band, but Mikeal Akerfeld's amzing vocal melodies soonkick in providing a sticking melodic chorus. After 11 and a half minutes of utter jaw dropping perfection that is \\"The Moor\\", and into the fierce but melodic \\"Godhead's Lament\\". For those not familiar with ancient Roman literature, this album's theme is based upon the character of Homer from Roman History. The album is based on the story of Homer leaving his homeland for some sort of religious reason... and when he returns it seems he is not wanted. the people of his land dont want him back, and his wife - Melinda - has left him for another husband/s. The Moor it would seem is about his departure, and the next 4 or 5 songs about his arrival and the betrayal that faces him. In the final masterpiece of this album - White Cluster - the story of his execution is told, and what better song than a prog/death metal work of art. It is hard to depict a favourite for this album realy! The Amazing musianship and riffing of \\"the moor\\", the strong melodies of \\"Godhead's Lament\\", the quite but effective \\"benighted\\", the strong heavy riffing and vocals of \\"moonlapse Vertigo\\", and here is a major highlight of the album! \\"Melinda's face may start out as a slow mellow acoustic bueaty, but it soon breaks into one of the most catchy and amzing riffs ive ever heard. If Opeth carry on producing works like this - as shownon the 2 most recent master pieces \\"Blackwater Park\\" and \\"Deliverance\\" - then they could become almost as important as Black Sabbath, the greats of the entire genre known as Metal! Recommended 4 any fan of prog, melodic death metal, black Metal or just any budding fello Sabbath fans out there!   1 million out of ten i would say!

Another funny moment was when Allen(woody) was on a first date with a sex addicted woman and when allen jumps on her  (after she's explained that people should have sex as often a possible) pushes him off and says \\"what do you take me for?\\"accually writing this review made me reconsiter ill give this one a 4
B0000640VO|5.0|You can almost smell Paris in this beautiful, rich and fun film. Amelie is a lonely girl who grows into a quiet adult - whose life is small and neat - but whose past has been somewhat fraught and misunderstood. A chance event sends her life spinning off into a parallel existence - one in which she realises she can quietly do good for other people without seeking reward - and it also helps her find love.<BR>Now that is the barebones of the story - but it in no way actually manages to capture how wonderful this film is. It is sweet, shoulder-shruggingly gallic film - where everything is open to gentle ridicule from the argumentative old house-wives to the nature of Ameilie's mothers' death. (killed by a woman falling from a Cathedral). As Amelie tries to organise true love she realises that this is the one thing you cannot organise - for if you help it along it will not necessarily turn out  - and you cannot avoid it if it is meant to be. <br />I didn't think I would like this film at all. I thought it would be meaningful and poignant and have long lingering silences and then try to carry it off by having a gamine heroine for the lead. Well it has the Hepburn-esque heroine, but the movie is just a joy from start to finish. LIght, refreshing and one I will happily watch again.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This album makes you remember Harrison at its best. It has the same level of &quot;All things must pass&quot;. It combines incredible well that era with the &quot;Cloud 9&quot; album and the Travelling Wilburys records. It is a must for Beatle / Harrison fans. God bless him.
B00006V9A0|4.0|While i give this CD 4 stars, i think it is more than that.  While it may not have the extras like many people, and me wanted, maybe that can be a next time abulm.  I enjoy the fact that i basicly know have all my faviorte songs on one CD of Nirvana.  If anything that to me saes time switching back and forth between albulms.  If anything i recomend this Cd for that factor alone.  And by the way, i agree with all of the people that &quot;You know you're right&quot; is a great song and deserves to be on this albulm.

B00005ATQE|4.0|This movie came the closest of all movies to the experience I had in Marine Corps Bootcamp. Their Senior Drill Instructor was much like my own. I had many of the same experiences as those in the movie: the drill instructors putting you to bed (every night), footlockers thrown all over the floor, blanket parties, recruits caught with contraban like Pvt. Pile's doughnut. My own experience seemed more intense maybe because the total focus of the movie was only on their senior drill instructor and nothing on the other 2, and having 3 months of bootcamp vs. their 2.<br />All scenes were believable - I think drill instructors have to memorize all the same sayings in drill instructor training. The only part I found unreal is the end of this section of the movie. I believe his D.I to be a combat vet with all his ribbons. Pile would have been on his face and off to Leavenworth before he knew it.<br />The movie is broken in half (2 movies in one). The second half is the continuing story in Vietnam. The mood of the second half of the film is as bizarre as the first half. Not a family movie.
B00007BHOE|3.0|I recently bought this dvd and many reviews says the concert dvd rocks, it was okay but nothing can compare the sheer magnatude of actually being in the concert and the mosh pit itself.I was fortunate enough to go and see six slipknot concerts and nothing beats the ear smashing,heart ripping sound of a live concert that slipknot delivers..sure the concert in london on the dvd was okay but it cannot live or surpass the actual sound and feeling of going to an actual live slipknot concert. The dvd is okay for fans that don't have a chance or will never have a chance to see slipknot live in the flesh.
B00003CXFU|5.0|This movie isn't just well-acted, it's truly inspiring.  For disgruntled lawyers, this one allows you to go back and remember that you really can help real people.<br />Ms. Brockovich, irrespective of her brash nature and unique wardrobe, used her tenacity to accomplish something truly remarkable.  It's important not just that the story be brought to light because of the fraud perpetuated on these poor residents of the California desert, but also to remind us that in fact, one person can make a difference.<br />Julia Roberts really turned into this character, and did a great job of portraying a woman who so desperately wants to do the best she can for both her family and her clients.  Her Oscar was truly deserved!
B000001FFJ|5.0|It has been said that Britain may have spawned the Beatles and 90% of all other great musicians of our era, but that America makes up for it by having Tom Waits.  Listen to this album and you might start to see why.<br />I am admittedly a fan of the &quot;middle&quot; period of Waits' career.  I find his early work interesting because it shows him trying to find his personal &quot;voice&quot;--a songwriting idiom that works for him.  Waits began his career by writing mostly formulaic love songs with a blues edge or wistful melodies sung alone with solo-piano accompaniment.  Then, with &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot; and &quot;Frank's Wild Years&quot; Waits was beginning to find his voice.  Here, he finally found it.<br />First of all, this album is most consistent in placing three of Waits' constant themes in almost every song:  rain, whiskey, and trains.  Almost any image you can conjure up featuring those three things is probably found in a Waits song somewhere.  The songs on this album also display a variety of subject matter sometimes lacking on Waits albums.  There are uptempo, upbeat songs, humorous short ditties that sound like nursery rhymes, and a lot of what Waits does best:  songs with a catchy tempo or a hum-along chorus that you can hear over and over and then realize they're simultaneously the saddest and most haunting songs you've ever heard.  Songs on this album which fit this description are &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;, &quot;Downtown Train&quot; (shame on you if you thought that was a Rod Stewart original!), and &quot;Hang Down Your Head&quot;.<br />Tom's next album, &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, comes close to the lyrical virtousity and perfect blend of musical skill and eccentricity displayed here.  Since then he has tried many different directions with his music and his latest two albums show that he is on the verge of making another masterpiece like this one any day now.  Don't get me wrong, his latest work is a hundred times better than anything else out there today, but &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; is definitely the place to start.else out there today, but &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; is definitely the place to start.
B00005JKTF|4.0|During the World War II Charlotte Gray travels to Scotland where she meets the love of her life who is a Royal Air Force pilot.  Her beloved is then transferred to fly raids over France and Germany.  Meanwhile, she is recruited by the British Secret Service to serve as a courier.  When she finds out that her loved one is shot down in France she seeks an opportunity to go to France on a mission with the notion of hopefully helping save her dearest.  When she lands in France she quickly faces the facts of war and is forced to learn how to adapt or perish.  Charlotte Gray is a cinematic experience that plays with themes of hope and despair and it leaves the audience pondering both.
0060934913|4.0|This is a good read on the insider's guide to how a kitchen is run and how grueling being a chef can be.  I enjoyed Tony's views and &quot;punk&quot; attitude to being a chef.  I finished this book this summer and need to read the 2nd one.
6303379214|3.0|This definitely isn't motion picture at its best.  However, Marisa Tomei always turns in a lovable, humorous performance, as she does here.  She's locked in a fun female bonding trip, one that makes her companion's husband realize he's been neglecting his wife, while at the same time allowing Ms. Tomei to romp around Italy engaging in adventures while she looks for her soulmate.<br />I did feel a bit betrayed as the film resolved the &quot;soulmate&quot; issue, which I won't give away here.  All in all, it's worth seeing once, just for fun.
0060975768|5.0|Easily the best Vietnam War book written.  Probably the most personal account of battle from the perspective of the individual soldier.  Hal Moore and Joe Galloway avoid the temptation to add to the politics of this war and simply write a stunning, frightening, inspiring story of common men fighting for each other and their own survival.  Beyond the striking descriptions of close battle, this book provides an interesting perspective of how the Army adopted the use of helicopters as air cavalry and air mobile operations.  I'm a career military officer and avid military history reader and haven't found another book like it - I routinely recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel battle in all its elements.  In my top 5 all time best military history books.  If you like this book, read \\"With the Old Breed\\" about the Marines in WWII Pacific.
B00005JKL8|4.0|Lt. Chris Burnett is a bored Navy pilot that has requested release from the Navy, since the Navy never provided an opportunity for him to feel worthwhile.  As a consequence he and his co-pilot are put on a holiday routine recognizance assignment while he is waiting for the paper work to process.  During the flight, they stumble on activity within a demilitarized zone, which they check out after some persuasion by Burnett.  This leads to a missile chase that ends with them being shot down behind enemy lines.  Behind Enemy Lines offers suspense from the beginning to the end, which can cause mild fatigue of the viewer due to constant alertness.

6304044836|4.0|This movie isn't the best, I'll be completely up front.  Julia Ormond is just completely lacking of charm, and if you've seen the original, it comes across even more plainly.  However - it really is a fun film with witty dialogue that I find watching over and over despite its problems.  <br />The banter and camaraderie of the house servants, as well as the sharp wit of Linus and Mrs. Larabee, provide a humorous and entertaining aspect that makes this film worth owning for a rainy day.
B00006NSGX|5.0|I first saw this performance on TV.  It's absolutely amazing for starters.  Secondly, Clapton has some of the most amazing &quot;backup&quot; musicians I have ever heard assembled for this show.  A must buy if you are a fan of Clapton or even simply great live music!

B00005JKCH|3.0|it always amazes me how a movie studio can spend millions of dollars on a film and miss on so many levels.  despite the hype and box office sucess of this film, it falls far short in terms of an artistic statement.  it is obviously packaged for general audiences and like so many other productions of our time, this movie caters to the whims of our children at the expense of adults.  this is NOT spiderman but spider-BOY.  tobey maguire is much too short and boyish to portray a superhero MAN.  he is barely taller than his co-star kirstin dunst and if anyone should get an oscar, it's her for pretending to love him.  he is like every spoiled yuppie geek u might come across during business hours or catch playing hackysack at some state college campus.  i cant believe that HE was the best one for the role.  NO WAY JOSE!  on top of that his acting is dull and stoic.  there is barely a vibe of adrenaline to be found anywhere in this film.  i didnt feel inspired to get behind one of my favorite comic book heroes whom i've loved for years.  and as a fan of the serial, i feel jipped.  the spider bite scene, which is  supposed to be the turning point in the life of this character is passe and forgetful.  i have other issues as well with this film.  i think with better casting(notably maguire), and a more inspiring directorial vision, this story could've been a five star movie, instead, it's just another cgi moneygrabber.

0385508417|4.0|Having never read any of John Grisham's works, I had no idea what to expect when I picked up Skipping Christmas.  I had reservations at first because I doubted that Grisham could separate himself from a writing style more appropriate for his best selling law dramas and write a light and brief Christmas piece.  However, I found this book to be surprisingly enjoyable and very easy to read.<br /> Luther Krank, the protagonist of the story, is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge of the 21st century.  He tallies up his family's spending from the previous Christmas and finds that $6100 of his money was drained with very few lasting benefits evident now, a year later.  When Luther's daughter, a Peace Corp volunteer in Peru, informs her family that she will not be returning for Christmas, Luther sees an opportunity to evade the dreaded hustle and bustle of the holiday he despises.  Luther books a 10-day cruise for him and his wife.  The Kranks become targets to their incredibly jolly and spirited neighbors who pressure the couple to conform to the neighborhood standards.<br /> Readers can laugh at the humor in the Kranks' situation and at Grisham's satire. He makes fun of the whirlwind of frenzy that settles over America every December.  This novel is mean to be read for pleasure.  If you are looking for well-developed plot and characters, this may not be the book for you. It is brief (I read it in one night) and light and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Skipping Christmas is a perfect story for anyone wishing to curl up by the fire and take a break from the Christmas rush.

B000075BFK|4.0|This is a great CD. How is 2Pac still making music? He is an amazing artist.
B000006OHL|5.0|I first became aware of American composer Bernard Herrmann's movie music in 1958 at age nine when I saw \\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\\" on the big screen. I was in awe of the great Ray Harry hausen special effects and the movie music, also, added great excitement to the scenes. At age fourteen I saw another Ray Harryhausen movie with a music score by Bernard Herrmann. Again, Herrmann's music added excitement to the scenes in the movie. Herrmann's music touches me emotionally. That's what I want. I want to feel the music. I didn't see Taxi Driver in 1976 when I was twenty-seven years old. After the publicity of the assassination attempt of President Reagan, the newspapers reported the assassin was inspired by watching the movie \\"Taxi Driver.\\" I rented the video in 1981 or 1982. The movie is a disturbing account of a New York City cab driver slowly entering into madness. Again, Bernard Herrmann's music added the ingredients that capture Robert DeNiro's character moving into the world of madness. I am a music composer myself using my computer to write original music and Bernard Herrmann is one of the major movie music composers who is a major influence for me. I rented the DVD Collector's Edition of \\"Taxi Driver\\" and I enjoyed the \\"Making of Documentary of Taxi Driver\\" which was made in 1999. I can write without a doubt that I am glad that director Martin Scorsese seeked Bernard Herrmann and that the late Bernard Herrmann accepted writing the music score after reading the script to \\"Taxi Driver.\\"
B00005NTN5|5.0|Hilarious, sexy, and definitely witty...this movie has great style that's surely lacking in most cinema features today. Jennifer Tilly is the perfect mob moll with more brains than you think. Gina Gershon is the foil with a plan.
6305205620|1.0|Metallica died in '89.  This DVD [is bad]. Anyone who really likes this band would regret wasting their time on it. Luckily I was givin a free copy so I didn't waste [money] on it. Stay away from this. If you want to see a great metallica video get cliff'em all.
1400031354|5.0|What a delight -- to find a new author! This book serves up an African cozy -- a heart-felt book about a world the author clearly loves and admires. The heroine owns a detective agency in Botswwana and, as the book opens, has become engaged to a kind gentleman who owns an auto repair garage. Just how kind is he? Well, let's say this book shows us warm-hearted generosity without descending into maudlin sentiment.<br />The mystery itself -- what happened to a young American who disappeared ten years ago -- allows the author to maintain suspense. We genuinely care about the crime and we observe the heroine's search for a solution. At the same time, the detective agency gets involved in a more routine &quot;who's cheating on who&quot; marital case. While the ending is not a satisfying solution to a problem, the handling of both cases demonstrates the heroine's talent for combining compassion with justice.<br />Books in exotic settings often don't work, but this one does -- splendidly. I am reminded of both M.C. Beaton series -- Hamish McBeth and Agatha Raisin -- but this book actually has less of an &quot;edge&quot; and the humor is more subtle.  Tears of the Giraffe goes beyond cozy into a sub-genre of the &quot;gentle&quot; book -- not a tear-jerker and always respectful of the characters and setting.
0385508417|3.0|I found this book to be mundane.  I kept waiting for something exciting  to happen - that's the only way I got through the entire book.  Thank goodness it was short - I didn't waste a whole lot of time.
6304083769|4.0|One of the inspirations for &quot;The Matrix,&quot; this anime cyberpunk classic has all of the anime elements needed to make a cool movie. The plot is as weird and odd as any in the genre and much of it is very confusing. But the film doesn't need to rely on plot to be completely awesome. We get a cool chase scene, some gunfights, and a final showdown between the heroine and a giant robot that's too exciting to miss. &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; is the ultimite treat for the anime fan.
B0000584V3|5.0|Blackwater park is one of Opeths best works and some of the best out there.  Opeths lengthy songs take you through many emotions.  It can switch from crushing death metal to softly played acoustic guitars and crooning vocals.  Blackwater Park Has a similar sound to early shadows fall (one of the few bands i like better than opeth).  The musicianship is very solid and the backround often changes to keep things interesting in their 10+ minute songs.  On more thing, mikeal <BR>akerfeldt has one of the most brutal death screams in the world.
B00003CWTI|4.0|What do I have in common with God?  Apparently, in PT Anderson's world, a steel bond made of the ugliest chain one could ever see.  I liked this movie and found it very interesting.  I'm still unable to decide if the frog thing was a copout.  Does anyone know if he intended to end the movie like that, or if he had the idea but was unsure how to bring it all together.  It was interesting anyhow.  Why, however, would God care for all these dispicable people who can only come to grip with reality when frogs fall from the sky.  Can humans come together only if we know there is something watching us?  Otherwise are we self loathing specimen?  Is that the point?
0783217048|4.0|The premise of \\"Too Wong Foo\\" is very simple: three drag queens, the soft-hearted Vida (Patrick Swayze), the no-nonsense Noxeema (Wesley Snipes), and the dreamy, romantic Chi-Chi (John Leguizamo), travel across the country in a vintage Cadillac which breaks down in the tiny, idyllic rural town of Snydersville. Beneath its classic American small town facade, however, Snydersville is a place rent by domestic violence, alcoholism, racism, depression, and thuggery. Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi encourage the town's women to take control of their own lives, not through any particular magic, but by simply reaching out with compassion to their fellow human beings--Vida to the abused Carol Ann (Stockard Channing), Noxeema to the depressed, mute Clara, and Chi-Chi to the young Bobby Lee. The themes of the movie--that only women who have found their inner strength (and men who are in touch with their feminine side) can change society for the better and that ultimately beauty is not a luxury, but a necessity that can get you through the dark hours--give this film a surprisingly feminist outlook.  All three actors--men best known for their macho roles--give strong performances and although John Leguizamo makes the most convincing woman, both Wesley Snipes and Patrick Swayze are very believable. I became so accustomed to thinking of them as women that it was a shock to me when Vida's wig accidentally came off and she was revealed as a man. \\"To Wong Foo\\" has been repeatedly compared with \\"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\\", but the two movies could not be more dissimilar. \\"Priscilla\\" is grittier, deliberately not glamorous and less thematically tied together. Although I liked the film overall, I was displeased by its demeaning portrayal of women throughout the movie. I do recommend both movies, but don't expect them to be mirror images of each other. \\"To Wong Foo\\" is the one most suited for a family audience. \\"Priscilla\\" has a great deal of profanity, sexual innuendo, and a very casualattitude to drunkness and drugs.
B000002BPS|5.0|I think it sounds alot like Smash, so if you like Smash, you will like this one.  &quot;Gone Away&quot; (played on 99.1 WHFS and 97.9 WIYY) is what spurred me to get this CD, and it's great.  I really wish I would have been listening to this genre when it started....  Oh well, I am now :)
0385508417|4.0|Not your typical Grisham novel, but a very CUTE story.  Funny and endearing and it'd never happen in real life this way, which is why we read anyway, isn't it ... to escape real life for a little while!
0679746048|5.0|While the movie gets lost somewhere in the midst of big name actresses and the urge be historically accurate, the book cuts a path though the dark forests of mental illness. Susanna's memior is formatted as several short essays, not chronological, and therefore is able to communicate beyond the actual words the changes in mind and memory. This is a beautiful book.<br />This book challenges assumptions commonly held by juxposition of concrete images and anticdotes.  Who decides one is crazy? How can a fallible being decide? Why are some ideas deemed inappropriate, thus thoughts of a crazy person, when everyday sees even more outragous ideas put into place everyday by leaders or celebrities.     <br />Reading this book was a revelation that other people have the same thoughts, doubts, and fears as I do. I was assured with the realization that there is life beyond mental illness. Life doesn't stop, but you can still be part of it.  I recommend the title &quot;The Magic Daughter&quot; in addition to this one.
B000002AGE|5.0|Gosh when I got this LP of Weather Report,this was the<BR>breakthrough of all breakthroughs of jazz fusion. I had read a review in this review section, and one person's wife said Wayne Shorter sounded like John Klemmer and Jaco a \\"run if the mill\\"bass player. I am sorry you must be beginner jazz listeners!!! When I was attending NTSU in Denton,Tx. This is all the students were trying to imitate. Especially Jaco's rip roaring \\"Teen Town\\". Everybody in the school \\"pulled their frets\\"(Jaco plays a fretless bass)Wonderfull ballads such as \\"A Remark you Made\\".The hit ofcourse was \\"Birdland\\",but even this song was played by everyone from Manhaten Transfer to Maynard Ferguson. This whole album was a musical explosion!It gave way to other fusion artists to gave them the freedom they needed! So dont give this audience and readers that this album was \\"lame\\". In its first couple of weeks of sales(I worked in a record store,getting my Jazz degree),it went to gold in a matter of a month. The musicians ,you could not find better musicians!!! John<BR>Klemmer,had the most lame musicians and would put me to sleep!<BR>So you people that have never heard of this band and were<BR>wondering,this is the CD to buy!!! Listen to different textures<BR>in the music,Jaco's bass,sounds like its talking to you ,Shorter<BR>sax,well this man goes way back in doing jazz,JoeZawinul,<BR>wrote \\"mercy,mercy\\" in his \\" hey day\\" in the 60's. Songs<BR>like Havona,a true example of expression and quality in the pure<BR>sense. With Jaco's \\"Teen Town\\",you bassist out there,try to<BR>write this out ,then play it. Thats what my instructor of<BR>theory class senior year wanted me to do at my college.<BR>I am sorry, but some of these writers of doing a review,some<BR>are really good in telling you history or what to listen to,<BR>but it chaps my_______, when someone says this band is lame.<BR>Go get and enjoy the different tunes on this CD! You other guys are all wrong!!!!

B00003CXI1|4.0|I guess almost everybody has seen the movie, so I'll stick to the DVD review only.<BR>A beatifully packed DVD. When I opened the DVD pack, for a minute I did nothing but admire the DVD cover.<BR>The second DVD is full of stuff for kids. As for me, it was a little below expectation. I expected stuff like interview with JK Rowlings, making of the movie, etc. But there is nothing much for the grown-ups. The only thing I found interesting were the deleted scenes. But they are not easily accesible. You have put in your harry knowlege to reach the deleted scenes.<br />To summarize, it is definately a great(must) buy for kids. But otherwise buy the DVD for the movie (and offcourse deleted scenes) but do not expect too much special stuff.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is a great, laid back release that showcases Norah Jones' excellent vocals.  Her band is excellent as well, and the chemistry between her and the rest of the musicians is evident.  She is one of the most talented vocalists out now.  All in all, not one weak song on this!

The special effects are great.

B00005RHGL|5.0|And that title line is one of Val &quot;Doc Holliday&quot; Kilmer's signature quotes from this incredible 1993 film.<br />a) If you buy &quot;Tombstone&quot; in any commercial form, buy the Vista Series DVD. The packaging is absolutely gorgeous and the extras are absolutely worth it.<br />b) If you've seen the film in its original cut many times, it's a real revelation to see the scenes that George Cosmatos filmed but which the studio forced him to cut, for time reasons.  Movies over two hours long scare studios because theatre owners don't want them because they can't cram in as many showings per day, sell fewer tickets, and makea lot less money on popcorn, hot dogs and soda, so the Director's vision suffers because of it. Why and how did Doc Holliday leave Big Nose Kate?  Who is that body dragged in front of Hooker's ranch before the climactic scenes.. these and many other questions are answered when you see the original cut of the film, and finally see the deleted scenes..<br />The extras on the second DVD will show you how a truly authentic Western was put together.. the incredible amount of care and planning that went into the detail of set and costume design and decoration. Did you know that ALL the moustaches on the cast were real? Watch the film at least once with Cosmatos' running commentary and you'll learn a lot more about one of the best, most authentic Westerns ever made.<br />The incredible ensamble cast works perfectly together. There's a reason for it. The film LOOKS real. There's a reason for it.<br />The most unfortunate thing about &quot;Tombstone&quot; is that it was released within a couple months of Kevin Costner's much more heavily hyped, three hour epic &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;.. the two films have many similarities, although Costner's adds a full extra hour by covering Earp's life before he takes his family to Tombstone, Arizona, after retiring as a lawman..<br />While I like Kostner's film too, &quot;Tombstone&quot; is the superior of the two.. Kurt Russell and especially Val Kilmer simply shine much brighter as Wyatt and Doc, than do Costner and Dennis Quaid in the same roles..<br />Westerns? I have a lot of favorites. #1 - Clint Eastwood's timeless &quot;Unforgiven.&quot; #2 - &quot;Tombstone.&quot; #3 - the epic Cinerama &quot;How The West Was Won.&quot; And quite a few others including &quot;The Treasure of The Sierra Madre.&quot; Unfortunately, while very few of them are made anymore, The American Western is a film genre with literally thousands of examples, a few dozen stellar standouts, but only a dozen or so true classics.. &quot;Tombstone&quot; is one of them.. And The Vista Series version is not a DVD you will be trading in any time soon. It's a keeper!!..e two..

B000066NW0|5.0|when it comes to music.  She is an unbelievable talented singer who brings variety out in so many levels with her music.  Avril is one of the best newcomers that has evolved out of the world of music in the past few years.  Songs like Losing Grip, Sk8er Boi, Things I'll Never Say, I'm With You and Complicated really does show what an talented writer she is.  Usually when I listen to songs on a CD, I can't stand to listen to all of the songs; although, when it comes to Avril's Let Go cd, I have to listen to them all.  Each song is like a cabinet full of spices, not all of them look, taste, or can be used in just any recipe, but yet, they are all great for some kind of recipe!! Avril Lavigne definitely has the recipe for success written all over her!
B000002UEB|5.0|I don't even know where to begin.  In my opinion, Operation Mindcrime is without a doubt the very best Rock Album of all time.  Ten years later, it still holds strong and completely buries any new music today.  The intellectual drive is unprecedented and has never again been immitated.  The music writing is absolutely phenomenal.  This album has taste, class, strength, emotion and talent.  Every song is better than the last and vice versa.  I've gotten every Queensryche album since Mindcrime and none of them has even come close to the greatness that this album is and always will be.  Another ten years from now, it will still be the best album on the shelf.  If you are a fan of rock music and have never heard this CD, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy today!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Though this is where Radiohead first started to really blend electronic elements into their music, this entire cd has a very organic, emotional feel to it. Each song is a mini-epic in its own right, filled with a large variety of somber melodies and dissenting, augmented chords. Really, this band is full of true dynamic musicianship--all the band members are truly talented. Naturally, Thom Yorke's vocals are the real standout, with their wide range and ethereal quality. <br />Of course, Radiohead isn't for everyone. I can understand how some people would say that the vocals are just too dreary and boring for certain personalities, particularly those stimulated by faster, harder rock. Then again, I like just about every kind of music out there, and this album is on my top 10. I'm not going to insult someone just because they don't like this music--everyone has their own taste. However, you should at least download a few songs from the album before you pass judgment on it. Some impressive standouts include \\"Airbag\\", \\"Karma Police\\" and \\"Paranoid Android.\\"<br />All in all, this is Radiohead's most musically developed album. Kid A and Amnesiac may be more experimental and ambitious, but those aren't necessarily good qualities. And Pablo Honey and The Bends may have a very polished, smoother British-pop sound to them, but where's the variety and uniqueness? OK Computer will be looked back on in the same manner as Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Nirvana's Nevermind.  Yes, it's that good.
B000002U9W|4.0|This  album  is  an  underrated  masterpiece . True  it's  not  going  to  satisfy  everyone  but  try  listening  to  this  with  an  open  mind  and  you  might  be  satisfied . Atom  Heart  Mother  goes  on  for  26  minutes  and  is  something  of  an  adventure . If  follows  next  and  this  is  a  more  sombre  yet  paranoid  tale  of  a  person  who  feels  that  he  has  lost  his  mind . Summer  69  and  Fat  Old  Sun  pass  through  nicely  and  then  that  brings  us  to  Alan's  Psychedelic  Breakfast  which  is  basically  Alan  having  his  breakfast  and  the  band  tapes  him  having  a  conversation ( &quot; bacon , sausages , tomatoes .... marmalade ! I  like  marmalade &quot; ). This  is  a  rather  weird  track  but  it's  rather  humourous  as  Alan  siting  what  he  has  to  do  for  the  day  and  how  he's  got  a  bad  back ( reality  TV  hounds  might  like  this  track ) and  finally  after  all  that  he'll  sign  off  with &quot; Well  my 'ead's  a  blank &quot; which  may  happen  to  some  listeners  after  they've  listened  to  song .<br />Definitely  an  album  for  hardcore  Pink  Floyd  enthusiasts . If  new  you'd  be  better  off  starting  with  Dark  Side  Of  The  Moon  or  The  Wall  as  they  are  Pink  Floyd  at  their  most  accessible . If  you  want  to  start  straight  off  into  their  madness  get  Piper  At  The  Gates  Of  Dawn  as  there  may  be  more  to  catch  for  you  there . Leave  this  for  a  while . Chances  are  you  might  be  like  Alan !
630529142X|5.0|... This has to be one of my favorites from Sandler because it's a really funny movie plus there's a lot of football action and Sandler is hilarious in this movie.<br />Sandler is Bobby Boucher, a 31 year old still living with his mama waterboy. Boucher gets fired from the big league university he was waterboy for and is then forced to find a new waterboy position and he finds his way to SCLSU (South Central Louisiana State University) and the SCLSU Mud Dawgs football. As soon as he gets there, it's the same situation... the players are picking on him. His coach (Henry Winkler) then tells Bobby to fight back or they'll do it forever. So with his coach's advice, Bobby fights back and shows his teammates who's boss. Winkler being impressed with Bobby's tackling ability when he's mad uses that and makes him their new starting Linebacker.<br />Trutyhfully, Sandler stretched for this one because his character was unlike any of his orher characters. Sandler was funny in almost a DUmb and Dumber sense along with the on field comedy during the football games was also hilarious. I'd suggest this to anyone because it's a great movie for laughs and some good ole' football. <br />If you're looking for other roles where Sandler is more than just a regualr guy (like in Big Daddy), check out LITTLE NICKY because that one is also very funny and Sandler makes an acting stretch for that role as well. In any case, drink your Water and check out the Waterboy!
B000002UA5|5.0|This  album  is  scary . And  I  mean  that . There  is  nothing  more  freaky  than  an  incoherent  rambling  Scotsman  yelling &quot; ne'er  be  fray  shirly  e  tayk  meee  alie &quot; to  the  tune  of  some  badgers  and  squirrels  and  mice  squeaking  in  the  background . And  if  you  that's  bad - most  of  the  album  is  like  that  too .<br />Now  you're  probably  wondering  why  I  give  this  5  stars . Well  because  in  some  odd  way  the  music  is  pretty  darn  funky . And  in  some  cases  they  sound  pretty  modern ( that  track  included ). The  live  cuts  of  Careful  With  That  Axe  Eugene  and  Saucerful  Of  Secrets  are  genuinely  scary  and  Sysyphus  that  Pict ( Scotsman ) track  as  well  as  The  Grand  Viziers  Party  are  also  unsettling . Dave  Gilmour's  contribution  is  OK  but  it's  not  something  altogether  excellent ( something  which  even  he'll  admit  to )<br />The  band  hate  this  album . It's  not  surprising  really . But  I  think  this  album  shows  how  they  were  feeling  at  the  time  and  maybe  that's  something  they'd  rather  forget . Enjoy  it  late  at  night  on  your  headphones  when  everyone's  asleep  and  be  afraid .... be  very  afraid
B00003CXIY|4.0|Road Trip was pretty funny. It's about a guy who misses his girlfriend because she goes to another college far away. Because he misses her so much, he makes a video tape of himself and plans to send it to her. The night before he sends the video to her is the night HE CHEATS ON HER and IT'S ON VIDEO!! He then decides to go down to her college on his spring break to stop her from seeing the video. So he and a few friends get together and have the Road Trip of a lifetime.<br />O.k. I have to say in some respects, yes it's kind of like American Pie but it's still different enough to be it's own movie and it's not bad at all. There are a lot of funny scenes in this movie from Tom Green eating and playing with the mouse, to the sperm bank (you'll see) of course when one of the guys is sitting out on the porch smoking pot with a dog.<br />Another great thing about this movie is that Tom Green is nowhere near as annoying as he was in Charlie''s Angels or Freddy Got Fingered. For me personally, Tom Green had one of the funniest scenes when he was playing with the snake.<br />My advice to anyone interested in this movie is to NOT compare it to American Pie because if you do, 9 times out of 10 people will say they hated it. Road Trip is truly it's own movie and the brand comedy used in this is way different in comparison with American Pie. I think it's a great movie but id your still skeptic, rent it first and see what you think.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is without a doubt the best score that Howard Shore has ever written and one of the best scores of all time. It represents Middle Earth perfectly and Tolkien would be proud. Several themes are found throughout. A Celtic theme for the Hobbits is found in &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, &quot;The Prophecy&quot;, in parts of &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, &quot;Many Meetings&quot;, and with a boy soprano soloist in the concluding track &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;. The Fellowship theme is a heroic brass motif, heard in &quot;The Prophecy&quot;, &quot;The Treason of Isengard&quot;, &quot;Many Meetings&quot;, and &quot;The Ring Goes South&quot;. The main reasons why this score is so good is because of the wall to wall sound, the immense orchestrations done by Shore himself, and the orchestral and vocal performances. The orchestra is very very large and the chorus is well over 100 members singing in several different languages, such as English, Dwarvish, and Elvish. Shore did tons and tons of research before writing the score in order to convey the best possible sound for Middle Earth. The action sequences are powerful and heroic with pounding war drums, metal percussion, and lots of trumpet and horn sounds, such as in &quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot;, &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, &quot;Flight to the Ford&quot;, and &quot;A Knife in the Dark&quot;, among others. &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot; is sheer orchestral and choral power and &quot;Amon Hen&quot; is an awesome cue just by listening to the dominating brass section. Enya's song &quot;May It Be&quot; that was nominated for an Academy Award, is also good and fits in perfectly with the score, probably because Shore orchestrated it. As John Williams did with Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Indiana Jones, Howard Shore is doing with The Lord of the Rings and it couldn't be any better. A truly monumental, gigantic score that is one of the best.
0066214122|4.0|Crichton's latest novel shows he's still at the top of his game, and he carries us along on a fast-paced thrill ride filled with horror and suspense.<br />Crichton's books generally center on some new and potentially disastrous technology (i.e. the dinosaur cloning in Jurassic Park), and in Prey he addresses nanotechnology. In the near future, he warns, these tiny machines may group into a \\"swarm\\" and rapidly evolve into a threatening intelligence. This is the premise the hero of Prey races to resolve, as he also tries to find a new job, deal with his wife's adultery, and take care of his kids.<br />The plot details are well summarized by others, so I won't go into them. Although in many ways this novel is typical Crichton fare, I found it more horrifying than most of his other works, reminiscent of King. Although there are perhaps a few too many coincidences in Prey, Crichton's introduction does a good job of telling us that nanotechnology is coming whether we like it or not, and must be thought about and dealt with before it is too late.
B00006IR5S|5.0|After being nominated for an Academy Award for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, John Williams returns once again to score Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, which I think is a better score than the first. Brought in to conduct the London Symphony Orchestra, due to John Williams caught up in other projects is William Ross who is also a great film composer. Some of the music from the first score is brought back, but a lot of the music is brand new. Harry's theme is brought back and is present in &quot;Prologue and The Escape From the Dursley's&quot; and &quot;Harry's Wondrous World&quot;, and other tracks which quote his theme in various places. One of the new themes added is the theme for Fawkes, which is an outstanding theme that reminds me a little of Home Alone. It is heard in &quot;Fawkes the Phoenix&quot; (the best track on the album), &quot;Fawkes Is Reborn&quot;, and &quot;Dueling the Basilisk&quot;. The other theme that occurs is found in &quot;Gilderoy Lockhart&quot; and &quot;The Dueling Club&quot;, which is very similar to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Another theme was found throughout that reminded me a lot of Hook. The recording is top notch as well as the LSO and voices performances. This should receive a nomination for the next Oscar, which will probably end up competing with Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. We'll see! In the mean time, get this score as it is even better than the first one.
0345448898|3.0|I really enjoyed Pullman's imagination-- love the idea of daemons (animal others that represent your soul), loved the armored bears and the rich worlds he created.  I found the books utterly engrossing and difficult to put down.<br />I don't know whether the books will offend Christians, but as a Jewish person, I found the association of \\"Religion\\" with what is essentially Christian philosophy (emphasis on Authority, the afterlife etc.) to be muddy and ultimately a bit preachy.  Not unlike Ayn Rand and the way she uses fiction to disguise her propaganda.  Just be warned; if your kids read this they may become anti-religion bores!  :)  I also found the \\"good guys\\" to be questionable (not the kids, but Asriel and his forces) That said, I did enjoy them as stories.
0345446798|5.0|This is a book that needs to belong in the library of every dog lover who truly wants to understand the behavior of his/her dog. This is not a training manual. But I suspect it should be required reading for anyone wishing to better understand and train their dog. Please be open minded when you read this book and throw away the traditional WWII era thinking about dog training and behavior. Patricia truly cares about dogs and it is clear in every page of this book. Buy this book, read it, and read it again. It will open your eyes and heart to a new loving relationship with your dog. Every chapter is full of valuable information you should not be without. The chapters about body language (of humans) and sounds  were so valuable that I instantly was able to have my dog come to me when called 100% of the time, even when in the middle of a squirrel chase!! Thanks Patricia for your masterpiece.
B00006879E|5.0|I've followed Maroon5 since they were Kara's Flowers.  With the addition of James Valentine (bass) to the band, they changed their name to Maroon (briefly) and then Maroon5.  As this band has grown up, their music has as well.  &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is one of the most amazing albums I've heard - from an independent (recently noticed) band.  With their first single &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot;, they draw you in and keep you going with each amazing track they have to offer.  With the seductive lyrics they pour out of their souls, to the outstanding music they lay out for the taking - Maroon5 has single handedly created an album that will be around forever.  You can not compare them to anyone else and do them (or the other band) any justice.  They have an amazing sound that only Maroon5 could pull off.  I hope this review was helpful - it's hard to put into words how fantastic this album is.  It's definitely worth the purchase price!
630264366X|2.0|A great story about a courageous priest who openly opposed evil at the risk of his own life should make a great movie, but this isn't a great movie. This movie isn't a drama, it's a tragedy. It's a tragedy that this isn't a great movie.<br />There are three kinds of actors that could have been considered for the role of Monsignor O'Flaherty: 1.) Irish actors; 2.) Non-Irish actors who can use Irish accents effectively; and 3.) Gregory Peck. Now, I wasn't in on any production meetings or casting calls, but if there were any actors available from the first two categories, why were they not used? <br />Peck's portrayal of Monsignor O'Flaherty isn't even vaguely convincing. He doesn't sound Irish; instead, he sounds like a mediocre American actor who is trying desperately to sound Irish. His attempts at an Irish accent nearly turn this movie into a comedy. <br />Sir John Gielgud is cast as Pope Pius XII, and he does a commendable job of portraying this heroic pope according to the false gospel of historical revisionism. He nearly fails in this effort early on, when his Pius XII shows some backbone in his dealings with the Nazis, but he quickly falls back into an irresponsible and inaccurate portrayal of Pius XII as a spineless man who wants to maintain peace at all costs. There is plenty of historical evidence to the contrary, but this seems not to have mattered to the producers of this movie. <br />To be fair, in general, this movie portrays the Church in a positive light, and it deserves commendation for that. However, even this can't make up for the fact that Peck is badly miscast and that Gielgud is unappealing.<br />Despite all this, I do recommend buying this video. Pop it into the VCR some night when you're having trouble getting to sleep. You'll be well rested in the morning.

1568497369|5.0|The queen of mystery writing deserves her reputation. And this is her best book. I have read and reread it and have yet to find a flaw. Originally published as Ten Little Indians for reasons which will become apparent as you read it, this little gem should be read by all who aspire to write novels. The characters, the landscape, the background, the build up of action, the fantastic action -- all leave me breathless as well as enthrauled with the perfect narrative tone and control exhibited in this masterpiece. If you haven't read it yet, you are in for a treat. It is way better than the movie, the play, or any of her other works including The Seven Dials Mystery, Three Blind Mice, Witness for the Prosecution and Murder on the Orient Express.

Thank you and we apologize for<BR>the inconvenience. <br />DVD TEAM\\"<br />I loved this movie and would give the movie 4 stars. But the DVD is maddening! It seams they added sooooo many kewl features (i.e. BAD CODE) that they thought that the ability to pause or scan forward/backward to mundane to think about =/<br />I cannot stress enough what a pain this is to watch on my DVD player that seams to handle my 100's of other DVDs perfectly :(<br />If this DVD worked I would give it 4 stars.
B00005JKOV|2.0|I feel somewhere in between of giving this film 2 or 3 stars. It's a commendable experiment, a very original movie, and for that I would give it 3 stars. But for all of that, it is ultimately a movie I didn't enjoy much. So that's why I gave it 2 stars. Read on for further thoughts...<br />First, the animation. It's amazing. It's interesting to see how it changes from scene to scene, giving it different moods for different characters. The extreme distortions in one, for example, are very engaging. Yet I have a little but. The truth is the different parts (backgrounds, characters, objects) bounce around a little bit throughout the whole film. This is certainly interesting and goes well with what the movie is trying to convey, but I can't help getting a little bit dizzy about it all, and I think it would have been much better if this 'bounziness' (for lack of a better word) would have been used sporadically. That would have been much more effective. The same goes, for example, for the extreme distortions previously mentioned. They are repeated throughout a long dialogue where all we see is that face being contorted and distorted over and over again. But despite all the minor complaints, animation is excelent, and will have you glued into the screen for some time.<br />Then, the plot or, better said, the dialogues. The idea of the movie was promising, and I really wanted to like this movie. But the fact that it has no plot whatsoever puts the whole of the importance on the dialogues. And the truth is that some really succeed in making you think, whilst most are simply... boring. They start repeating themselves and going off to places that don't make any sense at all (unless you're high, I guess). It's just so many 'profound' reflections that don't actually have any meaning, any substance behind them. There's mainly questions asked in this movie. Don't expect any anwers. And although I think that could be a good thing, after the first 30 minutes, it all gets boring andrepetitive. And it goes on way too long after that. The other thing I didn't really like was the 'plot developments'. They were waaaaay too predictable. Like when Wiggins is told 'You can tell you're in a dream when you try to switch off a light and the light stays on'. I expected this would occur sometime later in the movie. It would have a bit of expectation. But it happens right after they finish speaking. One way or another, I figured they would show us this whole film was a dream, but I though it would have been interesting to give some suspense to this, or to give the feeling that maybe some of it was dream while some might have been reality. The ending was very predictable as well. When I saw him starting to fly off and reach for the car again (and because of the time I knew the end was near), I automatically knew he would fly off and the movie would end.<br />The music, however, is something entirely different. Glover Gill composed a poignant and engaging score. The tango music fits perfectly the film and the questioning it's trying to get through, and I thought the music scenes were some of the best parts of the movie itself (especially the one in the Ritz in Austin, where they are dancing tango, towards the end).<br />In the end, Waking Life is a worthy experiment, but the end result is not as good as I would've liked it to be. I think this could have worked much better as a short, but I guess it wouldn't have had so much attention and success. The animation and music are top-notch, but the film becomes quite boring after the first half-hour, except for a few interesting dialogues.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I first got this album when my friend highly recomended it. He allowed me to borrow his and I was immedietely hooked. I went out and bought it and it is worth every penny. Besides the fact that the cd is relatively inexpensive the music is amazing. I see many comparisons to the Joy Division and although I am not familiar with that band I can say they are alot like The Strokes. They take an almost playful look at life, although they go a bit deeper then the Strokes. All in all I'd say definetely worth the expense and trouble of going to the store. You wont be disappointed.
6305603847|4.0|First of all I'm pleased to say that this DVD is in widescreen--REALLY WIDESCREEN. I'm one of those people who like to see the movie the way people in the theater saw it (especially PFTW came out a year before I was born).  I must concur with everyone and say that the picture and soundtrack are of excellent quality--and on that note, be warned: this film is loud! I played this movie in my music theory class (had a very hip teacher)  And when \\"In The Flesh?\\" came on, I think anyone asleep in the building woke up.<BR>  I found Waters and Scarfe's audio commentary unsatisfactory.  These two cranks have almost no idea how this film was made but have plenty of mean things to say about Parker and Geldof.  They also go off on long, boring tangents leaving the film to role on while they talk about pedaphiles and Irish terrorists. Didn't gain much from it.<BR>  I'm glad they put in the HEY YOU outtake, eventhough one can see why it was left on the cutting room floor (still a great song!). I've owned this thing for months and still haven't checked out all the features there are that many.<BR>  I've watched this film so many times I can't watch it all the way through any more, so my suggestion: watch in moderation. But definitely a good buy.
0553573403|2.0|Why only two stars?  While the characterizations are good, there are too many sub-plots and too many characters. Some of the plots and characters are interesting, but not enough time is spent on them to make the reader care. The story skips from one to another and often leaves you wondering.  There is so very little action, I was often tempted to skip ahead to see if anything more exciting was going to happen or if I should just give up.  I can't even fathom why anyone would compare this work to Tolkein.  It has none of the interesting world development, none of the excitement, and very few characters that the reader can actually like.  While the writing can be quite good at times, it tends to get bogged down by insignificant details (probably why the book is so unnecessarily long...).  I mean, does it really have any impact on the story to describe every single Lord in the land and what their house sigil looks like?  Many of the characters are cliched and unimportant, as well.  How many time can you read about the spoiled rotten Prince, or the Lord who values honor more than anything?  These characters are DULL!!! Sorry to all of you that gave it five stars!  I have no idea what you saw in this book....
B000006TRV|5.0|I discovered this album at sixteen just after my father passed away. I found this dark, angst-ridden piece of poetry so strangely moving, my life was forever changed.  Pink Floyd's not-so-tender farewell to the decade of glam-rock, stadium-rock and dinosaur rock (a term I scarcely use), is brilliant because it's dark, bleak and funny at the same time.  Water's with album artwork by political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe it's hard not to see the black humor.<BR>  This is a great album just to sit and listen to alone in your room, with the lights off (especially the second disc).  Every time &quot;Vera&quot; comes on I just have to sing along: &quot;Vera, Vera what has become of you? Does anybody else in here feel the way I do?&quot;  So cathartic, so brilliant.  So buy it already!
B00006M183|4.0|This is a wonderful CD, and in my humble opinion, the best since VS. way back in 1993. The sound is great, the words are unreal (as usual), and everyone seems to be moving in the same direction musically. I have to admit that I love all the PJ albums, but this one is a tremendous success. Songs like \\"Save You\\" and \\"Green Disease\\" sound like they came from the early PJ years of the nineties. Most of this CD is straight out rock music that you can listen to from beginning to end. The sales probably wiull not be astounding what with all the ...other music people somehow listen to now, but if you are a rock fan, buy this ablum soon.
B00006HBUB|5.0|I didn't know why there were so many negative reviews here but I went ahead and bought for my kids anyway.<br />At first it would seem that the nay-sayers were right on the money, after watching my kids enjoying the DVD so much and over andd over, I had to have a second thought!<br />This is simply a fascinating for the right minds---the kids, actually I enjoyed the movie too, not just once, many times over.<br />Yes, it seems &quot;different&quot; than the cartoon version if you are so used to cartoon network. However, after analyzing it over and over, I realized(and my kids too) it is far more entertaining than the cartoons, hence the whole purpose of making a &quot;live action movie&quot;. The colors, the scenes, the casting are simply great. THe DVD even has some deleted scenes and are nice and fun to have them.<br />Two thumbs up!
B000050XEI|5.0|In her latest release, Irish vocalist Enya has once again captured the minds and ears of listeners around the globe with the hauntingly mesmerizing &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;. Full of vivid emotion, it will tug at your heart and soul with an urgency lacking in most modern music.<br />Enya's albums are always soothing, and this one is no different. It explores everything from tranquil bucolic settings to the fear we all face after losing a loved one. However, she does it with a style and grace that is seemingly unmatched in today's music world.<br />The spring-like 'Wild Child' is one of the record's best efforts, as it reminisces about the care-free days that we all wish would still reign in our lives. 'Deora Ar Mo Chroi', her Gaelic-language piece on this album, is both haunting and tender in its emotional delivery. 'Fallen Embers' is sadly tragic yet strangely soothing as Enya laments the loss of love. <br />By far, the best piece on the album is the hopeful 'Only Time'. This is a different version than the pop-ified radio hit. It is much slower, more instrumental, and more solemn. However, there is a distinct emotion evoked in this delivery that the upbeat version lacks. Without the drums, it is easier to feel both the despair and optimism that the Irish lass is communicating.<br />Overall, this is an amazing album that left me listening to it over and over again. 'Only Time' introduced me to Enya, but it was &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; that made me a fan. It is at once touching, soothing, and hauntingly mesmerizing.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Previous releases of Elton John's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; have never really encompassed the full range of his music writing, and Bernie Taupin's lyrical talents.  This release has taken a superb cross section of all the songs from the past 3 decades that have made you dance around the house when a particular song of EJ's is played.  The key to any collection of an musician's work is its arragement on CD, and this particular collection allows you to sit back an listen to the development of a unique sound that all fans can recall and relate to.
B00005JLWL|5.0|i'm lucky enough to live in a state where several theaters are playing this movie...everyone seems to want to compare equilibrium to the matrix...the truth of the matter is that wimmer has created something infintely more thought provoking and character driven...this being said, the action sequences are some of the best that i have ever seen, and if you insist on comparing this movie to the matrix, then these sequences blow that movie away...bale never seems fails to show that he is one of the best actors out there...it's such a shame that miramax didn't dump more money into marketing this film...it has the potential to be a sleeper hit...simple advice to anyone, SEE THIS MOVIE
B00007E8JP|5.0|Amazing, sweet, wat else can i say this album rox beyond belief. Even without the swearing cuz my crummy parents dont like it this album is definetly the best ther is. Crazy? Of course it is this is system of a down folks but this cd rox the charts an i recommend it 2 all soad fans!!
0385720920|2.0|Palahniuk has a gift for pointing out the obvious and making us grimace, for baring the darkest and blackest parts of what makes us human and forcing us to view them with pure honesty, and I admire him for that.  But having the talent to entertain and enlighten doesn't necessarily produce a good novel.  <br />Choke left me feeling empty and confused.  The sex addiction issues and the dysfuncional mother-son relationship were the well developed themes, but I felt as if nothing gelled together to form a complete statement of intent. Despite a very thorough synopsis of humanity's ailments, the plot just became more and more contrived and ridiculous as the book moved on, and the various 'surprise' endings were disappointing, to say the least because they were not developed; it seemed like they were just thrown together at the last minute to bring things to a close.<br />I enjoyed Fight Club but Palahniuk has failed with this one.  Hopefully his next effort will be better.
B00004TX5F|2.0|There are too many inaccuracies in this movie that I cannot even count them! In addition, the plot was terrible, the casting was awkward, and the sex scenes unnecessary. This cannot be called a 'period movie.'<br />For anyone who knows anything about castrati, they would never have looked like Stefano Dionisi (masculine and angular. Farinelli was called 'il ragazzo' (the boy) on account of his childlike appearance.  Also, his lip-syncing with the audio track was perpetually ill-timed (though acceptable for a non-musician) and distracting.<br />However, even though I feel the artistic merit of this movie is negligible, the soundtrack is one of the most incredible recordings I have ever heard. The artificial castrato voice created for this film is sublime and definitely worth investing in.

0375507507|5.0|Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight is a terrific memoir of a young woman, born in England who grows up on various farms with her family in various African countries during the 1960s and 70s.  Her story is a marked contrast to the &quot;typical&quot; suburban childhood, of the sort that one sees recollected in A Girl Named Zippy.  Alexandra Fuller, or Bobo, as she is called is a humorous, gutsy narrator and manages to convey what is at times a heartbreaking childhood with no hint of maudlin and much good humor.  Enjoy.
B00004XMSN|4.0|Walk right past the re-make. As in many cases, the original is about a gazillion times better, unless of course you are a Denzel fan, in which case, I would say, go ahead and get the re-make.<br />This is a classic movie, with beautiful actors, Loretta Young, Cary Grant and David Niven and a beautiful story that quietly suggests(via Grant as an angel) not the existance of Santa, but of God, in such a non-preaching and non-intrusive way, it eases its way into your living room.<br />I guess my favorite part of the movie is the theme, that the man-made artificial constructs of religion, such as church buildings with over-the-top stained glass tributes and priests and all that other stuff pale in comparison to the idea of a Supreme Being who loves all people, regardless of lifestyle, wealth or any other similar junk and that finally God is good, loving even humorous.
0064407667|1.0|Let's start out by saying that the only reason this book even got one star was because zero stars wasn't an option.  I've read a LOT of children's books and this is far, far down on my list. The main problems with this book (and the whole series) is that the plot is dull, it's poorly written, there's no character development, you can't connect with any of the characters, it's depressing, and it's a teacher's worst nightmare if you value SHOW not TELL since the entire book reads like a plot summary.  The appeal for these books is that they introduce vocabulary words, however what a waste of paper to do so in such an unimaginative way.  There are so many books in this series, and it's probably because they only take about an hour each to churn out.  The ONLY good thing about this book was that it was returnable.  Let me plead, there are so many wonderful and creative children's books out there, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TRASH!
0451169514|5.0|This book is what originally got me addicted to Stephen King books. This book was so scary, at times I had to put it down and reassure myself that it wasn't real. <br />The book mainly revolves around a group of kids, Bill Denbrough, Ben Hanscome, Beverly Marsh, Richie Tozier, Stanly Uris, Eddie Kaspbrack, and Mike Hanlon. Also known as the Losers. In the summer 1958, when all these characters were only eleven years old, they went in hunt of IT. Yet IT can be anything, and IT feeds on the fears of children, and the children themselves. Eventually IT leads to the death of one of the Losers. But when the Losers think that they have killed IT, IT rises again, and he is hungry for the meat of children<br />Twenty seven years later, six of the seven Losers became widly sucessful in life. And when the are phoned by a mysterious stranger, they are informed that IT had returned. Also that it was their promise that they would kill IT, if IT came back to life. <br />Now all of the Losers travel back to their hometown of Derry, Maine, to face the very scourse of their greatest and deepest fears. <br />I could hardly put this book down when I read IT. Some people will not even think of reading the book because of how thick it is, but the thickness of the book makes it all the better. You not be dissapointed with this book. If you like horror stories this book is perfect for you. When I read the conclution, I actually checked under my bed. If that dosen't give you an idea of how scary IT really is
0064407667|1.0|As a fan of the Harry Potter series, Roald Dahl, AND Charles Dickens, I approached this book on the recommendation of several friends who had read and enjoyed it-perhaps thinking I could enjoy the nine Lemony Snicket books while awaiting the fifth Harry Potter book like so many other H. P. fans. Trusting my friends and believing that \\"50,000 Harry Potter Fans Can't Be Wrong,\\" I decided to give it a try.<br />The notes on the back of the book clearly begin \\"I'm sorry to say that the book you are holding in your hands is extremely unpleasant.\\" Truer words were never spoken! As many others here have pointed out (and even Lemony Snicket himself), there are no happy moments in this book. I understood this before reading it, but thought I might at least enjoy some of the \\"humor.\\" I laughed once in 162 pages. The humor comes only when the reader can't see how circumstances for the Baudelaire kids could get any worse, and then they do.<br />Perhaps it's unfair to compare this book to Harry Potter, for Harry Potter is everything this book isn't: clever, interesting, absorbing, exciting, well-written, and worthwhile.  Snicket's characters are completely one-dimensional. Violet thinks about nothing other than inventing, Klaus is obsessed with reading, and Sunny exists only to babble nonsense words which are not-so-cleverly translated by the author. In addition to translating baby Sunny's words, the author also seems obliged to define every word over six letters-something that is cute and almost funny the first two times, but quickly becomes annoying when he does it on every other page. Besides the Baudelaire kids, we meet boring Mr. Poe: the manager of the kids' deceased parents' estate who never has time to address the kids' problems with their new guardian, Count Olaf. Olaf is pure evil; he drinks too much, abuses the children physically as well as emotionally, and devises an outlandish plot to grab the Baudelaire kids' inherited estate (I won't give it away, but can anyoneimagine that such a plan would *actually* work!!??). Olaf's next-door neighbor is the amazingly thick-headed Justice Strauss, a judge who seems to live in her garden. She's kind to the kids, but can't detect that anything is wrong in the filthy, dilapidated house next to hers. Even when the kids explain their troubles to her and ask to look through her law books to figure out Olaf's \\"sneaky\\" plan, she doesn't bat an eye. And the kids still love her!<br />I think Snicket underestimates the intelligence of his audience, not only by defining every other word (and I mean that figuratively, not literally...) but also by keeping the plot extremely simple, straightforward, and predictable. The Harry Potter series proved that kids can handle complex storylines and don't need to be spoon fed the meaning of any word with more than three syllables.<br />Having said all this, I read the book in one sitting, something I don't usually do. I suppose my real reason for being unable to put the book down came from my expectation that at any moment, the storyline would \\"snap\\" and suddenly become interesting. Having read so many good reviews and heard so many positive things about this book, I was sure that with any turn of the page it would get better. All the way up to the bitter end (and it *is* a bitter end) I kept assuring myself that I would suddenly find myself \\"enjoying\\" the book. After all, I had had a similar experience with Harry Potter, in which I found the first twenty pages of the first book completely dull. Somewhere around the fourth chapter of H. P. though, I became hooked. That never happened with Lemony Snicket.<br />Lemony Snicket is unique, and the idea of telling an unhappy, depressing story is a novel one, but I'm afraid the book doesn't live up to the hype. I'm usually easily pleased, but was thoroughly disappointed with \\"The Bad Beginning.\\" In this case, you CAN judge a book by its cover.
0451450523|5.0|The Last Unicorn is an all time classic. I loved this book after reading the first two pages. It is that addicting. Peter S. Beagle wrote the best book I have ever read when he wrote this. <br />The story is about a Unicorn, who was the color of the snow while being relected in the moonlight. She is wonderfully described by Beagle. She learns through several scourses that she is the last unicorn in the world, and she starts on a quest to find her people. <br />On the way she is captured by the vile witch Mommy Fortuna, and is held captive. But among her captivity she finds a trusted friend, a bumbleing magicain named Shemdrick. Shemdrick joins the Unicorn on her quest. <br />Soon they find another ally, in the form of a jaded woman named Molly Grue. As the trio continues to search for the rest of the world's unicorns, the find themselves face to face with death, danger, betrayl, love, and an alcoholic skull (sorry, but I had to include that). <br />I read this book at least once every month, and every time I still get the same thrill when the Unicorn battles the Red Bull, or when the Lady Amalthea confesess her love for Prince Lir.<br />This is the best book I have ever read in my life, and will remain the best book I have ever read. You should without a doubt pick up a copy of this book and read it.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|At first listen t.A.T.u. seem to just be another Europop group trying to make their break in the U.S. Upon closer inspection these girls are the real deal. Their songs fight for equality, but also sing of the troubles of being gay in this world. \\"All The Things She Said\\" sings about being afraid to be in love with someone of the same sex on one hand and being frustrated with that fear on the other hand. The song has a Bananarama feel to it that makes it all the more catchy. The cover of the Smith's song \\"How Soon is Now\\" actually turned out very well, blending guitar sounds with Europop. Great beats and fantastic lyrics blended with the girls soft but powerful voices make this a fantastic album.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Moulin Rouge the movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my short lifetime. When I was out shopping and saw the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, I had to buy it. There were no if, an's, or but's about it.<br />The CD features *almost* every song from the film. They left out the song Like A Virgin, Zidler's Rap, and another called (i think) Spectacular Spectacular. That is the only bad thing about the CD<br />The best song on the album is the Sparkling Diamonds, El Tango De Roxanne, and Hindi Sad Diamonds, and Come What May. I have played those songs over and over and over again. <br />In lamest terms, if you loved the movie, you will love the album. It is worth every penny
0060977493|5.0|To me, the story has no end. Although you know the end, you keep reading and it is as if Arundhati is there guiding you along a path you know, yet she makes it more beautiful and opens up feelings inside you that you never knew existed. The scene that brings tears to your eyes is a scene that you would normally read with pleasure. And when the story is finally all told, she soothes your aching heart with one last page of beauty and sorrow. I have never read a book so haunting, and somehow I never think I will.<br />To me, it is telling, how different people are, that some find this book disappointing.
0395051010|5.0|I like when that what I read is realy interesting. I must say that Jane Austin wrote about life in England in the begining of 19th century. Lots of my friends think that it is'n actual at the moment, but I think it is nesesery to now how live people 200 years ago. I like her books.

0800135954|5.0|From breathtaking scenery to shots of Brad Pitt as eye-candy for the ladies, LEGENDS OF THE FALL has something for everyone.  Edward Zwick brings a powerful story of brotherly love and conflict to the screen, a story that stays as fresh and vigorous as the majestic northern Rockies.<br />The conflict that drives this story involves brothers Alfred and Tristan Ludlow (Aidan Quinn and Brad Pitt).  Here are two brothers torn apart by their love for the same woman, and by Alfred's resentment that Tristan is his father's favorite son.  Tristan--wild, self-destructive, guilt-ridden--must exorcise some demons of his own (and does).  The film moves relentlessly toward a compelling climax, when the brothers come to one another's aid, when a father's love for his outcast son is renewed.<br />Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as family patriarch Colonel Ludlow.  LEGENDS OF THE FALL is as tough, gritty, and determined as its scenic background--as tender and poignant as any family saga ever portrayed.  Highly recommended.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|With a sond that mixes Techno and Pop, its easy to see why t.A.T.u is a band that will make it big. Originally from Russia, these two lesbian teens smashed ont the seen with \\"All The Things She Said\\", a song that depicts the life of two girls in love while being loked down upon by society. With other songs like \\"Theyre Not Gonna Get Us\\", apparently a song about people trying to change them(?), these girs look like they are ready to take on the world without taing any crap. It should be interesting to see how well they do in America compared to how they did in Europe. If yor into up-beat poppy techno, this cd should be on your \\"Things to buy\\" list!
0399103422|4.0|In Mario Puzo's The Godfather, he uses the crimes of a family and their Italian heritage to show how it affects a large loving family.  I thought this was an excellent book, because the plot sequence was amazing with constant twists and suspense.  The irony of this book comes through the crime boss Vito Corleone who is a kind-hearted and loyal friend of all who come to him with a request.  However, he makes his living off of corruption and death which really doesn't affect the reader's attitude towards this loving character.  The vicious side of the mafia comes through Vito's son Sonny.  Sonny's rage leads to the death of many mob-related characters as well as to the his own death  which is another irony evident in this novel.  The Godfather uses masterful description of each member's life and how mob-life affected them.  Another example of irony in The Godfather is the youngest son Michael's situation.  At the beginning of the novel, Michael is returning from World War II and has no part in the family business.  However, when his father nears death after gunshot wounds, Michael is drawn into the family business and chooses to pay back the antagonist Solozzo by spilling his blood for the sake of the family.  Michael becomes the leader of the family after his father and Sonny die and he returns from Italy after things die down about his assasination of Solozzo.  This transformation from an upstanding servant of the country to a crime boss looking out for the wellbeing of his family alone is the ulimate irony in this novel. Women and children are not major characters in the novel, because Puzo uses them to show how the mobs goal was to keep the innocent free from encountering their violent troubles.  Puzo incorporates the lives of everyone involved in this crime family to show how much love and loyalty lead to their success and rage and deceit lead to their downfall.  After reading the novel, I gained a greater appreciation for the movie which I had seen earlier and an understanding of how loyalty leads to power in the world.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\" is a perfect, albeit short (36 minutes), album with subtly beautiful songs. It's not something you play to a friend, saying, \\"listen to this great stuff.\\" But once you get absorbed in it several times in privacy of your home, thinking about the meaning of lyrics, it's almost impossible not to be swept away by its raw, and yet tender, elegance and  melancholy.  Created and performed almost exclusively by this very unique artist, just about half of songs features guitar (one or more), and on the other half Joni is singing with her own piano accompaniment. The ten songs form a compelling mosaic of a woman's soul, describing relationships of two people at various stages. Lyrical quality is astonishing, contributing greatly to the overall deep impact of the collection.  Every song would deserve a special paragraph to describe. To offer my own subjective viewpoint on some of the highlights, \\"My Old Man\\" is an ode to devotion, \\"The River\\" is a very touching pang of remorse, a good-bye to a lost love, which the loved one cannot hear anymore. And \\"A Case of You\\" says what happens 'just before our love got lost' -- letting go when you don't really want to can be almost unbearable... No wonder this song is covered so often.  These are just small glimpses of this work of art, a beautiful and very human tapestry.  It's a pity many of my friends do not understand English. I would like them to listen to \\"Blue\\". It is an essential listening.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I sat down to A.I. expecting a movie full of wonder and amazement. I got that at times. At other times, I wanted to turn it off. When it was finally over, I really wanted to like this film but I just felt like I was in a ship on stormy seas and was seasick from it all.<br />The movie starts out in a very somber tone. It explains how the earth is suffering the effects of global warming and the creation of robots, specifically one who can love. David, the loving Robot, is purchased by a family whose own son is on life support. Soon enough, the son improves and the mother decides she doesn't need David anymore. So she drops David and Teddy (the best and warmest character in the movie) in the woods and David goes on a journey to become a real boy and to earn the love of his mother.<br />This is a very sad way to start the film, but it is then that we start to see a little of a \\"quest\\" in the movie (a la Wizard of Oz) and it begins to feel magical. Then, we get depressed again as we are introduced to a \\"pleasure robot\\" and how a woman is afraid of his \\"functional abilities.\\" This totally lurches the movie from a kind of magical quality to in your face smut. Then, we see a \\"flesh fair\\" in which defective robots are destroyed in an arena to the delight of the humans. Then, we are taken to a city which has buildings in the shapes of women in provocative poses. I knew this was a pet project of Kubrick but I didn't know a lot of his perverted imagery and characters would be included in the film.<br />Once we get past that, then we have a few more magical moments and then we are introduced to more dark images and finally, more magical moments. By the time it is all over, I was exhausted.<br />Did I like the movie? I liked the Spielberg \\"moments\\" but I disliked the Kubrick ones. This maybe what they had intended but to me, it made for a very uneven and overall unsatisfying film.
B000065V41|2.0|Picture quality is OK, but not great.  It is cropped so it doesn't show the full picture we saw in the cinema.  Disney chose to mention this in extremely tiny print on the back of the box.    I'll buy it when it comes out in widescreen.

0671027344|5.0|Let me start by kind of introducing myself.  I am a 15-yr. old sophomore from Central Illinois and am much like the protagonist of this story, Charlie.  I don't know how Stephen Chbosky did it, but he perfectly captured EVERY emotion of growing up and the solace of friends and music in a world of high school that can easily be disheartening.<BR>  Charlie is a kid that isn't exactly a loser, but hes not popular either.  He is in the middle, and starts his freshman year without anyone since his best friend in junior high committed suicide.  He as a normal family life with the dad who used to be an athlete and the quiet, stays-out-of-the-way mother.  His sister is the stereotypical older sister rebel with or without a cause.  His brother is a football star going to Penn State on a scholarship.<BR>  This story is a year in Charlie's life.  All of the ups and downs that come with it.  His friends are great, and a lot of social issues are noted by them.<BR>  I really cannot say enough about this book.  If you are a teenager who is looking for a book you can actually relate to, do not hesitate at all in checking this out.  I'm very glad I did because it restored my faith in reading.
B000002LQR|5.0|I would give this ablum 6 stars if it were possible. This is such an awesome album. This is one that will be known as one of the best rock/funk albums of all time. From soft ballads like &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; to heavy slam funk on &quot;Give it Away&quot; this album has all the music to satisfie your needs. And I'm proud to say, this was the very first album I ever bought.
B00003CX5P|1.0|There's a irony here, that the man who started the mythos of Star Wars becomes the director who so carelessly destroys it.  Does this DVD set new standards?  Sure it does.  It has A LOT of interesting extras such as computer generated deleted scenes and some very intriguing behind the scenes features.  But does this save the movie?  Hell no.  The original movies like 4,5, and 6 had some great dialouge.  While the Phantom Menace has some really interesting characters, its painful to listen to them speak.  I'm sure I will get a lot of negative reactions from this review, but Star Wars fans have to ask themselves this...did you actually have fun watching this movie?

B000007WRN|4.0|What can you really say about Madonna...typically, either you like her or you hate her and there seems to be no middle ground.  Up until Ray of Light, I never liked Madonna or any of her songs but this album truly was a revelation when I heard &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot; and decided to buy the album.  &quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot; opens the album up with lots of introspection and a good slow beat.  &quot;Swim&quot; is a song that lyrically tells the world to end all its problems, and for each of us to let go of our burdens and not let them bury us.  &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is one of the worst songs on the album but it's not as bad as some of her songs (thinking of &quot;Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;).  &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; reminds me of the much more sensual Madonna many are used to but the electronic beat puts an interesting groove to this song...wonderful song.  &quot;Skin&quot; follows beautifully, still with provocative and inviting lyrics but also the electronice edge that actually gets harder and faster.  &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; is a strange video I'm not crazy about but the song is actually really good and a fun dance track, fitting in perfectly with the previous tracks.  &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot; is an okay track but sort of mediocre on this album and &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; following it makes these tracks what I like to call &quot;the new found beliefs&quot; and honestly, I don't think these are strong tracks at all and seem out of place.  &quot;Frozen&quot;...the second best track on the album...this is an AMAZING song here, something we have never heard of with the dark and rushing sounds throughout it, not to mention absolutely piercing lyrics (and the video is a work of art!).  &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot;...the best song on the album still...this song lyrically is so strong even though it's pretty simple and allows for the building passion and constant psychological tearing of leaving someone you love(another beautiful video!).  &quot;To Have and Not to Hold&quot; is an okay track but after following two powerhouse songs that have a unique beat, this song seems to aburptly stop the album completely...placement would have been better at the very end of the album.  &quot;Little Star&quot; just gets on my nerves and it's one of my least favs.  &quot;Mer Girl&quot; is lyrically a good song but again would be better probably as the third song or fourth song on the album.  &quot;Has to Be&quot; ends of this import version and lyrically is sort of simple but it's not a bad song either.  Overall, this album is probably the best Madonna has ever produced, lyrically and artistically, and hopefully if and when she makes a new album, she'll return to a deeper form of music that is found on this awesome album.

I think this album can compete with the greatness of Siamese Dream by Smashing Pumpkins. Although Pearl Jam's later albums are also very excellent, I still belief Ten is the ultimate Pearl Jam album
B000000YBQ|5.0|Quite an amazing session.  It feels as if you're in the Village Vanguard in the moment.  Intimate, gentle, phrasing and interplay quite beyond description.  Porgy is done in a way I'd have never imagined and Some Other Time sounds as if it could/should be played no other way.  What a genius this trio is/was.  And thank heavens for the great technology to keep this music alive and at it's very best.

There are many excellent animated movies out there.<br />As for acting skills, again, this is a subjective criteria that I will not touch.<br />This movie has good settings, costumes, music and decent plot.
B00005YXZH|3.0|...I can say that it's very abstract and unconventional, which I can appreciate to some degree. After listening to the same rehashed music over the last 33 years of my life, I've made conscious effort to change my musical repetoir, so I welcome the change. However, to say that this album is genius is quite an overstatement, in my opinion. For some reason, the band decided it would be cool to throw in a lot of noise...The parts of it that are good, are really good and the rest is up in the air until I listen a couple more times.
0780620003|1.0|This flick was a belated attempt to cash-in on the run of dark comic book heroes sparked in 1989 with \\"Batman\\".  Though having CGI graphics, and even tossing in a demented clown character, nothing here comes close to matching that earlier hit.<br />The Story: Al Simmons (White) is your basic can-do spec-ops master.  Doing various impossible dirty jobs for a super secret agency run by the odious Jason Wynn (Sheen) that require him to sneak around fortified installations across the world with timed charges and a sub-machine gun, White is seeking a way out.  He knows he's being set by Wynn and his toady (Sweeny), but doesn't have an idea of how deep Wynn's betrayal goes.  When Wynn turns on White during The-Last-Mission (an intentionally botched demolition of a classified bio-warfare installation), he incinerates White and leaves him to burn with the rest of the factory.  Wynn, it turns out, was in league with no less than Hell itself - selling his country (and White) to the devil in return for immeasurable power.  Hell, it goes without saying, has its own plans, which include an army of the damned ready to march on the land of the living, and led by a savagely scarred warrior who is none other than White himself.  Agreeing to lead the forces of Hell in return for a chance to see his beloved Wanda, White becomes \\"Spawn\\" - an unstoppable warrior clad in living armor - and returns to Earth.  Forgetting the deal (and just about everything else) when he first returns, White gets a rude wake-up from \\"The Clown\\" (Leguizamo), one of Hell's more lewd minions.  (Clad in what looks like gallons of laytex, Leguizamo's hard to recognize - for years, I thought Chris Farley had the part).  When the his dirty jokes don't make the point clear enough, Clown morphs into the horrible \\"Violator\\" a hulking terror that tosses Spawn around like a rag-doll.  Though not quite in league with old scratch, Spawn can't divorce himself from the pact since obeying it will allow him a shot at Jason Wynn.  Wynn, learning of Spawn's pursuit of him, and still thinking himself in league with Hell, has himself implanted with a device triggered to detonate and release huge stockpiles of the deadly gas, should he should die.  Spawn doesn't know about the implant, but then Wynn doesn't know that the devil is playing him and Spawn off each other.  With its unspeakable powers, the forces of Hell could overrun the world, but even the devil must follow the laws of irony (in short, the plan is for Spawn to freely kill Wynn in revenge, and thus release the toxin that will destroy our world).  To balance out evil, the forces of good have their own warrior - Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson, and no, he doesn't redo the Merlin act from \\"Excalibur\\") - who tries to show Spawn that he still has free-will, and that his powers can defeat evil.  While Spawn eventually turns to the way of good (dark powers, living-armor, machine guns and all), the tug of war between good and evil insures that we'll see a lot of those powers and other CGI.<br />So what's wrong with this movie?  The plot is convoluted - the elaborate plan by which Spawn will destroy all live on Earth by killing Wynn seems like irony for irony's sake.  Since the devil is neither a real character in the story nor the hint of a bigger character (he appears as a big CGI affect in one of the supposedly climactic scenes) it's hard to see the plan as actually being a plan put in motion by a character, instead of just an excuse to plump the plot.  Actually, there aren't any real characters at all - once White's outer body is stripped, he never forms anything real to replace his identity.  Wynn is just odious, Cogliostro just noble, Sweeny is just...well, Sweeny.  The script gives a lot of attention to the Clown, but then he becomes the Violator, and his character disappears entirely (which is little loss, since the Clown's good for nothing but vile and obvious jokes - the worst one delivered at the end after he's been de-capitated.The sanitized version of that line is the single least-inspired TV-edit ever).  The action sequences lose it after a while, boiling down to pointless CGI romps.  During the climax set in Hell, I kept wondering - \\"what the hell's going on?\\"  There are no funny lines, memorable characters or anything else to stick in your head.  This flick is like \\"The Phantom Menace\\" with pitchforks instead of lightsabers.  McFarlane once said he was ready to go on the sequel - all he needed was the cash (I don't remember how much he said, though $40 mill sounds familiar).  Hollywood must be full of guys with the same idea, but at least some of them could have done a better job than this.  In short - it's just no fun.
006016848X|4.0|Ashley Romano<BR>Book Review<br />Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, is a book on real life relationships. It talks about the different languages men and women speak, and how to deal with them, how to score points with the opposite sex, how to ask and receive support, how to avoid arguments and basically all you need to know in order to have a happy and successful relationship. Author John Gray does an amazing job in representing both men and women's point of view on everything. Typically you would think that since Gray is a male he would talk more about men and how they are superior, but he does not. You can see that he did a lot of research and probably interviewed many people, especially women, before sitting down to write this book. <BR>After reading the first chapter of this book in my expository writing class, I immediately wanted to read the rest of it. I went out a few days later and brought the book, it had me hooked the whole time I read it. I am amazed at how well the author represents each and every aspect of a relationship, both by the men and women. I also think it's great how all the stuff he says is so accurate. I was reading in the book and every other minute I was thinking to myself \\"Oh my gosh, so true\\" or just laughing to myself.<BR>Throughout the book John Gray wrote some lists, mainly of common queries, or misunderstandings between couples. Those were my favorite parts of the book, because I was like, \\"Whoa this guy really knows what he's talking about.\\"  Another main thing that had me hooked into the book was how he presented everything. When he wanted to talk about how men always try and help but usually make things worse, he called it \\"Mr. Fix-It and the Home Improvement Committee.\\" The author also added in some example problems, in which he interviewed different couples. He would present you the problem, what both people had to say and then offered a solution. I think that was very effective because sometimes, just like in math class,it's all a bunch of mumble jumble, until you got an example, then you totally understand it. <BR>This book is a necessity for everyone, both men and women. At some point everyone is in a relationship, successful or unsuccessful. This book can help you understand you partner better, especially if you are in a relationship right now. If you are not you can better understand why your last relationship failed if you are unclear, or learn how to make the best of your next relationship. I believe that anyone who reads this book will get a lot of humor out of it, because the author hits everything right on the nose, so its completely accurate and will have you laughing. You will also learn a lot from this book I think, so I give it a thumbs up and recommend it to everyone, whether you are fifteen and beginning to experience relationships or eighty five and have experienced them for a long time.
6302869390|5.0|To the recording and retail/distribution industry, an open letter:  Please remaster the music and release the original film on DVD!!!  Also, as bonus add more footage of all the concerts that were shot.  If the record companies do this, we will buy!  Also, please have Eddie Kramer remaster the music and release it on at least 180 gram vinyl as well as on CD and SACD, DVDA etc.  Do it all, there is no fiscally irresponsible reason not to do so!  Sadly, George is now gone and this film is a treasure for us all to enjoy.
0060920084|5.0|It's not supposed to be a serious travel book, people! Maybe it's because I have lived in many of the places Bryson describes in this book, but I recognize all these types of people he meets along the way and he is dead-on in his descriptions. This book made me a Bryson fan forever, although some of his other book never quite hit this level of hilarity (with the exception of A Walk in the Woods). I used to read this on the train to work, and I had to clamp a hand over my mouth to keep from laughing aloud!  This is one of my all-time favorite books!  Just TRY it!
0688145078|3.0|My son was given this book as a gift when baby #2 arrived.  Although he enjoys reading it, it's not my favorite.  My biggest problem with the book is the mention of bottles and pictures of bottles on many pages.  The majority of newborns in the US are breastfed, and the promotion of bottle feeding as the \\"norm\\" is bothersome.  In fact, the book encourages the new brother to help feed the new baby.  Although my 2 year old is too young to understand, older kids may feel as though they're \\"missing out\\" if mom is breastfeeding and big brother isn't able to help with feedings, as shown in the book.
6305878323|5.0|This is my favorite musical of all time. It's wonderfully done, and the story is excellent. Julie Andrews did a great job in her first ever cinematic role, she plays a magical nanny that comes to a rich man's house in order to bring the family back together. What I love about her performance is that she looks very confident and so straight forward and firm, not as playful as you may think. The film also has Dick Van Dyke in the role of Bert, who is a very good friend of Mary Poppins and also handles magic very well. That role was funny and very entertaining(the accent is a bit confusing though), and i loved all of his dance numbers, especially Step In Time, the dance on the roof-top. Another excellent performance was David Tomlinson, who did the role of George Banks, the father of the children. He is very firm and strict, but he can also be very clumsy and forgetful, which is another reason I liked him. His song The Life I Lead was also great. This film was prized with five well-deserved Academy Awards, for the excellent Film Editing, the Visual Effects, like the jump into the pavement picture, the tea party on the ceiling and the smoke ladder, the excellent score, the song Chim Chim Cheree, which may have not been the best song, but one of them had to win, and last but not least, the excellent (oscar-winning) performance by Julie Andrews. I cannot find any more words for this film, so I'll leave you with one word. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

As you watch this fantastic film you will see the ups and down of Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) and Danny's (John Travolta) love. At Rydell high the teenagers get up to allsorts, but nothing could stop them doing it. The film was made in 1959 and this musical will make you want it over and over again. Be thrilled by the way it is made and come to the edge of your seat as Grease Lightening is raced at Thunder Road. <BR>Remember GREASE is still the word.
B0000640VO|5.0|Although MAYBE a little too mature for me, I loved Amélie. There were 2-4 nude scenes, but besides that, I loved it.<br />Somehow I find it more difficult to comment on movies I liked. Perhaps this is because praise is harder to put into words than complaints, and merit is often less tangible.<br />\\"Amelie\\" is a movie I would highly recommend. I know, I know: it's already been labeled an international hit, but this is one of those rare occasions when a movie deserves the praise it has been showered with.<br />It's fresh, original, beautifully shot, and features a memorable score that helps create its very special atmosphere. It leaves you with a wonderful feeling, like \\"an orange-coloured day\\", when nature is in bloom and harmony, inviting you to the celebration of life. It endows your memory with a picture album of those colourful, dynamic, artistic, often poetic sequences of which it is composed.<br />\\"Amelie\\" is not a simple fairytale, as some might think. There's a bit of everything in it: romance, mystery, philosophy, brilliant humour and whimsy. It touches upon many issues, but never \\"in your face\\". Obviously, it wasn't meant to mirror reality, so don't try to find flaws here. And I wouldn't encourage viewers to question some of Amelie's actions from the moral standpoint. Doing so would be taking the film too seriously, instead of just enjoying its mischievous twinkle.<br />The plot is well-woven and a pleasure to follow. I've seen the movie several times, and it hasn't yet lost any of its charm. It isn't perfect, at times overly sentimental, but I would generously give it 9/10, for all of the above and for making my day. :)

B00006YXEK|5.0|Having heard \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" previewed before the album was released, and really enjoying it, I was looking forward to hearing the finished product. It is a great delight when you already like the single, but it ends up not even being your favorite song! While Paul can always write an emotional song that sobs, George has always been able to write one that rocks. <BR>The CD opens with \\"Any Road,\\" a spiritual musing with a Wilbury sound that just pulled me into the album. Other favorites are \\"Looking For My Life,\\" \\"Marwa Blues,\\" a beautiful instrumental that makes the most of George's great slide guitar, \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" already mentioned, and the grand finale \\"Brainwashed,\\" complete with chanting by George and Dhani. But really, no song should be left out. Jeff Lynne's sensitive production brings George's warm voice to the front of the mix, and I much prefer it to the sound of \\"All Things Must Pass\\" where George seems smothered in the echo chambers, the mariachi trumpets and the \\"wall of sound.\\" George, Jeff, and Dhani--thank you for this work of art!
B00006LIRI|5.0|I'm french. So i could find luckily the english version which includes &quot;the fly&quot;.<BR>Some people talk about lemon, walk on, etc... I can explain with my experience as a french man, why there is no of these songs.<BR>In some countries, indeed, the songs are not famous at all. For example, from the &quot;all that you can'tleave behind&quot; album, only &quot;beautiful day&quot; had a lot of success in France !<BR>I agree that these are very good songs but teir omission is forgivable.<BR>More other, contrary to certain fans'opinion, i think new remixes are better than originals.<BR>To finish with, I can't explain why some people dislike &quot;the first time&quot; as they hated &quot;All i want is you&quot;. these songs show how u2 is able to make good true ballads<BR>As a conclusion, i would say that U2 is great and shows with songs as &quot;one&quot; or &quot;beautiful day&quot; that the group remains the best in the worl.
1586210912|4.0|This book is amazing. If you have ever needed a swift kick in the butt to encourge you to do something with you life this is it.  It tells you to think with you head and not with your emotions.  It encourages you to think big and use your imagination.  Those who use their imagination and take risks are the ones who make money.  Never say you can't afford something, ask yourself how can you afford something.  Make money your employee have it work for you, not you work for it.  This book is so easy to read and it's quick.
B00006M183|2.0|I was let down by this one.  It has a couple of decent tracks ... otherwise not that good.  Sorry EV, still think you are cool.
B000070WJE|5.0|Come on America, give this bloke a chance of cracking the American market, listen to this CD a few times and you will realise just how good it is. Like every album he has released the more you hear it, the more hooked you become, the catchy lyrics and fine orchestral backing really make him stand out from the crowd. You really don't know what you're missing, give it a go, you'll not regret it.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I would give this album four stars alone for the absolutely beautiful cover of one of my favorite songs of all time, Joni Mitchell's 'A Case of You'.  But fortunately, it has a lot of other great moments.  After hearing this I would defiinitely shell out money to see Krall in concert.  I love her cover of 'Fly Me To The Moon' as well.  She has a very rich voice, and she decorates it with stacatto notes throughout.  I plan to check out her other albums.  She definitely sold me on her.
B00006BTCA|5.0|...as well as Best New Artist of 2002. It's a rare occassion that a recording blows me away, particular with several thousand cd's in my collection.  However, when I heard this playing in a record store a few months back, I had to have it.  The fact that it was only [inexpensive] only sweetened the deal (no reason to wait to find a used copy).  Since then I have listened to at least one track almost everyday. I drove 1.5 hours to see them in SF (@ Bottom of the Hill), however was stopped short (only 3 people in line in front of me) of getting inside to see them.  I only found out that they were going to be playing in NY while I was there (and for three dates) too late to get tickets. ...P> To cut to the chase....all the hype surrounding them is well-deserved.  Interpol are reminiscent of all the \\"post-punk\\" bands I grew up with (The Chameleons, The Sound, The Dream Syndicate, & yes, Joy Division too) & had turned me on to rock 'n roll after AOR radio (w/ the likes of Boston, Rush, Lynryd Skynryd, etc.) had almost killed it.  At the same time, Interpol don't sound like a cheap imitation of any one of these groups.  For me, none of the attempts by US bands in the 90s to capture the energy, rebelliousness & innovation of the punk/post-punk era succeeded (except maybe Nirvana.....and Sonic Youth, who were still at it).  One reason is that these groups weren't very musical (Green Day, etc.) and their lyrics weren't particularly creative.  Another reason is that it really was the music that compelled the 80s bands. Most of the 90s bands began w/ an MTV video, a major label contract & $$$ in their eyes.  As a result, I largely switched over to electronica or the more heavily produced of the pop & rock scene (Pulp, Spiritualized...) over the past decade.<br /> However, Interpol & The Strokes have changed that. Now I'm not only checking out some of the new crop of lo-fi & DIY bands, but also popping in some of my favorites once again (Gang of 4, The Slits, The Pixies). <br />....So how does the album sound? Well all the comparisons are only partially true, as Interpol really do have a unique variation on a familiar theme.  You need to have a listen for yourself.....and for less than the price of a movie, there's little risk involved.
B000006OAM|5.0|Natalie's 1998 release, &quot;Ophelia&quot; broke the Top Ten in its debut week.  Yes, many of the songs are dark, depressing, but oh so beautiful.  I'll give a run down on each song:<br />Ophelia - very cool - kinda new age sounding.  great lyrics<br />Life is Sweet - beautiful ballad about a girl who's troubles will go away if she keeps thinking positively.<br />Kind and Generous - Fun song to listen to.  Natalie thanks all her fans in this song.<br />Frozen Charlotte - probably one of my favorites from this album.  Great piano work on this song.<br />My Skin. - about a woman who has cancer and wants her husband to make love to her one last time.<br />Break Your Heart - song written for the twenty-something generation.  &quot;Don't think everybody is gonna choose your side&quot; is the best lyric in this song.<br />King of May - ode dedicated to Allen Ginsberg<br />Thick as Thieves - my favorite song off this album.  Great guitar work at the end by Daniel Lanois.<br />Effigy - a Tibetian funeral song.  it's ok - not my favorite song in this album.<br />The Living - a beautiful ballad written about a man who wants to commit suicide.  <br />When they Ring the Golden Bells - A great folk song - Natalie's a natural at singing this song.<br />ALL OF THESE SONGS are great.  Go buy it now, you won't be disappointed!  Don't listen to the negative reviews because one way or another, all of these songs will make you feel what Natalie is feeling.
0380730367|5.0|When Patrick Kenzie's 'friend' commits suicide he finds it difficult to reconcile her demise with the life of the gentle woman he knew.  Thus begins his search into the mystery surrounding her death. With his partner and sometimes lover Angela Genarro he discovers the psychotic killer who has terrorized his friend. Now he and Angela become targets of this sadistic madman.  Stories like this have been written before but not with such frightening realism and intensity. Lehane's writing has a dark edge to it but the emotional ties between Patrick and Angela create a contrast that makes the story human and compelling.<br />I read and enjoyed this book a while ago and I'm still waiting for the next entry in this incredibly well written series.
B00005RFAI|4.0|.....Pink does a wonderful job with this album.  Every single song has a message and very nice melodies.  Don't compare Pink with the other crud that people call music (i.e., Britney Spears, etc.) because Pink has something to say.  She's not a sex symbol, her music is heartfelt, and I would let my children listen to her.  Very good job.
0316666343|5.0|Excellent book.  Holds a very different story line that grabs you from the first page.  Wonderful read that brings tears to your eyes and a smile to your face.
B00004Z459|5.0|EVERY SONG ON HERE IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE OTHER IT WAS THE BEST SELLING ALBUM OF 2001 AND IM NOT A BIG FAN ANYMORE BUT THERE NEW ALBUM WILL BE IN MARCH 2003!I JUST HOPE ITS THIS GOOD.
B000069CWE|5.0|At first I heard about this and was very excited about it thinking it was an entirely new album (yes im not the best informed listener). When i got to best buy it was like \\"WHAT!!!\\"  But soon i saw the Pts.of.Athrty. Video and it was kind of an enlightenment.  When my friend bought the album and i heard about the first 5 tracks it was like hmm.. i have the album now and its excellent.  Not your normal remixes.  Some are worse than the original cough enth e end cough. But deciding to buy the album and mixing all the tracks from Hybid Theory and Reanimation its now one CD that is a usual listener.  If you really like rap buy this.  If you really like Linkin Park buy this.  If your looking for a unique sound then buy this.
B00005TT77|4.0|This is a selection that my wife picked up, and as with most of her music I am very skeptical at first and sometimes am glad I gave it a chance later (ref. Barenaked Ladies, Tori Amos, etc.)  I would say that you should buy this album just to get the cool version of Revolution done by Grandaddy which is a stellar band.  I just groove that song.  The rest of it is the Beatles, which was barely acceptable done by them (IMO) and then covered doesn't help a whole lot.  If you want great rock from that era, check out the Rolling Stones.
B000068PQ0|4.0|not as good as everyone says...but still pretty good...
0345448898|5.0|Absolutely three of the best books I have ever read.  They are filled with love, sorrow, justice, courage, wisdom, and strength.  I can relate to these outstanding books on so many levels.  The love story is so breath taking and the whole scientific outlook is fascinating.  The world that Pullman creates is so convincing that you are drawn into it like it is a reality.  His messages are so powerful and the images are dazzling.  I am not one big on religion and you defiantly have to have a very, VERY open mind on religion to read these books.  They have touched me very deeply.  They have given me much to think about and I feel they are filled with much wisdom.  Though I feel these books are for more mature children. Due to some violence and matured theories. I recommend 12 & up.
B00006F7S4|1.0|this record is bad. mutations is great. how dare you rip off sarge? and call it a spoon song? well...I never...see you at fred 62 ;)
0345440900|5.0|Read at least one other overall baby-care-and-feeding book (e.g., Dr. Spock's \\"Baby and Child Care\\", or Eisenberg's \\"What to Expect the First Year\\"), but be sure to read this one too. My wife and I have found that in most cases, when other books' tips are not helpful or not working, \\"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer\\" has the answer--and where two books' advice contradict each other, \\"Whisperer\\" is usually the one to follow. (Addendum written in 2004: Looking back now, I would add that in order to solve problems specifically dealing with sleep, we found \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" to be superior.) <br />It really works for our twin babies (one month old today!). When our babies started associating nursing with going to sleep, my wife was virtually permanently \\"feeding\\" them. This book solved that problem almost instantly. We refer to it daily. It's written in a very realistic, rational style. The translations of babies' specific crying sounds and head, arm and leg movements' meanings, are impeccable and clearly true. It is true that every book is only a guide, each baby is different, and each parent chooses his or her own style and judgments. But I believe, despite the misleading mystical-sounding title, that many realistic, intelligent, and rational parents of babies would find the tips in \\"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer\\" to make sense. Tracy Hogg bases her views on years of experience with babies and parents. She uses inductive reasoning based on consistently observed evidence to understand babies' \\"language\\", which is as scientific a method as any. Her parenting techniques encourage babies' independence and calmness, encourages respecting babies' \\"self-ownership\\" (my words) by speaking to them before you lift them or touch them, and lessens parental stress. She essentially doesn't take a position for or against breastfeeding, leaving it up to the parent.<br />I also generally recommend \\"Parent Effectiveness Training\\" by Gordon for parenting older children, though I have minor reservations here and there.

B00005M91K|5.0|I have never, in my life, cried at a movie, film or television program. That is until I saw Baraka. There are things in this film that really show you things about our world that we, as North Americans, are completely oblivious to. Things that happen in our midsts, in our pasts, and can happen and will happen in our futures.  The film needs no words, because in the end, the film left me completely speechless anyway.
0553277472|5.0|by reading the first few pages. If you continue, this book will hold something of value to you. <BR>Maybe it's the state of mind you are in. When the book first came out, I was 21, invincible, &quot;right&quot; about my attitudes on every subject, questioned authority and everyone else in the world and the book didn't mean much to me then. Now, I'm near 50, have faced a near fatal health crisis, have a five year old son and am &quot;smarter&quot; or maybe &quot;wiser&quot; and do question myself, my happiness or maybe my own meaning in Life.<BR>That IS important now. I am enjoying and learning from this book.
B000002MY3|4.0|This is one of the best cd's of the 90's. All the songs are good. Sometimes she's just a little to angry, and other times, the music is a little too slow. Anyway there are a lot of great songs on here, so check it out.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I was one of the very lucky people to get a \\"sneak listen\\" to the complete soundtrack. In the past two weeks, I have listened and re-listened to this soundtrack. My favourite track is by far Number Eight: \\"Evenstar\\". It has all the choral complexity and ethereal beauty of a Thomas Tallis composition. Very Elvish. <br /> <br />This wasn't, at first listening, the same Howard Shore I'd expected. Used to the \\"heroicism\\" of the Fellowship Theme, I was unprepared for the much darker tone of the TTT Soundtrack. It has a much more sombre, almost Eastern in some places, sound. However, it fits the tone of the story immensely well, and I have added it to my short-list of favourites!  <br /> <br />The \\"Rohan Theme\\" (not actually the name of a track, but of a piece played throughout) is very enjoyable: heroic enough, with brass, but also with a very melancholy string section. It's beautiful, with an almost Celtic feel to it. <br /> <br />All in all, it's quite different from The Fellowship of the Ring Soundtrack, but that's as it should be. It's definitely gorgeous music, in the best form. Enjoy it!
B00007E8O5|5.0|The original release of Cantrell's Degradation Trip was a single disc containing 14 of the 25 songs he wrote for the album. Now, Roadrunner has chosen to release the entire two disc set that Cantrell originally envisioned when he wrote the album. The results are outstanding. The tracks from the previous release are all here, as well as a bunch of new songs which are really good as well. They don't sound like rejects. Most of the new material is just as good as the original songs. My favorite new tracks are Owned, Pro False Idol, Pig Charmer, the instrumental Hurts Don't It, and the closing ballad, 31/32. The entire album fits together extremely well and feels far more complete then the original release. If you liked the original, you should definitely check this out. On the other hand, if you didn't like the first release, then you shouldn't even bother with this. I think it's an amazing album, but it's not for everyone.
0767830555|2.0|When exposed to crummy filmaking, one's reaction can often reveal a treasure trove of information about that person. Take for example the great &quot;critic&quot; boydjt &quot;Ah-got-mah-hand-gre-nade&quot;  reaction to this acknowledged garbage. Talk about missing the boat!

0066214122|4.0|&quot;Vancouver is lovely. There is no other word for it. High, snow-capped mountains dominate the town, and the land-locked, green-shored bay with its pellucid waters makes a wonderful setting. The town itself is very American in appearance with its high buildings. Here also there can be no great expansion until Western Canada is more populous, but sooner or later Vancouver will certainly be another San Francisco.&quot; <br />-- Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1923<BR>British author of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;
B00006LSM3|5.0|Before writing here, i wanted to listen to and digest the album over a few weeks- as well as enjoy the other reviews written here...and try not to repeat what already has been better said by others...<br />to me, there has been no other album that i've waited for more than this one...i had thoroughly enjoyed Cloud Nine and have fond memories of Harrison's music back in 1987....this new album has rekindled this pleasure...<br />1.the opening track \\"any road\\" is energetic and kicks off the album almost with the same feel where the last Wilburys volume had ended...(curiously, mccartney's last album also kicked off with a track about a road-\\"lonely road\\")<br />2. P2 Vatican Blues is Cloud Nine revisted...in fact it has been pointed out that this track was originally for that album...i love the bluesy retro feel to it...<br />3. Pisces Fish has been a track that has grown on me with repeated listenings...great lyrics...Harrison was a maturing artist to the very end...<br />4. Looking for My Life...i don't know if this track is well positioned on the album...it's a great track but suffers in being another midtempo track after Pisces Fish...i can see how some can see the album bogging down at this point...a track like Harrison's \\"horse to the Water\\" could have sparked up things right about here in the track line up...<br />5. Rising Sun...would have been my first choice for radio single (even non fans have told me, that this is the one); Lynne's instincts proved him right on this one to make it a bit more posh so as to do it justice...this was the first track that grabbed me and held me, soaring with a a beautiful slide guitar solo...<br />6. Marwa Blues...keeps the album soaring with ethereal slide guitars and a psychedelic atmosphere...no words needed for this track ..put it on the headphones and be prepared to be taken away...the most beautiful instrumental done ever by a Beatle...and if you listen close enough you will catch a familiar riff or two..<br />7. Stuck Inside a Cloud..i agree with the comments that this is classic george harrison...it has that Harrison sound all over it..have yet to tire of the melody and lyrics which are very reflective without sounding like sentimental slush...<br />8. Run So Far...i have to confess that i prefer the Clapton version because of Harrison slide guitar on that version...I wish they would have flown in the guitars from the Clapton version,and if Lynne had toned down the production a bit on this one- just this one..i remember the billboard editor referring to this track for a multi disc retrospective that Harrison was preparing...hopefully we will have a Harrison anthology with all his beautiful demos one day...including some of the originals from this album...<br />9. Never Get So Far,,,,this dreamy romantic ballad sounds the way the Somewhere In England album should have sounded...and it would have given that album a boost...just exquisite, guitars, voice, and all...a worthy succesor to cloud Nine's \\"someplace Else\\"<br />10.

B000002UDB|5.0|The easiest way for me to rate a pop album is to count how many make you want to sing along with them.  And you can do that with almost every track on this album.  This is most likely my favorite of the Beatles' albums.  You can keep your spotty White Album or Sgt. Pepper.  From the time you put on your headphones to the end of the last track you get exactly what was promised, a great trip.
0671027387|4.0|This book has all of the pieces of a masterful story:  An interesting plot, lots of twists, extreme settings, and complex characters.  Mr. Brown did an incredible job building conflict into the situations and keeping a very complex plot moving while still adding layer after layer.<br />I was slightly annoyed by little quirks in Mr. Brown's literary style (specifically reminding me of factual points he made in previous chapters and weaker characterizations), but mark those up to personal preference.<br />This is one of the stronger books along this line that I have read in a while.  Mr. Brown has earned a place on my list of authors who I look forward to reading again!
0671027344|4.0|This book seems to have a definite case of Amazon.com syndrome.  The one where all the reviews seem to consist of five stars and titles consist of \\"I'd give this five gazillion stars if I could\\".<br />Just a tip, I've found that when you are trying to decide whether or not to try something just scroll down to the three or perhaps four star reviews because they tend to be the most balanced.  I've been convinced more easily to read something by a mixed review because these tend to be the most well informed.  This probably sounds uppity, but it's quite true.<br />Anyway this book was quite interesting.  Never really read these type of books much in high school.  Can't even remember how I heard about this book.  But it was a good find.  Sure the main character goes through a little TOO much in the course of the plot like many have pointed out.  This book definitely has it's flaws.  But by the end of the book I was rather touched.  Charlie is the type of protagonist that you can't help but like.  And sure the book has too much 'emo' to it, but that doesn't bother me very much.  We need things like this to balance out the constant nonsense that we're barraged with (gets on soap box) especially the onslaught of youth culture.  It's like the ultimate oxymoron that an MTV show about narcissistic drama queens rewarded for sitting around is called the 'Real World'.  Sure not everything in this book might be completely authentic, but it tries at least.
B000005RS6|5.0|Like it even better than Made in Japan. Never really understood the widespread appeal of MIJ. I rather hear many of DP's classics than listening to a 20 minute long songs with endless ego soloing. This straight seemed to plagued many progressive rock bands in the 70's. Every song here is played to the album standard with the exception of Cascades:I'm not your lover,( which features a nice duel between Lord and Morse at the end) and the show ending Speed King. <br />Gillan's vocals are much better here than on either the Nobody's Perfect and Come Hell or High Water CD's
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has a huge voice, and \\"Stripped\\" is this 21-year-old singer's fervid attempt to grow up fast. She ricochets from breathy ballads to pithy rhythm-and-blues to quasi-gospel to rock, collaborating on most of the songwriting. <br />She also keeps flipping her image from vamp to victim to tough girl. \\"All these years you violated me,\\" she sings. \\"It's overkill, now I'm ready to fight.\\" Determined to shed her teeny pop past, she flaunts her sexuality and aggression in self-explanatory songs like \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" \\"Dirty,\\" \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" and \\"Fighter.\\" Perhaps it's no wonder she sounds overwrought in nearly every song, although she briefly quiets down for \\"I'm O.K.,\\" a song about watching her father beating her mother. <br />\\"Stripped\\" is a blast of excess that risks alienating Christina's old fans without luring new ones, and it's bursting with misguided energy
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I give it five stars because of what it stands for. The russian versions are musically better in my opinion, but the English lyrics bring it closer to home and bring out a part of our culture whos time has come to shine. Many say they are a cleverly thought up marketing gem, which they are, but this music is too beatiful to have been created only for controversy. It has heart, and most of all, it's dance music thats fun to listen to!
B00006LSM3|5.0|Folks, this is a great album.  In a sense it represents a 30 year overview of George's various musical styles.  Some tracks hint at his 70's work, others remind you more of the 'Traveling Wilburys' and Cloud Nine era.  The lyrics are deep, meaningful, and and (in my humble opinion) help to put life in perspective.  Contrary to some other opinions, I don't think Jeff Lynne overdid the production, rather his touch is (unusually) restrained.  I've been listening to the album daily for over a week and haven't grown tired of it yet.  It's a lovely goodbye present from an artist who did what he could to make the world a better place.  My thanks to George, his son Dhani, and Jeff for all their time and effort in sharing it with us.  It is a wonderful ending punctuation point to his catalog.  Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed!
0316666343|4.0|It seems this book strikes a strong cord with people--they either love it or hate it.  The progtagonist, Susie, is a richly dimensional character for whom we come to know and love.  Susie, as such, tells her story from an omniscient perspective.  I found it interesting that sometimes I felt as if I were in the room with the other characters of the novel and at other times, looking above, as Susie herself.  If you like novels focused on character development and are willing the forays into unchartered literary ground then this may be a book for you!
0380789035|1.0|I've read maybe 90-120 novels the past 4 years ranging from classics like Shakespeare's plays and 19th century Russian novels to Tolkien and Stephen King. For some reason American Gods left me with an utterly disgusted feeling after 70 pages. I threw the book in the trash at Seattle airport. Maybe it was a way too realistic description of our time and society.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore and Peter Jackson have done an unparalleled job with the Lord of the Rings--and this is no exception.

B00003CX9Q|5.0|ET is a pretty good movie.
B00006RINF|5.0|The first Lacuna Coil song I heard was Tight Rope and honestly it was in my head for days and days. <br />Comalies is a blend of goth-metal with a bit of rock and pop but it is completely a sound of their own. The keyboards are dominant throughout, and they are totally beautiful. <br />Cristina Scabbia is the hottest chick in music in my opinion and her voice does not fall short either. The way she sings the 'entwined together now' in the song 'entwined' is reason enough to buy this cd. I payed [a whole lot of] bucks for this c.d and i don't regret it one bit.<br />Gothic music with chick vocals is my new favourite.

0385473788|4.0|When I first looked at this book it just looked a boring book. But then I thought about how I had never really got a oppinion of how the 1940's were. At least from a child's point of view. As I started to read the book I noticed how it just put me right back in those day's. It made me feel like I was actually there. As I progressed I could picture everyday life for this girl. Good times and hardships and even more personal thoughts. I honestly thought I was inside this girls head. Over all I thought this book exciting and compelling.And I do recomend this book to any person who is interested in getting a up front look on how life was back then.

B000005IU2|4.0|I first bought &quot;Funhouse&quot; by Iggy and the Stooges upon its release in 1970.  Having lived in Detroit at the time it was their live shows that first enthralled me and prompted me to see if they could capture the same energy on vinyl.  Boy, they did NOT disappoint.  From the opening riffs of Scott Asheton's guitar on &quot;Down On The Street&quot; coupled with Iggy's insane growling and halfway discernible lyrics and THAT incredible drumbeat, the listener is instantly hooked. They grab you by the ears and refuse to let go.  They are the quintessential Detroit garage band (since Bob Seger never really fell into that category, IMHO) and a set blueprint for all punk artists to follow.  Their live performances, especially at the Easttown Theatre circa 1970 are beyond legendary.  Iggy would keep his fans waiting at least 45 minutes after the group was set up<BR>and ready to go, whipping the audience into an anticipatory frenzy before he even took the stage or a single note was played.  When he came out in those ripped jeans and no shirt and started his slithering routine through the first few rows it was rock and roll theatre at its best.  At the top of his game at that time, no other performer ever wanted to follow The Ig, so, of course, he always got top billing.  Funhouse indeed!
B00005JL96|5.0|i'm not a big disney fan, but i loved lilo and stitch. it portrays and &quot;real&quot; family that maybe not everyone is born into it and they might not always get along, but when it comes down to it give truth to everything a family is all about. this is the first disney that, i think, shows people as they could be in real life not the normal fairy tale people they usually show. if you want a great feel good movie that's fun as well as funny this is the one for you. on top of all this great elvis tunes and incredible animation. i highly reccomend this to everyone.

B00006SFBD|5.0|Let me start out by saying that this album came as quite a shock to me. At first i didn't really know what to say. I was literally blown away. I have been an Opeth fan for years, and this is definatly something i saw coming. My first album i bought was morningrise and since then i've been addicted to them. From their death vokills, to clean vocals, acoutic guitar passages that sooth you or break you, or heavy memorable guitar work with pounding double bass. This is what people have come to expect from opeth...what they depend on hearing. I notice some people are already bashing (or dissapointed with) the new record because they think it lacks in clean vocals and memorable songs. This is totally false (listen to A Fair Judgement for clean vocals and the rest of the album for great songs).<br />    First off every band changes in the course of their career, even the greatest bands in the world, and there is no Opeth album that is the same here people. They all hold different places in my heart and to pick one of them is like picking a needle out of a haystack. Deliverance is part 1 out of a 2 part set of cds (Damnation comes out in March of 2003). Deliverance (the heavy record) has no flaws, it's great music that makes you listen through the whole record and wonder where the time went (much like all Opeth). I can see what some reviewers mean when they say it's hard to get into. Well maybe you should give the album a chance. I sure did, and i was uneasy the first few times i heard it, but with every listen it totally grew on me. I obviously give this cd (Deliverance) 5 starts not only because it's Opeth but because its another ground breaking album. I just can't wait to hear Damnation now (mellow album) i'm sure it will be spectacular. Grab this Opeth goodie hell grab them all. I highly suggest this if you like metal with an edge.<br />I shall now close my review by mentioning Chuck Schuldiner's saying: Support Music Not Rumors! Have a good day.
B00005K3O4|5.0|i saw this movie when i was little and i hated klowns ever since... so thank you to the ones who made it :) no really its a good movie and has helped shape who i am today... my saying &quot;the only good clown is a dead one!&quot; great movie by the way... i would tell anyone who is everyone to watch it.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones has been on the best-seller lists practically all summer. And after reading her novel it is readily apparent to me why this is so. With believable characters and a plot that kept me turning the pages with cyclonic anticipation I was so drawn into this novel that I felt like I was up in Heaven watching the story unfold with Susie,the protagonist, as my personal narrator! <BR>Sebold has written a strong work of fiction that portrays evil, real-life tragedy being overcome by good, make-believe (or is it?), heavenly intervention. <BR>I'm anxiously awaiting to read Sebold's next novel, hopefully I'll not have to wait very long!
B00000IQUT|3.0|The stark presentation of this film can either be described as a brilliant delivery, or a tawdry attempt at climactic cinema.  In this case, I believe it's a little of both.  Though not meant to be a \\"fun\\" film in the least, it's difficult to say whether or not certain aspects were presented to shock or tantalize.  (The cover in and of itself is enough to entice even the most discriminating of porn-connoisseurs...)  At best, it's a highly disturbing film with a grim 'happy' ending.   Definitely not for the faint of heart.
0671799320|5.0|This book is one of those rare non-fiction books that is simultaneously huge, broad, very deeply researched and annotated, and emminantly readable.

What makes it a great book and a bestseller is the epic nature the book takes on.  The subtitle 'Epic Quest,&quot; sounds a lot like an editorial decision to sell books, but it is quite accurately descriptive of the book's evocative power.  One really gets a sense of global struggle, and Yergin's focus on the stories of individual people gives the book a very intimate feel to it.  Hense 'Epic Quest.'

0920668372|5.0|I remember being a little girl and my mother reading this book to me every night. It was always my favorite! Love you forever is a wonderful childrens book with a great story, it shows the huge amount of love a mother has for her son.  While some reviewers thought it was creepy that she drove across town with a ladder to sing to her son, to a child that shows nothing more than great love and isn't creepy at all. It is a great book and in the end it shows that her son really was perceptive to how much his mother loved him. I thinks this is a wonderful  book to share with your child. Sometimes even now that I am a teenager my mom comes up to me, give me a hug, and says... <BR>I'll love you forever, <BR>I'll like you for always,<BR>as long as I'm living,<BR>my baby you'll be.<BR>This will be a book that I pass on to my children.

B000002GYN|3.0|Let's get one thing straight; the Eagles are not the Beatles of the seventies! They weren't great innovators, they didn't invent country rock, and they weren't the most important rock act of the seventies. However, they were a band that drew those folk and country rock influences that were already pioneered by the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Still, Nash  (and sometimes Young) into pleasing radio friendly and commercial (if overexposed) hit singles.<br />  The Eagles' debut album is a pleasing pastiche of ballads and rockers. There is a slick overall harmonic sound (thanks to Glyn Johns's mixing) that compensates for the lack of memorable melodies and originality. The most memorable tunes here were the ones that became hits: the Jackson Browne rocker `Take It Easy', the airy country ballad `Peaceful Easy Feeling' and the R &amp; B Spinners takeoff `Witchy Woman'.<br />  The Eagles' first album may not be their most memorable, but it set the primer for what was to come next.
6300988600|4.0|When it was originally written this episode had placed Spock in the dilemma that Kirk would eventually find himself in.  Changing it to Kirk benefits the entire show as it allows for some of the best Spock and Dr. McCoy clashes of will that the series would offer up.  Another change involved adding the environmental suits that were substituted for a belt device worn around the waist that provided a force field for the wearer and provided a supply of oxygen also.  Both of these alterations to \\"The Tholian Web\\" help significantly, resulting in one of the strongest entries in the uneven third and final season.<br />The Enterprise finds the USS Defiant a floating derelict but the Enterprise cannot detect anything with the starship scanners.  Further complicating things is the state of flux the Defiant is in due to a spatial interface in the unstable area of space.  Kirk boards the Defiant with Spock, Dr. McCoy and Chekov to investigate why there is no response and they discover that the crew had killed each other in a fit of frenzy.  Within a few moments McCoy reports that the area he is investigating is becoming transparent and he believes the rest of the ship will also.  Attempting to beam back Scotty explains that the transporters can only handle three at a time so Kirk remains while the others return.  The Defiant then disappears completely taking Kirk with it.  Spock finds evidence that the same spatial interface will occur in a short while and that they will make an effort to beam Kirk back aboard then.  The Tholians then encounter them, which disrupts the plans made by the Enterprise and compounds the situation with a ship to ship attack.  Meanwhile McCoy makes an uncomfortable discovery - if they remain in this area of space they will experience the same calamity as the Defiant unless he finds a cure.  Soon afterward crewmembers report sightings of a ghostly image of Captain Kirk appearing to them.<br />The few moments when Kirk appears as a 'ghost' are quite effective and thankfully not overplayed, each one happening at perfect intervals.  Instead of having Kirk wander through the starship in ghostly form, attempting to communicate, he appears infrequently precipitating the spatial interface the Enterprise is waiting for.  All of the story elements are balanced well here: the encounter with the Tholians, the disappearance and recovery of Kirk, the expected volatile dialogues between Spock and Dr. McCoy, the effects the crew experiences in the unstable area of space. Placing Kirk in an environmental suit works better than the previously suggested use of a force field type belt.  The introduction of such a device would have caused extreme complications in later episodes yet to be produced.  His ghostly appearances in the suit have an unsettling horror feel to them as well, emphasizing the idea that he is stranded.<br />The only trifle I have with this episode is the way in which Kirk is recovered.  At the moment Kirk appears onscreen on the bridge Spock has full power restored to the starship and this sudden effect throws the Enterprise completely free of the Tholians energy field and Kirk as well as soon discover because he was caught in Enterprise's transporter beam.  Hold it!  Back up a minute...just before full power is restored Spock says \\"Ready to transport on my order,\\" but he never gives the order or at least we never hear it.  However, we do know that Scotty had locked a transporter beam on the coordinates provided him; perhaps he didn't want to risk losing the captain one more time!  Also notable: McCoy ruins a perfectly good (and I assume quite costly) environmental suit - as soon as Kirk is beamed aboard the doctor gives him a shot with a needle directly through the material of the suit.

B00005JK8K|1.0|As many others, complete disappointment.  The bar has been raised as far as war movies goes with Band of Brothers, and this just plain sucks.  How hokey.  When you make a movie based on real events, we expect real action.<br />Don't waste your time or money on this dog.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Absolutely mindblowing. The sonic landscapes displayed here on this masterpeice have yet to be matched by anyone since. When I hear this, the atmospheres bring to mind bands like My Bloody Valentine, the complex prog-rock tendencies bring to mind bands like Yes/King Crimson/ELP, the piercing, ringing solos bring to mind Hendrix, as many other influences ring throughout the magnificent opus this is Siamese Dream. Yet they can pull all of this off and still remain sounding very real and NOT pretentious at all. The songwriting is highly profilic and Billy throws in some amazing arrangements which, at times, can bring tears to one's eyes. I HIGHLY recommend playing this album with a nice stereo system and speakers VERY LOUD, in the dark and just burying yourself in the emotions for a while and become immersed in all of the rich sounds and textures. It's unlike any other album i've heard. It's most certainly a milestone in rock music, comparable to MBV's Loveless. I normally don't discuss albums in the sense of being a trancendental experience, but believe me, this definaly qualifies. If you know what's good for you, you'll buy this album and listen to it as it's meant to be heard...all the way through, and to be played countless times over the years. This is the music that changes people's lives. If the first listen leaves you perplexed or confused, it might take a few listened to truly get it. All of Smashing Pumpkin's albums take some time to fully apreciate and understand as a work of art.
0151008116|5.0|I heard an excerpt of this book on NPR and from that I was hooked. It is absolutely captivating, imaginative and beautifully written. It is a linquistic marvel. The situations that Pi experiences with Richard Parker are completely believable and breath taking. You will not be able to put this book down. There was not one slow part to the book that made me want to put it down. It is like a fine red wine that keeps opening up in its complexity and color, and then tickles your taste buds for more. The book has humor, drama, compassion and faith and they are blended so wonderfully. I would recommend to anyone who likes a great story.
0151008116|5.0|Though the jacket suggests that you may end up beleiving in God, while a lofty notion, just READ this book!

Incredible, inspiring, indomitable in spirit, this book is for everyone.  I will read it again, I miss it already!
B00005B36H|2.0|Just because Tool make &quot;Prog metal&quot; and use odd time signatures and name drop other progressive rock bands like King Crimson and The Swans, this does not make them musical geniuses. Overall Tool are an average band, above average by todays music standards. While I did enjoy the darkly cynical art rock of Aenima. I think Tool tried too hard with Lateralus. Most of the songs are unecessarily long and would be just as effective if they were 2 or 3 minutes shorter. Maynard James Keenan sounds bored and he sings with no conviction. His voice is soft and whiney. The lyrics are what really turned me off this album. They are so pretentious and boring, just recite a few out loud and you got a cure for insomnia. I couldn't imagine anyone who could emotionally connect with these lyrics. Which is a shame since Undertow and Aenima had such sharp, witty and intelligent lyrics about the human pysche that could actually make the listener want to think. The musicianship has not improved greatly. Simple and repetitive chord progressions in even more complex arrangements. The drummer is still the standout musician.<BR>If you're not one of the obsessive hardcore fans i recommend you get one of Tool's other albums. This one is for the pretentious and blindly devoted fans to ponder over.
B00007BH5C|3.0|This is a much of the same as \\"Fellowship\\" soundtrack but lacks the enthusiasm. Additionally, the music which accompanies the trailer is absent from this soundtrack.

His music has been a stepping stone for so many young and inspiring artist that may not have had the opportunities before.  His dancing and singing are enough to drive a girl \\"mad\\".  His footwork and artistry are magic.  THRILLER was the start of a new beginning for him and for many of Americans who love him.  I've been a fan since I was 9, after watching the THRILLER short film, (which I now own).  I am now 29 and still follow his music because his music has touched me in so many ways.  One of his songs; off his DANGEROUS tour, inspired me to write a book.  My children love his music also.  My boys imitate his movements, or at least try to.  As long as our kids show interest, HIS MUSIC SHALL NEVER DIE!!!! devoted fan---Felicia Minix from Louisiana
6303965415|3.0|Evidently, to love this adaptation,  it helps if you're a Hinds fan. I'm not, which partly explains why I'm not satisfied by it. I say this as someone who has read all six novels and who enjoys almost all of the adaptations, including the old BBC ones. <br />I picture Wentworth as a livelier, younger-seeming man, a smile never far away. Someone you'd enjoy being around. Hinds' portrayal is rather dour, even cold. In the scene at the Bath concert, where Anne's cousin is paying her attentions, Anne practically begs him to stay, but he is cold to the point of humiliation. Sorry, at that point I wouldn't care if he came back or not.<br />Amanda Root would not be my first choice for Anne. I pictured her as a bit more elegant and poised. However, I did like her better with repeated viewing. <br />It's a fairly small budget production, and for some reason they often shot in small, cramped, dark locations. I believe this was to give it a realistic feel, but it only succeeded in contributing to a dark, claustrophobic mood.<br />One other (small) criticism I had was the scene with Lady Dalrymple and her daughter. It was over the top. Lady Dalrymple especially looked like she belonged in an opium den. I guess it was supposed to be humorous, but it gave me the creeps. The point of those characters was to satirize wealth, connection and snobbery. It seemed pointless to make them so weird. <br />So, on the whole, I would watch other Austen adaptations before this one. I think the definitive Persuasion is still to be made. A note on the book: it is one of the most accessible of all the six novels, and I recommend reading it.
0066214122|1.0|I waited for the release of this book with such anticipation and was so let down. There wasn't an iota of originality and no cutitng edge sci fi tale told. This was the most disappointing read of my life and it is from an author that I've loved all my life so that made it worse. I ended up reading my sister's new favorite book Cloned Love.
B00007E8O5|5.0|For all of us who have already purchased the single CD-edition of \\"Degradation Trip\\" it may seem like this is an unnecessary listen, but please let me implore any previous fans of Jerry's work, solo or with Alice, to find a way to pick this up.  The full 25 songs flesh out his musical ideas and make for a much more satisfying listening experience.  In fact, to those drawn to Jerry because of his potential to be one of the more original guitar/vocal composers in the history of heavy rock music, I'd say that the great majority of the inspired moments of \\"Degradation Trip\\" weren't on the original release.  There are twelve additional songs that, as a whole, represent the darker side of his music that defined most of Alice In Chains' songs, but were almost entirely absent from \\"Boggy Depot\\" and only hinted at in the original 13-song release of this album.  Jerry is a very apt rock musician, capable of churning out up-beat rockers and countryfied ballads, but he's at his best when he's doing his own thing: slow, unpredictable, heavy dirges of melancholy rock and roll.  His power chord rockers like \\"Anger Rising,\\" \\"Angel Eyes,\\" and \\"My Girl\\" were well represented on the first release, but to whomever wanted more of the stuff suggested with \\"Psychotic Break\\" and \\"Chemical Tribe\\" it's here in spades, and now his other musical tunes offset the overtly depressing music nicely, instead of dominating the mix.  If it wasn't for the arena rock production of most of the songs, this album might be perfect, but I'll settle for two hours of often amazing music, thinking how lucky the rock world is that Jerry keeps making his music while the rest of the mainstream hard rock world imitates.
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca is one of the most beloved films in movie history.  It is a timeless classic that has crossed over from mere entertainment into pure Americana.  Lines like \\"here's looking at you kid\\" and \\"play it again Sam\\" are part of our lexicon and \\"As Time Goes By\\" is practically as famous as the movie itself.  Humphrey Bogart is dashing as club owner Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman is luminous as his former paramour Ilsa Lund who comes back into his life with her husband Victor Laslzo played by Paul Henreid.  This sets up a love triangle that famously concludes on the airstrip.  Director Michael Curtiz won the 1943 Best Director Oscar for his work and the film won the Oscar for Best Picture as well as writers Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch picking up the Oscar for Best Screenplay for one of the most memorable screenplays of all time.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Another experimental album for Radiohead and a companion piece to KID A which was recorded during the same sessions. There's plenty of tweaky electronics, but a fair amount of guitar too (althouwhat an exiting life you must lead!gh not much actual rockin' out). It's a record that conveys blurry strains of confusion and mourning. \\"Pyramid Song\\" is beautiful, the way its piano achingly hesitates in its musical progression. \\"You and Whose Army?\\" is a moving song musically although it doesn't sound very threatening compared to what the title implies - unless you imagine it's sung from the point-of-view of someone physically weak who has the power to destroy you at his fingertips. \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac,\\" originally released on KID A has been recast in a more mournful light, yet it still sounds strangely uplifting to me. \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" conveys what the detached and opaque world of autism must be like - fluttering, fleeting and senseless. A brilliant piece.<br />I just mentioned a few great songs but they're all great, actually. No filler, although this experimentalism isn't going to appeal to everyone. Don't put this on at a party ...
0060920432|1.0|Man will always continue to seek the meaning of life.  Each generation asks what purpose they serve to bring true meaning and purpose to existence.   Without purpose and a greater good, man suffers in mediocrity and daily chaos. Most people desire to achieve a new goal or higher status in life only to discover that once obtained, dissatisfaction occurs and a new goal must be established.  It is this intuitive hunger for achievement beyond that which we possess that prevents long-term happiness and peace.   Most people never utilize positive entropy to find true fulfillment but continue in the dark, an abyss, which consumes their daily lives.   <br />Throughout the book, Csikszentmihalyi hinges his flow premise on the idea that man through evolution continues to gain more freedom and consciousness.  He cites the Protestant reformation and the American Constitution as moments in time that freed man from existing ideologies and oppression from either the Roman Catholic Church or the aristocratic government as examples of this evolution of our consciousness. [pg. 22]  It is my belief these negative entropies were actual paradigm shifts that occurred because man naturally desires freedom over oppression and tyranny. <BR>The author does not address how our physical well being affects our physic energy?  Depression, a chemical imbalance with the brain or physical discomfort from the pain of an injury can play a major role in how we perceive the world.  Granted, our days are full of choices.  We can turn negative entropy into a positive attitude; however, there can be a lack of control over consciousness because of the physical or chemical imbalances that occur along the journey of life.  Where does one find happiness when our physic energy is affected beyond our control? <br />Personally, I regard the ideas of Csikszentmihalyi and other philosophical writings like his as man's feeble attempt at achieving \\"god like\\" status.   If he had read scripture not as simply a bibliography, but as a guide on how to live, believing in its divine inspiration, his heart would be opened to see the entropy of God's flow.  He would find the happiness he writes about and the true awakening of a slumbering consciousness.

6305127638|5.0|First I would like too say that I am not a star trek fan. In fact I hate star trek. But star trek first contact was the best star trek movie I've ever seen. I own the DVD version. The sound and picture are good. the story in star trek first contact while good and does not let up is nothing special.Time traveling as everyone knows has been done before in countless movies. Star trek first contact has everything from space battles to some comedy and a little drama. this great movie can be enjoyed by any star wars fan or babylon 5 fan. as for the villians in this movie they are called the borg (any true star trek fan knows who they are) but for those who do not know the borg they are cyborg like beings that take over everything that cross there path. you do not reason with them you do not talk to them you battle them. I just wish that they filmed more star trek movies like this. I hope that the up coming star trek nemesis movie is like this one or better but I myself am not going to put much hope as everytime I watch a star trek movie it is a big and I DO MEAN A BIG disappointment. I also recommend star trek deep space nine the way of the warrior part one and two. this can also be enjoyed by any fan of star wars or babylon 5.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Well, it goes without saying that Barbra Streisand is the greatest performer of all, but I think it is about time she released a cd of new songs. We have had enough of \\"Greatest Hits\\" and \\"Compilations\\". We understand she no longer wants to perform live,we understand she has let 7 years go by without a movie, but we do not understand why she has recorded only two new songs in a year's time, when she says she loves recording!!!!! Come on Barbra....think of your fans. We love you and need to be inspired by your voice every year. Love, J.C. Brazil.
B000001E18|5.0|Like all classics, U2's Zooropa takes some time to understand and appreciate. At first listen, its not as accessible as Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby. But, in true classic form, it grows on you slowly but surely and remains timeless. In fact, it just gets better with age.<br />Like most, Zooropa didn't excite me at first. I thought U2 had truly gone off the deep end, but, after a while, I changed my tune and now it ranks #2 in my all-time favorite U2 albums (second to only Achtung Baby!). That's no small feat!<br />This is U2 at their most experimental, their most chaotic. It's as though, with this album, they wanted to get as far away from making a U2 album as possible, and they certainly suceeded.  Songs like the title track, &quot;Lemon,&quot; &quot;Babyface,&quot; &quot;Dirty Day,&quot; and &quot;The Wanderer&quot; (with eery vocals by Johnny Cash) sound like the work of an entirely different band at first listen. After a while, though, its obvious that all the elements are there, and the band is at their best.<br />The two songs on this that received the most airplay are &quot;Numb&quot; and &quot;Stay (Faraway So Close).&quot; While you can skip over &quot;Numb&quot; and not miss anything, the latter is quite possibly the best ballad the group has ever done. Give it a listen!

B000001DTM|5.0|With 1991's &quot;Achtung Baby,&quot; U2 reinvented their sound, their style and themselves all at the same time.  It was 1987's &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; that truly made them superstars but by the time they concluded their tour supporting the &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; album, everyone (themselves included) seemed a little tired of their spiritual-esque, humbled roots-rock.<br />Like no other artist before them, the biggest band of the 80's disappeared off the radar and returned in 1991 with a new style, a new sound and a new attitude.  Oh boy did it work! Not only did the album prove just how versatile the band is, but it quickly became a classic and is undoubtedly their finest hour.<br />From the opening track, &quot;Zoo Station&quot; to the closer, &quot;Love is Blindness,&quot; there is a sense of pathos and urgency present on this album, like no other album I have ever heard.  Much of it was recorded in Berlin as Communism was falling and the world was changing. I think that has a lot to do with the overall feel and mood of the album!<br />Whether it's the rockers- &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing,&quot; &quot;The Fly,&quot; &quot;Mysterious Ways,&quot; &quot;Acrobat,&quot; or the ballads- &quot;One,&quot; &quot;Wild Horses,&quot; &quot;So Cruel&quot;(my personal favorite), this album comes together perfectly.<br />It's hard to believe thay it has been 11 years since this album was first released. I suppose that is the true testament to just how good of an album &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is.
B0000057C5|5.0|This album is Rammstein's best album yet.  With their trademark song, Du Hast and their gothic rape song, Buck Dich, Rammstein is able to deliver a gothic mind-blowing experience that you won't forget.  Rammstein is my favorite band, and should be one of all metal heads' favorite bands.
B00006LIRI|5.0|Simply an amazing collection of work from the best band in the world!  U2 fan or not, you can't help but enjoy every track on this album.

Feel the amazing rhythms of the bandmates!  A great CD!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is the best band in my opinion, there is no other band like them. Most bands sound alike, but not like Tool! Lateralus was the first cd i had purchased and the songs from that album where the first for me to hear from Tool.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|If Marvin the Martian was indeed waiting for the \\"Big Kaboom\\", this was it! Recorded in late 1977 and unleashed on the world in February 1978, this album is indeed the motherlode. Not only one of the greatest debut albums in rock history, but one of the greatest albums ever, period. <BR>It's the total package- Great classic tunes, great rythm, great solos, great guitar tone and live onstage, well, these guys where cuttin' heads big time. This album served as a blueprint and inspiration for many, from Def Leppard to Guns n' Roses. Even newer bands like System of a Down and Incubus speak of growing up on VH. Scary thing is the album was done in like 2 weeks and the tunes you hear on the album are usually the 1st or 2nd take done! It captures a young wild band playing live & goin' ballistic in the studio. Overdubbs damn near non-existant on this album. They where so good and seamless at combining rock, metal, pop, blues, funk, big vocals, shred and the kitchen sink! They formed a huge rock sound that many learned from and where inspired by.<BR>Eddie Van Halen was like 21, maybe 22 years old when they recorded this album. It is stunning what he lays to tape on here. And to think he did it on a cheap homemade guitar he slapped together as a teen! Not bad for a guy who never even had a single guitar lesson. Frank Zappa said after hearing this album \\"Eddie Van Halen has reinvented what the electric guitar can do\\". All from Randy Rhoads to Steve Vai to Kirk Hammett to Slash to Dimebag Darrell to Jerry Cantrell have given their respect to this album and to this band. Even legends like Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Brian May and David Gilmour all give VH their love and respect. <BR>This album is tight- 11 cuts, no filler, classic front to back. This album caused so many to pick up a guitar and to form a rock band we couldnt even begin to count.<BR>The album cracked the top 20 and went platinum in 1978, which was pretty sick for a brand new band that had just hit the scene. There wasnt even MTV till late 1981!! Overnite it seems they became the new Kings of Rock. <BR>This album has sold over 10 MILLION copies in the U.S. alone! Beginning with this album, VH fired off 12 consecutive multi-platinum albums between 1978-1996! It all starts here with this classic. Man this album still jumps out of your speakers and smacks you upside your head. Hard rockin', fun, melodic, simply timeless.. If you dont own this, well, you're a lost cause basically... Diamond David Lee Roth, Mike Anthony, Alex and Eddie Van Halen. Well done gentleman.. =VH=
B00005JLWL|5.0|In the nation of Libria, there is always peace among men. The rules of the Librian system are simple. If you are happy, you will be arrested. If you cry, the law will hunt you down. If you read a contraband book or so much as look at a smuggled painting, you've committed a crime. To keep the peace, citizens must take their daily doses Prozium, a powerful designer drug that stops feelings dead and keeps everyone on an even keel. Refuse to take the drug and special police will find you. Up until now, top-ranking government official John Preston has believed in this system, has upheld the system as a highly-trained \\"Cleric\\" who seeks out and destroys those who don't take their pills. But then he skips his own dose of Prozium--and discovers an incredible new world of sensation that gives him the passion to fight for freedom.

B000065U6O|5.0|Hitler wrote MEIN KAMPF, he gave lectures, he wrote letters, he campaigned on the destruction of 'Capitalistic Jewry', and he had a personal film-maker, Leni Riefenstahl.  She captured the anger and angst of the post World War I Germans and their enthusiasm for a leader who promised to make Deutchland great again.<br />TRIUMPH OF THE WILL is a triumph of film-making, and thankfully nothing else.  It's hard to imagine a world that might today be overrun by the Nazi jackboot and not shudder.  The black and white film along with the extraordinary camera work, massive rallies (notice the bizarre cult and occult overtones), and subtitles give us a rare -though very scripted to be sure- look into the Third Reich before it threw the world into disarray.  Interestingly, we get a lot of material meant to reinforce Hitler's idea of 'volk' lifestyle: communal eating and bathing among the German military, 'normal' German women participating in what appear to be calisthenics and other dance-type arts, children being acclimated to the machinery of warfare (this is perhaps the creepiest thing about the entire film aside from Hitler mentioning in a night speech that he was there to do God's work...ugh.)<br />An important historical document, example of propaganda film and a painful reminder that Hitler was at least a man of his word; he spoke about taking over the world and sending superior German culture to the farthest reaches of earth, he spoke of destroying the slav and the Jew.  We just didn't listen.  It's funny, but someone made a comment about the President's speech after 9/11 and tried -miserably- to compare it to this film.  Let's be clear on one thing:  radical Islam is NO different a threat than Hitler's thousand-year-Reich, except that Hitler did not have the variety of weapons and world transport that terrorist organizations have today.  Let this film be a lesson to us all: we need to rise up and fight tyranny in all forms.  Our President was right then and he's stillright.  Those of you who think this will all go away are deluding yourselves.  I don't need 'Bush propaganda' to convince me, seeing people jump out of those towers was quite enough thank you.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|With the upbeat tone of songs like \\"Malchik Gay,\\" (without being overly popstar bubblyish), and the seriousness of songs like \\"Stars,\\" 200 km/hr In The Wrong Lane is an album with a good mix. Though many people have doubted Yulia and Lena's talent because of the exploitation of their relationship (by press and their manager) and marketing of that relationship (they ARE a genuine couple, thank you!), I think they pull off it off.<br />I'm sick of hearing about a bunch talentless bubblegum pop \\"singers,\\" make room for Yulia and Lena! They have genuine talent and definite charisma. Their obvious chemistry is a turn-on as well. And their music is good to dance to! We need more fun and upbeat music like t.A.T.u.'s, that isn't as 'shake and baked' like other pop artists, or presented in a way that shows the artist really just tried too hard to sell an album.<br />\\"All the things she said\\" will definitly be 'running through my head'!
B000067CPX|5.0|Anyone that doesn't think this album is sweet should get a life right now.  It has funky tracks, soulful tracks, and flat out awesome tracks.

B00006F7S4|5.0|It took me several years to realize that Mutations was Beck's greatest CD to date. If I hadn't owned Mutations and come to that realization, I don't know what I would have made of Sea Change... the two seem almost at times to be the left and right halves of the same concept album, and both are generally light years away from the rest of Beck's work.<br />Reviewers who have called this disc 'dull' or 'depressing' may not be giving it a fair chance; appreciation of Sea Change requires you to be both attentive and a little vulnerable. If you are willing to give yourself to the music, even just for a listen or two, you will find a kind of deep, moody serenity and perhaps even joy in these tracks. You will also realize that the subtle riff and chord progressions in Paper Tiger, for example, don't simply float away into your consciousness by accident; this is beautiful music that represents a great deal of thought, work and sincerity on the part of its creator. There is as much skill here as emotion, but the former is so great that you are only ever aware of the latter.<br />But perhaps more simply, I give Sea Change five stars because it touches me. And that's what it's all about, isn't it?
B000002ULO|5.0|...And with good reason. Paul recorded this album right after working on the Beatles Anthology series. Even the title of the album is a Beatles reference. (Of course, I'm sure we all already knew that.) ;-)  Paul employed an all-star lineup to help him with this album. Most notably: Ringo Starr, George Martin, Jeff Lynne, and Steve Miller, who delivers some great guitar solos in the songs he plays on. Anther cool and interesting element is the fact that Paul supplied a bit of history next to the lyrics of each song in the booklet (a la Anthology).  The first half of the CD contains a few of Paul's greatest songs (really!). \\"The Song We Were Singing\\" makes for a great opener. Paul wisely chose \\"The World Tonight\\" as a single. It's possibly the catchiest song on Flaming Pie and has the coolest vocals. \\"Somedays\\" is an incredible piece that gives me a feeling similar to that of \\"Yesterday.\\"  The unfortunate thing about this album is that the songs on the second half are, for the most part, not as strong as the first seven. There's nothing wrong with these songs...they're just not as good. \\"Used To Be Bad\\" is a duet between Paul and Steve Miller. As is the case with just about any duet Paul has done since the Beatles, his partner's voice suits the song better than his own. \\"Really Love You,\\" the only existing song with a \\"McCartney/Starkey\\" writer credit, is unfortunately the weakest and longest track on the album. The song doesn't really seem to go anywhere (it's basically a jam, I believe)...and Ringo's repetitive \\"boom-THWACK\\" drumming pattern doesn't exactly make the song any more exciting. \\"Beautiful Night\\" (in which Ringo also plays drums) is awesome, and surprisingly a song which had been on the shelf for nearly 10 years! It's the closest thing to a trademark McCartney piano ballad found on this album. The chorus is powerful and the tempo speeds up at the end, making the song even more interesting. Ringo also sings backing vocals in this part. The song ends witha rush of band chatter, reminiscent of some of the songs on the original Let It Be album.  \\"Great Day\\" & \\"Little Willow\\" are good songs, but really nothing too special compared to \\"Calico Skies\\" & \\"Somedays,\\" found earlier on the album. The demo-like \\"Great Day\\" offers a short, sweet closing to Flaming Pie.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|It's like having someone fart in your living room for 90 minutes.<br />What a lemon.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|\\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is 102 minutes of pure hell, torture, agony, sadness, and pain.  And yet.... I loved every minute.  This is filmmaking at its best.  This is a film that wasn't made for the sole purpose of making money, hence why this is not a \\"Hollywood Movie.\\"  Directed by the man who brought you \\"Pi,\\" Darren Aronofsky, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is about how the path to happiness and success isn't always the right one, and how some people are willing to do just about anything to get it.<br />The main focus of this film is addiction.  We are presented the day and life of addicts and what they go through when they either have their fix or don't.  Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyron, are drug addicts.  They need their fix 24:7.  And when they don't get it, the results are pretty bad.  They come up with a scheme to sell cheaper drugs for more money so they can purchase more drugs and purer drugs.  To them, this is how they can succeed.  If they save enough money, they can purchase the better life.  Well, that better life is going to come with a price tag, and the price isn't money.  The more they use, the more they need.  And the more they need, the more desperate they become, doing whatever it takes to get their next fix.<br />The film isn't only about drug addiction.  It's about addiction in general.  Anything can become an addiction.  Take for instance Sara Goldfarb, Harry's lonely mother.  Her fix is chocolate, sugar, and television.  When she gets a call that tells her she has been chosen to appear on television at a later date, she immediately runs for her red dress.  Unfortunately, with the passing years that have endured her life, she doesn't quite fit into it anymore.  So she goes to a doctor and gets a variety of diet pills.  They make her peppy and hyper.  But soon, she's adapted to them, and she wants more.  The more she takes, the more brutal affect it has on her body and mind.<br />For these characters, what seems to be the path to absolute happiness turns into a gut-wrenching nightmare.  The last 15-20 minutes are the minutes you will NEVER get out of your head, no matter how hard you try and no matter how hard you want to forget them.<br />I was so blown away by this movie.  I had heard so many good things about it and after seeing \\"Pi,\\" I knew that it was something I would have to see soon.  The movie may be pure hell and torture to watch, but it is done in such a brilliant and enriching way.  The camera movements, shots, and cuts are all so well-executed.  Aronofsky uses his camera techniques to get you right inside of all of the characters' heads, allowing us to experience exactly what they are going through.  People have complained about how all over the place the camera is during the movie, but the whole point is to make you go through exactly what the characters are going through.  It also shows us how fast a fix can take place and how short it is lived.  It wouldn't had been effective if it were done in any other way.<br />The acting was great.  Ellen Burstyn is so great in her role as Harry's mother.  I don't think there's anyone else who could've gotten the job done.  Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are also terrific in their roles.  You could tell that they were absolutely determined to get their characters down in order to make the story work.<br />As disturbing and unsettling as this movie is, I feel it is an important one for people to see.  Sure it's unrated, but this is something I think they should make mandatory viewing for junior highs and high schools.  Anyone who is thinking of using or experimenting with drugs really needs to see this movie.  I'm sure they'll have second thoughts.  I myself have never done drugs, and seeing this movie reinforces the fact that I will never, ever do drugs.  EVER.<br />The DVD is great and really does the movie justice.  (The menu's hilarious.  It really had me fooled.  I know some of the other reviews gave it away, but I'mnot going to.  You'll see what I mean when you get to it.)  The picture and sound quality is sharp and breathtaking.

B00005M989|4.0|It's common knowledge that by now, Prince's days of Top 40 hits are well behind him.  Still, some of his songs are receiving radio play on the 80's stations and are attracting young listeners who may be curious about more of his music and don't know where to start.  This review is intended especially for those wanting to know where to &quot;sample&quot; Prince to see whether or not they'd want to buy anything else by him.<br />Basically, as listed in the previous reviews, this is a chronological listing of 17 Prince songs from the first 15 years of his career.  While several of his truly &quot;best&quot; songs are not included here, it is still a pretty good representation of what Prince is capable of at his best.   <br />If you then find that you enjoy this album and might want to get another Prince CD, this would be my recommendation:<br />If you particularly enjoy the first 10-11 songs of the &quot;Very Best...&quot; album, I'd recommend buying &quot;Sign of the Times&quot; next.  &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is considered by most people to be his classic CD, but almost half of the songs from that CD are included on &quot;The Very Best of...&quot;, so I'd make the more efficient purchase and buy &quot;Sign of the Times&quot;, of which only two songs are included on &quot;The Very Best of...&quot;  <br />If you find, however, that you prefer the latter 6-7 songs on the &quot;Very Best of&quot; CD, I'd recommend buying the &quot;Symbol&quot; album next.  Unlike &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot;, none of the songs from the Symbol album appears on the &quot;Very Best of&quot; and I find it to be an equal, if not superior album, to Diamonds and Pearls.  Again, this just makes it a better buy for you.<br />Once you've bought those albums, if you want more, it's pretty much up to you which direction you'd like to go....
6305090564|4.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT,I GIVE IT 4 STARS FOR A B-MOVIE,IF YOU HAVE TESTOSTERONE FLOWING THROUGH YOUR VEINS,YOU SHOULD LOVE THIS DVD,THE SOUND ON A SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM IS FANTASTIC.TREAT WILLIAMS IS COOL AS WELL,HOPE THEY MAKE A PART 2!
B000002N9L|2.0|I am a fairly big Prince fan, owning seven of his releases, but am not so blinded by my &quot;fandom&quot; as to not recognize mediocrity when I hear it.  <br />I bought this album several days ago and have now listened to it 3-4 times, which I think gives it a fair shake.  The return to guitar-playing is welcomed, and in fact, is probably the highlight of this record.  It is probably Prince's most guitar-oriented record since Purple Rain.       <br />But it wouldn't be a truly great Prince record without his booty-shaking funk and rip-roaring melodies, and those are missing here for the most part.  The title track and &quot;Dig U Better Dead&quot; are solid tunes, but still don't compare with anything from &quot;Sign of the Times&quot; or the &quot;Love Symbol&quot; albums.  &quot;Dinner with Delores&quot; and &quot;I Like It There&quot; are amusing tunes with nice musical performances, but are nothing really special.  &quot;I Rock, Therefore I Am&quot; is a pretty mediocre stab at the rock-funk at which Prince has historically been so adept.  The other six songs are either forgettable or downright lousy.  &quot;Right the Wrong&quot; and &quot;Had U&quot; in particular just make me want to hit the skip button.  Prince even attempts to affect a drawl in the beginning of the former song.  Oh brother....<br />Anyway, as mentioned elsewhere in the reviews, this CD is for Prince completists only.  Try &quot;The Very Best of Prince&quot; if you want an introductory sampler to Prince's work.  It's a nice place to start....
B000001FE0|3.0|Originally titled Masterpeace, this concept album was going to be the Gibb's grand statement, ala Sgt. Pepper or Tommy. It eventually fell apart amid Barry and Robin's battling egos. We are left contemplating what might have been. Lot's of lovely songs are contained here. The haunting title track, Robin's Lamplight and Black Diamond, Barry's First of May, Marley Purt Drive and You'll Never See My Face Again all rank up there with the Gibb's better-known early material. The psuedo classical pieces might have worked had the original concept come to pass, but over time the three orchestral pieces have not worn well. They would have been better served to edit the original album down to a single LP. In the end, Odessa can be catagorized as a noble failure...one half of a great album. IT did show that the Gibb's could be more that 3 minute tunesmiths and could hold their own as the face of pop music became more album oriented. Unfortunatly the Odessa experience would spook the Gibb's from never attempting anything this ambitious again. Too Bad. This album screams to be remastered...while Universal is at it why not issue it with a replica of it's original red flocked gatefold cover...that would be worth an extra star in itself.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|c'mon, this is one of the greatest cds of all time - writing a review is pointless!
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Yeesh.  I mean, I expected this remake of the old H. G. Wells sci-fi classic to be kinda not good, but I never expected it would be this bad.  Why would anyone want to make something this lame?  Even the special effects -- which one would assume would be the film's sole saving grace -- are pretty cheesy.  Oh, well.  Too bad nobody can go back into the past and prevent this film from ever having been made.
B000009RC2|5.0|If you picture the time and place (1970), there was a lot of \\"progressive rock\\" in the air. Of all those bands, the Mahavishnu Orchestra and King Crimson had the hardest edge (both groups could be described as \\"intense\\" as well as \\"heavy\\"). <BR>The early recordings of both groups hold up extremely well over time. This is probably because both bands created worlds uniquely their own. <BR>The Maha Orch combined the precision of a classical ensemble with the improv skills of top jazz musicians within a rock context. Think of CREAM meets BARTOK meets MILES DAVIS. <BR>Forget the religious overtones. They only get in the way.<BR>If you are interested in additional music from these players, check out THE FLOCK (Dinosaur Swamps) and DEVOTION (with Larry Young, and Buddy Miles: kind of Band of Gypsies meets Miles Davis). <BR>The first three Maha Orch albums were the best of the lot. Hey, try playing \\"Meeting of the Spirits\\" at 4:00 AM at full volume in an apartment building. Garanteed to get you evicted. Enjoy!!
B00005T33W|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot, although I feel the ending was unnecessarily (and unconvincingly) bleak and gratuitously cruel to the characters.  It felt a bit forced, as if they said, &quot;we must make this an un-Hollywood, bummer of an ending!&quot; and then just took the quickest, easiest path to make that so.  That quibble aside, this is a great film.
B000005YZM|3.0|I'm surprised to find O &amp; O on some lists of &quot;all time greatest albums&quot;. To look for lost classics of the sixties is an admirable and symphatic interest, but come on people!<br />If this had been the original vinyl version of 12 songs, I would only have listened to the A side. Am I the only one having the nasty habit of reaching for the &quot;STOP&quot; button after track number six on this CD? Thinking of it as an LP, I can't think of many other albums where the quality sinks so dramatically on the flip side. <br />To my ears, the first six songs works out well, except from &quot;A Rose for Emily&quot; which I can't possibly take seriously, and I will not even take the bother of mentioning what song it sounds like a parody of. The rest of side A is, if not superb, absolutely satisfying. I especially like the excellent use of mellotron in &quot;Brief Candles&quot; and &quot;Hung up on a Dream&quot;. Lots of good vocal harmonies as well.<br />My reason for giving this album only three stars, is that I don't like any of the songs on the rest of the album. I know that &quot;Time of the Season&quot; is beloved, but quite frankly, I can't stand that song. All in all, O &amp; O is worth having, but it's far from being a great work on the level of for instance &quot;Forever Changes&quot; by Love,  and no way does it qualify for any &quot;all time greatest list&quot; in my opinion.
6305949980|4.0|Three words, \\"BEST MOVIE EVER.\\" If you havent seen this movie before, please do! It is personally my favorite movie, along with Burton's cinematic classic, \\"Edward Scissorhands.\\" Okay, so you think it may be too scary for little kids. Well, let me give you a few reasons why it is NOT too scary:<BR>1.) There is no gore, blood, foul language, or intense violence<BR>2.) Everything is based on untrue events<BR>3.) The plot is kind and sweet. It has a good moral to the end, which is, \\"Never change who you are inside.\\"<BR>   Now that you can see why my absolute favorite movie is not too scary for kids, let me point out some reasons why \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is my favorite movie (since I was 4 years old):<BR>1.) The characters are not bad or mean (exceptions to Oogie Boogie) <BR>2.) The storyline is fun and colorful<BR>3.) The songs and script are ones that make you smile and feel good<BR>4.) It's simply a great movie you watch when wanting to sit back, and watch a WONDERFUL~ film. Please take my word for it- \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is a delightful movie about friendship, solving problems, trusting, and learning that being yourself is be
B000002JSJ|5.0|Presence is often called Led Zeppelin's worst album. this hardcore fan disagrees passionately. This album shows zeppelin's ingenious use of rythyms to elevate the songs to another level, with Jones sticking to playing the bass it just displays not only the rythym section but the whole band's incredible chemistry.Of course there are differences between this and thier other works, like the fact that Jimmy page wrote every song but one. 'Achilles Last Stand' is the opener, lasting ten incredible minutes. Page recieved criticism for using multiple guitar layers, but the effect is superb here, with jones and Bonham firing like crazy.'For Your Life' is where they start playing with the rythyms, and to great result, the song winds around Plants vocals, wich seem to be about drugs. With 'Royal Orleans', Zeppelin brings the funk to the album,(a flavor wich imitators never picked up on)and with 'Hots on for Nowhere' they initiated the big fat pauses for tension's sake. 'nobody's Fault but Mine' is a cover, and it so happens to be the best song on the album. It is a cover, but it sounds nothing like the original, and the arrangement is pure genius.'Tea For One' demostrates that Zeppelin could still get down with the slow blues, and although they had not gone that route since the third album with 'Since I've Been Loving You', it is still an incredible piece, with a different atmosphere than prieviously. Oh yeah dont forget the incredible riff that introduces the track. Led Zeppelin created a masterpiece with Presence, despite the fact that jones only played bass, and that robert Plant's voice sometimes seems to be getting worn by cigarrettes and booze. I give much credit to jimmy Page, despite his drug problem, he managed to record and mix the whole album in three weeks. Worth your money!
B00006SFLV|5.0|Probably my favorite thing about DVDs is the chance to collect seasons of most of my favorite TV shows. My So-Called Life is just one of those shows that I never thought would make it to the shiny silver discs, what with all of the rights problems that surrounded it. Am I ever glad it did. I was in 7th grade when the show first aired, so I didn't really appreciate it, even though I remember watching the pilot when it premiered. Subsequent viewings on MTV, however, made me realize how great it is. It's really the little things about the show that make it stand out. The language of the characters is spot-on, exactly how I talked in high school with 'like' and 'or whatever' peppering many sentences. The characters don't have a brand new outfit every episode. Angela has *one* jacket and wears the same sweaters, skirts, dresses, and pants like normal people do. I just like that. I really don't have a favorite episode, all of them are very good. I especially like the voice-overs done by various characters (mostly Angela, of course). The only complaint I have is the video quality of the eps. The first disc is particularly bad, noticeable towards the end of the episode 'Guns and Gossip.' Jordan's face gets very bright and there is a lot of grain.
0316666343|1.0|Thank goodness for libraries. I was able to checkout a free copy and not spend my hard earned money on this. The visions of heaven were actually disturbing to me. I'd hate to think that once I get there I still have the human characteristic of worry, pettiness, regret, longing and unhappiness.<br />By the way, she spent quite a bit of time interacting with her high school love, why didn't she instead find a way to stop George Harvey or at least help those on earth find her remains.<br />I thought the main character was selfish and self adsorbed. <br />If you MUST ready this book and its not a must, go get it at library instead.
0812548094|4.0|...but not in others. Stone of Tears is a little longer than Wizard's First Rule, which is fine, but at some points I felt like Terry Goodkind was just telling me too much. There were a lot of loooong scenes between Zedd and Adie that I just wanted to skip (which I didn't, but it took me longer to read because of it), and the separation between Richard and Kahlan was excruciating - they must have been gone from each other for at least 700 pages. But when all is said and done, there is one thing that makes this book irresistable: Gratch! The loveable fur ball formed such a bond with Richard that it was hard for me not to reach for a Kleenex every so often while reading. I think the scenes between Richard and Gratch are an indication of a good author - I actually would have been satisfied with a 1,000 page book on just the two of them! Still, despite its flaws, it's a fine sequal. It's for the most part interesting, and it has its share of intense and suspensful (and not to mention GORY) parts. If you liked Wizard's First Rule, you might as well continue with the series.
0316666343|4.0|This is not a startling new thought or book about a young girl being ... and murdered.  This happens every day in most every community.  What is so compelling is how the author sets the scene of Susie's \\"individual heaven\\".  A premise, so new to me, and perhaps to others, who really have not given much thought to there being a heaven.  As Susie freely moves into and out of the everyday lives of her shattered family and friends, you feel her pain and frustration that she cannot truly intervene and that closure will only come with......read the book - it is so thought provoking that I am rethinking my own personal thoughts on heaven and hell.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Only one word can describe this CD: beautiful. Sarah McLachlan's voice is beautiful, and her songs are beautiful. I have never liked live albums, but I heard the live version of \\"Posession\\" on the radio one day, and I just had to have the CD. This was a couple of years ago, and I'm still playing that CD today. There is not one song on the entire CD that I dislike. At first, there were a couple I didn't really care for, but just recently I got back into listening to it, and now those songs I didn't care for are my new favorite songs on the CD. It just keeps on giving! A lot of people complained that it doesn't really sound like a live album, because you don't hear too much of the audience in the background. Who knows, maybe that's why I love it so much. Still, usually I find that a live album just doesn't sound as good as the one made in the studio, but Sarah McLachlan is so talented that even when it's just her and her piano, she is amazing. If you like Sarah McLachlan at all, please add this to your collection.
0064409422|5.0|I READ THIS BOOK WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IT WAS AN AWSOME AND THE STORY IS REALLY NICE.I RECCOMEND IT TO EVERYBODY.
B000002UAX|5.0|I own probably more then 1000 albums, but this one is still my all time favorite, and heres why... every emotion of life is on this album... happiness, sorrow,laughter, rage,it moves from slow ballads to ballistic heavy metal, from the simple to lyrics that you will never forget... I could go on all day... go hit the \\"purchase now\\" button, then put your seat belt on!!!
B00006LSM3|4.0|This CD is a MUST for any Beatle fan.  With our saddness at the loss of George, this last CD is a special gift, thanks to Olivia and Dhani.  It was very kind of them to share George with us one last time.  Hearing &quot;Rockabilly&quot; and &quot;Hippie&quot; George took me right back to my teen years, when George and the Beatles were the ONLY music for me.  I feel truly blessed to have one final opportunity to listen to George's messages and songs.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Not to disparage the rest of the CD, but am I the only person who thinks track #2 is ()'s best?  I've read all the listeners' reviews and I haven't come across a single person who thinks, as I do, that this track is the most evocative, ethereal and otherworldly of the lot.  It's spacey openness and restraint creates a far more powerful sonic image than the kitschy bombast of track #8, for instance.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I like this CD a lot. It's the first No Doubt CD I bought. My favorite songs are \\"Hey Baby,\\" \\"Hella Good,\\" and \\"Underneath It All.\\" For the most part, the songs are really good and fun. Some of the songs are kinda...ya know...cheesy and silly. Especially \\"Start The Fire.\\" It's a great CD that I would recommend to anyone. If you liked any of the songs I mentioned as my favorites, or even if you just like No Doubt In general, you should buy this album. You won't regret it. If you don't like it the first time, give it a few spins and you'll fall in love with it. It's certainly \\"Hella Good\\" and I wouldn't give it up for the world. And you should buy any MARIAH CAREY albums, especially the new one, \\"CHARMBRACELET.\\" Enjoy!
B000066NW0|5.0|I have never considered buying two copies of the same cd until I listened to Avril's Let Go. This is THE pop-rock album you must have. All the songs in this album are excellent. &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; are awesome, they rock you. But &quot;I'm With You&quot; is the single that is just killing me! It is impressive how Avril Lavigne expresses rage, frustration, and hope, yes, hope,  all in just one song. This is top quality. Avril is here to stay!
B000002LND|5.0|I started out not really being a Madonna fan, and simply buying her album \\"Music\\" (which, by the way is also great!). I had heard some of Madonna's early work and really liked it. I had been interested in this CD for literally years and I now regret that I put off purchasing it for so long! I love EVERY SINGLE SONG on this album, no lying. It's a really great collection of Madonna's truly excellent early work. Despite how much I like \\"Greatest Hits: Volume 2\\", I like this one a whole lot better. All of these songs are truly amazing, my favorite is \\"Into The Groove.\\" I had heard \\"Into The Groove\\" on the radio a few days before purchasing this and I really liked it and had no idea it was on this CD! I was so surprised.<br />1. Holiday - one of my favorite songs for a long time. It's a fun tune that just won't dissapear! I hear it on the radio all the time and enjoy every second of it.<br />2. Lucky Star - another great song. I had also liked this song for a long time. It's really dancy and I like that.<br />3. Borderline - I had seen the video for this on some VH1 thing (I think it was Behind The Music orr something) and I hadn't heard the song since. I like it.<br />4. Like A Virgin - I had never heard this song before! At first, I was kinda thinkin \\"Huh? This is weird\\" but after a few spins, I really grew to like it.<br />5. Material Girl - This is another \\"Huh\\" one for me. I also grew to like it. It's one of my favorites now.<br />6. Crazy For You - This is one of those slower ones. Despite this, I still enjoy it. Although it disrupts my dancing, I still enjoy it.<br />7. Into The Groove - OMG, my favorite song! I love this song, it is so awesome. I can't help dancing whenever I hear it. If you don't (for some odd reason) buy this, at least download this song! You won't regret it!<br />8. Live To Tell - Another slow one, which catches you in the midst of your dancing craze from the danceable \\"Into The Groove\\". Nonetheless, it's still an awesome. Two thumbs up!<br />9. Papa Don't Preach - Of course this is better than Kelly Osbourne's version (at least in my mind). I really like the classical-ish intro, it's probably the best part of the song! Hehe.<br />10. Open You Heart - Another old favorite. It's great, and that's all I can say!<br />11. La Isla Bonita - LoL, my Dad told me this is one of his favorite songs. It must be good, coming from the jazz man. Anyway, it's a really fun song....<br />12. Like A Prayer - OMG, I can still see Haley and Samantha dancing to this at the Sadie Hawkin's dance. It's a really good song. I heard it on the radio on Sunday, along with \\"Holiday.\\" Love it!<br />13. Express Yourself - Ooh, I really like this song. I could skip the intro, but that's Ok, it's still a good song....<br />14. Cherish - I really like this song too... Uh yeah... Romeo and Juliet! LoL, can't go wrong with them. This song came on ironically when I was doing my \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" homework last night.<br />15. Vogue - Again, skip the intro. I dunno, some people like it, but I could do without. I loved her performance of this at the MTV awards. Nice dance tune!<br />16. Justify My Love - I love this song. It's kinda sexual, and Lenny Kravitz does a good job with whatever he did (what was it, produce? co-write? I don't remember, haha).<br />17. Rescue Me - another great song. Her voice sounds a bit like Cher, but maybe it's just me. Too bad the CD has to stop there! We need more! I believe in the power of Madonna to continue to make great music, so no worries!<br />If you really liked this, you should buy Madonna's \\"Greatest Hits: Volume 2\\" and any Mariah Carey CD's. You should especially buy MARIAH CAREY'S \\"CHARMBRACELET\\" ALBUM! It's awesome. Good luck, hope you buy this CD, I know that you won't regret it! ENJOY!/>9.

B000002I2M|5.0|This album kicks ass.  I recommend it no matter what kind of music you usually enjoy.  It is the door's best album beyond a doubt.
B00005B58Y|4.0|I do own this recording and play it with satisfaction from time to time, but, unusually for music by Miles Davis - who is on the whole my favourite jazz musician - this is one which I feel I could do without, good though it is in its best moments. I stress \\"in its best moments\\", for I feel that even the greatest enthusiast could hardly deny that there is a lot of unevenness here.  At the time the record appeared it never seemed \\"finished', somehow, and in retrospect one can see why: things hadn't quite come together, were as yet often half-expressed, but the latent greatness foreshadows that of \\"Kind of Blue\\", where it more than fully flowers forth. If you want to buy, say, 5-10 Davis records, then I would not necessarily include this one amongst them. If your feeling is that you need just about anything he produced which is of a high standard, then this would need to be included. Personally, and at the risk of sounding disrespectful, I'd probably not re-buy it if I started all over again, simply because it does not ultimately seem to me to provide anything so remarkable that it stands out as unique or not just as well or better done on \\"Kind of Blue\\" or other recordings. - Joost Daalder
B00006J3WH|5.0|I have just read the review for this by a favorite reviewer: fairportfan and I just want to give a contrarian point of view, respectfully submitted. I'll make it short. I think this episode will be remembered and performed, in the next centuries, as much as Wizard of Oz. And I am glad the actors sang in their own voices because it was so charming, but singers looking for great songs to do in albums or singles should listen to these songs. I would love Grey Eye Glances, or the Hollies, or the Searchers, or 10,000 Maniacs, or, yes, King Clave or Long John Baldry, to take a shot on singing the ballads from this episode!
B000002UA0|5.0|It's hard to say that this is even Pink Floyd when you listen to it because like most fans we grew up hearing Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Wall on the radio.  Now that I'm older (25) I have explored the catalogue and boy did I discover a gem.  Astronomy Domine is a song that may have influenced later Floyd albums.  Lucifer Sam has a James Bondish guitar tune/riff to it which is great.  Matilda Mother has a fairy tale quality to it with an arabic sounding guitar solo.  Pow R. Toc H. is just plain weird, it sounds like animals shouting with that &quot;James Bondish&quot; guitar tune in the middle of the song.  It's probably my favorite song on the album and it captures Syd's crazed genius better than any song.  Only Scream Thy Last Scream is more bizarre but it was never released, probably because of it.  A reviewer once said that &quot;it was a blood curdling pre-beefheartian lunacy tune&quot;.  <br />     Interstellar Overdrive is a classic but if they had the London 66/67 or the Jan 20th 1967 version on Granada TV performed at the UFO club versions instead I would've liked it better.  Bike is a crazy song that only Syd Barrett could get away with because he's mad without trying to be mad, it's a natural quality in him that others could never duplicate.  Flaming is a song that I could imagine hearing on an early Blur album.  People who try to sound eccentric like Syd never pull it off because there's only one Crazy Diamond.  The gold, it's in the...Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|This being the fourth collaboration with producer Rick Rubin, it's apparent that Cash is ready to go on his own. I don't think we needed covers of Simon & Garfunkel's \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\", Roberta Flack's \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", The Beatles' \\"In My Life\\", \\"Danny Boy\\" or The Eagles' \\"Desperado\\". The best covers are Nine Inch Nails' \\"Hurt\\", Sting's \\"I Hung My Head\\" and Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\"--all of which seemed to suit Cash's voice and stylings. Also, the traditional \\"Sam Hall\\" is the perfect foil for Cash--more of this please! The title song, an original, shows that The Man In Black can hold his own, and, if he really wanted to, he could do an entire cd of all originals (which he SHOULD do). Maybe the next time out Rick Rubin could just produce an all Cash penned album?
B00007BH5C|4.0|With his musical accompaniment to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" composer Howard Shore gave us an emotional ride into the haunting beauty that is Tolkien's Middle-earth. The experience, especially when joined to Peter Jackson's amazing film, was breathtaking (and I say this as an avid Tolkien zealot and a lover of music). Though The Lord of the Rings is a trilogy of films, the filmmakers' intention is for the three films to play as one (when they've all been released, that is). Therefore it should come as little surprise that Shore's accompaniment for the second film, \\"The Two Towers,\\" remains similar in essence to that which has come before it. Many of the same themes remain - those which, by now, have come to be associated with Jackson's take on Tolkien's work. To trash these beloved and familiar themes would make no sense at all - but, fortunately, there's enough new stuff here to quicken the blood. The highlight of the experience has to be \\"Breath of Life,\\" which joins Sheila Chandra's beautiful vocals to some bewitching music. The theme for the race of Man is fresh as well, and employs some splendid violin work. The battle music is appropriately rousing and full of danger - though one such bit can sound quite a lot like another. \\"The Riders of Rohan\\" sounds a lot like \\"Helm's Deep,\\" for example, with very little to distinguish them. And though I've agreed with all the score so far, I have a problem with \\"Gollum's Song,\\" which replaces Enya's wonderful \\"May It Be.\\" Simply put, the song is out of place in any adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, and it sticks out like a VERY sore thumb in an otherwise solid compilation that builds upon the music that has come before it in film one. I regret that Shore didn't get a chance to add more new themes this time around, and I definitely regret \\"Gollum's Song,\\" but, all in all, it's more great stuff that will return you to Middle-earth just as you left it.
B00006LSM3|3.0|Boy, the other reviewers have been very kind to George. As a follow up to 1987's exceptional set \\"Cloud 9\\", \\"Brainwashed\\" struck me as weak. I'm always suspicious when a posthumous recording is released long after the artist has died. \\"Brainwashed\\" is no exception. The music here is unmemorable. You can't really distinguish one acoustic guitar driven song from the others. The obvious standout track both musically, melocically and lyrically is \\"Any Road\\". This song is the perfect bookend on George's life and philosophical views. It's optimistic and reflective, with its views firmly placed on 'wherever you go, there you are'. I was hoping for a stellar closing set to George's career, but this was a big letdown. This, and Paul McCartney's latest \\"Driving Rain\\" have a very lackluster feel to them. It's a major loss to have George gone, and I believe that were he still alive right now \\"Brainwashed\\" would sound different--in a better way.
6305205620|5.0|I'll be honest, I'm a fan of Metallica, I have seen them live many times, and I attended the tour this DVD was taken from at it's Albany, NY stop, I am also a techno-phile, this DVD is the best captured concert DVD I have ever seen, and lets not forget heard, the band sounds great, you can even hear James Hetfeild strain to hit a note every once in a while, the filming of this concert is incredible, at times, if you watch in the dark, it seems you're on stage with the band, gone are the over done MTV style edits like over-used in their concert film Live S*** Benge and Purge, the crowd as usual at a Metallica concert is amazing, they sing along when qued, and go wild for the better part of this DVD, as a Metallica fan, if I had a complaint, it is that unfortunatly, although there are over 20 songs on this DVD, Harvester of Sorrow and Unforgiven are not here, and Welcome Home (Sanitarium)'s opening is only played during an all to breif bass/guitar interlude, but other than those, the classics, and the new classics are here, be warned, this DVD was filmed before the realease of Metallica's Re-Load album, so you can't really complain about those songs not being here, but So What and Fuel from Re-Load are, Fuel is performed just as it sounds now, but at the time an untitled new song, there are even three songs in which you can choose from 5 different camera angles, the main angle, which is edited in the style of this DVD as a whole, the other angles let you follow 1 of the 4 band members as they perform, you see many things you would've missed, it would have been nice if you had this option through all the songs, but this was 1997, and it would have taken 3 DVD's to accomplish that, you would have to pay more, so take what what you can get, this DVD also contains a behind the scenes portion with the band, some breif sessions with the road crew, a photo gallery of all the tour's stops, and much more only from Metallica extras, not to mention the Enter Sandman Cunning Stunt, watch if for youself, it was cool live in person, but the filming of it allows you to see it all, if you didn't know Metallica, you'd think it was for real, it's quite impressive that a metal band and the crew can pull this off night after night, all in all, this DVD is a must not only for Metallica fans, but for music and concert film fans in general, you can hear every bent note from Kirk Hamett's guitar, Jason Newstead is at his best on bass, Lars Ulrich's drumming is even better than usual, which is a hard feat to behold, and James Hetfeild gives it everything he has as usual, in tipifying Metallica style, the stage in the round set up alone is a great breath of air as compared to the normal stage at one end of the arena set up used by most bands, and in most concert films, you see angles, and things you'd never see, and this has a lot to do with the \\"feeling of being on stage with the band\\", in my opinion, you need this DVD, run it through your headphones, turn it up, and enjoy, for the money, and for the experience, any music fan, and any techno-phile will wish they had bought this DVD earlier, like I did, on it's day of realise, I am a huge Metallica fan, but I would tell you if this DVD [stunk], it doesn't, I wish more of my favorite bands would do things like Metallica
B00005JA2B|5.0|Unlike some elitist post punk naysayers say, Kansas is (or was) a great band. Their mix of prog rock/hard rock, with a southern rock tinge is a catchy and intelligent mix that grabs the listener. Sure it isn't simple and direct like the Sex Pistols, but it isn't comparable to aor stuff like Reo Speedwagon or Supertramp or Toto either! This album features some of their best material like Magnum Opus and Carry on Wayward Son. I'd say if one is into 70's Rush they are likely to find this album a treat! Prog elp type dissonance mix with nicely done hard rock and then a fiddle comes in and adds to the variety. This and more is available on this excellent album.<br /> Overall, this album has a cohesiveness the previous \\"Masque\\" does not (which is another good album). THe mix of maze like structures on Magnum Opus (which was actually leftovers of songs they started, hence the name \\"Leftoverture) and smooth catchy vocalisms are what seem to inspired Dream Theater's more lengthy compositions.
B000065V1V|4.0|What can I say about Heathen?  Simply put, this is Bowie's best work since the 70s.  I own just about all his albums, and when I heard that he was coming out with this one, I was going to get it anyways, because I am I fan of his work.  But when I put it on, and started listening to this album, I was extremely pleased.  Heathen is classic Bowie.  If you like his music, then do yourself a favor, and buy this album.
0064407667|4.0|I am pleased to report that Mr. Snicket's first chronicle of the Baudelaire children is suitably bad. Had it been what apparently constitutes \\"good\\" these days, I'm sure there would be no need for an endless string of sequels designed to correct everything that is wrong about this volume.<br />That said, I thought this would be the perfect story to read to my 8-year-old niece. I put on my best Tim Curry impression, and commenced reading. Within no more than 50 words, my efforts were rebuffed. My niece, an obvious connoisseur of good books, indicated that she vastly preferred good stories of children with lightning bolts burnt onto their foreheads over repulsive tales of gangly, unshaved men with eyes tattooed to their ankles. Maybe if I had brought in the real Tim Curry (or bought the book-on-tape, as I found out later), it would have gone down a bit easier.<br />So I was left to wallow in the misery of the Baudelaire orphans. Mr. Snicket chronicles the first in what is apparently a series of misadventures involving a trio of young moppets who face disaster at every step. What is their appeal? Besides their inventiveness, their literacy, and, of course, their very sharp teeth, these three children are probably nothing like you, gentle review reader. After all, surely no children ever fantasize about being orphaned and surviving solely by their wits.<br />And what of the hero, Count Olaf? I fear that Mr. Snicket may have been unfair in his characterization of this abundantly talented thespian. Surely, his generosity in extending shelter and entertaining his unfortunate but distant relatives has been misinterpreted after his attempts to bring them fame and additional fortune by including them in his current theatrical production. Truly, I expect that the later chronicles of The Series of Unfortunate Events will vindicate the Count, just as the delightfully pedantic Mr. Snicket is sure to attempt to describe \\"irony\\" to his readers. A good thing, too, or how else will they understand the subtexts to the film REALITY BITES, which they will be sure to encounter later in life.
B000000W5P|5.0|Some Girls came out when I was a junior in high school and I loved it immediatley, which doesn't happen often. I wasn't a big Stones fan before this one. Every song is dynamite. 'Shattered' was sort-of a theme song for the group I hung out with back then. Highly recommend this one.
B00006JDVV|3.0|This movie really had a good idea I must say but I think they lost it somwhere.  Most of the movie relies upon the actors to make it interesting because the dragons are not really a very big focus at least not visually(you don't see them a whole lot).  And to my dissapointment the acting was not that great.  I really didn't like the storyline and I am sure England would not have either.  The movie depicts life in England after the dragons take over and the \\"English\\" philosophy of hide until the dragons die off.  Then the Americans come over with guns blazing, to be the heroes.  Now in the end they do turn this stereotype around which makes the acting even more unnatural (why did they put it there in the first place).  I think they did something good, they tried not to make this movie all action packed graphics and tried to rely on acting ability.  I think it's good and maybe other directors will begin to realize, yes, acting still is important. As for those of you who want to buy a really good movie, I would suggest renting this one first then buying it.
0425170349|3.0|Rainbow Six is a good buy for any avid reader of Clancy.  He does a nice job of paying attention to detail, but not like in the Jack Ryan series.  Unlike others that I talk to, I enjoy reading entire chapters on how and why the bomb detonated like it did.  There is detail, but not nearly where I would like it to be.  I like the idea of having a spin off of John Clark books, but the references to \\"the President\\", who all who read Tom Clancy know is Jack Ryan, became distracting.  I expected at least maybe a slight role for good old Jack, but there never was one.  I also found the end to have high suspense, but there wasn't that good old drag out knock down fight at the end that I always enjoy so much.  And finally, the plot was too over the top to be believable.  Most books that I read by Clancy have plausible plots, but this was just a little over the top for me.  Even with all of these \\"problems\\", I would recommend it to an avid Clancy fan.  If your looking to read a Clancy book for the first time, I recommend something like Patriot Games, or Red Storm Rising, you'll get a better taste for what this author can really do.
B000002KET|5.0|My personal favorite Black Sabbath album. A complete album start to finish. The songs flow beautifully together. I love all eight tracks. The first two songs are killer. This is Sabbath's finest, forget Paranoid and go buy Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.
0316666343|4.0|That short message is the basis of the story told in Frank Capra's brilliant film, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".  Arguably, one of the best films of all time, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" tells the biography of the fictional character George Bailey who lives in the small, fictional town of Bedford Falls, NY.  Like so many people in real life, George, as a young boy (played by Robert Anderson), aspired to become something greater than what the town of Bedford Falls could offer.  However, unforeseen circumstances prevent him from realizing his childhood dreams and lock him squarely into the life of Bedford Falls that he had so desperately wanted to escape.  In midlife, George (Jimmy Stewart) is barely able to provide adequate food and shelter to his wife Mary (Donna Reed) and their four children.  Further, he is falsely accused of embezzlement and threatened with imprisonment following an absentminded error committed by his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) by his unscrupulous rival, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore).<br />Having faced so many disappointments, the boy who planned to travel the world and become an architect to skyscrapers and bridges instead becomes the manager of the lowly Bailey Savings & Loan and views himself as a complete failure.  Seeing no other viable options in his disillusioned state, George goes to a bridge crossing a wide river and contemplates suicide.  Just as he's ready to take his own life, he hears a splash and pleas for help rising from the river below.  Instinctively, George jumps in, not to kill himself, but to save the individual who had fallen.  The man that George saves, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers), is not a man, but a guardian angel sent to save him.  Doubting the existence of angels, George states his wish that he had never been born because he believes everyone would have been better off without him.  Seeing an opportunity to help George, Clarence grants George his wish and creates an alternate reality in which no George Bailey ever existed.  Not realizing that reality changed, George decides to return to Bedford Falls, but instead finds the renamed and sordid community of Pottersville.<br />As George walks the now unfamiliar streets of Pottersville, George sees nothing but nightclubs, pawnshops and other disreputable businesses.  He searches for his business, the Bailey Savings & Loan, but he is told by a stranger that it closed years ago after George's father died and his Uncle Billy had been unable to manage it.  The two men who had been his best friends, the taxi driver Ernie Bishop (Frank Faylen) and police officer Bert (Ward Bond), don't know George at all.  He convinces Ernie to take him to what had once been his home, but now is only an abandoned house in total disrepair.  George has no wife and his children don't exist.  In this altered reality, the woman who had been his mother (Beulah Bondi) is an embittered childless widow.  Her only son Harry died as a child when he drowned in a frozen lake because George had not been there to save him.  With no Harry to join the navy, several sailors drown because Harry had not been there to save them and could not become a decorated war hero.  Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner) who had once owned a drugstore where George had worked as a child in the other reality, was now only a homeless alcoholic because he had accidentally poisoned a patient when he prescribed the wrong medication.  George had not been there to stop it.  Finally, the woman who had been his wife, Mary Hatch, is in the alternate reality only a lonely spinster.<br />In desperation, George returns to the bridge where he had once planned to commit suicide and pleads for his life to God and to Clarence.  A light snow begins to fall as it had been in the familiar reality.  Officer Bert, who has been looking for George (and not trying to arrest him as he had in the alternate reality), recognizes George to George's astonishment and relief. He runs home to find Mary waiting for him and no longer cares about the threat of imprisonment, but Mary has made many phone calls in his absence. Nearly everyone in town collects more than enough money to make up for the $8000 that Uncle Billy had absentmindedly lost.<br />\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" earned 5 Oscar nominations in 1947, including Jimmy Stewart for Best Actor, Frank Capra for Best Director and for Best Picture.  Having watched it many times, I am frequently brought to tears by the film's powerful drama and emotion.  George's self-sacrifices for Bedford Falls are not overlooked by its citizens who rally to help him. Clarence earns his wings for his efforts; a bell hung on the Bailey Christmas tree rings with George's youngest daughter Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes) saying, \\"Teacher says that whenever a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.\\"  George replies, \\"That's right. That a-boy Clarence!\\"<br />\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is a timeless classic that has delighted many generations since its release in 1946.  If you have never seen it, don't be dissuaded because it was filmed in black and white.  Instead, try it and don't be surprised if you find yourself holding back tears like so many others touched by its powerful drama.  As Clarence says, \\"Each man's life touches so many other lives. If he wasn't around it would leave an awful hole.\\"
B00004YYDI|4.0|If you're looking for a fancy DVD with featurettes etc etc this is not the CD for you.  OK, that's the only negative here.  The extended version is WELL worth the price of admission for movie fans.  Where as the American version was edited to become a shoot em up type film the European version focuses on the relationship of Leon and Matilda.  And it does so in a wonderfull manner.  The film is a much more satisfying experience this way, still inundated with the wild action scenes.  Some might complain it slows the pace but I would disagree.<BR>Seeing the film in digital format is of course fantastic, and the Dolby 5.1 sounds fantastic.  This is a DVD worth having simply for the movie itself, it really has a life of it's own with the added footage.
0385508417|4.0|This a quick little story that you can read while standing in those long shopping lines over the holiday season.  Nothing complicated, just a humourous and light tale.  It's like watching a christmas movie-of-the-week on TNT.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Hard, or not, to believe, finally here is the new album from Audioslave. I mean, if you are searching for another fine release from Rage Against The Machine you get failed, sorry. 3/4 were RATM but remaining 1/4 are not fillable with Cornell to have RATM back once again. Please hear to Audioslave by forgetting everything from RATM to enjoy the listening, you will be comfortable by hearing Cochise sounds and instantly it will remember you Bombtrack. Other tracks are good as Tom Morello's ability with his guitar are well known to us. Other bands componet abilities are well known too, Chris Cornell, once vocalist of Soundgarden, gave his voice a means in this Audioslave project. Timmy C., the great bass player from RATM, is known for his astonishing and amazing bass solo that made history in &quot;a bullet in your head&quot; track. Not least Mr. Brad Wilk, from RATM too, the one that did cool, colorfull and powerfull percussion sessions, our ears are glad for that. With this band components you are sure that Audioslave don't miss a hit. Go for it.
B000002UAX|5.0|Although many White Album song lyrics do seem to not explicitly tell a story, that is OK because the listener can feast on the advanced musical imagery and interpret it in line with his/her own life. Or just enjoy it without claiming to understand the meaning, that's permitted. The White Album includes a reggae-influenced song (Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da), a frenetic McCartney metal song (Helter Skelter), a not-so-subtle protest song with comedic undertones and an art-rock-Baroque style (Piggies). A country-influenced song with inventive wordplay (Rocky Raccoon), two amazing art-rock John Lennon tunes (Happiness Is A Warm Gun and Glass Onion), a McCartney song inspired by 1920s music (Honey Pie). A lesser, but interesting, version of the Lennon hit (Revolution), a wild and powerful Harrison effort about his friend Eric Clapton's sweet tooth (Savoy Truffle). A put-down of a tiger hunter the Beatles  encountered in India in 1968 (Bungalow Bill),   and an underrated energetic little rock song (Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey). And, Of course, the hits you actually hear on classic rock radio: (Birthday, While my Guitar Gently Weeps, Back In The U.S.S.R., Blackbird). John Lennon's sweeping and majestic tribute to his mother, who got hit by a car while a teenage John heard the crash from down the block (Julia).  McCartney's simplest, perfect little love song (I Will). Even the songs some call \\"filler\\" all have a degree of merit to them. Don't Pass Me By, Why Don't We Do It In The Road, Yer Blues, Revolution 9, Good Night, and Wild Honey Pie. And a half-dozen good songs which I haven't even mentioned. If you listen to The White album, you discern that, yeah, many of these songs ARE about something. And others have vague lyrics designed to go with the music. <BR>      One huge compliment was recently paid to these legendary Beatles albums,  and other timeless albums such as Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon. Billboard now refuses to accurately list these older albums' positions on the music charts. The music industry was angered that after 30+ years these albums were still outselling some of the current heavily-promoted music. Amazon has no such bias, and The White Album is in 83rd place in Amazon sales, after 34 years on the market. That's rare. There is some great new music out now, undoubtedly. But it is possible that no other album has displayed so many different styles of music so masterfully and inventively. Some days, I waver between Revolver and The White Album as the absolute best. Some days, I listen to The White Album, and think \\"this is it.\\"
B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm not a big fan of cinema in general, I don't find movies or television generally captivating at all.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" is the first and only thing I've ever witnessed on my television which has not only grabbed me emotionally but has run the entire gamut of emotions while doing so.  How can you not fight back tears at the first sight of the concentration camp or when an interview with a veteran dwells on about their fallen friends?<br />I know I'm not the only one who was actually rather upset when the series ended.  It was so gripping, that realizing the series was at its conclusion makes you actually feel a sense of loss that you won't be able to follow these people any longer, after all they have done.<br />Dialogue also seemed ultra-realistic.  Unlike previous war movies (\\"When Trumpets Fade\\" comes to mind) where I find it hard to believe that our grandparents were cursing at every moment and acting cool with their issued cigarettes, BoB portrays who are essentially our grandparents as they surely were when younger.  More \\"for Pete's sakes\\" , and a bigger self-consciousness/pride of religious identity (no mistaking who's the Catholics in this series!).<br />Unbelievably great movie/series.

B00001QEE7|5.0|Many say that the Little Mermaid was the movie that restored the magic of Disney in its films.  This statement may not be enough.  The Little Mermaid is one of, if not the best movie Disney has made yet.  The animation is a little inferior to recent movies such as Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King.  However, the Little Mermaid makes a connection with its characters and the audience like no other Disney film.  In this film the viewer feels for the characters.  I was standing anxiously awaiting for Eric to finally pucker up and kiss Ariel in the magical boat ride scene.  In the final scene when Ariel is wed to Eric and she whispers to her father, &quot;I love you, daddy&quot; melted my heart.  The songs are fantastic.  &quot;Under the Sea&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Girl&quot; won major awards but don't forget Ariel's song performed by the lovely Jodi Benson &quot;Part of Your World.&quot;  The bottomline is that the movie entertains like no other.  The Little Mermaid should not be considered the standard of Disney movies but the pinnacle.  I have yet to see another film by Disney that moved in me the same way as The Little Mermaid.

The world over knows the premise of Dickens classic but (especially) at this time of year is a story most people will enjoy reading again.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|It's about time that a complete Beatles' collection spanning their whole career was released and the #1s format was the way to go. Sure, it doesn't contain every essential song recorded by the Beatles but then again, you'd need more than 1 CD for that. But the 27 selections on here are all the biggies. All either #1s here in the US or in the UK. Coupled with solid sound, this collection unseats the red and blue albums as the must-have greatest hits album.
B00005JKCH|5.0|The considerable promise for the comic book feel that former horror director Sam (Evil Dead) Raimi showed with his gonzo action thriller Darkman comes to fruition in what can be considered the best comic book movie adaptation since Superman, The Movie way back in 1978.  Tobey Maguire's acting talents are more than capable of putting real humanity into Peter Parker as he goes from lowly nerd to your friendly neighborhood Spiderman, battling the Green Goblin along the way.  Columbia/Tri-Star has packed the DVD with more goodies than one simple disc can hold, you get commentary, trailers, documentaries and lots, lots more.  An essential for any Webhead, young or old.
B00007BH5C|4.0|Howard Shore bust onto the cinematic scene with his score to &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; rivaling anything that may have been produced by John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith.  The music captured imaginations and transported listeners to the wonderous land of Middle Earth.  In this soundtrack to &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; much of Shore's brilliance has apparently faded.  The score is epic in its scope and scale, but sadly, many of the themes from the first CD are missing.  You can occasionally catch wisps of the theme of the Shire, or the Fellowship, but these themes are only periperal.  While the themes for Gollum, Morder, and Treebeard are quite striking, the rest of the CD suffers from being only mood music.  Even the climatic battle track for &quot;Helm's Deep&quot; is disappointing when once considers the epic music for &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Doom&quot; from the CD to &quot;Fellowship.&quot;  Overall, the music is quite good and melodic, but it fails to capture the sheer magic that was the score to &quot;Fellowship.&quot;  So go out and buy this one to complete your Lord of the Rings collection, but make sure you have the &quot;Fellowship&quot; CD to listen to in the car.
B000063JDE|4.0|Now, don't get me wrong. Blue Velvet is one of my all-time favorite movies, if not my hands-down favorite. It's just that I was a trifle disappointed with the &quot;special&quot; edition. As was no doubt the case with a lot of other Lynch-heads, I was hoping for chunks of deleted scenes and never-before-seen footage, but apparently such scenes fall under the &quot;lost forever&quot; heading - what a shame. Instead, we get a montage of still shots from a variety of scenes which, while compelling, falls far short of the actual scenes themselves. If you're a geek like me, you might want to try and locate a copy of the script. This will answer a lot of questions you might have about the context of these scenes.<br />That said, I highly recommend buying this if you don't already own a copy in some format or other. Blue Velvet is a compelling, voyeuristic, and times downright scary masterpiece, peppered with David Lynch's trademark quirky humor.
B00007E8O5|5.0|I am a huge Alice in Chains fan so when the unexpected death of Layne Staley occurred I wasn't sure what would happen with Jerry Cantrell....but I knew there still was a promising future for my favorite guitarist of all-time. With the release of Boggy Depot and Degradation Trip you could hear alice in chains in some songs but this  was a new side from Cantrell we all never saw before. With Alice in Chains many of the lyrics were depressing but yet uplifting all at once and with Staley harmonizing with Cantrell it created a sort of tone I had never heard before...the way Staley sang was very deep yet so soothing all at once. I could not focus on music after the death of Staley because Alice in Chains identified my music taste.....once the leader that founded me as a person who takes in music died I was deeply saddened.....but music must live on...it has had the biggest effect on my life. All the punk that is taking over right now which I am not really into...this is a nice change of events with the few decent bands that are out right now...but with this band its only one person who is extremely talented....Jerry Cantrell. I'll admit it was a different tone than Alice in Chains but I think you will notice like I did that once you give it a try the album really grows on you....with Alice in Chains for me nothing had to grow with time....it was a right away love for the band. With all due with respect to Cantrell this is a great album and could make a nice holiday treat. P.S. Chek out tracks....lots more by the way than just the first degradation album....anger rising, angel eyes(spider man), spider bite....spider bite and anger rising resemble more alice in chains to me but its the same Cantrell we have all grown to appreciate.....a great album all around!
0684800713|4.0|Everyone I know who's read Hemmingway hates him.  My roommate bristles when his name is mentioned, and the person I'm dating goes berserk whenever his name comes up (which, admittedly, isn't all that often).<br />So, having never read anything by him, I thought it only fair that I give him a chance.  Having found The Sun Also Rises at a used book sale, I gave it a shot.<br />And I was pleasantly surprised.<br />\\"But NOTHING happens!\\" everyone whined.  And they're right.  This is one of those not-particularly-plot-driven kinds of books.  But against my will, I found myself actually caring about the characters, even if they were fairly predictable, and even if they did drink too much.  It all just seemed to fit together quite well, and I ended up really liking the book.<br />And his prose style (simple sentence. simple sentence.  simple sentence.) made for a nice break from Nabokov, who I'd been reading at the time.  Not right for every book, sure, but it worked for this one, and it made the dialogue feel real, instead of forced or false.<br />So Hemmingway.  He's not for everyone, sure.  But I enjoyed this book, and I'm looking forward to reading other things by him.
B00006AL1G|5.0|Loved this movie!  Does anyone know the name of the DJ Krush song that features towards the end?
B0000640VO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  It may not be an intellectual feast for the mind, or a gritty documentary about the pain and suffering of real life, but it DOES remind us of the simpler side of life and what it is to see the world as a child might see it.  This is entertainment, so I must protest, it is entitled be whatever sugar-coated confection it wants to be!  And it is not really so sugar-coated.  Nino works in a porn shop (though it is surprisingly un-seedy), and other characters have their problems (though they seem surprisingly easy to solve by our irrepressible heroine).  Amelie is a sweet, Ally McBeal-esque girl who has never really grown up.  She is still the little girl who lives in a world of her own imagination.  And if those glasses are rose-coloured, who are we to say that the way she sees the world is worse than the more pessimistic brand of cynicism that seems to be so rampant in &quot;realism&quot; today?  Amelie reminds us that perhaps, after all, the children, with their innocent idealism and little games, have somehow got it right.<br />Both Amelie and her accidental &quot;amoureux&quot; are adorable, though I thought perhaps Jeunet might have taken a cue from Jane Austen and pointed out that Amelie's interference with other people's lives, like Emma, sometimes turned out badly (like Georgette and her psychotic lover), and Amelie should have taken some responsibility for that.  But perhaps that is my North American liberalism speaking.  I loved the integration of the fantasy with reality: talking pig-lamps, the photographs that speak to Nino about the &quot;beautiful&quot; mysterious girl....are they merely manifestations of Nino and Amelie's subconscious thought, or is destiny really working miracles to bring them together?  And it is the pointing out of the details of life that holds the movie together in terms of story.  After all, most people's stories are manifested through the details...this is the stuff life (or at least an ideal one)is made of...c'est la vie.  And everybody, not just Amelie and Nino, has their quirks.  I thought the narrated introduction at the beginning of the film quite funny in its portrayal of the silly and the absurd that really, though exaggerated, makes up much of our lives.  And the characters!  Oh the characters!  There's not a sane one in the lot (it has been said that the French have their own distinct brand of madness..j/k)!  Nevertheless, we see echos of people we know in each of them, in the jealous boyfriend, the angry grocer, the kind painter, etc.  And perhaps there is an Amelie in some of us too, shy introverts who think up strategems to avoid confronting our true passions.<br />Last but not least, the cinematography is excellent.  It may not be realistic (I lived in Paris for a few years and it isn't), but it's a pretty fantasy of an Ideal Paris. <br />All in all, it's a satisfying fantasy with a happy ending.  And in these days, don't we all need some more happy endings?
B00000253N|5.0|This album is that rarest of beasts: one that will bridge every generation gap and bring in new listeners over and over again. I remember my parents playing old Dylan tapes in our car when I was little. I remember hating them, and calling for something more modern and horrible. Then a few years ago I was in my parents' living room and Dad put on his original vinyl copy of Blood On The Tracks, only for me to find it was a sound I now loved.<br />Now this album has become one of my favourites ever. The songs are beautiful, well-produced, warm and engaging. The sound of the original vinyl coming on with the first notes of 'Tangled Up In Blue' is still thrilling every time. The album progresses wonderfully, showing the true value of the days when albums were intended as complete works of art, to be played from start to finish. Rather than just being a collection of songs, this album evokes a mood as a whole. Each song adds another layer to the greatness of the album, from the slow, stripped-down 'Simple Twist Of Fate' and 'Shelter From The Storm' to the bluesy 'Meet Me In The Morning' and the epics 'Idiot Wind' and 'Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts'.<br />This is a seminal, classic, essential album which I hope will continue to be passed down from generation to generation. 5 stars.
B00005JKES|5.0|You can get this superb series WITH THE PILOT INCLUDED on Region2<BR>I managed to stop myself buying it on R1 (i do not know how!!)and waited for the UK release and im glad i did because it includes the original US pilot - not the edited european pilot  -so forget that very poor quality R0 pilot from taiwan. GET THE COMPLETE SERIES 1 as it should have been and enjoy the greatest US Television show EVER!
B000006NPY|4.0|Adore is not a step backwards in the Smashing Pumpkins' career. This album may be less grungey and aggresive than Siamese Dream and Melon Collie, but it certainly isn't any less dark, with the new beautiful sound equally haunting. The styles here are mixed, and some tracks are simply acoustic, but the overall feeling is one of that paradox of genres, goth-pop. Its influences are such bands as Depeche Mode, Joy Division and The Cure. Ava Adore, Daphne Descends and Tear all use this sound.<br />Tracks like opener To Sheila, Once Upon A Time and Behold! The Night Mare are less dark, but there is still a haunting feeling underpinning their pastoral beauty. For Martha is the only track which could really have fitted on an earlier Pumpkins album. <br />Some people who see dark music as simply thrashing music misunderstand this CD, seeing its techno, indie and acoustica as a sell-out, but the fact is, commercial this is most certainly not: in fact this surely is the most complex and difficult of Pumpkins albums. Nevertheless, its one of the most rewarding, and makes far more interesting listening than Melon Collie Pt 2-but-not-as-good would have. Tremendously under-rated.
6304414145|3.0|Mel Gibson could hardly resist doing this picture since it not only amounts to a vehicle for him, but is exactly the kind of slightly off-beat but heroic part that he likes (cf., Conspiracy Theory 1997).  He does a good job although his tendency to overact is not under consistent directorial control.  But Ron Howard directing Mel Gibson is a bit like Spike Lee directing Danny DeVito.  (Huh?)  Or how about Oprah Winfrey directing Whoopie Goldberg?  Or, John Wayne directing Clint Eastwood?<br />Gary Sinise as Jimmy Shaker, a cop gone not just bad, but sleazy psycho bad, also does a good job although just why he is such a sickie and why nobody noticed before is not developed or even explained.  Rene Russo does her best (alas) as the suffering wife and mother condemned to a dreary role of one dimension.  I was thinking, how about some creative casting?  Instead of Lili Taylor as the bad girl, how about having her play Gibson's trophy wife and make Russo the girl gone bad?  Taylor is talented enough to pull it off with panache and Russo would be an arresting sight among the degenerates.<br />Ron Howard clearly worked hard to hi-tech the old ransom plot with cell phones and cell phone tracers, infrared goggles, voice-distorters, helicopters and electronic homing devices.  He provides plenty of shoot 'em up and gives the tale a twist with Gibson challenging the kidnappers.  He also affords us a lot of satisfying revenge stuff at the end.<br />I do have a couple of questions though.  Was his portrait of the FBI inspired by the real life FBI's fine work at Ruby Ridge and Waco?  I mean at no time in this movie did the FBI do anything positive.  I'm not crazy about today's FBI anymore than anyone else, but was this a fair and realistic take on how they might handle such a case?  Also what was police detective Jimmy Shaker's motivation for the kidnapping in the first place?  After x number of years on the force he suddenly gets a yen for a lot of money and balmy climes?  Finally why doesn't he just take his cleverly and murderously earned reward a couple of days down the road instead of showing up prematurely at the Mullen place and giving himself away?<br />Bottom line: this picks up after a slow beginning, and there's some clever business along the way, but don't examine it too closely.y why doesn't he just take his cleverly and murderously earned reward a couple of days down the road instead of showing up prematurely at the Mullen place and giving himself away?<br />Bottom line: this picks up after a slow beginning, and there's some clever business along the way, but don't examine it too closely.
B00006ALGL|5.0|As a native dubliner just like damien ive had the luck of hearing this album before a lot of people, and from the very first time i heard it playing in my local CD store, right up to attending his live concert this week i have ADORED this album, and every song on it. <br />filled with unbelievably moving lyrics and amazing guitar work, his voice is perfectly complimented by lisa's . it is impossible to categorise this CD, it ranges from close-to-silent voice only songs to rising multi layered songs, one climaxing with a moving operatic finish.<br />i have given this CD to everyone i know, i find no matter what their traditional musical taste everyone has loved it. BUY this CD, get him widely known, and if you ever have the chance to see him live GRAB it.

0590353403|5.0|Have you ever done something so amazing that it could save hundreds of people?  In the story, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, by J.K. Rowling Harry Potter, the protagonist, risks his life to save the rest of the world.<BR> In this story a huge giant named, Hagrid, rescues Harry from his dreadful stepparents the Dursleys. Then Hagrid told Harry why everyone knows his name. Hagrid explained to Harry,  an evil wizard named Voldermort took many wizards and turned them bad. One night Voldermort came to your house ,Harry. and whoever he wanted to kill didnt stand a chance. Your parents fought and fought but he killed them. He also tried to kill you but his spell backfired.  Something about you ,Harry, had stopped him that night.           After that Hagrid gave a letter to Harry telling him that he had been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  He also gave him a very weird list of school supplies.        Harry started to frown and replied sadly, but Hagrid I dont have any money.  Dont worry about that, replied Hagrid. Hagrid got Harrys money out of Gringotts Bank, and he also picked up a very scruffy package.           When Harry got to Hogwarts the first few months went by very quickly and smoothly, except for Harry and his friends detention in the Forbidden Forest.  As he was walking through the woods he saw the most fearful sight.  He soon would find out that the monster he had seen was Voldermort.  Harry also found out that the scruffy package Hagrid had picked up was the Sorcerers Stone, which gives you eternal life.  Harry thought Voldermort wanted it, so Harry told Ron and Hermione about his discoveries, and they had to stop him that night.  When they got to the corridor on the third floor, they ran into one of the things guarding the Stone, a three headed dog.  <BR>Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew that if they got passed the dog,                there would be many more tasks for them to accomplish.  Iencourage you to read this story and find out if Harry can stop Voldermort and stay alive in the process.  If you read this story, you will be on the edge of your seat every time you turn a page!

B00005JKDR|5.0|The geniuses at Pixar are four-for-four with their feature efforts. <BR>This film has wit, heart, drama and laugh-out-loud slapstick humor, with memorable characters, great lines and an involving plot. The filmmakers' emphasis on story is obvious, and appreciated. I haven't mentioned the animation because this flick is so enveloping, the detail so precise...it's a reality in which I was happily immersed.<BR>Only after spending time with the innumerable extras did I gasp at the level of complexity I had taken for granted. You will sit eyes agape in amazement, learning about computer animation techniques. I found the whole bit about \\"set dressing\\" to be ridiculously cool.<BR>A film full of wonders. Feel confident popping this sucker in your DVD player that you're going on a great trip...
B00000DFRS|1.0|If this is her big comeback cd, she should be afraid, very afraid.  Listening to this stuff, and the techno remixes of it in the clubs was was like a combination of waking up from a huge hangover and watching a movie, but the second and third reels of the film are missing. I was left really confused at hearing this stuff. This is Whitney Houston's new career saver and new sound? Sorry, but your time has come and gone, and that time was back in the 80s and early 90s.  You've lost that great voice that once couldn't be topped, and now she's doing forgettable junk that sounds like throwaways that other artists passed on.  Honestly, her last greatest cd was The Bodyguard Soundtrack. What a waste of a talent. Guess that's what happens when you marry Bobby Brown: you hang out with a loser and sooner or later you become one. Whitney is no winner with this dud. I'm only rating it one star for the song I Learned The Best From You. I rest of the cd is so forgetable i couldn't recall it if i tried.

B00007BH5C|5.0|If \\"Fellowship\\" was the appetizer, \\"Two Towers\\" is the main course.<br />The first track of \\"Two Towers\\" begins as \\"Fellowship\\" did, returning us to Middle-Earth with the quiet, foreboding theme that opened the first film.  Then come the drums, and you instantly know that this part of the story is different.  This time, the stakes have become much higher.  Chanting erupts in the same theme from Fellowship of the Ring's \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum,\\" but then transforms into new melodies and suddenly ceases as if halted in the middle.<br />In \\"The Taming of Smeagol\\" we are reintroduced to the Hobbits with their theme, but don't get too comfortable: just when you think you know the territory, you are shaken from your complacency.  Something entirely new emerges, and it is the most noble and glorious theme yet in the series: \\"The Riders of Rohan.\\"  This is our first encounter with the race of Men, and the music beautifully conveys their bravery, courage, and determination.  In this track Shore employs the Norweigan fiddle, called the hardinger, to invoke images of the Vikings.<br />Now we take a glance at the Hobbits in \\"The Passage of the Marshes,\\" and we are in dark territory indeed.  But fear not, because from there our gaze lights upon Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli as they rush to rescue Merry and Pippin in \\"The Uruk-hai.\\"  This track makes most use of themes from \\"Fellowship\\" as you will recognize the triumphant Fellowship theme and the percussive, brassy tones of the Uruk-hai.  <br />Shore quickly returns to his new material and elaborates on the Rohan theme in \\"The King of the Golden Hall,\\" and though halfway in the track things get a bit shady, it concludes with a renewed--though more somber--heroism.  \\"The Black Gate is Closed\\" conjures up exactly what the title implies: frustration and imminent failure; before your heart can break, though, the gorgeous \\"Evenstar\\" featuring the ethereal vocals of Isabel Bayrakdarian floats out to comfort you.  <br />But what's this?Something approaches, and it is \\"The White Rider.\\"  Here Howard Shore takes my breath away, as arpeggiated harp and soft voices build into a full orchestra calling us back to the Quest.  Onward!<br />Though \\"Treebeard\\" opens seriously, it turns eerily playful as wooden percussions give a forest effect.  The woods are usually home to Elves, too, and they make their presence known in \\"The Leave Taking\\" with the \\"Rivendell\\" theme of the first movie.<BR>  <BR>With all the leave-taking done, everything is in place for the battle of battles: \\"Helm's Deep.\\"  I commend Howard Shore--and probably Peter Jackson as well, as the two collaborated heavily about the film's music--for the way this event was handled musically.  Rather than being a loud and boisterous war party, the music instead portrays the sad but steadfast courage of a vastly outnumbered army making their last stand to defend their civilization.  It is one of the most touching moments in the score.<br />\\"The Forbidden Pool\\" is a five-and-a-half minute piece dominated by low, ominous notes and ending with some singing by the boy's choir, and the mystical \\"The Breath of Life\\" concludes with a rhythmic, almost \\"Conan\\"-like march.  Towards the end of \\"The Hornburg\\" we are treated to another new dark, brassy theme with an Arabian feel to it--and though it is oddly reminiscent of \\"The Godfather,\\" it is enjoyable nonetheless.<br />Now we are winding towards the end of the movie, and the music takes off to soar to its exciting conclusion with \\"Forth Earlingas.\\" As we fly off, however, we look anxiously over our shoulder and see \\"Isengard Unleashed.\\"  The troubles are only now coming to their head, and there is a long, bitter fight yet ahead.  In spite of this impending doom, we turn one final look upon \\"Samwise the Brave,\\" and are softly reminded of Galadriel's words in the first film: \\"Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.\\"<br />Overall \\"The Two Towers\\" soundtrack has immediately become one ofmy favorites and worthy of all five stars.  If the movie is as good as Howard Shore's music, we should be in for one amazing experience!<br />P.S. On a technical note, the recording is crystal clear and the London Philharmonic sounds gorgeous.  And what about the final track, \\"Gollum's Song\\"?  You can download it from Amazon.com and see for yourself!

B000066C1N|5.0|I consider myself quite an afficianado of music and I can honestly say this soundtrack is one of the very best.  If it wasn't for this music the movie would not be as good.  This soundtrack collectively completes the movie and the emotion of it.  This is a must have for anyone who loves the kind of music that moves you and brings you to tears.
B00005B36H|5.0|Words can hardly do justice for a work of art like Lateralus.  It's unfortunate that there are those who can't appreciate this masterpiece, but then again, Tool never wrote songs for those who expected from them a certain sound or pattern that so inflicts many of the mainstream bands stumbling in the music industry hoping for a &quot;lucky break&quot; or some song that &quot;catches on.&quot;  The quartet known as Tool is confident in their composition, in the lyrics, in their presentation that - in my opinion - is the deepest, most poetic, most moving thing out there.<br />There is not a &quot;greatest thing&quot; about Tool's latest effort, which, as their best work yet, far exceeds anything that's been done for a long time.  It was only last summer that I became a Tool fan, so this review isn't a byproduct of some long-time attachment.  Objectively, Lateralus - if you're the kind to appreciate music and poetry - sets high standards for future bands hoping to emulate them.<br />Some of the highlights about both Lateralus and Tool in general:<br />Make no mistake, Maynard is a poet who happens to have one of the greatest voices in the music industry.  From the very first track, where he sings, &quot;Give away the stone, / Let the oceans take and transmutate this cold and fated anchor. / Give away the stone, / Let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudges into gold,&quot; to the climax of the album (the title track) where, in a jaw dropping, hear-it-to-believe-it song about the power of creativity, Maynard captivates the listener in his artistic grasp and doesn't let go until the final track throws you from the whirlwind that is Lateralus.<br />Add Danny Carey's precision drumming and two incredible musicians in Justin Chancellor and Adam Jones, and you have an inimitable formula for creating the spectacular.<br />Nearly eighty minutes may go by once you've sat down and listened to this album, but you'll think you've acquired an eternity's worth of inspiration to jostle your imagination into the highest of gears.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I RARELY ever buy soundtracks, but after i had this wonderful movie experience as soon as i found out there was a soundtrack, I bought it right away. THis score won an Academy Award so that proves just how majestic it is. It fits perfectly with Tolkien's masterpiece and deserves to be heard by everyone.I can't wait for what Howard Shore has in store for The Two Towers and the Return of the King!
1577311523|5.0|God-fearing atheism is what I would have called my shaky yet logical alternative to faith. I settled on this after an evolution of discontent with modern practices of the popular western religions and the lack of good answers to important questions. My pragmatic mind would no longer endure the unprovable, deciding once and for all that devoting more time to it in a fleeting life would be wasteful. After all, everything I admired and feared about God, everything that made God interesting enough to pursue, had been hearsay. You can't bet your life on hearsay. So until God pops in with a miracle I'd focus on practical things, like making money and looking good.<br />The woven logic above unravels now. It unravels not through intelligent counter-attack and argument, but through finding that which is eternal---within me, within you, within everything, and even the space and nothingness about and between. The answer is. God is. I am. Now.<br />My experiences throughout and after the reading of \\"The Power of Now\\" have been profound. Some of the writing may seem paradoxical, but you will understand it nonetheless on a deeper level than the mind. The book not only describes enlightenment but shows you the way. Actually several paths lead to enlightenment and they are described in surprising practical detail. <br />Eckhart Tolle is the author's name. \\"The Power of Now\\" is the book's name. They point you to that which is nameless. <br />Honor your self by reading \\"The Power of Now.\\"
B000002IP1|4.0|I must say that this CD quite impressed me. I'd known that Phil was a big band-ish kind of guy, but I didn't know he used those aspects of music so well.<br />  With number like That's Just The Way It Is, Do You Remember and I Wish It Would Rain Down, we know Phil has a soft side. And I like it. He's sad, remiscant and melancholy, yet not depressed and mopey. Heat On The Street and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning pick up the pace a bit and pull some tapping from your toes.<br />  As usual, Phil manages to combine kickin' tunes with catchy lryics, making for one heck of a CD.<br />  I enjoy this Phil, but I'd like to see more of songs like Find a Way To My Heart and Colors. He's good at making songs with meanings. Let's see more of them.
0066214122|3.0|I rated this book relative to the author's genre and previous books.  I generally enjoy Crichton's prose - by no means great lit, but well structured and fun to read.  The book, narrated by the central character, develops an amazing sense of dread.  While Jurassic Park, for example, is a much much better book, the sense of foreboding and suspense in Prey is much more intense.  The villain is, as usual, man's own folly, and the personification of this is microscopic.<BR>Unfortunately, these tiny robots don't stay microscopic. What could have been (and is for the first half of the book) an intense human thriller, degrades into a bad Hollywood action script, with the nanobots &quot;swarming&quot; to form visible clouds.<BR>The swarms, however, are still very Crichton and pretty neat stuff.  The sequences with them are scary and suspenseful - a read till 2am series of events.  But then everything falls apart.<BR>I will not &quot;spoil&quot; the end, but suffice it to say that it is unbelievably silly (emphasis on unbelievable).  I love Crichton because he can convince me to believe things that are impossible.  He fails in Prey.  Not only is the finale dumb, but it leaves huge holes in the plot unresolved.  While Crichton is by no means a Steinbeck-like character writing, you are also left feeling completely perplexed at the interactions between the characters and the emotional reactions they have.  Great personal loss is treat blas and is marginally offensive.  I did not give a lower rating only becasue I enjoyed the first half of the book quite a lot.  In the end, you are left with the feeling that Crichton wrote this as an excuse to  make another movie, and what began as one of his best ended up along side Sphere as one of his silliest.
B000056K04|4.0|As an avid DMB fan, I have to say that I was not that impressed with CD when I first heard it. Not at all. There were a few good songs, Dreams of Our Fathers, for example, but other than that, I didn't listen to it much.<br />After a while, I found myself going back again and again to listen to the songs. I eventually began to love this CD, even Angel, which I despised at first.<br />The only problem I have with this CD is that the songs tend to sound alike after a while. Guitar from one leaks into another, possibly leading to the mashing of the stop button. Other than that, I'd give it thumbs up!
B0000020C4|5.0|This CD was my introduction to Les Mis. PBS showed this performance in 95 I believe, and I at 16 and my sister at 14, were entranced. Have been ever since. The particular concert is powerful and emotional... brings me to tears at times. I don't know alot of the history of the singers that participated, but I do know that this is my favorite recording to date and Wilkinson and Salonga are completely bewitching. I've shared this CD with many others and although they lack the knowledge of the storyline they are pulled in by the music.<br />Can't recommend this highly enough. Just wonderful all around.
0515123447|4.0|My husband and I go through books like water and are always looking for a new author to satisfy our appetite.  When we find one we both like, we tend to fly through everything in the series.  This is one of those series.  The whole idea of this being far fetched is what is so scary - it could be true!  Who would ever believe you if you told them about it?  Making Reacher a drifter is the perfect solution to the worst problem most serial heroes have - I mean, how many bodies can one person discover before everyone in their small town is dead? The fact that he is not devastatingly handsome or rich and travels by Greyhound gives him a humanity that makes you want to take him home and feed him a hot meal.  I love Jack Reacher!
B00005JLF5|5.0|It's about time this show came out on DVD.  And I'm so glad it is.  I origanlly got into Star Trek by TNG, but I fell in LOVE with DS9.  The show is much darker and much more realistic then some of the other ST shows. <BR>One thing that I always liked about DS9 was that it wasn't JUST the \\"three main characters\\" that were allowed to shine.  Though Mr. Brooks was clearly the star of the show, the supporting ensemble cast was first rate.  And it was the only ST show that I know of in which the supporting actors like Andrew Robinson (Garak), Aron Eisenber (Nog), and Max Grodenchik (Rom), were equally flushed out.  <BR>Anyone who puts this show down because it's not like the other ST shows, or puts it down because it's too much like Babylon 5, is missing a great show, IMHO.  It's a show that should be treasured for it's own uniqueness, not put on a shelf because it dared to go against the status quo.

But when my mom read this book to me, I figured out how the cycle really works.  This book is a very easy reader for young children, and a favorite to all.  It talks about how the caterpillar is born, how it lives as a caterpillar, how it makes a cocoon, and how it turns into a butterfly.  And when you are little, you are just amazed by this stuff.  That is why I liked this book when i was younger.

B00005YXZH|5.0|This album has as much original musicality as any Steely Dan album, with clear influences of The Monkees, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Floyd. It is amazing, and is easily the Album of the Year! Oh, and could you all please stop saying that this is an \\"alt-country\\" album. Just because Tweedy uses violins ala Mellencamp on \\"Jesus\\" doesn't make this anything close to alt-country. This album is genreless in the same way that Daft Punk isn't alt-techno/house just because they sample Barry Manilow. This album is a must buy for anyone who enjoys music for more than just the melodies. The timbre of each song is original and startling. Tweedy understands that a song is not complete unless it portrays a heretofore unheard musical mise en scene. The distortion effects with which the album is riddled enhance the quality of music and never get in the way. Many songs would have been pop only if it weren't for the genius of the effects....
1587990717|4.0|Nassim is right-on in his analysis that many investors are fools.  The great ones that survive \\"don't blow up\\" are the cautious ones that move slowly and pragmatically.  Unfortunately, this crowd although survivors are less like the stereotypical genius that Wall Street firms tend to reward.  This survivor crowd moves deliberately and analytically and in the end they are the witnesses to the devastation created by the high roller gamblers that are more common on Wall Street.<br />Thank Nassim
6305696071|3.0|As much as I love this show, the DVD needs help.  It's not anamorphic so widescreen TV owners beware.  Although the movie format says widescreen, the DVD format isnt a true anamorphic as we'd expect.<br />In addition, the transfer seems old and unsaturated and grainy.  I would have hope for a better picture but I guess with a non anamorph DVD what could you expect.
B000002J2B|5.0|I purchased this cd about 6 months ago and i think it's great. i have every single genesis album the whole way from &quot;from genesis to revelation&quot; to &quot;calling all stations&quot;. Wind and Wuthering is the first album released after Peter Gabriel left and Phil Collins came to the lead singer spot. this album seems overlooked but it definitly should not be! It captures the Peter Gabriel era sound of genesis very well. The band took a turn towards pop soon after the release of this album. I highly recommend this album!
B00006LFGD|5.0|I thought I was the only one who noticed that the last five seconds of ONE LESS BELL/A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME are cut off.  It bothered me when the C.D. Barbra Joan Streisand<br />came out and thought it would be back in for the DUETS C.D. but it is not.  That someone else noticed is  such a relief, I'm not the only one.  For such a perfectionist, Barbra, I guess you should listen to your old stuff now and again, you wouldn't let this happen if you did.  But go buy DUETS anyway, it's a great collectoin of this amazing womens work.
0316666343|5.0|I agree with the Dec. 6, 2002 reviewer (Not What I Expected) and other reviewers. Not only did &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; keep tugging at my heartstrings, it was a quick and easy read that was presented very creatively. Congratulations to Alice Sebold. And, by the way, I took the recommendation of other reviewers and am now also enjoying (almost finished) with Norman Thomas Remick's creative book, &quot;West Point&quot;. Is Alice Sebold (or Remick) working on a sequel? If so, I look forward to it.
B000001FS6|3.0|U2 were completely panned by the press and some hardcore U2 fans for 'Rattle &amp; Hum' (1988), which is purported to be U2's ill-fated egocentric exploration into American music. Leaving pretentiousness in the eyes of the beholder, a lot of people liked this record, a mix of studio songs and live tracks from 'The Joshua Tree' tour and for good reason. Here's a song-by-song:<br />1. &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; [Live]. OK, the ego does get a bit out of hand here, but this is one of the standout cover tunes.<br />2. &quot;Van Diemen's Land&quot;. The Edge takes vocals on this nice ode to the working man which is, unfortunately, abruptly cut off in mid-verse on the record.<br />3. &quot;Desire&quot;. The first single, an obvious musical tribute to blues legend Bo Diddley, continues to be one of their most popular and infectious songs.<br />4. &quot;Hawkmoon 269&quot;. Although there is some lyrical help from Bob Dylan, this is one of the studio tracks that really does not work.<br />5. &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; [Live]. An uninspired cover of the Dylan classic which is memorable only if you saw the movie.<br />6. &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; [Live]. With embellishments by a real gospel choir, the song is performed the way it was meant to be, albeit a bit over the top.<br />7. &quot;Freedom for My People&quot;. This is just a snippet of a street performer.<br />8. &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; [Live]. A great live version of a non-LP track, seethingly delivered by Bono toward an apathetic American audience.<br />9. &quot;Pride (in the Name of Love)&quot; [Live]. What live record would be complete without the consumate U2 anthem?<br />10. &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot;. As one of the songs recorded at the historic Sun Studios, complete with a horn section, this lyrical ode to Billie Holiday is a U2 classic.<br />11. &quot;Love Rescue Me&quot;. With the vocal accompanyment of Bob Dylan, you would think this one would be great.  However, it falls flat.<br />12. &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot;. Although many U2 fans did not appreciate the prominent vocals and guitar of B.B. King, the lyrics are &quot;fantastic&quot; (as the King puts it in the movie), and if you love the blues . . . <br />13. &quot;Heartland&quot;. You can almost see the Mississippi going by in a bus window listening to this tune, an evocative mood piece which works much better than &quot;Love Rescue Me&quot;.<br />14. &quot;God Part II&quot;. A great rocker about contradiction and a lyrical and musical prequel to U2's &quot;reinvention&quot; in the 1990s.<br />15. &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; [Live]. With a recorded intro of Jimi Hendrix doing &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;, this is the consumate version of this song, which seems to take on a new context with each passing tour.<br />16. &quot;All I Want Is You&quot;. Although it seems a bit out of place on this record, this is simply one of the best U2 ballads ever.

B00005JKWJ|3.0|I will try and keep this short. If you liked the introduction of Eric Blade in the first film then you will probably like this. I think it is a good film but by no means a better film than the first. On the plus side the DVD is loaded. It has got all you expect to see on a successful box office film DVD. What is very evident from watching the DVD is that they had more money to spend this time and I think that some of it was well spent. I am very impressed by the special effects (most of the time).  But the special effects were over used and one bit did really spoil it for me. When it comes pretty obvious that a scene is computer generated or is actually a stunt man it spoils it for me. However what really lets this film down is the weak story. Vampire films are pretty much predictable. We all know the main premise, we all know how to kill them and so on. The story could have been a lot better if the characters were developed more. The cast gave excellent performances with the material given to them.  But you can't help but feel that the characters could be developed even more. <br />A major downer for me however, was the commentary on the DVD's. All I will say is that some of the language used was frankly vulgar and rude. It did not strike me as having the professional touch. Even though it was not as good as its predecessor, it definitely is worth a watching and (having for us Blade fans). Wesley Snipes is perfect as the dark avenger. Lots of action and lots of horror to satisfy all.
B000075BFK|5.0|I love the album.  The first track after the intro, Still Ballin with Trick Daddy got me going, I was hype and the rest kept me up.  But I like some of the songs underground version better for example Fair Exchange with PAC singing the hook.  The underground version sounds more street. The Outlawz, one of the greatest groups of all time, step it up on this album as they always did with PAC.  Never Be Peace is one of the hottest tracks to come out in a while.  This is the best album to come out in a while.  In all, the album is great and a must have for all PAC fans.  Go and get it right now!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|It wasn't supposed to happen this way. As a true R&B and rap fanatic, I had enjoyed being one of the biggest cynics of the Chritinas, the Britanys and the N'SYNCs of the pop music world. I was just about to laugh my way through a first listen of Christina's new CD \\"Stripped\\" (which I was glad to get free because I would NEVER buy it) and then it happend: Christina SUCKER PUNCHED me. Not in a long time have I heard such a powerful voice, such mesmorizing melodies, such eloquent lyrics. With \\"Stripped,\\" Christina has proven she is no Britany, she is no Justin, she soars above the rest and TRULY gives music lovers (I said \\"music lovers,\\" not necessarily \\"Christina lovers\\") a piece of herself that will give the harshest of cyncis (like me) goosebumps. It will raise the hairs on your neck, send you shivering with uncontrollable, musical orgasms. And so now, I am cursed by my initial cynicism, unable to remove the CD from my CD player, even bound to mouthing the lyrics in front of unsuspecting bystanders. I listen to it, I drive to it, I run to it, I have romantic moments with it - I truly love it. Take it from this 34-year old black man... Christina's \\"Stripped\\" will floor you. Let it sucker punch you too, it's one hit you won't regret.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Overall I liked the story, at least it was something new. The acting was decent. Both Christian Bale (American Psycho) and Mathew McConaughey are good actors in their own rights and did a convincing job. McConaughy as a futuristic &quot;dragonslayer&quot; of sorts and Bale simply as a man trying to keep his group of humans, as well as himself, safe from the new flying menace that has taken over the world.<br />Like most movies, there are a few gaping plot holes (ie: the helicopter and skydivers) but the special effects and overall screenplay may be enough to overlook those incidents.

B000050XEI|5.0|This was my second Enya album.  I had heard the song \\"Only Time\\" on the radio and wanted to try it out, and I'm certainly glad I did!  This CD has a very nostalgic, soft, airy feel to it, and the layered vocals and instrumentals are absolutely astounding!  The only exception to the soft, airy feel is \\"Tempus Vernum,\\" which, although dramatically different from the rest of the album, is enjoyably so.  \\"Tempus Vernum\\" is in Latin, and I do have a complete, unofficial translation in case anyone's interested.  Just email me ... and I'd be glad to send it to you.  <BR> To all who have never heard Enya before: this album is a terrific place to start!  If you enjoy nostalgic, dreamy New Age music, this is definitely for you!
0316666343|4.0|Sebold's novel Lovely Bones is refreshing in that it tells the story from the point of view of the victim. The victims in our society have no voice. In literal accounts our news media can only interview police, family, friends and with &quot;luck&quot; the murderer. Suzie is on the verge of exploding into the next stage of her life when she's lured away, murdered and taken from Earth. Her family is left to miss her and love her and wonder who she would have become. The novel chronicles what crime does to a the psyches of wide circle of people: their emotions encompass the missing, the grief, the wondering, the depression,the anger, the fear, the pain. Suzie sees her family and friends dealing with the stares, whispers, the feelings of being apart from the &quot;normal&quot; world; worrying about other loved ones; trying to trust others again and finally going forward into the future without dragging the pain of the past everywhere. The ending has a touch of miracle that I wish all victims could savor to give their souls rest.
B000077VPU|3.0|I just got this DVD, an impulse buy.  I was very disappointed to find out that it didn't include the part of the tribute show with the individual bands performing, particularly Extreme's great medley of Queen songs.  I can't believe they only included half of the show, despite the fact that this is a 2 DVD set.  Oh, well, next time I'll read the fine print.
B00005JKDR|5.0|terrific detail, great story.  My kids and I all love it.
0553579908|4.0|I was originally drawn to this series by some comments I read that favorably compared its author to JRR Tolkien--a parallel that Mr. Martin clearly encourages with his own prominent supernumeRaRy middle initials. While I find his Song of Ice and Fire similarly engaging and voluminous thus far, it's no Lord of the Rings. Yet why should it be? As a linguist and a scholar, JRRT spent years independently developing the languages, mythology, and political history of Middle Earth before turning Frodo loose within that world. In terms of depth and immersiveness, LotR derives incalculable benefit from the uniquely backward mode of its conception. It does not surprise me that other fantasy novels' settings often appear thin-fleshed and contrived by comparison (Frank Herbert's Dune being a rare exception). <br />While aSoIaF does exhibit some minor shortcomings in this regard, I think this sort of evaluation is ultimately unfruitful and misleading: Martin's strengths lie elsewhere. His aSoIaF reads as more medieval soap opera than epic literature, its vivid and immediate characterizations revealing the unspoken thoughts and emotions of the many protagonists. Although the supernatural exists, good and evil here are not personified as absolutes (cf. Sauron) but instead are manifest in human interaction, and their interpretation often depends on perspective. Events are told from the characters' point of view and are unavoidably filtered and colored by their egos. It is their hopes and fears, their stratagems and machinations, their interpersonal and physical conflicts that matter most in Martin's world. I wound up caring sincerely about Jon, Arya, Bran, and Tyrion--a dangerous undertaking, given Martin's unflinching (and admirable) refusal to shield his heroes from the Machiavellian, often lethal cruelty of their environment. <br />Several reviewers have decried or defended the graphic language that pervades these books. Martin deliberately aims for a certain coarseness, preferring blunt Anglo-Saxon words to flowery Latin cognates. This is intended to set a gritty, unsparing, medieval tone for the story, and apart from a few jarringly anachronistic turns of phrase (\\"butt cheeks\\", e.g.), it works well and is even refreshing, given the suffocating mawkishness of some other novels in the genre. Still, I must say I often found the continual parade of bodily functions, \\"whores\\" (willing and otherwise), and \\"Penthouse Forum\\"-style sexual conquests gratuitous and distracting, even juvenile at spots. Does the author's quest for ultimate realism require that his readers be privy to every bathroom break in the woods?  At such times I felt grateful to Tolkien for all that he left implied or unsaid in LotR. I don't mind graphic sexual imagery used in moderation to serve plot or characterization, but reading Martin sometimes feels like eating an entire bottle of ketchup with a single hot dog (somewhat ironically, the Amazon review editors nixed the Tabasco metaphor I had originally used here). Sometimes, less is more. <br />As with the frequent long \\"roster for today's tourney\\" lists of names and house sigils, such bits are easily skipped over without detriment, but it would be perilous to conclude that Martin is inflexibly prolix and incapable of subtlety: Some of the most wrenching plot revelations--I'm thinking of one in particular involving Bran--are first conveyed within the space of a few disarmingly parenthetical remarks! So, you must also keep your eyes peeled, or be prepared to backtrack if you're skimming.<br />Notwithstanding my various criticisms, I have thoroughly enjoyed this series and consider it well worth the effort to read, even if the pace does flag somewhat in the 2nd book. I'm eager to read \\"A Storm of Swords\\" as well as the 4th book, after which I suppose I'll join the frustrated souls who impatiently await the concluding installments, wondering how (and if) Martin plans to wrap it all up. I give the series to this point a solid\\"B\\", or 4 stars, with Book 1 earning a B-plus and Book 2 a B-minus.
B00004XONN|4.0|In Pablo Honey, we saw Radiohead emerge as a talented british anthemic rock band, with strong musicianship and songwriting abilities.  And while they didn't have anything which particularly stood them out from the rest, they had potential, particularly in the area of vocals.  Their next album to come out, The Bends, started them down the path of evolution into something very unique which is still in working order.  The music was more complex than that of Pablo Honey, and they really threw in something of their own.  In OK Computer, they took a step further in their modulating, and took on electronic elements.  Their songs were laced with electronic blips and bleeps, and again, their sound became more somber and melancholy.  Now, on Kid A, Radiohead have adopted an almost entirely electronic formula.<br />This is the album where they really start to experiment with different sounds, and interesting composition.  They don't seem to really care whether the songs turn out pleasing to fans, as they range from extremely listenable and somewhat conventional to more right-wing, often dull tracks.<br />About half of the album is made up of songs you'll actually enjoy.  Everything in its Right Place, Idioteque, Optimistic, How to Disappear Completely, National Anthem, Motion PicturE Soundtrack...These are the sort of songs which will became new Radiohead classics.  As for the others, they're interesting, but lack something, overall.<br />Treefingers and Kid A are simply too experimental and boring, making them difficult to sit through.  They might be good background music, but since there is little variation throughout the song, they won't stick.<br />As for In Limbo and Morning Bell; they're standard Radiohead stuff, but they lack catchiness and quality which can be found in other songs on the cd.  <br />In the beginning, this cd may seem naked.  There's probably the least going on here, in sheer sound than any other Radiohead album.  It's also a short cd, with a couple songs that are arguably not even &quot;songs.&quot;  However, after you give Kid A a chance in your cd player, you'll start to really appreciate most of the songs on this album, I guarantee it.  I've owned this cd for nearly one year now (got it last Christmas) and I can honestly say that How To Disappear Completely is on my list of top 5 Radiohead songs, ever.  I also have a soft spot for Idioteque, Optimistic and Everything In Its Right Place.<br />This was my first Radiohead cd, but I might've appreciated it more, initially, if I'd heard their other cd's first.  Don't turn this one down, by any means, but you might want to consider passing on it until you hear OK Computer and The Bends.
0066214122|4.0|Red Herring chose a nanotech backlash as a trend for 2003, and mentioned Prey. It was compared to Jurassic Park and its impact on biology. I would read the Foresight guidelines on nanotech safety, and David Forrest's initial guidlines, written in 1988.<BR>Good read, but consider the upside.

0553381350|5.0|Tom Wolfe's rollicking style (exclamation points!) can take a little getting used to, but once you settle in, you'll find that this is not just a fun-to-read book, but a well-written one too.<br />First, Wolfe clearly did his research, filling the story with details and facts which prove illuminating (I do wish he included dates more frequently; sometimes it's hard to tell when an event is taking place). His detailed descriptions of the flights of Alan Shepard, John Glenn and Chuck Yeager practically put you in the pilot's seat.<br />Second, he manages to capture the emotions and feelings of the time, showing the competitive nature that drove the astronauts, how their wives wanted respect, and how the public adored their new space heroes.<br />Finally, he ties it all together with some good philosophical insights. The Right Stuff! Single Warrior Combat!<br />My only lament about the book is that Tom Wolfe makes it look so easy. Too many writers since then have tried to imitate his style -- but without doing the fundamental research that makes a good story. The result can be tedious and superficial writing.
B000002NFM|5.0|This CD is wonderful and one of my favorites.  I love techno/trance and dance music in general and this is one of the best.  But beware, it is much different than the normal techno many of you are familiar with.  It includes a more hard rock sound with loads of beats looped. <BR> The one negative review I saw for this CD is unfair in that the reviewer is not an electronic music fan.  He/she complains of repeated, catchy beats and lyrics, the core of techno.  So disregard that negative, biased review.<BR>So I would recommend going out and buying this CD, it is a unique style but well worth it and will be a favorite of yours for a long time.
B000001FN8|5.0|Why people critise \\"Savage Amusement\\" for being lackluster, disappointing and anything, is still unknown for me. Play \\"Love at First Sting\\" first, then directly play \\"Savage Amusement\\". Scorpions sounded incredible on this record, the sound was better than on \\"Love at First Sting\\" and the songs are just as powerful, and although it didnt boost the same hits as its prequel, there are still so many wonderful songs here, that its hard to start with one. Superb gems on this record is \\"Rhythm of Love\\", \\"Passion Rules the Game\\", \\"Media Overkill\\", \\"Every minute Every Day\\" and the utterly Genius and powerful \\"Believe in Love\\", another Power Ballad.<br />Each of this song is almost as good as the songs on Love at First Sting, except for Believe in Love, which is better. After listening to Still Loving you for 10 years, discovering \\"Believe in Love\\" this summer was an incredible experience. This album suits me better than earlier Scorpions, as I prefer Power Ballads, and Mean and Clean Rock combined with wonderful melodies. This record got less raw powerful sound than Love at First Sting, but the production is cleaner, and the melodies sounds better. It may not match Love at First Sting, but that does not prevent this from being a perfect follow up to the perfect Rock album.<br />Strongly Recommended!!!
B000002JS6|5.0|This is without a doubt the best album AC/DC have done with Brian Johnson. The guitars are loud and raw and the vocals cut though you like a chain saw.If you're a fan of rock this one's for you.<br />The only way to listen to this album is to crank up the stereo full blast and ignore the neighbours.
B000002BHE|5.0|I wont go to much in personal Details, but my first love had this cd, and we listened to it all night. And there were one song we played over and over, and that was the brilliant masterpiece &quot;It`s all coming back to me now&quot;. Written by the Mastermind behind Meatloaf, Jim Steinman, this haunting song is fantastic. Celine does her strongest performance on this, filling every note with a force to be reckoned with. No other singer in the world could have done this so perfectly like Celine. <BR>If you got no idea of how the song sounds like, think a &quot;I`d do anything for love&quot; version sung by Celine Dion, but a little bit faster and dramatic. The Choir is there, the Piano, the powerful chords and the light &quot;angel-like&quot; parts. It is the most beautiful song ever.<BR>It alone gives this CD a 5`er.<br />So to rest assured Celine deserves the highest mark, I can get on to the rest of the album. <BR>The other great songs on the album, is &quot;Falling into you&quot; which is another song featuring lovely sax playing! Makes me shiver everytime. <BR>Then we got the melancolic &quot;Seduces me&quot; and the classic &quot;All by Myself&quot;. Much better than the versions sung by men, those sounds dull. <BR>The Lovely &quot;(You make me feel like A) Natural Woman&quot;, with a great chorus. I can feel the R&amp;B coming right thru the speakers. <BR>&quot;I dont Know&quot; is a wonderful, slow and sad song.<BR>&quot;Your Light&quot; is an upbeat catchy but still wonderful song, with an interesting verse. The Chorus is a bit to clichè for me, but the song is neverthless one of my favorites on the album. Finally, the short little diamond, &quot;Fly&quot;. It sounds so sweet, and Celine keeps her voice down, which gives her a whisperlike voice. Beautiful.<br />The songs I didnt care to much about, is &quot;Because you Loved Me&quot;, &quot;Make you Happy&quot;, &quot;Declaration of Life&quot;, &quot;Dreamin of You&quot;, &quot;I love you&quot;, &quot;If That`s what it takes&quot;, &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; and &quot;Call the Man&quot;. Now there is ONE question I have to ask. Why on Earth do Celine have to ruin the records with the noisy songs in the middle of the silent and calm ones? On this record, she does it with the horrible &quot;River Deep, Mountain Deep&quot;, a song originally recorded by Tina Turner. As said, the problem here is that this song isnt exactly laidback, slow and fitting. It`s noisy, and destroys the whole mood. You will probably jump too, it comes right in after &quot;I dont know&quot;. <BR>This is the same problem as in &quot;Let`s talk about Love&quot;, where &quot;Treat her like a lady&quot; appears from nothing and ruins everything, all the mood the record built up destroyed in a second. Why?<br />Oh well, this is a minor flaw with the record, besides from that, this is superb stuff. Celine sounds simply great. The thing about Celine`s album, is that all the songs are written by different writers, making it impossible to love everything. Thats why I rate this a 5, even with all the songs I didnt like, because if I ask a friend, he/she will like other songs. This is also the case on Lets Talk about Love, which I strongly recommends too. But for now, run out, buy this cd, and engulf yourself with &quot;It`s all coming back to me Now&quot;. You will soon discover that this is Celine`s best song.
B000000OF6|5.0|BR>The songs looks like brand new every day. The classics never die. Ive learned enjoy Queen because of her.<BR>This album must be in your collection. Who likes real rockn roll, likes Queen!!
B0000026T4|4.0|Some say that Trash and Hey Stoopid are Alice Lowest. Why? They contain some of his best songs! Who havent heard Poison? <br />This cd contains some extremly great songs, full of power. \\"Poison\\", \\"Spark in the Dark\\", \\"House of Fire\\", \\"Only My heart Talkin`\\" and \\"Hell is living without you\\" are superb songs, and makes this one of the classics of the 80`s. Produced by superman Desmond Child, who has worked with Ratt, Alannah Myles, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi and many more, this certainly explaines the catchy rock and the great hits!<BR>The strongest combination is on Bed of Nails, written by Alice Cooper, Desmond Child AND Diane Warren, known for many, many hits(Cher and Meatloaf). No doubt I love this album.<br />The lesser great songs, \\"Why Trust You\\", \\"Trash\\" and \\"I`m your gun\\" are mostly fillers, while \\"Why Trust you\\" is pretty decent, \\"Trash\\" and \\"I`m your gun\\" are...exactly Trash. But hey, 2 bad songs on a record, thats alright! <br />To be short and Sweet, this is my favorite Alice, Filled to the brim of Power Ballads, not to Heavy but not poppy, he certainly does a fantastic job on this record. It is one of the records you just got to have, not only because it boosts so many hits, but also because of the enjoyable rock he plays, and of Course....It`s Alice.<br />Dont forget Hey Stoopid, in my opinion a even better record!
B0000069CT|5.0|This cd was chosen for the GROSSLY overlooked Concerto No 3, I couldn't believe this piece is not played more often! <br />Do you wish you could find a new and fresh concerto and are sick of listening to or playing the standard ones over and over? Well this is the CD you want for sure then! Bruch was like most composers: a hopeless romantic. There are so many pieces of unquestionable power and beauty he has written. All of the concertos by Bruch are soothing and relaxing and make for a perfect atmosphere of beauty and romance. <br />It is well known about Mr. Accardo's collection of great violins and his ability to change from a Strad to a Guarneri. Here he presents an unbelievable display of awesome tone from his violin, a lot better than the other recordings I have heard by him. His vibrato is lush and phrasing is wonderful here. <br />Many people put Accardo's abilities down, based on his performances of Paganini or Haydn concertos. While I do not fully recommend those recordings, if you have been biased by his other recordings, you will be surprised at the beauty of this CD. I submit that the recording of Concerto 3 here is completely essential and necessary.<br />While the Concerto 1 is played very well here, I recommend Kyung Wha Chung's live recording paired with the Beethoven. For the Scottish Fantasy, check out Rabin and Heifetz. Make sure to check out the Bruch Double Concerto too, totally awesome music with warmth and power!<br />To all professional violin players out there: please consider putting the Bruch Concerto 3 in your repertoire, it is awesome!
B000002AE3|4.0|Toto is a group of many men. Every record has had its up`s and downs, but the common thing is the few diamonds on each albums. Unfortunatly, Tambu only boosts ONE real diamond, the superb &quot;I will Remember&quot;. The rest arent Diamond`s, but they are gem`s at least!<br />Not to say the rest of the record is bad! For it isnt, its quite competent, and it manages to sound stable and relaxed, these guys got control over their hands. <BR>The Good songs include..<BR>&quot;I Will remember&quot; (Wonderful all the way...)<BR>&quot;Slipped Away&quot; (Oh the verse is great, it is right there it should be. Not so good chorus, but I can survive that for the sweet verse)<BR>&quot;If you Belong to Me&quot; (One of the ballads on the album, it is pretty good!)<BR>&quot;The Other end of Time&quot; (I really love this verse...can sound a bit to much like I will remember, but thats not a bad thing! Chorus is a bit slow and wrong though..) <BR>&quot;The Turning Point&quot; (Catchy! I`d normally give a song like this thumb down, but it just sounds like Toto, so I will be kind to it)<BR>&quot;Time is the Enemy&quot; (Another Catchy song, playful Piano and unusual rythm..)<BR>&quot;Just Cant get to you&quot; (Yes, its another wonderful ballad, with great verse but way to sappy, boyband like chorus. If you can tolerate the chorus, you will love it.)<BR>&quot;The Road goes On&quot; (YEAH! I know thats no good description, but the song is great! Unusual with its use of accustic guitar, but the times it catches up it bursts out into a great state of music that is apar with toto`s best songs)<br />The rest of the songs are so-so, they are not bad, but if we look at the total, Tambu is actually very good! The first listen was a bit hard, but when I started to play it regulary, I noticed how much I liked many of the songs. It can stroll abit away from the true Toto formula, but its a good record, and when &quot;The Road goes on&quot; have run out, you will be tempted to press play anothertime...to listen more.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld, a great show to watch a thousand times. So please put the episodes on DVD so millions of people can enjoy their favorite episodes of this great tv-show!
B000001DV2|4.0|Long before the overpoppy &quot;X&quot; came out, there was a record called Adrenalize by Def Leppard. Rated by many as a failed successor to Hysteria, I think that isnt completly right. Adrenalize isnt incredible as Hysteria, but it is pretty damn close. <BR>It starts off with a bang, &quot;Lets get Rocked&quot;, which is a awesome rocker, perfectly in the veins of Hysteria. <BR>&quot;Heaven is&quot; isnt great, but still, it works as a great filler. <BR>&quot;Make Love like a Man&quot; is a weird song, and the title kinda scares me, but it shows that Def Leppard still plays around with their music, and it is a catchy chorus. <BR>&quot;Tonight&quot; Reminds me of the music on Pyromania, listen to it because it is hard to describe it very clearly. <BR>It goes over to &quot;White Lightning&quot;, a song built up on Guitars. Not that great really, but it makes way for my favoritesong on the album, <BR>&quot;Stand up(Kick love into Motion)&quot; Ohhh...for those who have read my reviews of other things, you are aware of my knack for power ballads. This song fits perfectly. Wonderful verse and chorus, a great song for lovers. If Animals had this chorus, Animals would have been the perfect song. They really sound alike.<BR>After a repeat, its time for song number 7, &quot;Personal Property&quot;, and this song isnt any special. Its what they call another Rocker, ala Def Leppard.<br />Then, to my all time favoritesong of Def Leppard, the most wonderful song they have made.<BR>&quot;Have you ever needed someone so Bad&quot;. The Sole reason I bought this record, is this song. I cannot describe the feeling I get when listening to this song, a lot of girls I know have borrowed this cd over and over just for this song. Its pretty much the best song they have written, with a text that resembles the problems with love everyday. The melody is haunting and beautiful, yet powerful with its guitars and heavy drums. You want a real powerballad? Here it is.<br />Oh well, back to reality and the rest of the Record. &quot;I wanna Touch U&quot; is an uplifting rocker, with a good chorus, one of the better songs on the record.<BR>And the last song, &quot;Tear it Down&quot; is just decent.<br />So whats this I see? Adrenalize not being a good record? Wake up people, Adrenalize is a great record, maybe due to the fact that some of its songs are much better than on Hysteria, but the whole isnt, so its not better. If you can forget about Hysteria, or start with this one, Adrenalize is a great rockrecord from one of the best bands out there!
B00005S6K8|5.0|Ok so I have never seen the origional, who cares this version was great, it made me want to go to paris. this is one of the best (family films) to come out of hollywood in the last decade. a great film.Julia Ormond is badly underated in the US
B000002HK4|5.0|Dream Theater. The word is almost identical with Technical Quality and musical perfection. <br />And what a wonderful way to show this with &quot;Change of Seasons&quot;, a record with only 5 tracks, but when the shortest one is 5:33 and the longest is a grand 23:06 it isnt really a short record anyway. <BR>To get the other songs out of the way first, they are ALL Covers. &quot;Funeral for a Friend and Love Lies Bleeding is a VERY good cover of Elton John! I found my self searching for the original song, and found it nowhere as good as this version.<BR>&quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; originally recorded by Deep Purple, is a well known rock piece, and its sufficent to say that Dream Theater does a good job covering it.<BR>&quot;The Rover/Achilles Last Stand/The Song Remains the Same&quot; is a Led Zeppeling cover, however due to my lack of interest in Led Zeppelin, I cannot say wether or not it is good(In risk of making anyone irritated)<BR>&quot;The Big Medley&quot; Cool, they covered my favoriteband, Pink Floyd. This is basically 6 songs written by different groups, melted into one lengthy cover. Highlights of it is of course &quot;In the Flesh&quot; by PF, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen and &quot;Turn it on again&quot; by Genesis. GREAT!<BR>Here ended the coversongs, on to the only song made by Dream Theater, worth the CD alone.<br />So the king of the record, the majestic and grandiose &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;. A Superb example of how to become a mark in the history of Rock. The song changes mood between each stages, an is divided into 7 of them. Some stages are better than others, but they fit together pefectly. It goes from brooding dark guitars, to experimental rock which is a showcase for the band to the best part in the middle, a powerful Ballad which is so incredibly raw and strong, its hard not to rewind a bit to hear it again. <BR>Needless to say, Change of Seasons is nothing short of a masterpiece, and deserves to be treated that way. Not the best way to Start with Dream Theater due to all the cover songs, but if you have heard &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; or &quot;Metropolis 2: Scenes from a memory&quot; first, this is the next place to stop. <br />ABSOLUTELY FINEST.
630469797X|5.0|Its hard for me to say, but this film really is better than N.O.T.L.D. Romero scores big time with this genuinely frightening, inteligent comentary on the human race. While the main plot is the characters trying to survive, Romero sneeks in a sub-plot about human indulgences. The main characters start off in a tv station, but when they get their hands on a helicopter, they run off to a mall. The characters board themselves up in the mall (much like the characters in Night do to the house) and temporarily have the mall all to themselves. In this time, they go on a rampage through the mall, taking whatever they want, back up to their little room upstairs. Of course, like all Romero films, things go awry, and we are treated to a spectacular finish. In the end, its not the zombies the characters worry about, but something far worse. Watch it to find out what. A+++. <br />Note: Of course, the gore is in abundence, and it looks great.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I didnt listen to Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence(Hereby shorted SDOIT) before I bought it, so I was totally neutral on my first listen. Many years since Scenes from a Memory was released, my hunger for new DT material was unexplainable. <br />Here I am, over a half year later and dozens of times listening, writing the review for SDOIT. <br />First things first, Dont expect Scenes from a Memory over again. This is a completly different record, and the only thing left is the superb quality of the worlds best musicians. The melodies on SDOIT is not bad at all, they keep getting better and better. They are however a bit unfamiliar to you the first time.<br />The first song, &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; is a heavy heavy song, albeit with some nice touches and it turns out to be very good once you have listened to it some times. Really nice start, both for the song and the record. Can sound a bit like the start of &quot;Change of Seasons&quot;, which is not a bad thing.<br />The second coming up, is &quot;Blind Faith&quot;. A song it can be hard to place on a correct style, but the song is great with its use of Piano, and it reminds me of Scenes from a Memory. <br />Running Third is &quot;Misunderstood&quot;, it starts of slowly, a welcome change after the two more hard songs. It lulls you into a relaxed feeling in the beginning, but it soon picks up, and the brooding feeling is always there. Accustic guitars and eerie noises in the background(sounds like the worms from Pink Floyd`s &quot;The Wall&quot;). It builds up from the lush and slow mood, and then it bursts out to a rocker. Great!<br />&quot;The Great Debate&quot; is a song I often listen to. The background chatters that almost becomes the vocals, are different people discussing the pros and cons of Stem Cell research. I REALLY like the bassline on this one, it gives it a kinda hurried, dramatic feeling. The only problem with this song is that you can hear how lousy the people`s arguments are...^_^<BR>The melodyhowever is superb and it is a catchy song, worth many spins in your player. <br />Last up on the first disc, &quot;Disappear&quot;. A slow, dark accustic song, it sounds almost like Marilyn Manson`s slower pieces. Needless to say, one of the best songs on the cd, and definetly a song for SFAM fans(Like me).<br />Disc two is spectacular, following the veins of &quot;Change of Seasons&quot;. It is really just one song, &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;, splitted up into 8 pieces. The Intro and outro are amazing, while the Intro is a example of what these guys are able to do, the outro is a wonderful powerballad which can remind of the middlepart in &quot;Change of Seasons&quot;. I didnt find the rest of of the pieces as good, but they all change styles, and there is enough musical styles here to satisfy most listeners. <BR>Great song.<br />What do we make out of this? For the first, What could have been a weak follow up to SFAM, became a major record, so big it had to fill 2 cd`s. All the songs have depth, and there are big amounts of production values, writing and polishing behind everyone. This is what records in 2002 should sound like, played by professionals, not by teens who sing and dance to computerized rythms. Long live Dream Theater, defender of the whole essence called music.
B0000009RT|5.0|This is the first Double Album, EVER, and what a fine start.  \\"Concept album\\"? - what ties it together is the sarcasm.  These songs are well crafted parodies of 'greasers' and doo wop - the Temps & the Coasters or the Toasters or something [tracks 2, 4, Motherly Love, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12]; and California surf music like Dick Dale or the Ventures [tracks 1, Wowie Zowie, Any Way The Wind Blows].  All with healthy doses of Zappa's contempt for modern 1966 society - That's what a Freak Out! is all about.  Then there's Zappa the \\"composer, arranger, orchestrator and conductor\\" - tinkering around in the studio with new equipment [tracks 3; Help, I'm A Rock; 14].  Zappa has one of the fastest, most complex guitar solo's of anyone; along with pure vocals and tight instruments from the only band that Frank could ever whip into shape - The Mothers of Invention.
B00006J3T4|2.0|I dont got much to say about this album. Huge disappointment would fit nicely. While &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; was a major success and something for everyone, &quot;The Ragpickers Dream&quot; is a..well its not a bad record, for its not! I just cant stand it. This review is not to say its bad, its to warn those who think it is something like &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot;. I thought it was, and bought it. I wasnt particularly happy after it was finished. 2 great songs, &quot;Why Aye Man&quot; and &quot;The Ragpickers Dream&quot; isnt enough to make the record good. They are the only two songs who could have fit on STP. <br />I dont know what to say about this. I am a huge fan of his Dire Straits style, with his slideguitars and catchy riffs, but they are gone! Listen to this album before you even think of buying it. Lets hope Mark changes his mind on the next album, giving us a varied rock album with great songs and guitarplaying.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is one of the best rock albums in a good while. Considering I was a huge Rage fan, I was jumping at the chance to get this album, and did it ever pay off. Get this album, if you like loud rock music with smokin'lyrics and guitar riffs that will blow you away(thanks to Tom Morello)then you will not be disappointed at all. Here's to their next album!
B000001EUR|5.0|LOADED with hits! Love at First Sting is a powerful, melodic record filled to the edge with sharply written melodies, in a time where Hard Rock Bands knew what they were doing and their closest friend was their guitar. And it doesnt show any clearer than here. The first thing you hear on this record is the guitar soaring thru the speaker, and the last thing you hear is how it fades out, inwillingly to die. And the last track, \\"Still loving you\\" will always live on as the real, mean Power Ballad, the king of them all.<BR>It is as earlier written loaded with hits, among them are the now legendary \\"Rock you like a Hurricane\\", \\"Big City Nights\\", \\"As Soon as the Good Times Roll\\", \\"I`m Leaving You\\", \\"Crossfire\\" and the powerful smashhit number one, \\"Still loving you\\". I still have a hard time holding back the fingers from tapping wildly on the keyboard as I listen to it, but for the review`s sake, I have to control my self. Otherwise this is pure power. All the songs have so wonderful guitarplaying, eternal choruses and GREAT solos! <br />This is just pure perfection, a record that never will be succeeded by any rockbands, not even Scorpions themself. However, Scorpions have released many superb albums afterwards too, worth checking out, but if you want the best of all rock albums ever, get this. RIGHT NOW.
B00005JLWL|5.0|In a world not to inthe distant future, a strict regime has eliminated war by suppressing emotions: books, art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death. Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) is a top-ranking government<BR>agent *like a super cop,judge and excutoner* responsible for destroying those who resist these rules. When he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-alterering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it.<br />this movie is getting panned by critics but really qwhat dothey know.<BR> this movie has the actoon of matrix .. yet  the martial arts are more believeable. I swear after you see gun kata in action you will really thinkyou to cvan do all these movies. thesenone of that 20 feet inthe air or punchs that knock a person back 30 ft and all those other wire trips.<br /> The whole idea of no emotions due tothe drug that everone has to take after the 3rd world war. does bother me because I'd see emotion as the drive behind everything.. going to work and the need for a promotion and the act of procreation.. and such.. but maybe i'm missing it.<br />Bale  and Diggs do an awesome job..  , the movie having I think a 20 mil budget you could hardlt tell.<BR> It's the type of film that has two messages.. THe one that the average action person gets and the one for the thinker.<BR> Hmm now are you average or are you a THINKER??
6305508550|5.0|the first half of this movie is extremely funny and the rest is just ok. the only way you wouldn't find this movie funny was if you never have worked in an office, or if you happen to be the boss in an office with the personality of the boss in this movie.
B000002C1W|2.0|I really love Pink Floyd.  Each of their albums offer a very different selection of songs.  However this one is quite bland.  The songs all melt together, so I can't even say which are good and which are bad.  It is obvious that after Water's left, the band did have to reinvent itself, just as it did after Syd Barrett left after &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn.&quot;  This album is easy to overlook, and I don't suggest getting it unless you want to complete your collection.
B000001FI7|5.0|This was my first taste of Portishead (I have since purchased \\"Portishead\\") and I adore it.  There's a certain pain that goes with listening to Gibbons' lyrics -- her voice is both shaky and solid, hearwrenching and drugging.  She opens her mouth and a soul comes rushing out at us, with all its highs and lows, fears, love, anguish, and sadness all wrapped up into a compact ball.  You just have to listen, and let the music wash over you.
B000066AXC|4.0|A Beautiful Mind scored a number of awards at the Oscars. True, the film was a rollercoaster of a ride through the mind of John Nash, a brilliant yet troubled genius, but it still wasn't a good as everyone's making it out to be. I think that the film received much of it's praise based soley on the performance by Crowe - in which he does a wondeful job as the extremely intelligent, yet overly troubled professor.<br />This film is based on a true story and that's why it lacks so much. There are lapses of pure boredom that make us think the best is yet to come. Well, it never really becomes great, just good. I have to give Ronnie Howard credit; he did the best with the plot he was given. I mean, the whole film deals with a genius and the constant demons he must face. It's hardly A Taxi Driver, Cool Hand Luke, or any other of the great cinematic films that have graced the screen over the years.<br />A Beautiful Mind will suffice your need for an intellectual film based on the mind, personal demons, and paranoia. It won't, however, go down in the archives as one of the best films of all time.
B000003TSP|5.0|My first taste of Portishead was with &quot;Dummy&quot; and I wasn't disappointed at all with &quot;Portishead&quot;.  I love Gibbons' voice and the music is lucidity in a jewel-case for a tense individual.
0316666343|1.0|This is possibly the most over-rated book I have ever had the displeasure to read. Even if you can get past the deeply disturbing murder scene, you won't be rewarded. I kept hoping I would begin to care about ANY of these characters or their trite and one-dimensional lives, yet even as the book mercifully ended I found myself wondering why I had bothered to finish it. I kept hoping to figure out what all the rave reviewers had found so remarkable in this little piece of junk. Ultimately, I was just annoyed with myself for wasting so much time on a book so profoundly disappointing.
B00005QIPH|4.0|this is real music.  the truth.  anyone who disputes doesnt know, is probably &quot;basking in soma&quot;.  listen to the revolution.  theyre not just 70s knockoffs listen and hear punk, Nirvana, the Pixies the smiths, anything you want.  again I implore you forget the hype and Listen.
B00000K2SC|5.0|The Matrix was brilliant, superb special effects, excellent storyline which has the ability to play on your mind for ages afterwards.  Wouldn't it be weird if life were actually like that and none of us knew, all going about our daily business with not a clue.<br />When Keanu Reeves does find out the truth however, it was interesting to see how it made him violently sick, mind you, so would you be if you had been fed lie after lie all your life and then found out what the truth really was - rather like changing eating habits after a lifetime of rubbish, he must have wondered what had hit him, especially as it was more bizarre than he had ever imagined.<br />I have no idea when The Matrix II is coming out, all I do know is, when it does appear I will be purchasing it.  Great film!
B000002G87|3.0|Well...a question best answered by others. I liked Clapton long before this LP and still like some of his work. As a piece of work this is not his best work, some tracks yes but mostly no. 461 Ocean Blvd. is better as a album. Eric Clapton is best served LIVE. Derek and the Dominos Live at the Fillmore, EC was Here,etc.... do youself a favor...go live or go home.
6305718903|5.0|Stigmata for me was intriguing and intensely watchable.  I thought the acting was superb and the storyline as good as they get.  Full of symbolism and clues along the way, Patricia Arquette is brilliant as the Stigmatic and Gabriel Byrne who plays the priest trying to save her, equally so.<br />This film received mixed reviews in the UK, some of them not too flattering, I am just so glad that I watched it regardless.  The soundtrack is wicked, so much so, I bought the CD.<br />Some people have taken this film as an affront to religion, I did not see it that way at all, on the contrary, the wounds of Christ that were appearing on the character in the film sent a thousand and one messages out to the viewer.<br />I have seen this film five times now and I know, that I will watch it again, thoroughly enjoyable with a very different storyline.<br />Keep an eye open for the small text at the end of the film regarding the hidden gospel, because that really does make you think.
B000001FN3|5.0|Well it's been years since the release of this LP/CD. But it has aged well like a fine wine. The additional voice overs by Orson Wells is a nice touch. As a Parson Fan, it is difficult to use this as a bench mark to measure all albums/ CDs against. Turn the lights off and turn it up and loose yourself in this CLASSIC.... its a great ride!
B00001MXXG|5.0|Ferris Bueller is by far one of the funiest movies of all time!!! So what if this DVD does not have 50 hours of extended scenes or bloopers.  You dont need bloopers when the movie is funnnier then most bloopers.  FERRIS BUELLER ROCKS!!!!!!!!!
0792839749|4.0|This is one of the last big budget fantasy musicals before these films became just too expensive to produce. But Dick Van Dyke was at his zenith here and Sally Ann Howes was marvelous as well. Note that Ian Fleming wrote the original story and as a tribute there were two Bond actors in the cast. Gert Frobe as the King and Desmond Llewyn as Mr. Coggin. But I was very dissappointed to see this DVD released in the Pan and Scan format. I really don't understand why MGM/UA remastered the film in the THX process and used a clean beautiful video transfer and doesn't present the film in its original widescreen format. At one-third of the film is missing and its really difficult to watch this now considering I had owned the widescreen laserdisc of this film.
0553296981|4.0|The book that I just finished reading is called Anne Frank The Diary of a Young Girl written by Anne Frank herself.  It is one of the best book that I have ever read.  It tells you about the life of a teenage girl who is trying to survive the awful times of the Holocaust while in hiding.  Along with her, there are seven other people living in this hiding place.  She learns how to cooporate with other people and how to live while all cooped up.  The story takes place in Amsterdam and the hiding place is called the \\"Secret Annexe\\".  There are two people who get them their food and take care of them.  The end of this book is so heart-wrenching that it is unbelieveable.  I would definately give this book nine stars out of ten.  This book is so informative that is really makes you realize how fortunate we really are these days.  It explains everything so well that you can't even believe that something this horrible could ever even happen.  This book has definately made me think completely different in a good way and I hope that it will do the same for you.
1402521154|4.0|I purchased this book to occupy my time during a 4 hour flight. Overall I enjoyed it. The first half of the book is much stronger, which is probably why I finished it on the flight home. The author seems to get tired in the middle and looks to an unbelievable recovery, an over-the-top supernatural event, to close the book. This was the only disappointment though. There were times the book made me cry which is not surprising for a mother of three. All total, it was worth the money. Being written from the little girls perspective, I think this would be an excellent audio CD or cassette gift.
B00005OAIE|5.0|To me,mayer sounds more like phil collins,not dave. compare the sound when they go high in &quot;I cant walk&quot; and &quot;No Such thing&quot;...very similar.thank you.
0375414053|5.0|... As a working exec / mummy, I agree that some parts of the book make Kate Reddy unsymphathetic, but come on! It was a great read- no matter if parts of the novel ring untrue, enough anecdotes cut so close to home that the basic TRUTH of the book shines clear through---<br />How many other novels deal honestly with this most-important-subject-in the -world:  the fact that working motherhood (or any motherhood) can be funny, wonderful, horrid, demeaning, guilt-ridden, and impossibly enriching....? Even though I'm not in Kate's financial class- she does seem rich- her fears, hopes, dreams, confessions, and methods to the madness ARE just like mine- leaving me to believe that working mothers everywhere should unite.. :)<br />The story was engrossing funny and sad (although I would have liked a different ending) and I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK MORE, especially to mommies, both working-and-not, <br />As for Daddies: Read this book. It'll not only show you the similarities, but highlights the differences between men and those of us on the 'mommy track'
B00003CXI0|5.0|With an open mind, this movie can touch the soul of any child and \\"the child\\" in any adult.  My husband is Catholic.  I'm primarily Buddhist.  He's an attorney.  I'm a speech pathologist.  He's read every Harry Potter book.  I haven't read any.  Nonetheless, we watched the \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" movie together for the first time with sheer delight!  Whether the \\"magic\\" throughout the movie is perceived as symbolic or real, countless lessons in morality may be derived:  i.e. 1) To take a risk and remove yourself from the same old setting and humdrum routine because you may embark upon the most rewarding experience of your life, 2) To face your personal demons using intuition and having faith that good will prevail, 3) To cherish and reflect upon your past without holding on, 4) To accept your areas of weakness, to maximize your areas of strength, and to encourage and rely on the strengths of others, 5) To stay focused on your own ball in the \\"game of life\\" because your objectives may not be the same others, and by obtaining your objectives, you help others achieve their own goals, 6) To cease judgment upon those individuals or things that \\"appear evil\\" because to your surprise, they may turn out to be quite the opposite... and as I mentioned earlier, countless other lessons... But regardless of what you absorb from Harry Potter, it's inevitable not consider the movie as suspenseful as it is humorous.  The acting was superb, the special effects were impressively imaginative, and I recommend every teacher and parent out there to take advantage of the popularity of this story.  It is utterly a GOLDMINE for language-based activities.  TWO THUMBS UP from both Hubby and me... and with flying colors, Harry Potter passed the virtually impossible criteria for our \\"repeat watch\\" list!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This cd is totally awesome. I've waited a whole six months for this and it proved the wait. It's more of a new thing for the music industry the whole lesbian thing whether it's true or not who knows except them. Aside from that the techno sounds pumping out with a poppish chorus is truly great. Alot of magazines are saying that this is the future of pop and I'm glad it has a techno feel to it rather than the rap thats going on now. This cd is really worth the 6 to 10 bucks you shell out.
B00007E8O5|5.0|HAUNTING IS THE FIRST WORD THAT COMES TO MIND.ITS A VERY HEART FELT POTRAYL OF PAIN AND RELEASE.JUST THINK OF SITTING IN YOUR HOUSE FOR FOUR MONTHS STRAIT MAKING MUSIC WELL THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.YOU HAVE THE SWEET SOUND OF 31/32 TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL WITH PIG CHARMER AND SPIDERBITE.TO ME THIS IS HIS BEST WORK EVERY AND ALICE IN CHAINS IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE BAND.MUSIC IS ALL EMOTION THAT IS WHAT DEGRADATION TRIP IS PURE EMOTION.
B000075BFK|3.0|If you were to count the actual number of CDs that have come out since Tupac Shakur's murder in September 1996, Better Dayz would actually be the 7th & 8th (Makaveli - 1;  R U Still Down - 2 & 3;  Still I Rise - 4;  Until the End of Time - 5 & 6).  One might expect the quality of recordings to go down with each passing release; however, they have remained remarkably consistent.<BR>   Like previous efforts, this album definitely contains some gold nuggets.  Disc One includes \\"Still Ballin\\", \\"When We Ride on Our Enemies\\", \\"Street Fame\\", and \\"Ghetto Star\\", which are excellent songs that capture the very essence of Makaveli.  Disc Two boasts the superb numbers \\"My Block\\", \\"Thugz Mansion\\", \\"U Can Call\\", and \\"Fame\\".<BR>   Two songs stand out, easily rising into the category of among 2Pac's best work ever.  \\"Mama's Just a Little Girl\\" is not only heartbreaking and hopeful, but is incredibly innovative in the delivery of its lyrics and beats.  And \\"Better Dayz\\" is one of those songs we've been waiting for - it almost seems like they should have saved it for his final CD.<BR>   As good as these tracks are, however, they can not disguise the fact that Shakur's estate is repeatedly falling into the same trap every year.<BR>   The problem is that for every brilliant song that is released, there are at least two \\"filler\\" songs that suffer from poor sound quality or overproduction by artists that really have no business being involved with 2Pac's legacy.  Understandably, Afeni Shakur and Suge Knight have sought to update (sometimes completely change) many of the unreleased tracks in an effort to keep the sound current while expanding his fan base beyond the standard cult following.  It just seems like sometimes they pick the worst possible people to accomplish this task.<BR>   Bringing in Nas to work on the project shocked me at first, but to be truthful I was pleasantly surprised to hear him apologize to Afeni Shakur as well as bow to 2Pac, calling him \\"The Ghetto King of the War\\".  It was hard for me to stay mad at him when he fully admitted that 2Pac is superior and in effect asked \\"How can I be down?\\"  I guess time will tell if he is sincere or not.<BR>   This album is not as thorough as \\"Until the End of Time\\", due to a smaller number of new tracks and a larger number of guest performers.  It does reflect a growing sense of inevitability that we're approaching the day when his unreleased music runs out.  But with so many releases slated for next year (the big 7th anniversary) and the promise of a few more projects after that (think \\"Thug Life Volume 2\\"), there is still much to look forward to.<BR>   If you are any kind of 2Pac fan, this album is definitely worth your time and money.  Just don't get your hopes up that the production problems of the past few years have been corrected.<BR>   Rest in Peace, 2Pac.  You are the greatest rapper to ever touch the game.
0786868694|5.0|I recently purchased this book (I own Nigella's other three, including the recent British release \\"Forever Summer\\" - also very good) and I have been really pleased with it. I was originally dissuaded from buying this book from a reviewer on the UK site who said that this book was a combination of \\"Domestic Goddess\\" and \\"HOw to Eat\\"; it is not. Nigella's style is very chatty and it is like having a friend in the kitchen with you. She also encourages substituting ingredients (offering her own options) when you are unable to find something, such as Seville Oranges. She also encourages that the reader/cook use these recipes as a guideline, changing them to suit their own taste/ingredients on hand, and she includes a section at the end of each chapter where you can jot down your own notes. I have already tried two of the recipes, the Lemon Risotto and the Chicken Breast with Cannellini Beans and Kale (I substituted Beetroot Greens - I am sure Nigella would approve.) These met with great success from my culinarily spoiled husband, who said they tasted great, and from me, since both recipes were fantastically easy, yet looked like I tried so much harder than I did. Nigella's recipes range from slow-cooked meals for lazy weekends to very fast dinners, what ever suits the cook and the eater(s). Finally, thumbs up to the organizational sections of the book, and I positively cannot give less than five stars to anyone who readily admits to being an Amazon addict (like myself!) Check this book out - you will not be disappointed! :)
B000002MY3|5.0|From the first note she sings, that voice sets Alanis Morissette apart from other singers, and so well does her voice belong to her lyrics that one wonders if she designed it.<br />Her lyrics reach deep enough when they make sense.  Every once in a while, she slips in something strange, enigmatic, crazy.  That's when she really gets to the heart of the matter.  &quot;I'm a sinner, I'm a saint,&quot; she proclaims, and I know just the woman she's talking about - doesn't everyone?<br />In another song, Alanis confides in her lover, &quot;I've never wanted something rational before.&quot;  Six words tell a lifestory.<br />A strange, wailing voice and odd, meaningful lyrics deliver a resonant Word.  Alanis' magick must be experienced to be believed.
0452270073|4.0|Barker's novel is a most impressive anti-war novel, wonderfully written and meticulously accurate in its characters' psychoanalysis.  I occasionally had some trouble enagaing with the story, but that is most likely a result of my personal preferences (and non-preferences).  I lean more toward plot driven tales, but this should delight anyone who prefer character driven fiction.
B00006RINF|5.0|I bought this CD at the recommendation of a friend having never heard the band previously.  And I have not regretted it since.  This is a unique, inspiring and fresh approach to a relatively stale metal scene.  The dual vocalists, in what is the one and only time I have EVER liked this situation, cause 2 dynamics that create such a hauntingly beautiful sound that it just boggles my mind.  Never did I ever think that a band could sound like a mixture of say Tori Amos and Meshuggah, but Lacuna Coil accomplishes such a feat, and does it so well that it is a shame these guys aren't well known.  Now, I tend to usually like more aggresive music, but this album just consumed me from the first listen.  With its melodies combined with the awesome metal riffs, this sounds just amazing.  HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam has been around for a long time.   ....  <br />PJ's music has  reflected their growth as musicians, as well as individuals.  The latest effort is simply another example of a band that is not afraid to push boundaries, explore who they are, and lay it down on a track.<br />YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS CD SEVERAL TIMES.  Not until then, will you discover this gem.  We live in a world of instant gratification (yeah, there is some of that on this CD), but Vedder puts it all in perspective on Love Boat Captain.  He has fun with our current President (Bush Leaguer), tackles such issues as self-abuse (Save You), and provides introspection on such tracks as All or None.  <br />You want bubble gum, go for it.  You want the real deal? Get this one.<br />By the way...from someone who saw their warm up tour in Seattle in 12/02, don't underestimate these guys.  They could be as big as any group around, but they do things on their own terms.  Another reason to say...Pearl Jam rules.  They do it for the music...in an ocean of mediocrity, they \\"get\\" it.
B00006LI4S|4.0|This was an awesome DVD of an awesome guitarist.  It was cool to see him play him play some of the Pink Floyd songs.  It was also cool to see him play some of the Syd Barret tunes.  I wish he would have played some more of his solo stuff.  The unplugged aspect of this DVD added to the affect because it did demonstrate that he can actually play.  I was also happy to see him playing with Rick Wright on a song.<br />The reason I gave this 4 stars is because it would be nice to see him and Roger Waters put their diffrences aside.  I've seen &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, I've been to the concerts three times.  I also have bootlegs from The Radio KAOS and Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking tours.  While the musicians that Roger Waters surrounds himself with are good (he even had Eric Clapton for Hitchhiking), David Gilmour demonstrates that only he is David Gilmour.  I would be nice to see the four of them reunited and doing a concert like this.
B000068PNQ|5.0|Nothing else is really close. I bought this when I was 15 not really aware of what I was getting into and now all these years later I still can't live without it. I'm not going to pretend to review it, every second the Velvets with Cale recorded is utterly essential. If I could only keep one record it would be this. <BR>This particular edition is the best out there, if you don't have it you really should, the mono mix is really fantastic, closer to white light/white heat I suppose.<BR>The Chelsea girl tracks are good, but don't belong here. Much better would have been legit remasters of &quot;Melody Laughter&quot; and &quot;The Nothing Song&quot; in their entirety, plus some of the EPI performances. They have been bootlegs for way too long, like the first three Kraftwerk records, it's just insane that such beautiful music has never been officially released on C.D. in complete form. <BR>Still, the music is without equal, the box looks great, the entire presentation is flawless, a bargain at it's price.
B000000IIB|5.0|Okay, so a few months after EVERYTHING IS WRONG was released (a truly superb album), I was walking past a music store when I saw a poster on the window advertising this album. I had already fallen in love with the original so I just had to buy it. I have never regretted it since, as it has become one of my all-time favourites.<br />Basically, Moby has compiled a bunch of tracks that are remixes of tracks from the original release. Some are remixes from the singles, some are exclusive to this release (most are remixed by Moby but you do get some other artists remixing - Westbam and Josh Wink to name but two). He then got two turntables and mixed the songs onto two CD's (he really did do it that way, on a couple of tracks - if you listen really closely - you can hear the vinyl popping!) and the result is this amazing \\"mixed and remixed\\" album. <br />The 1st CD is the best. Starts off with a very ambient remix of FIRST COOL HIVE, and then neatly slips into FEELING SO REAL (UNASHAMED ECSTATIC PIANO MIX) and from there it's non-stop until the two beautifully mastered remixes of ANTHEM and EVERYTHING IS WRONG. The mixing is amazing, Moby truly is a master at the decks, and this is good proof of that.<br />The 2nd CD doesn't really get going for me until the MENACING MIX of HYMN, and from there it's great. Still, even with the tracks before, it's a damn good CD. Mixed just as well as CD1.<br />The remixes themselves are mainly superb. Most were available on the singles, such as the FEELING SO REAL mixes and MOVE mixes, but you do get some rare stuff, such as HYMN (MENACING MIX) which was only available on the HYMN - REMIXES CD single in Germany (now long deleted and almost impossible to find) and ALL THAT I NEED IS TO BE LOVED (MELODIC MIX) which was only available on the German 12\\" release of HYMN and Survival 2000 - A Benefit for Survival International which was a various artist double CD album (both out of print of course). And then there are remixes which are only available on this album, such as<BR>ANTHEM (CINEMATIC VERSION) and WHEN IT'S COLD I'D LIKE TO DIE (INSTRUMENTAL VERSION). Brilliant tracks, all of them.<br />All in all, this is (I believe) Moby's best release - alongside the original version of EVERYTHING IS WRONG. Don't get me wrong, PLAY was very good, but for me, EVERYTHING IS WRONG and EVERYTHING IS WRONG: MIXED AND REMIXED came out at a very important time in my life, and because they are such good albums, they will remain with me forever. A masterpiece.
B0000067X1|5.0|As much as I love this record, it's not as good as Ege Bamyasi or Future Days, though much more experimental, which is a good thing, but at times Karoli just gets too bluesy for my liking. Still this is an all time classic, neccessary to anyone who truly loves music, and there are even moments where they move into Cecil Taylor territory, plus the classic Aumn, and Paperhouse which leads beautifully into one of the Can &quot;standards&quot;  the mighty &quot;Mushroom&quot;. Actually, forget what I said, this record is as awesome as anything else they did, &quot;oh yeah&quot; is as good as &quot;mary&quot; or &quot;sing swan song&quot;. No excuse for not owning this one.
B00000IMCV|5.0|Taking off where night of the living dead ended, this cult classic is a masterpiece in horror. Although there are a few large plot flaws, this movie has everything you could ever want : Action, Likeable characters, Gore...The Ultimate Movie. Tom Savini's effects also give it a great makeup and gore. I give this, my favourite movie, a full 5 out of 5 stars. See it, you won't be dissapointed.
B000056IKS|5.0|I cannot even begin to describe this album. It's one of those classics like the first Velvets record or the first Kraftwerk album that I test other people by, if you don't like this or those records then I know right a way that you aren't the kind of quality person I like to spend my time with. There are some who just don't get this, but it's their loss really. Influenced virtually everyone who made quality rock music from here on out, from Eno to Bowie, to the Buzzcocks to PIL to Joy Division to Stereolab (who made a career from biting the \\"neu sound\\")to The Orb and so on and so on. Classic and incredible. I had to pay ... amounts of money at one time for the bootleg of this C.D., now that Astralwerks have put it out for the world this should be played everywhere, in Taxis, grocery stores, airports, public lavatorys. Because it will never get old. They don't make them much better then this.

6304466498|5.0|This video is without a doubt the most phenominal movie ever. This movie has a lot of cussing in it. Allow me to phrase a scene. <BR>He's a &quot;BEEP&quot; sir. <BR>I know that what's his name. <BR>That is his name sir &quot;BEEP&quot; Major &quot;BEEP&quot;. <BR>How many &quot;BEEPS&quot; do we got on this ship. <BR>Yo! <BR>I knew it I'm surrounded by &quot;BEEP&quot;s. Keep firing &quot;BEEPS&quot;s.<BR>This movie has outstanding comedy and will tower over any movie. After all it's got Mel Brooks, Bill Pullman, and John Candy. What more fun do you want. Remember may the Shwarts be with you.
B00006CJOY|2.0|While he does have some great songs, listening to 29 different 2 minute badly mixed bad sounding live tracks just isn't worth it.  I'm sure it was a good show, but did not translate into a good live album, with the sound not up to par at all.
B000008LOU|5.0|The first Wilbury album is definately something magical that will always seem fresh and fun.  The second one (Volume 3) has just as much musical merit.  The blend of these four guys were what made the core of the song writing and instumentation of the first.  Roy Orbison's tenor, style, and attitude did bring raw fun and glory to SOME songs on the first one, but he was only on four or five songs (unfortunately).  This CD is more of a blues/folkrock direction for the supergroup, and that's cool.  It's very them.  It suits their style.  My favorite track (probably because it vocally mimics the first album the closest - but actually may be my favorite Wilbury cut between the two albums) is &quot;Poor House.&quot;  There is much more humor on this one, which makes it quite entertaining to introduce others to.  Tom Petty's influence is more prevalent in this one; he shows some of his top-noch song writing tricks.  Petty reveals his natural ability, and you can hear with what ease music comes to him.  My only regret about this album is there aren't as many George songs........I'll deal.  No one should go through life without hearing this album at least once.  Like the first one - it's nearly impossible to hold a bad mood while hearing this stuff.  (oh and try to act out all of the &quot;Wilbury Twist&quot; - I think I still have bruises)
0316666343|5.0|having lost a son in 2001, I first thought this would not be a book I could read, however, I picked it up at my nieces and was<BR>immediatly drawn in. It's a refreshing view of what heaven could be like and how our loved ones may be communicating with us. I like thinking about my son in this manner rather than some of the other senarios we have been taught in our lifetimes. I love Alice's writing there were many beautiful passages that I will go back to for comfort. If you are open-minded about death and have had time to digest the death of a loved one, you should read this!
0066214122|4.0|This book is going to make a great movie, just like Jurassic Park.   Remember how Jurasic Park's theme was that nature cannot be harnessed?   I cannot give this book a 5 star rating (save those for &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; or &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; (Ken Follet).   However, Prey is a good read.  I could not put it down until I read the whole thing - it made me late for work.
0553381687|5.0|A Game Of Thrones is a masterpiece. Martin weaves politics, intrigue, betrayal, legend, magic and mysticism in the most adult fantasy of the numerous \\"doorstoppers\\" that have been written in the last decade (Wheel of Time, Sword of Truth, Shannara legacy, The Pearl).<br />Martin's techniques and themes stand out. Most notable is the shifting perspectives -- each chapter is told through the view of one main viewpoint character and shows how he or she perceives the events s/he is involved in; and Martin uses interesting viewpoint characters including children and anti-heroes.  Also notable is that this is a more realistic -- A Game of Thrones (and this is more true for its sequels) can be decidedly raw in descriptions of intimate situations, coarse in its language, and bloody in its battle scenes, and all of it is gripping drama. Martin also is realistic in how he treats his characters, their motivations, their emotions (especially their petty jealousies) and their rationales. Martin is unflinchingly unsentimental, so getting attached to too many characters is ill-advised.  Moreover, the settings, social interactions, and the different societies are all rendered with tremendous detail.<br />The rewards in this series are numerous -- intricate plotting, exquisite narration, realistic characters, and descriptions that make his world palpable. The main drawback is time: Martin writes relatively slowly and a two-year wait between volumes is now routine (volume 3 was released in the UK in September 2000 and in the US in November 2000; volume 4 will be released in April 2003), therefore the series will not be finished until at least 2007 if the 6-book framework remains in place (originally he wanted this to be a trilogy). Therefore, know what you're getting into and know that once you dive in, you'll enjoy.
B00006CXXU|5.0|She is the most talented people around.....she write her own songs, explores different sounds.....none of her songs sound the same, her most powerful song i think it I'M OK, how she sings her life story through her vocals and just a guitar u can;t get any better than that.......Fighter also is a very inspriring song to alot of woman who became stronger from being put down....great cd......she has her on catergory of music style.....
B000070WJE|4.0|After the ego-trip that was his swing album, this throws me back to his earlier pop-rock efforts. And guess what? It sounds effortless but deep. Anti-musical establishment and mocking himself. Still delivering the melodic goods in songs like 'Feel' or 'Monsoon'(but the lyrics in that one have a twist). 'Me and My Monkey' is pure Hollywood bashing and all the better for it.<br />So does he have a *thing* for America? Who cares? He already rules everywhere else, doesn't he? Only hope there's no serious riff with his long-time songwriting partner Guy Chambers - it wouldn't suit his style. Then again this is the man who can reinvent himself time and again! I'm pleased and expectant
0312305060|1.0|I had to re-read entire sections of this book in order to figure out what was going on---I'm still not sure. After speaking to several fellow readers, I know I'm not alone. And I'm flabbergasted by all the praise. Is this writer so brilliant that we mere mortals are unable to decipher his meaning? Or is this just a very bad book that somehow caught the interest of the literary elite, (intellectual snobs)---it won the Pulitzer. Guess it's over my head.<br />T
0553573403|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me when I bemoaned the shortage of good fantasy books. Outside of TLOTR, the first few Jordan books and Tad William's trilogy, there aren't that many fantasy novels for adults out there.<br />This book hit the spot. GoF hooked me right at the start and I read it religiously until I finished. The characters were original and had depth and there is a large cast in a fairly original world. Although there are hints of magic, ie dark mysterious forces brewing, there is very little of it in this first book. The story is largely about everyday human principles and behaviors and the struggle for power in a medieval society.<br />The story line has a lot of depth and was quite engrossing and believable. The only criticism I have takes place late in the book. The author presents a character, Tyrion, as a very likeable fellow who is somehow different (and hence likeable) from those around him. However at one point, Tyrion leads men into battle to kill the \\"heroes\\" in the book. I found his actions hard to sympathize with and they seemed to conflict with his character development up to that point. But this is a small quibble with a fine novel.<br />All in all this book was a fantastic start but when I found out the story is not a trilogy, I finished it with some trepidations. This novel is not as tight as Tad Williams' trilogy and with 2 or 3 books as yet unwritten, I greatly fear that George Martin will follow in Robert Jordan's footsteps and ruin a good thing by turning it into a never-ending cash-cow, I mean, story. The ending is just as important as the beginning for all good stories. Time will tell how this one turns out....
B000002H33|5.0|When we last left our heroes, they came off the mimimal commercial but artistic genius of the second album, Ride the Lighting. The question in most serious heavy metal fans was could they top it? The answer was and still is HELL YEAH!<br />When I listened to this 10 years ago, I had my reservations. First off, I am a black man and a die hard student of the hip hop nation. My first ever rock and roll album was the infamous \\"Black Album\\", and even though I liked it a lot,I still wasn't sold on metal. A college friend of mine (a white guy), suggested that I go pick up another album by these Metallica guys,named Master Of Puppets. I did, and have not regretted it since. When I heard the opening to \\"Battery\\", I was confused and angry; but 40 seconds later, not only did my perception of heavy metal change, but my perception of what was possible musically changed. They freaked me out and brought me into their world, full of rants and raves about war, religion, politics, and the human experience with inhuman speed and aggression. James Hetfield leads his tribe along with giutar solo king Kirk Hammett(my favorite guitarist of all time), Lars Ulrich(he's a ..., but a great drummer) and Cliff\\"The Man\\" Burton(the greatest bassist of all time; you think of a better one!). I reslly don't have a favorite song beacuse they are all excellent, but if I had to choose one, it would be the wordless but emotion full Orion. That's Master Of Puppets and my major experience with metal. I now split time with hip hop and metal and own every Metallica album(even Load and Reload;forgive me). Buy this album before the world ends. Thank you.
B000000H57|5.0|This album is an amazing piece of artwork.  It will go down in my opinion as one of the best deep, dark albums, next to Tool's Aenema.  The third track \\"Love You to Death\\" sets the tone for the entire set.  \\"Die With Me\\" is one of my personal favorites along with my personal choice of #1, \\"In Praise of Bacchus.\\"  In order to enjoy this album then you must like classical masterpieces.  Great album if you are in one of those melancholy moods and you need some good music to escape with, even if for just a moment.  A must buy, and listen to the whole album all the way through, understand that you need patience to get at the heart of every song.  The way good music should be.
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie I feel will go down in history as a classic.It is hard to describe in words how this movie makes you look at the war and what Col. Moore went through.I think the best point in this movie is the accuracy to historic events as well as the directors ability to keep the movie rolling and active(which is really hard for a true events story).<BR>  However,the great purpose I feel this movie served is that it looks at both sides of a battle.It does not show Americans walking through the Ia drang valley like superheroes and plowing down the enemy.In fact it shows men struggling for eachother,and that true victory in a war comes by surviving,not by who wins the war.I think it is important that it shows the Vietnamise as every bit of people as we are.The Vietnamise who died during this war were not all evil.They were not horrific people who were trying to destroy anything.Most of them were guys just like our American troops,who were there because of orders,and really just wanted to go home.What is the value of this movie?short and simple.That war knows no friend,and anything living is the enemy.and the guys we fought werent evil or ignorant.They were just people answering the call of their country and dying out of service.I think that can be attributed in any war.<BR>A not that another viewer left.He stated that people were in the vietnam war by choice so they werent really fighting for anything.I disagree.I remember this thing called a draft which stripped your choices.You went to war or jail.I wish you  would look at history before I landblast what our troops did mr.Chiddles.

0812550757|5.0|I have read and enjoyed the entire &quot;Ender's Game&quot; Series, and a few other books authored by Orson Scott Card, and I've come to realize the jewel that is &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;.  The very idea of an individual who could objectively review the facts of a person's life and present his or her own opinion to the family of the deceased is a noble thought.  That individual would see us not for who we are, but for what we have done.  Information about us would come from people who were impacted by our presence.  Our actions would speak for us, long after we have passed from this existance.  <br />By all rights, &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, should be a hard read, a book to take with a grain of salt, but Card has masterfully lured us into Ender's world.  We see a wonder-child who is no longer child-like, but a great and wise man, someone who has learned from his mistakes, recognized the flaws in his personality and is working to fix them.  <br />I personally choose not to view &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; as a science-fiction, but rather an anthropological look at human nature.  <br />Without giving too much away, I recommend this book whole-heartedly.  It has been four or more years since I first read it and I am still pondering the implications.  <br />Enjoy!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|wow wow wow wow! i love this CD, this CD is exellent people buy this CD now!!
0316666343|5.0|I felt compelled to offer a simple review of this book after having read some less favorable customer reviews.  I have recommended this book to both my family & friends, something that I am not in the habit of doing.  I have never submitted a review for a book I've read before, but I do so now to encourage others to be touched by a emotionally charged story about family perserverance, lasting friendship, and perhaps most of all, eternal life.  This is a must read!!!
B00005JL78|4.0|You'll enjoy this stylish blend of sci-fi and film noir if you're willing to suspend your disbelief at the door. Many have decried the illogical holes in Scott Frank and Jon Cohen's otherwise excellent screenplay, but in the end these deficiencies hardly matter. Movies dealing with predestination never answer the big questions effectively - they just use them as the springboard for a story. And \\"Minority Report\\" tells a pretty good one, even if it does reveal where it's going too soon and is occasionally marred by Spielberg's trademark mawkishness. Tom Cruise is hugely enjoyable as the frantic John Anderton, and Colin Farrell does a fine job of making you hate Detective Witwer. It looks great, sounds great, holds your attention for all 147 minutes, and will even have you giggling at the spectacular product placements and some unexpected comedy. It's a respectful (if not faithful) adaptation of Philip K. Dick's story, too, so fans of the original should be pleased - although Act 3 does see the writers wandering into Hollywood-ending territory and has Spielberg wrapping things up on a typically optimistic false note. Still, it's refreshing to see a bunch of filmmakers tackling a sci-fi adaptation seriously and successfully while still keeping an eye on the box-office. If you're going to spend close to $100 million on a sci-fi project - and, let's face it, these days you have to - then you also have to consider the return. The result is a memorable film that strikes a savvy balance between deep thought and commercial appeal. \\"A.I\\" flopped because it glorified the former and \\"The Time Machine\\" failed by pandering to the latter. \\"Minority Report\\" wisely walks the middle-path. It won't have enough explosions to thrill die-hard action fans, nor quite enough depth to really please sci-fi devotees. But for the rest of us, it works.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|I thought this cd was great,but it wasn't exactly what I thought it would be.I really don't have a favorite 'cause I like most of them. I think Em' is good rapper,I like the flow mostly. I will never get sick of his music. Go buy the cd if you like the flow of Em's  music!!!!!!
B00006LSM3|4.0|The trademark searing slide guitar and distinctive vocals that fall somewhere between Roger Waters and Bob Dylan make this a great ending to Mr. Harrison's career.  The lyrics are clever and smart:<br />If you don't know where you're goin'<br />Any road will take you there...<br />(This doesn't work with my wife when we travel however)<br />This is an enjoyable album.  The opening track and the song, Pisces Fish, are my favorites.  I have the biggest trouble with the Brainwashed title and song.  While everyone depicts George as the most complex and ambiguous Beatle, his body of work doesn't hold up much in between this album and All Things Must Pass.  And the song, Brainwashed, while it seems to be his Do Not Go Gentle...very last song, it struggles to match the sonic and lyrical beauty of the other songs on the album.  It comes across as a rather trite attempt to attack the materialism, commercialism, and other -isms associated with Western culture, I suppose (Saying that we are all brainwashed by our President is, well, stretching it, for a most of us, I believe, as Bush seems to live by the Any Road philosophy in the first song.) The song Brainwashed just seems to ring a little hollow to me in the wake of his leaving this world without taking 150 million dollars with him.  That could pay for a lot of de-programming, if you ask me.<br />And to title the album, Brainwashed?  Was this George's idea?  I would have preferred, having only an oblique knowledge of this ex-beatle, part-time gardener, part-time musician, to title the album ANY ROAD.
B00005JKCH|2.0|Despite the hype and financial sucess, Spiderman was in fact one of the biggest disappointment among the Summer Blockbusters. Indeed, the action sequences and the special effects rank at the top (for people who complained that the CGI looks cartoon-ish, please refer to the \\"article\\" the film was based on.) At time it even seem far too graphic for younger viewers, though audiences would not expect anything less from the director of \\"Evil Dead\\". <br />For just any pop-corn movie, I would've shrouded mu shoulders and say, \\"It was a good ride while it lasted\\". But this is a film which was suppose to define the vision of the original superhero. With it's history, a more engrossing or engaging characters development should shine as bright as the actions. the problem is, they don't. When Spiderman is walking around without his mask on or nor revealing his super power, the film comes to a stall. We see wooden boxes stacked together being blown around by wind instead of actors. Maguire is dull, and Dunst is just awkward. Their love scene together not only generate no chemistry or heat, the lines are equally laughable, if not put most of the audience to sleep. The infamous spider-kiss (where Spiderman was hanging upside-down tounging Mary-Jane) is anything but sexy, instead, it looked dirty, even disturbing. In fact, the only person in the film who actually deliver an adequate performance is Willem Dafoe's menancing overacting.<br />Production-wise, it surely deserve more stars. But as a movie of whole, with a story that is already fully-developed, this Spider-Man fails on so many levels.
0783240503|5.0|A really fun, interesting show! We saw the Broadway version, and this is pretty close.  Although based on the bible story, the show is not preachy... kids and adults alike will love it! You'll be humming the songs long after the show is over. Fantastic acting, great plot, interesting sets. Absolutely a great show!
B00007BH5C|5.0|First of all, people who say this sounds a little too much like Fellowship are absolutely right. However, that's the point Howard Shore and Peter Jackson wanted to make. The Two Towers isn't a separate movie, rather the second part of one huge film. Therefore, wouldn't it be smart to have the score sound a bit like the first one? I believe that Peter Jackson and Howard Shore are making these films with the intention that one day they will be viewed as one huge 9-hour epic. And that's an unbelievable brilliant way to approach the music. <br />The score honestly stands on its own in terms of brilliance. The music reflects the tone of the film, which, I imagine(since I haven't yet seen the movie) is much darker than the first. However, since these three films are actually one big movie, The Two Towers does have the same heart Fellowship did. The score is truly magnificent. I haven't listened to a single other soundtrack since I bought it and it is doubtful that I will for a long time to come.
B000021XR5|1.0|Will somebody please tell Scott Weiland that he is not Eddie Vedder? Nor will he ever be. Thank you.<br />Now, with that said, I must say that the music on the Clone Temple Pilot's \\"No. 4\\" record is as generic as the record's title - perhaps even more so. \\"Down\\" sounds like a re-treaded version of their first tired album from 1992, back when the Clone Temple Pilots were truly trying to jock Pearl Jam. <br />By the way, have you guys heard Pearl Jam's new record? It's totally cool, totally Seattle-soundin'!!!<br />Stay away from this record, it will only bore you. On the last track, Weiland tries to be Jim Morrisson (I know, I can't stop laughing about it either), and the results are disastrous. He sounds like a tired cocktail lounge singer in Vegas who's had one too many cocktails...<br />HOPE THIS HELPS...

B00005JL78|5.0|It was pretty hard to believe that Tom Cruise plays a robot in Minority Report.  He acts so human and normal, (unlike the masterful performance from Haley Joel Osmand in A.I.)  Then again, Tom Cruise is one of the greatest actors alive,so, perhaps it's hard for him to act with little emotion...<BR>  Unlike Jurrasic Park, there are no dinasours, which may confuse people who read the title. <BR>  However, like Schindler's List,Speilberg makes a great entertainment picture about events and things that only a genius can think of!  <BR>   Speilberg, good for you...although Cruise doesn't look like a mecca, you sure do make another great holocust film.
B00007E8O5|5.0|An absolutely brilliant 2 hour and 20 minute Degradation Trip. Cantrell throws it all down here, creating a true work of art with brilliant harmonies and vocals, within a concept album that we haven't seen in the same form ever before. The guitars are heavy and biting, and then light and mystical. His lyrics are honest and artistic with a lucid vision of his Degradation Trip.<br />Cantrell's vocals have never been more piercing and beautiful. His trademark use of humming and chanting over his harmonies and as melody is ever present in its purest form. He adds a spiritual dimension to his music that no one will ever touch.<br />Starting with the superb verses of a Psychotic Break, to the honest, friendly party of Pig Charmer, Cantrell depicts a vision that is not dark and desolate, but simply the true reality of experience.<br />Honest, inspirational and creative, this album will be remembered most not as a Degradation Trip, but as Jerry Cantrell's Progressive Trip through true artistry.

6305508550|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie in the world.  Trust me, watch this movie and your dvd player will be seeing your Oh face.
B00006HBUA|4.0|My 3 and 5 year old boys love this movie. I liked it. Since this is a children's movie, I asked my 5 year old to tell me what he liked. He said it was funny, scary and gross (because of the fart scene between Shaggy and Scooby) in a funny kind of way. Will they watch it again? They still ask to watch it about twice a week...so what do you think? I think your young ones will enjoy this movie.
B000001FTQ|4.0|U2's &quot;Wide Awake In America&quot; is an oft-overlooked gem. The feel of this short album is a dreamy, early morning - as the title hints, an awakening. The first two songs are live cuts from concerts, but they are as clean as any regular album track, with very little of the stadium noise. The sound is so clear that you often forget that you're listening to a live track. The second two songs are studio tracks that compliment the first two.<br />two songs are my favorite:<br />&quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;: Very mellow and dreamy to start out, Bono picks up the energy of the crowd a few lines into the song, and the drums kick in, and the song kicks into full swing. A fun jaunt through very visual lyrics. The refrain is simple, but Bono's crooning of it  &quot;I'll be there tonight.&quot;<br />&quot;Love Comes Tumbling&quot; is another studio track, and my favorite of this whole album. I always think of a subdued evening (or feel that it should be played then). The song has a quiet somber feel to it. Subtle but powerful, Edge's licks lead you through the song, and Bono softly murmurs and picks at the melancholy parts of your heart.<br />Overall, a nice little thing to listen to for a short car ride. :D
B000006OAM|4.0|Many years ago, in a classic CBC interview, I heard Margaret Lawrence ascribe her greatest inspirations to loneliness. At the time, I wasn't old enough to understand what she meant, but the intervening years have put on weight, thankfully of the emotional sort as much as the physical.<br />This album shares a kinship with Margaret Lawrence's muse. It comes from the sad, lonely places of the soul. It's not about happiness or sunshine, but about burdens. It seeks to share those burdens with us, and by sharing them, comfort us with the thought that such burdens may be bearable.<br />Natalie keeps it simple, even stark, for a reason. She is speaking to remoteness and isolation. Such themes are not served by fancy instrumentation and overproduction. The best parts of this album are Natalie on her own, accompanied by little more than a piano or an understated guitar.<br />All of our pasts are composites of both our best memories and our worst. It's our best that gives us hope. But it's our worst that gives us depth. This album is an exploration of character. It seeks for depth. In so doing, it must plumb the darker recesses of the heart, places that are sad, painful and desolate, but worthwhile places all the same, because without them we are incomplete.<br />If you are the kind of person who simply can't find beauty in sadness, then don't buy this album. You won't get anything out of it and it will just depress you. But if you understand that there can be redemption in tragedy and grace in the midst of sorrow, then Ms Merchant has put together a marvellous work of art that speaks compassionately to the human condition.
B00005K9QP|5.0|I can't say anything that will add any new dimension to what others have already explained about this album.  Yes it was a revolution, yes it may very well be Clapton's most perfect album.  Yes, guitar players everywhere know every lick and chord on this album by heart and learned to play by learning this album.  All I can say is that I love this album and think Clapton shows us all why he is multi-nominated Rock and Roll Hall of Famer.  If you don't have this album, very simply YOU SHOULD.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is flawless.  It's a musical, lyrical, and vocal masterpiece.  I always liked CA, but never considered myself as a big fan; however, this CD has changed it all.  I am 32 years old & absolutely mesmerized at the outstanding performance penetrating from this record.  CA is above the rest, as she was entirely involved in writing, composing, & producing this album (unlike others).  It's an extremely personal, inspirational, & emotional songbook.  If you're not a CA fan I guarantee when you hear this album you will be. Obviously an overwhelming number of people who have purchased this CD love it.  Take a look at the all the fan reviews in RollingStone, Amazon, yahoo, etc......I am so disappointed that this album hasn't sold more.  PEOPLE GO BUY IT!!  IT'S SOOOOOOOOOOOO SPECTACULAR.  I am a huge music fan & like all types, but I must say that I have never been so impressed with an album after the first listen as I have with Stripped.  DIRRTY is not a representation of the album.  Dirty is a great dance/club song & I cannot believe that it didn't soar to the top of the charts.  Okay, yah she shows a little skin & sexual energy in the video, but so don't many other female artists.   I don't understand how it can work for some & not others.  Furthermore, look at videos from male artists especially in hip-hop you see boobs, butt, & sexual content plastered all over the TV screen & nothing negative is ever said, in fact, they are praised for it. Personally, I see nothing wrong with the DIRRTY video & almost have to laugh at all the controversy over it.  I admit that CA doesn't need to use her beauty or her sexuality to sell records.  Her talent & voice in itself can accomplish this.  Anyway, this is an incredible achievement for Christina.  She did an absolutely wonderful job with this album & I cannot wait until her next one.
B00004THAY|4.0|I have been a huge Eric Clapton and B.B. King fan for years.  When this album came out, I listened to it right away. The feeling created by this album is more of a laid back blues style rather than up tempo blues. Also, the majority of the songs are B.B. King songs, so if you are a fan of Eric Clapton and not B.B. King, then I really don't recommend that you purchase this album.
B00006950W|4.0|Being a movie based on a videogame I had low expectations but right from the start it grabbed me and kept me glued to the screen. The movie hold a high level of tension and terror right from the opening scenes. It does get somewhat choppy at times but overall I really enjoyed this movie. The vhs video quality is excellent and the audio is top notch with a clear, dynamic and very deep low and upper ends. Overall: VERY GOOD.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|I  truly love this movie.  Michael Mann did a superb job of capturing the essence of the leather stocking tales.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has read the James Fennimore Cooper novels or anyone who has interest in movies which contain beautiful cinematography shots.

B00007BH5C|5.0|Following his Oscar winning score for the first installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Fellowship of the Ring, Howard Shore returns with the even more epic and as equally satisfying score for the sequel, The Two Towers. Shore kind of came out of nowhere and made a very remarkable effort that injected that much more life into an incredible film. As the film goes, The Two Towers is grander, darker, and more challenging and the score lives up to that and more.<br />The central themes from the previous effort re-appear, but a lot less prominent and are utilized in new ways. Each race is once again presented in their own unique themes as last time, Dwarzes with the opening \\"Foundations of Stone\\", elves with \\"The Leave Taking\\", hobbits with \\"Samwise the Brave\\", and the Fellowship's theme is present once again in \\"Forth Eorlingas\\". Of course the menacing themes of the orcs and evil are spectacularly present once again in \\"The Uruk-hai\\" and \\"Isengard Unleashed\\", the later living up to chaotic nature the title hints at.<br />The main difference between the previous installment and this one is the very present darker tone. Even the recognizable held-over themes generally end up evolving into a darker, unstable clone of themselves. This is of course due to the hopeless situation the broken up Fellowship find them in. The hobbits are still themselves, but there is a swirling uncertainty around them in the creature Gollum, which Shore hits on the mark with \\"Taming of Smeagol,\\" which starts with the pastoral hobbit theme, but quickly turns into a swirling, forlorn tune. The elven themes are even more saddening as their existence is all but ending in Middle Earth.<br />The main new theme present is that of Rohan. First introduced in the aptly titled \\"The Riders of Rohan,\\" it's Nordic in nature, reflecting the people it represents, and is noticable because of it's unique use of fiddles and dense brass sections layered on top of string sections that support it. The theme pops up pretty much anytime the Rohan are present in the film, but makes itself fresh by changing it's mood depending on the situation; proud and sweeping on \\"Riders\\", forlorn and pitiful on \\"The King of the Golden Hall\\", aggressive and battle ready on \\"Helm's Deep\\", and charging on \\"Forth Eorlingas.\\"<br />Without having yet seen the film, but knowing the novels almost off the top of my head I can already tell this score works wonders within the film as I can already visualize the action based off the epic, moving music. I think what the best movie scores do is to remind you of the great scenes they become a part of and this, like the Fellowship of the Ring score, appears to be well on it's way to doing that. On the other hand it's also strong enough to be a stand alone piece and doesn't solely rely on visuals to give it life. Howard Shore appears to be on his way to another possible Oscar win, and he'll deserve all the credit he gets. There's a fine line between making the films cohesive and just re-hasing the previous work and he's made the conversion expertly. The new themes feel comfortable with the old, which is something truly special when it works as John Williams did in the original Star Wars trilogy. I can't see why any fans of the films or especially film scores or the previous Shore \\"Rings\\" effort would not fall head over heals for this release.s up pretty much anytime the Rohan are present in the film, but makes itself fresh by changing it's mood depending on the situation; proud and sweeping on \\"Riders\\", forlorn and pitiful on \\"The King of the Golden Hall\\", aggressive and battle ready on \\"Helm's Deep\\", and charging on \\"Forth Eorlingas.\\"<br />Without having yet seen the film, but knowing the novels almost off the top of my head I can already tell this score works wonders within the film as I can already visualize the action based off the epic, moving music.

B00006RU5B|1.0|I just bought the Audioslave album and i think it a very good album.  I don't know why people are comparing audioslave to nickleback or creed, they are totally different.  No way was this made for commercial success.  It is definitely one of the better albums of the year.  Im a big fan of both rage and soundgarden and when i heard of this combo i was all over it and was not disappointed.  yes there are several dry tracks on the album that are dry but overall it is very very good.  A must have for any rage or soundgarden fan...
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is one of the greatest films ever made and everything everyone says on here about it is true.<br />When I first saw it years ago, I thought it was the coldest-blooded black & white film I'd ever seen: the pathetic delusions of a faded actress, the overwhelming self-loathing of her failed writer/gigolo, the use of has-been actors playing has-been actors.  I thought, \\"Man, how'd they get away with this?\\"<br />(I'd read that Billy Wilder told the studio he was making a delightful musicial comedy to be called HILL OF BEANS and they studio execs were surprised to see SUNSET BOULEVARD on the marquee as they arrived for the premiere).<br />The Special Collector's Edition has some wonderful extras, but don't expect too much from the \\"original opening\\" sequence: the script is included but the soundless scenes are mostly second-unit stuff (nothing more of William Holden but his foot getting a toe tag--but I'm quibbling).<br />This is an awesome film that will stand the test of time.
B00005QIPH|5.0|So don't blame the Strokes if they are darlings of the media.  I accidently ran across their music on the net and didn't know about ANY of the hype.  It was a purely unadulterated experience.  I didn't know their status in the media until AFTER I started telling my friends about them.  I couldn't believe how many good songs there are on this one short album.  I love it because it is real and is very catchy.  One of the best bands in the last ten years unquestionably.  Stop listening to mass media and start listening to music.
B00006690G|5.0|I don't care what you guys say about him. He's offensive, he's a whiner, but the fact of hte matter is that he's good. He's very good. He can rap with the best of them. his songs are clever and smart. Just because you don't beleive in what he's saying, doesn't mean you should bash him. He's honest, and he's true to himself and thats all that matters. This right here is one of his best CDs. The first two were practice runs. This one right here is the way its supposed to be.<br />White America blares out speaking truth of our beautiful country. Business is a great song too. Em displays a talent in rapping one verse without cursing. Cleaning out My Closet is an instant classic. One that is not as bad as some say.<br />Without Me is a radio friendly hit. Everyone loves it.<br />Sing for the Moment is one of the standouts here as well. I'm sure this will be his next big hit. Aerosmith (whiel not my favorite band) adds some depth to the song. very enjoyable.<br />Hallies Song - the best track on the album. Its such a true song that displays how well of a father he is despite what some may think.<br />Till I collapse - another great closing song (I don't count \\"My Daddy's Gone Crazy\\" as a song worthy of closing. its more of a joke) This song really sounds good.<br />Enjoy this record. Its very good.<br />Highly recommended. especially if you're open minded.
0060920084|4.0|If you're looking for a book that summarizes life in rural America as a gift for your elderly Aunt Mildred, then this probably isn't the book you want. If you're looking for a social commentary of the Pre-Clinton era America, then this probably isn't the book you want. If you're looking for a travel guide with detailed descriptions on where you can get a great meal or a soft bed at attractive rates, then this probably isn't the book you want. If you're looking for a book that will make you laugh out loud, then look no further. I've been through many of the towns BB mentions in The Lost Continent, so it was even more fun reading these relentlessly funny attacks on the yokels across America - I live in a town with 1,400 people and at least 500 pickup trucks, so I believe I can speak with some authority on the yokelness of this great country! And I also have a father that took the family on these awful summer vacations that are funny thinking about now but were nothing short of torture at the time.<BR>Yes, Bryson is a lazy slob that cuts corners (don't forget how he skipped at least 900 miles of the Appalachian Trail a few years back) but he just has a knack for making me laugh. My wife hates him because I'm constantly reading passages aloud to her - interrupting her reading of the latest in the \\"How to Murder Your Husband in Cunning Yet Painful Circumstances\\" mystery series.<BR>I only gave \\"The Lost Continent\\" 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed some of his other books even more, plus I have this longstanding problem with giving perfect scores - probably due to poor potty training or something like that. Anyways, Bryson is one of my favorite authors (along with Mark Twain & P.G. Wodehouse), so maybe my review is biased, but this is a very funny book - unless you were a big fan of President Ronald Reagan. In that case, you probably haven't laughed since they granted statehood to New Mexico, so this may not be the book you want either.

1878424114|5.0|I picked up this book kind of by accident as I was shopping in a natural food store.  I have never read anything by Chopra before and have heard much about him, both positive and negative.  I read this book in an afternoon (recently) and have re-read bits of it each day since.  I carry it with me in my purse to read when I have a moment during the day.  The principles are universal and can be applied to every area of life.  My life was different the very first day I tried applying these principles.  They are simple; not easy, but simple.  If you wish to gain peace in your life and be more comfortable with yourself, others, and the universe, read this little book and learn to apply its suggestions in your everyday living.  This book is on my all-time great list -- I'm going to make sure I'm never without a copy.  May it be a blessing to others the way it is to me.
B00003CXCD|5.0|One of the all time great movies of all time. I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for the longest time and it's worth the wait. The studio actually spent the time to restore the footage from the original B&amp;W print.
B00005JL2O|4.0|I have seen the last 2 movies and this one.I think this is the second best one out of the 3. The 2nd to me was the best because it was a comedy/action film.The 1st one was not funny at all but had more action than any of them. This one is a pure comedy because there basically is no plot. It seems like everything Myers says is funny almost.Beyonce Knowles is great and better than Liz Hurley and Heather Graham. It is so rare a singer is also a good actor so early in their carrer. The only problem I have with the film is that GOLDMEMBER is the worst charcter. There are only like 3 things that are funny he says. Dr.Evil like always is the funniest charcter especially during the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS parody and HARD KNOCK LIFE song. Mini Me is the star and never even talks. I like the part when he has a kitchen clock around his neck during THE HARD KNOCK LIFE parody. Scott Evil plays a much bigger role and is a little funny and will take on a bigger task in the 4th film. The film has Myers' fingerprints all over it(Toronto best city in the world,Maple leafs win stanley cup,Male leafs jerseys in the Jay-Z parody etc.) and it is not such a bad thing. The opening sequence is one of the best in all the movies I have seen .It is a complete shock the first time you watch it.Danny Devito as Mini me is just hilarious. Overall I thought GOLDMEMBER was a great film but could have been much better.
B00006G8LB|5.0|MUSTSEEMUSTSEEMUSTSEE!   You must see this movie!  It is one of the best action movies i've ever seen.  Spider-Man for about 7 years now has been my favorite superhero.

0066214122|4.0|This most recent novel by Michael Crichton is another deep expression of concern about the misuse of science and technology by future-blind, irresponsible scientists and corporations bent only on the 'bottom-line'; and as a result, blind as to the dire consequences of their actions. As he writes in the introduction, '...our self-deluded recklessness will collide with our growing technological power.' In fact, this has been Crichton's pre-occupation for over twenty-five years, beginning with one of his first novels, 'The Terminal Man.' His most successfiul novel to date, 'Jurassic Park', expressed this concern in no uncertain terms - genetics gone terribly wrong - in this case, however, nature retaliates in the form of dangerous dinosaurs. In ~Prey~ the new villian takes the form of self-reproducing machines - nanoparticles or micro-robots - a highly creative merging of nanotechnology, biotechnology and computer science.<br />What I personally enjoy about all Crichton's novels, is that you never come away from the reading experience without learning something. The man does immaculate research for each project and it shows. This novel is no different.<br />Crichton fans will not be disappointed with this novel because it reads at a cracking pace, maintaining tension until the last page.<br />~Prey~ is a highly informative and entertaining read.
B00005QG9J|5.0|First of all, I absolutely love this CD. I've listened to it so many times that I've memorized every lyric, every note, every element of each song... and I haven't gotten tired of it. But the point of this review is not to actually review the CD itself, it's to warn people that this is NOT the same Incubus they were back in '97. I've read review after review with complaints that \\"they've lost their intense, angry edge\\" or \\"they've lost their originality.\\" I agree, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is one of the best albums every made, I love it... but what people don't realize is Incubus is not an angry band! If you want angry, listen to Slipknot or Mudvayne (also very good bands). This album is not exactly better than S.C.I.E.N.CE. but it's definitely more mature, lyrically and musically. They have grown out of their wild, original, \\"stoner\\" music into something more adult and beautiful. I hope that you true music lovers can appreciate this work of art.
630382790X|5.0|This docu-drama vividly portrays how NASA's greatest catastrophe became a very heroic event when three astronauts, Jim Lovell (who wrote the book on which this film is based, played by Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton),<BR>embark on a voyage to the moon. During the course of their journey, an explosion seriously damages the spacecraft, resulting in the crew having to attempt to get back to Earth right away. The threesome finds themselves struggling to survive inside the damaged capsule. Meanwhile, back at NASA, mission controllers find themselves also racing against time along with Apollo 13 as they integrate and interact with the damaged capsule and the three people within as they try to get the damaged spacecraft back to Earth at a distance of 205,500 miles . . .<br />Apollo 13 is a film that Ron Howard did a superb job at directing. Howard has proved himself, in my opinion, to be one of the best directors ever, right up there with Ridley Scott and James Cameron. The casting is perfect, and each and every person portrayed is convincing in their roles. It is a human interest film. I wholeheartedly reccomend this film to anyone. It is a movie almost anyone can enjoy. 5 stars.
B000002JSP|5.0|Even tough i consider Physical Graffiti, Zep's best album, this one is my favourite, why?, simply because it's their most varied, experimental and diverse album, every song is a hit for me. In other Zep's albums, you have one or two songs that i'm not too kin of, i don't like their arabic songs, but here, every song is diverse, this is their FUN album, JPJ was at teh forefront, since Page was battling a drug addiction at the time.<br />In The Evening, the only pure rocker of the bunch, stars with a powerful riff, and it just won't let you go, i't spo powerful, the best choice for a leadoff track.<br />South Bound Saurez, with it's carnival and caribbean beat, it's a fun track, one to enjoy, to sit back and relax, actually one of my favourites.<br />Fool in the rain, it's got the tropical beat again, it seems that this album was recorded in the bahamas instead of cold Sweden, i't s samba part in the midele is so contagious, you can't help but to crank up the volume.<br />Hot dog, bluegrass country at it's best, again a fun track, the boys were just enjoying themselves, it's a very tongue-in-cheek song, Plant singing about his texas girlfriend.<br />Carouselambra, even tough some might find it a bit long, it's a great epic of resurrection and triumph, it might have to do soemthing with Plan's dad, very progresssive and filled with synth, very meloic, it might contain three songs in one, fantastic.<br />All my love, one othe the greatest ballads there is, a song about loss and resurrection, a current theme in this album, very passionate, a beautiful song that will just grow on you like a fly to a wall, one of their all time best songs.<br />\i'm gonna crawl, a song about passion and love, Plant is singing about his beloved one, you can feel his desperation, a blues tune, that Robert  Johnson would have been proud of, very nice choice to close the album.<br />Like someone sais, not the type of album you should buy if you are just getting into Zep, this is one for the long time fans.<br />I recommend it to everyone with a sense of experimentation, and in need for something fresh and different
B00006IUL2|5.0|A great film where we recognize Pasolini's talent and interests. I highly recommend it.
6304712944|3.0|This is a very well done version of the Arthurian legends, and despite the fact that it has bad choreograhy, DESPITE the fact Franco Nero's acting is sub Ed Wood, and DESPITE the fact it IS a little long, it STILL has quite a few good moments, and as a whole is a good film for the family.
6305878323|3.0|A great film for all the family but, as an Englishman, I am outraged by Dick Van Dyke's 'accent'........
B000001ESN|5.0|How many bands have material that sounds dated even though you love them? NOT HERE!<BR>I first heard &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; in 1980 and I still love hearing it and at a concert even more. Remember, the track listings were made for album so Side 1 was &quot;Spirit Of Radio&quot;, &quot;Freewill&quot; and &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;. Side 2 was &quot;Entre Nous&quot;, &quot;Different Strings&quot; and &quot;Natural Science&quot;.  The CD experience is different having only 1 long side and most bands mixed in their more experimental material on Side 2. Also back in the day there had to be the obligatory ballad on an album and &quot;Different Strings&quot; does very well. &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot; have been staples of tours for years and &quot;Natural Science&quot; has been added on the last 2 tours.<BR>FYI - the blank space on the paper should read &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman&quot; but due to legal issues it has not been printed in the US.
B000075BFK|3.0|If it wasn't for Ghetto Star and Thugz Mansion I probably wouldn't even listen to this album
B00005JL96|4.0|Lilo and Stitch doesn't quite have that \\"Disney magic\\" which is found in Sleeping Beauty, Mary Poppins, and such, but it is nonetheless a very good family movie.<br />Lilo is a lonely girl who is from a broken home (the parents are dead and the older sister tries to keep the two together). She is a social outcast who takes solace in her apparently antique collection of Elvis LPs. Her characterization is the most interesting in the whole film; a small child who has distinctly adult attitudes. She adopts a dog, which is really a funky space creature and an outcast in his own right. Stitch is a drooling, snarling genetic mutant that learns from Lilo, the value of himself and the importance of family.<br />The story line moves away from the standard fairy tale fare that is the cornerstone of Disney films, and follows a dysfunctional family for a change. Indeed, Disney marketing blatantly represented Stitch as the black sheep of the animation family. The Ugly Duckling and the importance of family (\\"no one is left behind\\") are the core themes of the movie, and it does an acceptable job of turning these elements into a happy ending.<br />The animation is unique in that the figures are roundish, in sort of a Pillsbury Doughboy fashion, and the direct opposite of what Disney did with Hercules. This non-threatening approach to animation helps offset some action scenes that may be scary for younger children. Nevertheless, this is good entertainment for the family, and a must for anyone who wants to see an animated space alien wear an Elvis jumpsuit.
B000021YQV|2.0|...I only like the first five songs on that toxicity cd and the rest sucks in my opinnion. If youre thinking about buying that \\"steal this album\\" cd, its kinda dumb to buy a cd that looks like it was downloaded style cd. Its worth it to buy it if you dont have a cd burner or a computer. You should try System's Debut cd before you try Toxicity.
0805053883|4.0|Being a fan of \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear...\\", I bought this Polar Bear book thinking it would be just as fantastic.  However, the obscure animals do not make for good sound affects.  While it is easy to hiss like a snake and growl like a polar bear, how do you flute like a flamingo or brey like a zebra?  Nonetheless, the book is great for teaching colors and new animals.  It has the same charming illustrations that Brown Bear has.  (My daughter loves the elephant!)  I recommend this book for the vivid colors and pictures, but not for animal sounds.  It would compliment your child's book collection wonderfully!
B00005JL95|4.0|This is a standard-issue children's movie.  It treads carefully around significant issues:  family grief, social welfare bureaucracy, nurture vs. nature.  The result is that young viewers can begin to examine such weighty &quot;adult&quot; matters in an accessible, non-threatening venue.<br />Lilo and her older sister-forced-to-be-mother, Nani, play their roles admirably.  Lilo is a precocious, but socially inept young girl, struggling with her parents' absence, and the rejection of fellow classmates.  Nani must fill the roles of mother, father, provider, and big sister/friend.  At the same time, she needs a job, and suffers the unspoken frustration of not being able to care for her own needs and wants.<br />The alien characters are funny, but harder to empathize with.  Even stitch only becomes loveable in the last 15 minutes of the movie.<br />Overall, this is a somewhat uneven production.  Nevertheless it is worthwhile for its content and the acting of its human characters.
067144901X|5.0|This was one of my daughters first books.  Before she began talking, she was mimmicking animal sounds.  Her first sound was \\"MOO\\" and she said it with pride.  Next, she learned how to bark.  This book has been a pivital link between babble and deliberate sounds.  Also, this was what I gave her to settle her down anytime she was upset and it worked.  I highly recommend this book!
B00006CXSS|4.0|When I bought it, I did with the purpose of using this in the classroom with my students ( teaching english as a second language) and one of the reason that I purchased the  product was because I read the details of  it and it said that closed captioned was included on the film and it wasn't. There  are Spanish and french subtitles, but not english ones. I  use the film to teach  english to  my  students and when it's really difficult for them to understand, closed captioned helps  me to guide them in their understanding. So please make sure that next time you put the descriptions of a product, be  more specific. I really think that information given is misleading and even thought the product is more than I expected, the closed captioned is essential to  my purpose of having it. Another thing Could you guide where to find the transcript of the series, so I can use in the classroom?  I would appreciate that information very much.....Thanks
0761119752|5.0|We received this book when my daughter was 13 months old and it has been part of our nightly routine ever since.  The book has a wonderful, soothing rhythm and eye-catching graphics that keep my daughter's undivided attention.  By now, I have it memorized and helps me read it even when the light is off.  If my daughter wakes up in the middle of the night, I can recite this book and put her back down without problems.  Also, this book has been a blessing when we are visiting out of town.  (Makes her feel more comfortable before bed.)  This book has my highest recommendation!
0066214122|5.0|Being a long time crichton fan, I have been waiting for a new novel by him for some time. I wasn't disappointed.  Prey is a high paced ride to the end.  I just couldn't put the book down.  I had to find out what happened next.  I guess the only thing that i would complain about is the ending leaves a little to be desired.  But, I guess it is better this way, because true to the content, the story really doesn't end there.  Someone else is bound to pick up and carry on the stupidity.  Other then that small wrinkle. I still give this book a full five stars.  A must read, hope the movie will do it justice.
0805017445|5.0|This book has been a favorite of my daughter's since she was about 7 months old.  The illustrations are simple and colorful; very eye-catching!  Reading it in animal voices has added another level to the book.  My daughter, now 16 months, knows all the animals, the sounds they make, and most of the colors!  This book belongs on every baby's/toddler's shelf.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I have been listening to this CD for 2 days and it gets better with each listen. As the Amazon reviewer so aptly put, the music on this CD is Wagnerian in ambition and delivery. The London Phil and the various vocalists and choirs are tremendous. I especially love Evenstar and Bayrakdarian's solo is beautiful and haunting. Old themes and new ones collide. The old themes have been given a new lease of life with variations which take the listener by surprise and delight. I smiled at the Hunter's theme in the track Uruk Hai...truly wonderful.<br />If you enjoy great music and not just great film music then this CD cannot disappoint. I cannot more highly recommend this CD.<br />Get it!
B000002GJ7|5.0|i got this when i was i entered high school... and i still got the CD and listen to it almost daily.  Unlike other CD's i play the entire cd, not just certain songs.  This CD is all about guitar rock, Nuno can sure pluck them strings.  It still is my favorite CD.  To name a few songs, Decandence Dance, He-man woman hater, Money, A Song for Love, Lil Jack Horny, Get the Funk Out... pretty much all the songs.  And every song, during the guitar solos I find myself shutting my car windows and turning it up to just fill myself with Nunos talent.
0385503954|3.0|After 70 pages, I started thumbing...there's some action in here, right?  The paragraphs get shorter and more happens than a breeze and a sidelong glance, right?  Wrong.<br />This isn't a novel for everyone, despite the generally glowing reviews in the book press.  Although it is set in the 20th century, it struck me as more 19th century in spirit - if you like Jane Austen, you'll probably like Atonement.  It's a perceptive novel of life among the wealthy and smart, and if you hold it at arm's length, indeed there is a good plot, with a lot happening.  I enjoyed its perceptiveness greatly at first - McEwan does have some sensitive, striking, and original observations about the lives of children and how we get along with each other.<br />But as I slugged it through one long paragraph after another, with the phone and the kids and general restlessness interrupting every other page - nah.  Couldn't do it.  Hats off to those who could.
B000002N2P|5.0|When I was 11 years old and it was 1995 I got this CD for Christmas. It instantly became the album I would listen to in headphones when I was feeling any prepubescent rage or when I just wanted to hear some good music. I wanted it based off what I thought was the strength of the first single, &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot;. I then found that every song on the disc is stellar. They are all in the same punk style yet they manage not to be repetitive.<br />One of the greatest things about this album is its dark, harsh tone. Though the punk melodies of the vocals are usually in upbeat keys, the lyrics describe a lot of lost hope and discontent with the world in general. After the punk/slob indifference that dominated the material on &quot;Dookie&quot;, Green Day returned to offer a collection of songs from the point of view of a self-described &quot;jaded&quot; misanthrope. The result succeeds in drawing in and capturing the listener.<br />As time went on and the &quot;Brain Stew/Jaded&quot; single and video became subject to massive overplay on the radio and MTV (it was even featured on the Godzilla soundtrack three years after Insomniac's release), parts of the disc (namely the aforementioned single) began to wear out. But I took this disc off the shelf yesterday and started listening to it again. The great thing about it is that you can sit down and listen to the album all the way through and (a) not hit any boring parts or filler, (b) not waste too much time as it clocks in at around 33 minutes, and (c) not feel jipped because the amount of material presented turns out to be perfectly sufficient. I'll admit I have not bought or listened to any of Green Day's releases after Insomniac (their change in style and pop-sell-out attitude kind of turned me off around 1997), but this disc remains to me a masterpiece of punk rock that seems as fresh today as it did seven years ago.
B00006V9A0|1.0|this is a horrible set. the track list isn't really &quot;the best&quot; it's the singles. this was only put out so all those people who like &quot;teen spirit&quot; and never bought a nirvana album would ask for it for the holidays. however one &quot;new track&quot; (not even that great)is supposed to make old fans buy it because the record company (all of them) think the record buyer is stupid and buys every release or best of or new packaging of with one or two &quot;new&quot; or live tracks. forget this and pick up Nirvana Unplugged in NY and Incesticide.those are the best the band ever did.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Lena Katina and Julia Volkova are AMAZING in this new addition to the English version CD.....their Russian version of this album \\"Dvesti Po Vstrechiy\\" is equally amazing.  If you like dance music such as Madison Ave, etc....you, will LOVE this group.  T.A.T.U.'s music is hard hitting and brings up some really incredible issues in the way we are and the way we live...plus, it's GREAT to dance to.... =)<BR>There are SO many different dance music groups that come and go and leave songs without making any statements...(remember New Kids on the Block??????)  =p  T.A.T.U. is definitly NOT one of these.  These two girls not only have incredible voices, but they also carry a strong message in their music!...  Go out and GET THIS CD!...
B00007BH5C|5.0|Perhaps like me, you might have worried the excellence of the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack wouldn't be upheld throughout the series. Well, when I was able to get my hands on a copy of The Two Towers soundtrack, all my fears were instantly laid to rest. Howard Shore not only upholds the great themes set up in Fellowship of the Ring, but he expands upon them. New themes such as the Riders of Rohan have as much brilliance and memorable melodies as the Fellowship or Hobbit themes from the first film. From the first track, where we return to the Mines of Moria for the conclusion of the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog, you can tell Shore is keeping all the orchestral and choral power from the Fellowship of the Ring. In contrast, the Gollum theme is dark, brooding, and somewhat unclear (so much so that it could almost be called an anti-theme), perfectly fitting the double-minded character. A very pleasant surprise is that the Fellowship theme is not lost in this film, even though the Fellowship is broken. In fact, track five (The Uruk-Hai) brings about a rendition of the Fellowship theme longer than any found in the first film. The other themes of the Ring, Sauron, Saurman, the Hobbits, and the Elves all find their ways into the score. Gollum's Song is also very good, despite the somewhat Bjrk-likeness at the beginning. When it is over, you feel the song has really captured the character of Gollum. The track then ends with another rendition of the Riders of Rohan theme, which I think is the stand-out theme of this score. Overall, this is classic film music, which I am sure will (at the least) be nominated for an Academy Award for best score (and I won't be surprised if Howard Shore walks away with back-to-back Oscars). As with the first film's music, the power of the story is captured brilliantly. If you liked the score for The Fellowship of the Ring, you will not be disappointed at all by this score. A total success!
0066214122|3.0|Better than his previous couple of books (Timeline was just awful), this novel tackles nanotechnology, evolution and genetic optimization. Those are heavy-duty subjects but Crichton makes them seem easy and fascinating. As a teacher, he did a good job.<br />What the book is really about is how small and simple elements that obey very few rules can evolve into a very complex organism. This same subject has been thoroughly explored recently by Stephen Wolfram in his encyclopedic treaty, A New Kind of Science, (definitely not a novel!) about using extremely simple computer programs to solve extremely complex problems. (Am I the only one to pick up on this, or have others seen it also?)<br />As a novelist, however, Crichton is painfully inadequate. His character development is pathetic. I don't understand it: an obviously extremely bright guy who has even produced/directed some good movies who just can't write about people? Maybe he's just bored with that aspect of novels. On keeping the plot going, though, he did a good job. It's definitely a page-turner.
B000069HK2|5.0|Well what to say about such an awesome band and sweet ...cd.  If you have any interest in emo or punk buy this cd without hesitation.  Let's just say I don't care if Bert almost puked on me at the Warped tour this cd is sensational.  His screams are deathdefying and melodies are like the wind, he cuts through them with such ease.  and even live they rule.  Their sound is so unreal it scares me.  I bought this cd in August, and it hasn't left my side for anything else. unless u count the transtion from car to home stereo.  If you have only heard one song on the album, and you like it.  well there is a great deal more to come.  so get off your butt and buy this cd for your own good.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I have no words to describe the emotion I feel when I watch this concert. How could be possible I descovered DT just days ago listening rock in internet?.<BR>This is without no doubt one of the biggest bands on earth, since I get the dvd I'm not go to sleep if I don't watch them.<br />I will do easy for you, if you really like good music and excelent musicians, DON'T HESITATE ONE SECOND and buy this DVD, you will not be sorry.
B0000024ZI|5.0|I have been a major fan of this band beginning the day I first heard this recording on 8-Track Tape. This is my personal favorite. I think as a band they are tighter on this recording than any other. If I had to live without all of my MTH stuff and I could keep only one recording this would be my choice. Thanks
0394800389|5.0|I would recommened this bok to antone who liked to read. This is a great book and the first time I read this book to myself I was in a toung twister the whole time. I also liked how it rymed so much, my fav. was\\"the fox in socks on box on knox.\\"
0060504544|4.0|This is a creepy, dreamy little nightmare of a tale written for the young adult market. I bought the unabridged audiotape version read (quite dreamily, I might add) by author Neil Gaimen.  Coraline is a lonely young girl with endless energy and a keen sense of adventure.  Her parents have recently moved into a huge home that has been converted into several apartments and Coraline has been having great fun discovering all sorts of nifty things on the grounds of the home.  One day a storm arrives and Coraline is forced to stay inside with only her busy (and somewhat neglectful, if you ask me) parents for company.  They instruct her to leave them alone, to go on an adventure around the house and to bother the neighbors.  So Coralina does and discovers a door to a secret, sinister world that at first glance appears to be very much like her own.  In this world she has another Mother, one with black button eyes and long twitching fingers!  This is an interesting dark fantasy that I didn't think was predictable at all.  Coraline is a smart, spunky little girl who, when faced with the ultimate temptation, is forced to make a very grown up decision.  I liked this one lots and can't wait to listen to it again.
6301174240|4.0|Ok folks, this has seriously got to be the weirdest film I have ever scene, it makes very little sence (if any at all). Basically you have just over an hour of great music, really cool dance sequences, some rather intriguing claymation and a mish mash of the things he his experienced and accomplished in his life to the 90's.<br />Then it gets mondo bizzaro....the actual movie part..I mean yes the concept of fighting of drug lords and saving kids from the baddness of drugs is good...but turning into a robot and a space ship? WEIRD! I give it a four for the music and dance sequences but as to plot and story line..I was lost.

B00003CX8V|5.0|The Apartment is Billy Wilder's satirical look at office politics and the Man In The Grey Flannel Suit.  Jack Lemmon stars as C.C. Baxter, a lowly office clerk in a huge corporation who is just another faceless working bee in an endless row of desks.  When Baxter starts lending his apartment to executives in his firm so they can take their mistresses there, he finds himself moving up the corporate ladder.  Although the constant loaning of his apartment starts to be an inconvenience, he keeps doing it as makes sense business wise.  In meantime, he meets Fran, an elevator operator in his building, who is involved in affair with the big man in corporation, J.D. Sheldrake, played by Fred MacMurray.  Mr. MacMurray is outstanding  playing against type as the lascivious lowlife boss and philanderer (although is played another unscrupulous character quite well in The Caine Mutiny).  Ms. MacLaine is excellent as the morose Fran who brings the situation between Baxter, Sheldrake and herself to head when she tries to commit suicide.  Baxter must decide between his integrity and his career.  Mr. Wilder masterfully fills the film with laughs and heart and his look at corporate politics is sharp and incisive.  For his efforts, he yet again had a triple win at the Oscars, taking the 1960 Best Director, Screenwriting & Picture awards.  The Apartment was also the last black & white film to win the Best Picture Oscar until Schindler's List (which has some elements of color) won in 1993.
B000002OTL|3.0|A song I haven't herd for over thirty years, it was the first song I learned to play on guitar.  It brought back so many good times I had with my friends and they didn't even put it on the CD? If it was there I would have bought the CD but it wasn't. Sorry no sale.
0385474547|4.0|Achebe has done it again! Things Fall Apart is a book filled with subtle diregarding Christianity from the Ibo's point of view. What it right and what is wrong? Think about that while you read this wonderful book!
0802130208|5.0|This has to be one of the most bizzare collection of characters I have yet to run across. The characters and situations Toole conjures up are incredibly inventive, I only wish he'd lived to write more. If you don't enjoy this book you, sir, obviously lack taste and decency and should be flogged until you drop. Excuse me, I need to go clear my valve.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is awsome the lyrics are great theres  not to much lyrics for Avrils voice and not to little either. her woice is not like Britneys at all except in one song she is more like alanis morsette than like Britney,christina or jessica the only corny song is naked my favorites are complicated and sk8ter boi one other reason why i like avrils music is that she writes her own music and really expresses herself in her music and you can really tell she is trying hard over all this is a very very awsome cd I highly recommend it it is not a waste of money i hope my review was of help to you
B000001Y79|5.0|Emerging during the time period when Toni Braxton's &quot;Unbreak my heart&quot; was huge, right After the time Nirvana reigned supreme, came this feel good band. When I was in fourth grade, I bought this CD. It was the first CD I had ever purchased on my own. I fell in love. Now, 6 years later, I am still smitten with the band. This CD is filled with upbeat girl anthems, heartbreaking ballads, and feel good tunes. This album is so appealing to everyone. Why? I couldnt tell you. Maybe its the fact that Gwen Stefani's voice is so captivating. Maybe its because Tony, Tom, and Adrian bring you a great musical feeling. Maybe its both. This album is one of the best of the 1990's and if you havent picked up a copy, you are missing out. No Doubt is a hugely talented band that brings a great element to the music scene.
0060934913|5.0|I just love this book. The story is so honest and at times so raw that it just grabs you from the beginning. I find myself reading chapters to my wife and anyone else that will listen. His writing style grabs you and tells you &quot;I am for real!&quot;. Tony justs lets it all hang out and doesn't really care who's offended. At the same time he seems like a great guy to have a few beers with. If you want a chance to hang out in the locker room of the cooking world with all its characters this is the book for you. Just don't loan out any bail money!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I really really like this CD. At first, I wasn't really sure that I wanted to buy this CD. I thought Pink was hot, but I didn't know I would like her CD, too!!! LoL, anyways, I really liked \\"Get This Party Started\\" so I downloaded it. I heard \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and liked it, so I did the same. After I really liked \\"Just Like A Pill\\" I knew I had to own this CD. I was really surprised at how much I liked this CD. It's great! I recommend it to anyone. I know a lot of my friends don't like Pink, so I just hide this CD. LoL. Anyway, I'll break it down for y'all.<br />1. Missundaztood - (4/5) This is a good song. I listen to it a lot. It's probably one of my favorite songs on the CD. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! (listen to the CD to know what that's all about)<br />2. Don't Let Me Get Me - (5/5) Great song! It's really good. I like it a whole lot. At first, I was like \\"huh?\\" but then I started to like it. It sure does grow on ya!<br />3. Just Like A Pill - (4.5/5) I'm only giving this a 4.5 because I overplayed it and kinda killed it, but oh well. I still like it!<br />4. Get This Party Started - (5/5) Awesome song! A GREAT dance song. I really like it. If you liked this song, you'll like ths CD.<br />5. Respect - (3/5) I like this song. It's a bit too girly for me, but still kinda fun to dance to.<br />6. 18 Wheeler - (3.5/5) I like this song too. It's pretty good. That's all I have to say.<br />7. Family Portrait - (6/5) No, it's no mistake! I really, really, really like this song. Sure, it's kinda sad, but I like those depressing tracks on CD's! (I know, I'm weird) One of the best on the CD!<br />8. Misery - (4.5/5) The great thing about this song is STEVEN TYLER! I love Aerosmith and that just saves the song, otherwise I'd give it a 3.<br />9. Dear Diary - (4.5/5) I like this song a lot. It's really good....um, yeah....<br />10. Eventually - (3/5) It's kinda slow, kinda O.K. I guess I like it, but not as much as the other songs. Alright?<br />11. Lonely Girl - (3/5) It's O.K. I guess I like it, but again, not as much as the other songs. It's kinda slow too. It's just \\"O.K.\\"<br />12. Numb - (7/5) Again, no mistake. O.K., I lied about \\"Family Portrait\\", this is the best song on the CD. Why isn't it a single???? Some things will never be answered in life. All I know is that I like this song and you will too!<br />13. Gone To California - (3.5/5) This is an O.K. song, but you gotta give props to Miss Pink there for wanting to go tto the Sunshine State! (Rock on!) Besides that, it's O.K.<br />14. My Vietnam - (4.5/5) This is a really good song. I really like the bomb-ish sounds in the background and in the intro. Those sounds are really cool. It's a good song, too.<br />In conclusion, THIS CD ROCKS! You should buy it if you enjoy \\"Get This Party Started\\" or any of the other P!NK singles. Also, you should buy Mariah Carey's new CD \\"Charmbracelet\\"!!!! It's really good. Until next time, bye. Enjoy!!!!!guess I like it, but again, not as much as the other songs. It's kinda slow too. It's just \\"O.K.\\"<br />12. Numb - (7/5) Again, no mistake. O.K., I lied about \\"Family Portrait\\", this is the best song on the CD. Why isn't it a single???? Some things will never be answered in life. All I know is that I like this song and you will too!<br />13. Gone To California - (3.5/5) This is an O.K. song, but you gotta give props to Miss Pink there for wanting to go tto the Sunshine State! (Rock on!) Besides that, it's O.K.<br />14. My Vietnam - (4.5/5) This is a really good song. I really like the bomb-ish sounds in the background and in the intro. Those sounds are really cool. It's a good song, too.<br />In conclusion, THIS CD ROCKS! You should buy it if you enjoy \\"Get This Party Started\\" or any of the other P!NK singles. Also, you should buy Mariah Carey's new CD \\"Charmbracelet\\"!!!! It's really good. Until next time, bye. Enjoy!!!!!
B0000024T3|3.0|No other pop divas in the 1960's took time away from their hit-making schedule to do a French-flavored album of chilly love songs but our Barbra. I didn't care for her incessant over-dramatizing in two of my favorite songs(\\"What Now, My Love?\\" and \\"I Wish You Love\\")but \\"Clopin Clopan\\" and \\"Martina\\" are blissfully pretty. An uneven collection, but certainly worth a listen. The curious cover shot seems half a drawing, half a photo, yet encapsulates '60's Barbra in all her would-be French glory.
B00006LJ72|5.0|Will the world look upon the music of Enya in 100 years and consider them (Enya) true masters of music artistry?  Of course it will.  <BR>One can argue that long standing Enya fans will already possess the bulk of this collection.  Is that a reason to deprive new fans of their (Enya's) gift of a career's work?  I think not.  The music of Enya has come into focus as of late with commercial success of the single &quot;Only Time.&quot;  A 20-year-old co-worker of mine had been listening to Enya's &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; at her desk.  When I mentioned how elated I was that my admiration and gratitude for Enya's music had only grown with each CD's release, she looked at me dumbfounded.  &quot;Isn't this her (their) first release?&quot; she asked.  <BR>This boxed set should only be praised for what it gives...The opportunity to absorb an epic of work in one collection.  I commend the format in which it has been created that mixes Enya's beginnings with their ends (ends as of today...I know there is much more to come).  To be able to witness the evolvement of artistry in one listening session gives the subject the ability to experience the growth of Enya's music first hand.<BR>For the fans that have followed Enya's career since it's incept, you can review your collection and decide whether or not this boxed set will enhance an already well experienced epic of music.  I believe the assortment, and the B-sides such as &quot;Isobella&quot; (a track I took to heart immediately upon hearing the Japanese release), and &quot;May It Be&quot; (Who did not sit through the long credits of the masterpiece LOTR movie to hear every note of this song?) makes this set the crowning jewel in Enya's collection.  Will Enya release another box set in 10 years making this one obsolete?  I hope so!!  We should be, and deserve to be, so lucky.
B0000025HG|3.0|I didn't know anybody in 1979 who liked the disco-duet with Donna Summer on &quot;No More Tears(Enough Is Enough)&quot;, even though a shortened version hit the no.#1 spot in Billboard. The version heard here is a little bit longer and it is strengthened by the added space(it grew on me). Really, no album by anybody should cobble together disco songs like this and &quot;I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight&quot; with unbelieveably tender ballads like &quot;After The Rain&quot;. Yet Streisand took a chance and &quot;Wet&quot; works a lot better on CD than did it as a record album(on a CD, you can jump around more smoothly). I did enjoy the title track, it's a cute, winking song, and the cool, breezy &quot;On Rainy Afternoons&quot;, but &quot;Kiss Me In The Rain&quot; is a little bit too Broadway; it's too anxious to be a pop-hit, which it wasn't. Beautiful shots of a wet Barbra enhance the listening enjoyment.

B00004Y6Q5|5.0|I immediately purchased this soundtrack a day after seeing the film.  As soon as I heard the music for the opening credits, I remember saying to myself, \\"I'm getting this soundtrack tomorrow.\\"  And I did, and since then I have lost track of the number of times I have listened to it.<br />Composed by Clint Mansell, with the Kronos Quartet and their great violin playing and such, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is an outstanding score that really gets into your head.  It's a score full of dread, sorrow, pain, sadness, fear, and paranoia.  Its got an industrial quality mixed with haunting violins to enhance it even more.  (Imagine music by Trent Reznor with violins added to the mix.)  A lot of the tracks are short and some are repetitive, but I had no problem with that.  Yes, it might've been nice to hear some of the tracks extended, but I really like the overall layout of the tracks and how they appear in the order as the do in the movie.<br />Although the entire album is amazing, my favorite tracks are as follows: summer overture, ghosts of things to come, hope overture, tense, cleaning apartment, marion barfs, supermarket sweep, sara goldfarb has left the building, winter overture, southern hospitality, ghosts of future lost, meltdown, and lux aeterna.  As good as the entire album is, the overtures really steal the show.  (Especially \\"summer overture.\\")<br />Of course you'll most likely appreciate it more if you have indeed seen the film, but I can see people who haven't seen the movie enjoying this well-composed soundtrack as well.  It's really great music, and you'll never look at music scores in the same way ever again.  \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" definitely gets added to my list of favorite scores.  In fact, this may become my overall favorite.  Only time will tell.  All I can say is that I am loving every bit of it right now, and I hope that Clint Mansell does more haunting scores like this one.  Don't let this remarkable score pass you by.  You'll regret it if you do.
0066214122|3.0|I loved his earlier work, but this one even though a great concept really fells apart in later part of the book, you can actually out run airborne nano particles, an okay book, not a great one.
6305603847|5.0|This is the pinnacle of what a movie about rock and roll should be about. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and in this case eventual isolation from it all by the Wall. Everybody already knows about the goodies contained within the DVD so I will just speak about the film itself. It is excellent every minute is worth it. The lighting, cinematography, and animation are all excellent. The songs are all perfectly tuned to the action on screen. Its all about an imaginary rock star by the name of Pink Floyd. His psyche has been damaged through years of over protection, abuse, and trauma. His way of dealing with it is to construct a \\"wall\\" to hide himself behind. Needless to say this isolation soon gets to him and he falls apart. Anyway I highly reccomend this excellent movie and the album!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Non-stop hijinks and hilarity ensue when John Goodman and Billy Crystal get together for this fourth film from Pixar. The whole family will love this film. Cute monsters for the young ones yet witty writing and dialogue for the adults. The story is great, the animation is amazing, and the extras on this dvd will take hours to sift through. You will not regret this purchase.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Nobody needs this CD.  If you really love Nirvana, buy one of their full-length albums, and you'll get some of the songs of this horrid compilation plus some better, lesser-known songs that the radio hasn't played to death.  No matter what anyone says, YKYR is awful.  To me, its one of their worst songs ever.  The only things interesting about it is the tin noise repeated a few times near the end.  The rest of the song is off-key and grating.  Paper Cuts is even better than YKYR.  The band has only been in the public eye for a mere decade, so how young could you possibly be in order to be unfamiliar with them?
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove is a fascinating read and an equally fascinating miniseries or movie. Starring Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Anjelica Huston, and a fascinatingly different Robert Urich, it is well acted with many fine supporting actors including Diane Lane, Frederic Forrest and Rick Schroder. Well-researched and thorough, the filmmakers have faithfully followed the book and presented a movie that is beautifully filmed and also surprisingly &quot;educational&quot; for want of a better word. Most people didn't make a big deal out of hygiene, for example, in the days of this story, medicine was in it's early days and people died from illnesses and injuries that they would be able to survive in our day and age and the minutiae of the dialogue and fine nuances to the performances give you as much of a sense of living in a different era as any movie ever has.
B00007E8O5|3.0|I love Cantrell, but some of these songs sound forced.  I guess I've been spoiled by AIC.  Nothing is ever going to compare to that sound, not that he's trying to duplicate the success.  It'll probably have to grow on me.  I did however gain an apreciation for the original Degredation CD in listening to this version.  All the new songs aren't as good as the first batch except for track 12 on vol.2  I think I like that more because it could totally pass for an Alice tune.  I swear it sounds like Layne on that track.
B00006LJ72|1.0|You will never get the time back that you waste listening to this pap. Why people choose music devoid of any real emotional content is a mystery I will never solve. Buy a comfy pillow and take a nap instead. You'll thank me.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Oh wow, this album is WOW. I am lost for words. This is the only CD in my player right now. It is addictive. Chris Cornell's infectious, fluid voice is amazing and powerful as always. Tom Morello's guitar playing is distinct and innovative as always. Tim Commerford's bass playing is kick ... as usual, and Brad Wilk's drumming pounds away at your eardrums like always. This is a Megaband at it's best. These guys are here to save Rock and Roll. Please buy this CD. You'll love it. I promise.
B000068QY7|4.0|Yeah, yeah, I know.  It's Oasis heresy to declare ANYTHING might possibly surpass the heights of the Oasis Sgt. Pepper album What's The Story (Morning Glory, but Heathen Chemistry might have just done it.  It's more of a group effort than anything else the band has ever done, and it really harkens back to the snarling rock and roll of Definitely Maybe more than any other album.  They've cut down on the \\"annoying\\" tracks that derailed Standing on the Shoulders of Giants (itself not all bad) and clearly surpasses the mediocre Morning Glory follow-up of Be Here Now.  Thank the music gods they came out with an album this good or else Oasis might be relegated to the discount bins in the record stores.  Sure, they're derivative and a bunch of Beatle wanna-be's, but who isn't?  As more than one reviewer has mentioned (and as Paul McCartney has said), if they're going to rip-off anybody they may as well rip-off the greatest band ever.  This CD should be played LOUD.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Ok, for all of you who doubted this album, please pick it up, listen......I mean REALLY listen. Audioslave is the greatest thing to hit music in a long time. The only thing I doubted was that I didn't think it would be as great as Soundgarden was. And Rage, well, I hate Zac De La Crappa so I never got to into them, but Tom Morello, Brad Wilk, & Tim Commerford are all excellent musicians. So I think that the chemestry between Chris Cornell's god-like vocals, and ex-Rage musicians Tim, Tom, and Brad's playing works very well. Personally I always thought that if Chris Cornell and Jerry Cantrell got together it would be great, but this......I am more than happy about this. Audioslave is superior to all in my book. Pick it up, I won't tell you I told you so! :)
B00006J9OT|5.0|A live musical performance can be one of two things. If you know the artist by only their studio efforts, when you see them live it might be a major disappointment (there's no special wiz-bang effects to cover up their \\"real\\" sub-par sound). On the flip side, seeing & hearing them live might turn your opinion around and think \\"Wow... this is better than I thought!\\" Diana Krall's \\"Live In Paris\\" follows the latter thought... THIS IS GOOD STUFF. Gone is the slick production and tweaked voice-overs that you'd find on her studio albums. The background orchestra here is minimal (I found they were too much and almost took something away from Krall's \\"The Look Of Love\\"). \\"Live In Paris\\" takes you overseas to a stage with torch-singer-queen Krall on her piano accompanied by her crew... Clayton on bass, Hamilton on drums and Pisano on guitar. Jazz is playing a song with feeling mixed with a bit of improvisation. You'll find that here. These songs are done with style and any of the great composers or singers (Nat King Cole, Jimmy Rowles, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee) would be proud the way Krall represents them here in live form. Check out songs, \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\", \\"S'Wonderful\\", \\"Fly Me To The Moon\\", and \\"Let's Fall In Love\\"... actually all are good - no filler here. This disc gets better with repeated spins. If you're a Krall fan, this CD is essential.
B00006X06U|5.0|Travelogue is a beautiful assortment of refurbished songs that span Mitchell's career.  The new renditions are generally slower than earlier recordings but equally heartfelt and provocative.  Many take on a new life because of modified rhythm and orchestral accompaniment.  Mr. Mendoza's arrangements nicely complement Joni's smoky blue jazz style.  Despite her limited vocal range (\\"something's lost but something's gained in living every day\\"), Joni's muted horn voice continues to project a seasoned maturity, creativity, intimacy and sensitivity that preserves listener interest - qualities that have been the hallmark of her success as a recording artist.  For dedicated Mitchell fans, this album is a must; it does not disappoint.
0590711261|4.0|I received this book as a baby shower present. It was my daughter's first book, and I read it to her frequently for years. I love this book because its message empowers girls to seek their own destiny, to think and act for themselves and to question the roles others may impose upon them. I strongly suggest it to every young woman out there who may fall prey to &quot;traditional&quot; fairy tales.
0897500482|4.0|I can't say much more than what has been said by the other reviewers. If you want to know more about Lee or JKD, you need this book. I knocked it down a star because some of the drawings are crude, but they get the point across. Also because in some areas it seems a little unorganized.
0920668364|5.0|I read this to my daughter and son when they were very young, but it was my son who most closely related to it. He was two when I first introduced the story to him, and even today, at age 11, when he is dealing with independence and girlfriends, we still recite the verse to each other on those rare occasions he lets me cuddle with him. I am perplexed by those who consider this story creepy, and can only feel that they may not understand the true nature of unconditional love, or the reality of the life cycle. A child's greatest fear is the loss of a parent, but it is a reality that some children suffer that loss. We can let our children understand that our love for them supercedes even death, and will continue on in the love for their children. I recommend this book for every mother and child.
630463949X|5.0|This is the best live concert I've ever had the privelege to watch on DVD. Though there are noticeable recorded background vocals, Stevie and Christie sound in top form. I couldn't help thinking that they sounded so good that they must have rehearsed endlessly for this concert (I'm wondering if these songs are all from the same show because there aren't really any noticeable mistakes). Lindsey Buckingham does a solo perfomance for Go Insane and Big Love that is so emotionally charged that I was blown away. He is truly one of the best guitarists in the world. Landslide is another top song from the disc, and this performance will leave you with wet eyes (I was feeling like I invaded Stevie and Lindsey's privacy during this song). Every song is top quality and flawlessly perfomed. Lindsey's vocals are a little rough throughout, but it doesn't take away from any part of the show. The only song I didn't care much for was My Little Demon. They could have left this one off the disc. It just isn't up to the standards of every single other song here. If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, and love both Christie's songs and Stevie's songs, then you have to buy this concert video. Besides their voices being WAY better than I thought possible for a live perfomance, they are both stunning to look at (Christie looks better than she did 20 years ago, no kidding). I borrowed the DVD from a friend, and decided after one viewing that I would have to purchase it. The cd from this tour isn't as good as the DVD you're about to purchase, because it is missing 5 very important songs. You won't regret it. I wish they would tour again because I would pay any amount of money to see a concert of this quality again.
B00005JL3A|3.0|I first saw this movie in theatres, where it was extremely scary, disturbing, and creepy. I anticipated and jumped at every scene. Once it transferred to video, it lost something. The DVD version just lacked the horror. NO doubt it is a stylish, sleek film with incredible special effects and a great soundtrack. It just lacks all convincing scariness...
B000059TPN|5.0|THE ROCK is one of the top 5 action movies ever made! It makes no apologies for its all-out style, either. I don't usually fall for one-liners, but Sean Connery's quote about the prom queen (see it yourself!) is hilarious.<br />I don't usually even watch movies twice. But I pop in this DVD every now and again as &quot;background,&quot; and always end up totally engrossed. My &quot;real work&quot; always gets dropped in favor of the movie. Do yourself a favor and see THE ROCK.
0783226063|1.0|This movie was terrible as a movie alone, not to mention that it did not follow the book.  After watching this movie, I cannot believe that anyone can make a movie using at most a quarter of the actual book!  Many of the scenes were not even in the book and several were manipulated for one reason or another so that the content and/or settings were totally different!  I also have to agree with all of the other complaints from other posts regarding this movie.<br />If looking for a Dune movie, go with the 2000 miniseries, although not perfect, it is far greater than this junk.
B00006V9A0|2.0|While this CD contains great music, this CD is not for the Nirvana fan. This CD is for those who have heard some of the singles, and would like to have those songs without buying all 5 albums these songs are taken from. The only point for a fan to buy it is to get the 3 \\"unreleased\\" songs: Been a Son (from the Blew EP), Pennyroyal Tea (from the single and from the version of In Utero), and You Know You're Right. Even still, the first 2 songs can be obtained on other, less \\"legitimate\\" sources, the wonderful \\"Outcesticide\\" series (1 and 4). And in all honesty, YKYR just isn't as good as a song as people hoped. The live version from 1993 was way better (Outcesticide 5). <BR>This CD should have been released the same way Iron Maiden released their GH CD: release the CD on the same day as the box set, and allow the artwork from the CD to be downloaded. Thus, the fans get something, and the person interested in just the hits gets something too.<BR>If you're a fan, you already have these songs. Save your money.<BR>ROb
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm truly proud of Mrs. Aguilera from taking herself away from the POP image and persona.  She truly delivers a mature and positive side of her that was very well hidden on the first album.  <br />IMPOSSIBLE, CRUZ, GET MINE/GET YOURS, and BEAUTIFUL are truly hitmakers and songs to listen to from the album.  <br />BUY THE ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005AAFS|5.0|No, the title of the album is not what this group does here.  It's German for \\"mother.\\"  Be prepared for eleven songs of hard-driving crunchy extreme techno-metal.  Well, two of the songs are ballad, but still...  I always get stirred up (in the positive sense) whenever I hear many of the songs here.<br />\\"Mein Herz Brennt\\" bursts into a Led-Zep Kashmir-type power beats with symphonic backing,  The title is sung with such climactic agony, following as it does the following English lyrics from one of the stanzas:  \\"Now dear children, pay close attention/<br />I am the voice of the kiss/I have brought something along for you/A bright light in the heavens/My heart burns.\\"  Note, I'm naturally using English lyrics for quotes.<br />The opening militaristic marching steps of \\"Links 234\\" brought up an image of Bismarck's troops marching into Austria.  The beat is indeed martial when singing \\"Links zwo drei vier.\\"  However, the song is about hearts and whether they can be stolen, outspoken, pure, and actually to take the place of the brain.  This is my favourite song here.<br />If anything, people will know how to count to nine in German with \\"Sonne.\\"  Ready?  It's ein, zwei, drei, vier, funf, sechs, seven, acht, neun.  Inbetween the numbers, the lyrics \\"Hier komme dit sonne\\" means \\"Here Comes The Sun\\".  The waifish wailing voice near the end is a cool touch to a powerful song.<br />\\"Ich Will\\" means \\"I Want\\" and it begins with: \\"I want you to have faith in me<br />I want you to believe in me... etc\\"  The same lyrics are whispered except it's now \\"We want you to have faith in us.. etc.\\"  We, instead of I.  The music is martial in the same tempo as \\"Links 234.\\"<br />My second favourite song is \\"Feuer Frei\\" with its ferocious \\"bang bang\\" chorus.  Those of you who saw XXX will recognize this as the song Rammstein's playing when the NSA agent is killed by Yorgi's men and carried over the heads of the crowd.  This is one extreme song, as evidenced by the lead stanza:  \\"Rebuked are those who know pain/From the fire that burns the skin/I shine a light in my face/My loud yell (I yell loudly)/Open fire!\\"  Open fire indeed!<br />The title track is a downbeat ballad about a sad boy who never had a mother around for him.  One lyric goes:  \\"The mother who never gave birth to me/I have sworn tonight<br />[that] I will send her a disease/and later drown her in the river.\\"  Whoa!  The other ballad here is the closing \\"Hallelujah\\" which has a sweeping symphonic backing.  Looking at the lyrics, I wonder if the theme is akin to the recent Catholic scandal.<br />Other short notes:  \\"Zwitter\\" is a crunching song about a happy hermaphrodite, and the conflicting dynamic of being two genders in one person.  \\"Rein raus\\" meaning \\"in out\\" is a song about, well, put it this way, the man is the rider, and guess who is the horse?  And \\"Adios\\" chronicles the final moments of an addict who overdoses.<br />Oh, and here is a translation of the song titles in English I got from some the Rammsteinsite as well as the lyrics.<br />Mein Herz Brennt  =  My heart burns<br />Links 234  =  Left 234<br />Sonne  =  Sun<br />Ich Will  =  I Want<br />Feuer Frei  =  Fire Free<br />Mutter  =  Mother<br />Spieluhr  =  Music Box<br />Zwitter  =  Hermaphrodite<br />Rein Raus  =  In Out<br />Adios  =  Bye<br />Nebel  =  Mist<br />Hallelujah  =  Hallelujah<br />One of the best industrial-metal albums, and indeed metal albums of all time.hose who know pain/From the fire that burns the skin/I shine a light in my face/My loud yell (I yell loudly)/Open fire!\\"  Open fire indeed!<br />The title track is a downbeat ballad about a sad boy who never had a mother around for him.

B00006L83N|5.0|I decided to wait to write my review of this album until I had given it a good listening to. After over 40 hours listening to this CD, what have I learned from those many spins? Allow me to describe the tracks individually.<BR> **Inferno -- Michael Romeo had stated that this album would be their hardest yet. This song is definitely up there with the pompous and thrashing numbers from Divine Wings of Tragedy (DWOT). In fact, I'd say that this song sets the overall tone for the entire album. Russel Allen's voice is phenomenal on this and all the other tracks. For those who haven't heard Russel's pipes, his voice is crystalline at some moments and gritty the next depending on the emotions of the song and music. His voice is also quite operatic, without being clich; plus he sings with perfect pitch. On this track the vocal harmonies are toned back a bit, but not to fear because he showcases his harmonizing ability to its fullest on other tracks. To describe the guitar work, it sounds like Michael Romeo has broadened the range of his guitar work--though it is safe to say that it sounds like this and other songs on this album would have fit perfectly on DWOT. Indeed, personally speaking this album is, dare I say it, as great as DWOT and V. Mr. Romeo's guitar work has become more refined, with increased variety of styles and modes. The driving guitars and subtle keyboards (hats off to Mike Pinella) on this track are reminiscent of Sea of Lies off DWOT. The drumming and bass playing by Jason Rullo and Michael Lepond are also top notch--it's nice to hear the bass clearly in the mix.<BR> **Wicked -- It kicks butt. The ditty begins with a monstrous sounding rhythm that perfectly lives up to its moniker. Pounding drums and the driving base line echo in my ears as the song leads into the awesome lyrics. Speaking of which...these are some of the best lyrics this band has written. I almost feel as though I am wandering through the graveyard with the story's protagonist. \\"Long dark hair flowing down her thighs--Yeah!\\" Yeah is right! With this song's haunting melodies and driving beats, it easily ranks up there as one of the best on the album.<BR> **Incantations of the Apprentice -- Supposedly this song is based on the Mickey Mouse rendition of the Sorcerer's Apprentice in Disney's Fantasia. However, don't let that discourage any metal heads from listening to this tune--indeed Walt Disney's heart would probably give out from the pulsating and swarming notes seamlessly interwoven through a multitude of drum beats (if he weren't already cryogenically frozen). How this band can make something as mundane as dancing brooms and rising wash-water so kick butt is beyond me. It almost makes me want to try watching the cartoon while listening to the music just to see how Fantasia 2002 might be.<BR> **Accolade II -- This tune is the sequel to Accolade off their DWOT album. Some would argue that Accolade was the best song off that album, so that SymX has written a sequel should please a lot of fans--it certainly delighted me. The piano in this tune is absolutely breathtaking. Russel Allen's voice is simply overflowing with emotion. Normally I don't go for knights and chivalrous characters unless they are played by pythons, but this song is a winner. Many of the themes from the original song are revisited, but the song definitely sounds. \\"On the field, the sword and shield amidst the din, a dying man's wails--war is waged and the battle will rage until only the righteous prevail.\\" Sheer poetry...<BR> **King of Terrors -- This song is probably the heaviest song on the disk. It sounds like a cross between Pantera, heavier stuff from Dream Theater, and maybe Thriller by Michael Jackson (Paula Abdul would have a heck of a time choreographing). It fits right in with the other tunes on the CD.<BR> **The Turning -- This assault begins with pounding double bass drums and a groovy speed metal riff. Once Russel begins singing, the music takes on a new dimension--perfectly crafted to the overall feeling evoked by the lyrics. The song is about a werewolf's changing. The description of the cursed individual's torment is awesome--picture Jekyll and Hyde. Overall, this song is probably one of the catchiest on the album.<BR> **Awakenings -- It's about the quest of a man to find his reason for living. It's a serious topic that causes many people to run the gamut of emotions, and this song reflects this phenomenon. The musical landscape ranges from delicate piano work to angst filled guitars with piano accompaniment to determined piano and guitar solos. All in all, this is my second favorite song on the disk; I love their sonic blend of soaring piano/keyboard music with thunderous guitar work.<BR> **Odyssey -- Clocking in at over 24 minutes, this piece is an expertly orchestrated masterpiece of lushly symphonic music and beautifully sung lyrics. The song is a tribute to Homer's classic epic, and it pays homage wonderfully. Even though the song lasts for almost half an hour, it seems more like several shorter songs sewn together with a silken thread of segues and musical interludes. One thing that might have added some nuance would be some haunting female vocals acting as the sirens. Nevertheless, this song is, in my opinion, every bit as good as their other opus, title track to the DWOT.<BR> In conclusion, at just $14, fans of progressive or symphonic metal can't afford not to pick this up. And for those who aren't fans of this type of music, but know someone who is--this would be a perfect gift. Quite simply, this album is arguably their best yet and fits perfectly in their volume of work. Thanks guys if you're reading this...
B00006IR5S|5.0|It's a great soundtrack! John Williams managed yet again to recapture the magic of Harry Potter by this rousing and inspirational film score. I really liked Fawkes the Phoenix, in fact it was one of the best I've heard since the Jurassic Park theme. Most of music score is similar to Philospher's Stone but there are a few certain new scores bound to capture your ears like Spiders and the Flying Car. Also, the CD includes bonus CD-ROM and collectible covers (I got Harry! :-) All in all, a wonderful effort from Wiliams and no doubt it's definitely worth a buy!
B00000295Y|4.0|Cypress Hill came with a good laid back album upon the release of Black Sunday. Although their subject matter is limited (marijuana), their lyrics are often funny and some of the beats are pretty tight. The track &quot;Insane In The Brain&quot; is an all time classic and along with a few other good tracks, is worth the price of the album. Although B-Real's voice can get annoying after repeated listens, you should do fine if you limit your listening of this album (that shouldn't be hard, it's not THAT great). Overall this album is a nice change from the typical hip hop that was being released at the time and I can't really think of any other rap act that sounds quite like these guys.
B00006DEF9|5.0|One of the greatest movie musicals of all time, is also an affectionate spoof of show business and a very enjoyable old fashioned romantic comedy. It's got a greatest hits of Freed/Brown songs throughout (with the almost plageristic Make<br />'Em Laugh turned into a classic with Donald O'Connor's tour de force performance). Kelly's great but O'Connor and Hagen are even better and then there's Cyd Charisse. c. The color, choreography, performances, pacing, were all as good as some real masters of musical film (Donen/Kelly/MGM) could do in 1952.<br />The DVD is probably as good as it possibly could be for 2002 in terms of restoration, image and sound presentation.<br />The extras are more than generous with newly recorded commentaries from several surviving contributors to the film, a 35 minute love-fest of a new documentary letting you see how those still with us look today.<br />There is also the 90 minute PBS doc from a few years back that is a keeper featuring some archive footage, out-takes and more.<br />And yes there's more !!!<br />A classic treat. What are you waiting for?<br />----Christopher J. Jarmick is the author of the mystery suspense thriller, The Glass Cocoon (with Serena F. Holder).
B00006LSM3|5.0|A little over a year ago, having fallen asleep with AM talk-radio on, I woke to the news of Harrison's death, and I remember crying off-and-on that whole day.  Granted, I should have seen it coming -- he had been battling cancer for quite some time -- but I was still devastated.  I was thrilled, however, when I heard earlier this year that my favorite Beatle would be coming out with this last album, and I knew I had to get it.  Whatever the Quiet One had left to say toward the end of his life, I knew it would be good.<br />How right was I?  Brainwashed, as George's \\"farewell,\\" is beautiful and moving, and it often rocks.  \\"Any Road\\" is one of the best songs I've heard all year, with its gently rocking melody, insistent jangle, and simple wisdom (\\"Oh Lord, we pay the price with a spin of a wheel, with a roll of a dice / Ah yeah, you pay your fare and if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there\\").  The very same could be said for \\"Looking for My Life\\" (\\"Oh boy, you've no idea what I've been through / Oh Lord, I got to get back somehow to you\\") and \\"Run So Far\\" (\\"You know that you can't get away, and you know that you can't hide it from yourself / Lonely days, blue guitar / There's no escape, can only run so far\\").  I also love \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud,\\" with its deceptively mellow melody acting as counterpoint to lyrics that reflect the desperation of a man in the throes of terminal illness, preparing himself to leave the world behind but unsure of what awaits him in the next life (\\"Never been so crazy, but I've never felt so sure / I wish I had the answer to give, don't even have the cure / Just talking to myself, crying as we part / Knowing as you leave me I also lose my heart\\").  Another favorite is the gorgeous \\"Never Get Over You,\\" George's open love-letter to his wife (and soon-to-be-widow) Olivia; I'd be hard-pressed to find a more pure expression of love and appreciation.<br />George made this record knowing that it would be his last, and while many of the songs are about coming to terms with death, Brainwashed isn't just one long bummer.  Far from it, in fact.  Lighter moments include the goofy \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii,\\" a fun cover of \\"Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,\\" the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues,\\" and the super-catchy \\"P.2. Vatican Blues\\" (his irreverent take on the Catholic church:  \\"I wish somebody would tell me that it's only a show / I'll confess, own up, let's face it in my concrete tuxedo\\").  As expected, George's spiritual side comes up plenty of times:  \\"Pisces Fish\\" (\\"I think of all the Gods and what they feel ... I got to get off of this big wheel\\"), \\"Rising Sun\\" (\\"On the avenue of sinners I have been employed ... I was almost a statistic inside a doctor's case when I heard the messenger from inner space\\"), and \\"Looking for My Life\\" deal specifically with transcendence and salvation.  \\"Brainwashed\\" hits the only sour note, but if you can get past the cliched verses (George's list of the world's ills includes our teachers and their rules, our leaders, Dow Jones, the military, the media, the press, computers, mobile phones, etc.), the \\"God God God\\" choruses chime in well with his theme of transcendence.  Songwriting aside, though, George's playing and singing are also quite strong on this disc, and his son Dhani and old pal Jeff Lynne (of ELO and the Traveling Wilburys) have done some nice work as well.  After several listens to this disc (which I bought a couple weeks ago), it has become easier to accept as not just his final will and testament, but also as his final gift to his fans.  <BR>P.S.:  This is the best solo-Beatle work I've heard since Paul McCartney's 1999 CD Run Devil Run (on which the Cute One revisited the rock 'n' roll of his youth and paid tribute to his late wife Linda), another album I strongly recommend.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|Overall, MIBII was a decent show.  But I was severely disappointed with one aspect, which really is the emphasis to me writing a review.<br />I loved, absolutely loved MIB.  However, I felt that MIB was Tommy Lee Jones's movie, and Will Smith was along for the ride.  And as much as I love Will Smith, they seem to have made MIBII his movie, and had Tommy Lee Jones along for the ride, and it just ruined it for me.<br />Perhaps the movies simply speak to two different types of people and I'm much more of a type I then I am a type II, but I enjoyed the first movie far and away better than the second.
B000075BFK|5.0|September 13th 1996 - the day Tupac Amaru Shakur Sapposedly died...a sad day for the Hip-Hop Community as a whole, so we thought. Almost 7 years after his sapposed death, another album is released, titled \\"Better Dayz\\", to make his 7th Album since his \\"death\\". This album is superb, just about his best since his \\"All Eyez on Me\\" album, and any true Tupac fan will love this album. The Nas Acoustic version of \\"Thug Mansion\\" could have been left off, but except for that, the CD is a classic Tupac \\"Makaveli\\" Shakur Album.....Do you believe in the *7* Day Theory? -\\"In the coming 7 Dayz, he will rise\\"<br />-Alias: \\"Utaks\\"
B000000HHE|4.0|Although this album is a little overrated [&quot;Best album of all time&quot; (which it is not)] It still accounts for a good listen.  Although the production is a little outdated by today's standards and it runs a little long (24 tracks), the good tracks are more common than bad ones and a lot of the tracks are funny (&quot;A Little Bit Of Soap&quot;). In an era when gangsta rap was taking over, this was a breath of fresh air from the violence. Other rap acts that were members of the anti violence movement (A Tribe Called Quest) were better in my opinion, but if you've heard their stuff and decide you like it, check this out.
0316153834|5.0|The 3rd in the bosch series is so far the best.  I rated the first two 4 stars, and am a big fan of the series, but this is the best one yet.  The different stories within the story of the concrete blond all have interesting plots and tie the story together well.  The plot twists keep you on the edge of your seat for the second have of the book.  A must read if your as fan of the series, or even a good place to start.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is the fourth release from what has been hailed as one of the most musically sound bands of our time.  Maynard's lyrics have progressed nicely on this record, and his vocal abilities are very clearly shown. From the soft and beautiful sound of &quot;parabol&quot;, to the mindnumbing fury at the end of both &quot;The grudge&quot; and &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot;.  Adam Jones' guitar playing is nothing short of genius.  His ability to come up with creative riffs that blend perfectly with the rest of the band is uncanny. Justin's bass ability is second to none.  The effects his uses on his bass in this album are amazing, his riffs are some of the catchiest and most difficult to come from any Tool album to date.  Danny Carey, completes the Tool package on this record.  His drumming ability has come along way since &quot;Opiate&quot;, and with this album he has clearly become one of the best drummers ever.  This album is full of almost trance-like music, that is then followed with hardcore endings that only tool could do.  All in all this is my pick for the best album of 2001.
0066214122|2.0|... ultimately a disappointment. When I started reading it, I couldn't put it down for an hour or so. I empathized with the narrator, and couldn't wait to see where the plot was going, and for Crichton's grand ideas. (Albeit sometimes strangely uninformed ideas - or perhaps, more likely, plot-useful fictions, e.g. the charming but scientifically hollow notion that apes can acquire language a la \\"Congo\\"; dinosaurs \\"evolving\\" useful survival traits; etc.) No matter how shaky the science behind them - and some of the science has been very shaky - his ideas are always interesting; \\"Timeline\\" was chockful of fascinating ruminations, and I expected no less here.<br />Suddenly it was over.<br />The story is short and very localized, centering on half a dozen throwaway characters. The threat starts out as seeingly insurmountable, then becomes somewhat silly in its progress. I was reminded of \\"Mount Dragon,\\" but seemingly shorter, hurried, and smaller - a \\"Mount Dragon\\" Lite. Before you know it, it's over, and you're looking at the cover binding to see if some 100-odd pages have been removed.<br />Some technical terminology (the obligatory \\"fractals\\", for one) is tossed in, but doesn't really go anywhere useful. There are a couple of huge plot holes which allow the threat into the wild. The scenario supposes a level of nano-engineering that is quite fantastical, but which, like \\"Congo's\\" talking gorilla, would be forgiveable if the story were more meaty.<br />I wouldn't even buy this one in paperback. Used even.
B00005JKZ3|4.0|I think you have go into a movie with some kind of idea what the film will be like. You can't expect more out of movie than it's intended to be. This movie is suppose to be fun and that's it. I liked MIB1 and this movie held to that standard.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The soldiers have redeemed themselves once more. The audioslave album is reminsicent of Led Zeppelin and will become a rock classic in the future. The powerful guitars lead by Tom Morello and vocals by Chris Cornell are astounding. Tim C. carrys the bottom end on bass and Brad keeps the rhythm on drums. Wonderful cd, a must for any music lover.
B00002E233|5.0|Deep Blue Sea is one hell of a movie. I don't care how much criticism this underrated film has endured. It succeeds enormously in both presenting thrilling action sequences as well as developing characters, story, and plot. It's not just a glorified video game posing as a film. <br />Firstly, the acting is top-notch. The hero and heroine, respectively, are played by indie actors Thomas Jane (Boogie Nights) and Saffron Burrows (Timecode) the latter of whom actually portrays a doctor, not just a beautiful woman impersonating one (where are you Denise Richards, ahem, The World Is Not Enough...). Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, and Stellan Skarsgard leave lasting impresssions too as the crew members fending off hungry sharks on a floating research base. LL Cool J in particular has a charismatic and convincing screen presence. <br />Not only is this film supported by a talented cast, but Deep Blue Sea also avoids cliche of horror/action flicks. The script successful ommitts any trace of romance among characters, or a villainous human character trying to con the rest of the group, and literally, you have no idea who will make it to the end...it's that unexpected. <br />In turn, the Jaws influence is relatively non-existent. For a movie titled \\"Deep Blue Sea,\\" the action director Renny Harlin generates is original. I never knew action filmmaking could be this inventive until I saw Deep Blue Sea.<br />If people can sit and call trash like \\"XXX\\" \\"guilty fun\\" than most intelligent thinking people won't have a problem with calling an entertaining, well-helmed movie like Deep Blue Sea real genuine fun. A thrilling foray into the action genre.
B000003CMB|5.0|This is an excellent album/CD.  It is 1970s rock at its best.  Lots of background noise but anytime you have a &quot;live&quot; recording, that is expected.

0345448898|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever read.  It's got adventure, action, romance, and it's also VERY deep.  What more can you ask for?  Yes, it's a little on the dark side and its contents can be controversial as it questions the existence of the God most people associate with.  But just because that some people will not agree with the beliefs presented in the story does not mean it's low trash.  Sometimes controversy is a sign of something great.  Pullman's writing just pulls you into this other universe and it's just impossible to forget the characters and what happens to them.  It's definitely something more people should read and keep.  This is not a library book that you can check out, read, and return... You'll want to keep this for as long as you live.  Amazing.
B000021YQV|5.0|...this album by System of a down is a treasure that pops around only very seldomly. Other albums are Korn's self titled, Nirvana's nevermind, smashing pumpkin's mellon collie and the infinite sadness. Toxicity is another.<br />This album has none of that \\"i hate myself and the world\\" [stuff] in it. this is pure political upheaval. \\"free armenia\\" are some of the issues in this cd.<br />now the music, System of a down's music is very very memorable, the riffs are simple yet very promising and hard-hitting. And each song had some very cool and interesting solo or bridge that extends the song to becoming a masterpiece. now the best way to review a cd is by rating each song and i will do that now<br />1, prison song- good start (but i wanted more) then really picks up and finishes brilliantly 9/10<br />2, needles - i hate the annoying sitar souding intro, but after that 5 secs the song is so good. its about drugs and has a really good bridge where the guitarist starts to sing. 9.5/10<br />3, Deer Dance- now this is one of my favourite,should be put as a single. i love the bridge, it so mellow from the hard riffs at the start. 10/10<br />4, Jet Pilot 5,X  ok songs, not outstanding in anyway, but good enough 7.5/10<br />6, Chop suey- definately the best song on this album, very heavy with a very nice finish, i love the lyrics 11/10<br />7, bounce - [bad], the music is repetive, and ht elyrics dont fit this albums theme, if you want the meaning find it in some fan site. not political at all 3/10<br />8, forest- longish song, the riffs sound slightly too docile and like some heavy version of some music i heard in one of my little sister's animated videos. gets a bit repetitive 7.5/10<br />9, ATWA- now this is something, very memorable and has a very good finish. Its about Charles Manson, yeh you remember him, that pschotic killer  9/10<br />10, science  11, shimmy  these are great songs but better if they are live, problem is they are inbetween to fantastic songs 8.5/10<br />12, toxicity - title track, the best song to define system of a down by. Just shows their song writing skill, got to love the short solo in this song 10/10<br />13, psycho- gee thanks serj, i'm your fan yet you call me a cocain taking, psycho groupie. A bad song that insults the listener. music-wise its ordinary, yet such a beautiful solo. 6/10 (saved by the solo, otherwise 2/10)<br />14, Aerials - the end of such a great album.

B000002GYW|4.0|Very good early Eagles album. The songs \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" and \\"Desperado\\" helped make them superstars. Some of the other songs on this album were \\"kinda iffy\\".  They are good but you won't find yourself singing them in the shower.
B000002NC4|4.0|I've lost this CD a while back, but I bought it here so might as well review it :P  Some great work from this band, although I've read that it isn't reflective of their usual work.  Long, intricate songs that seem to inhabit your mind.  My personal favorites are &quot;Randy Described Eternity,&quot; with its slow build-up, and the darkness of &quot;I Would Hurt a Fly,&quot; a strangely sinister song to come from a guy with such a usually warm voice.  Proof that they were capable of varying moods to a wide degree.  Though it's been a while since I've listened last, I still remember it being a fairly good record.  &quot;Keep It Like a Secret,&quot; to me however, seemed a little more concise and better-flowing.
B000002TQV|5.0|yes i agree with syaing that the bends is (possibly) my favorite radiohead album, however it does not by any means define who radiohead is.  though thom is the front man and amazing, there are 4 more sides to this outstanding band, i mean with out a doubt jonny is one of the greatest musicians out there, phil's drum lines are incredibly out of the beaten path (stick the pun up your...)  his drums do not line any of the songs as done with other bands (not including the flaming lips new concept album which isn't perfected but has spun them in a great direction). Idioteque is by far better live than studio due to Phils tribal and almost out of sych beat, emotions run really high on the bends, but the same goes with pablo honey which most people forget about, the lyrics, however, don't really compare to ok computer, which was also a turning point to there music, experimental sounds were found during the bends era, but on b-sides, in fact i think alot of those b-sides could have replaced the tracks on the album, some of them, i.e. permanent daylight, the trickster, punchdrunk lovesick singalong, not lewis mistreated.  and for the emotion reference to ok computer, the b-sides on that album, true love waits (not really a bside but from that era) how i made my millions, so any way to be frank, don't let one album define radiohead nor let only one member be the icon,  the essence of a band is through their live performances, and by the way Kid A is chalk full of emotion, nearly a concept album chapter two being of course amnesiac, sallinger isn't defined by the catcher in the rye or nine stories or franny or anything else they are just books artist presentation,  brad pitt said once that radiohead is the kafka of our generation, i agree on the direction of that statement but not its fundlemental conception.  radiohead is not pink floyd, for they past them a while ago.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I love this album. I'm not a huge Beck fan.. The last songs I remember listening to were in the 90's (where it's at, loser,... ). I definitely enjoy those but they're not really of the genre that I listen to regularly.<br />I heard songs from this album on the plane recently (while half asleep) and couldn't figure out who they were by at first because I just assumed it couldn't be Beck.<br />This is definitely a very chill, laid back album. Good rainy-weather music.
B000002GXX|5.0|This is my second favorite Eagle albums. The songs \\"One of These Nights\\", \\"Lyin Eyes\\", and \\"Take It To The Limit\\" are done in the style of the real Eagles.  These songs are the highlight of this album. When the Eagles got back together and went on tour during 2002, the song \\"One of These Nights\\" was a crowd favorite. The Eagles tried to get their music of that tour to sound like a studio recording. Their talents really shone. This is another great Eagle albums.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Funny how they mark it as having EXPLICIT LYRICS.  Only things obscene about it are the little sampled bits before and after &quot;Silverf__k,&quot; that you can't even hear that well anyway.  Strange what they consider obscene.<br />Anyway, I've never reviewed one of my very favorite albums before, and I probably won't say much that hasn't already been said, but bear with me...<br />This is truly one of the four best albums of the 90's in my opinion (though two of those are REM albums so that shouldn't really count).  It's one of those albums that became part of the soundtrack to my life, and many memories, good and bad, are tied to it.  Despite its chaos and abrassiveness, it manages to soothe me at the same time with its evocations of times past.  Nostalgic in the most beautiful way (Am i getting old??).<br />Surely no one has created a similar guitar sound since.  This is pure ear-enveloping white noise, the kind you could only hear with My Bloody Valentine and a couple of other bands I'm sure exist but I'm not knowledgable of.  It isn't really a evolution of the grunge sound; more accurately it forges its own sound from expertly timed and brilliant drumming, subtle bass lines (although the bass does get swallowed in the guitar most times), and over all the chaos literally a wall of fuzzy distortion, which literally pummels you.  Despite a couple of acoustic nods, the album is a powerful, raw experience, one to make you wish bands rocked like this nowadays.  Trail of Dead is the closest, to my personal knowledge.<br />Then there's Corgan's voice.  Forget everything you've heard about his intolerable whine.  He's never been much more annoying than Bob Dylan (save Machina) anyway, but here his voice takes on an almost angelic quality, &quot;melloncollie&quot; (haha) and enraged all at once.  The tone and pitch changes he does throughout this record always seem perfectly timed, fitting with the music esquisitely. He never seems too angsty or forced, as he almost always would later on.  It's the sound of a heart breaking, pure emotion, the eptiome of sincerity.<br />Tracks, you say?  They're all basically perfect, and each has its place on this record.  It flows as one whole, though it's not &quot;really&quot; a concept album (the whole angels and old 18th century moon and star imagery in the liner notes and space imagery in the lyrics is, I guess, sort of concept-like).  If I had to make any specific mentions, &quot;Soma&quot; always breaks my heart, though now that I've listened to it closer it seems more ironically sad.  &quot;Hummer&quot; and &quot;Mayionaise&quot; are both swelling, life-affirming epics.  &quot;Silverf__k&quot; is an amazing swirl of noise.  Eh...they're all great!  Trust me!<br />This record was birthed out of difficult conditions, and it was truly an honest creation from this band.  It's almost spiritual in a way.  Like the classic cover of the two girls dressed in angel costumes.  Down to earth and ephemeral at the same time.  They couldn't possibly construst something this masterful ever again.  Wonderous.
B000002J23|4.0|This 1980 disc by the prog-rock veterans was the only release they recorded without vocalist Jon Anderson. But don't despair Trevor Horn (The Buggles) does an outstanding job filling Anderson shoes. This also is one of many recordings they did without keyboard wizard Rick Wakeman. He is replaced by Horn's bandmate in the Buggles and future Asia keyboardist Geoff Downes, who also does a commendable job.<BR>I think that the remaining Yes members without Anderson, decided that they could spread their wings and go for a harder sound and it's evident on Drama.<BR>Steve Howe's guitar playing is much more agressive as is bassist Chris Squires. It is some of their best work in Yes.<BR>I really liked the opening track &quot;Machine Messiah&quot; a three part, ten minute and half minute opus. I also liked &quot;Into the Lens&quot; and &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;. <BR>It may have dissapointed the hard-core Yes fans but I liked it. Check it out.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm not a fan of pop , Rap, or R&B music, in fact I loathe all three but this CD has some geniunely great songs on it. The lyrics are very deep and insightful and the melodies are very good. On this album Christina's not fake or spouting bubblegum bull like most of the other artists out right now. I highly recommend it.
6302878527|5.0|most anyone who enjoys older movies enjoys stanley donen, whether they realize it or not.  this is the man who brought us singin' in the rain, seven brides for seven brothers, and funny face, after all.  and his turns directing non-musicals are equally impressive - just watch charade.<br />audrey hepburn, of course, needs no introduction.<br />why then this movie -the last of three the two made together- is so often overlooked is beyond me.  this poingant, wildly inventive look at marriage has been cited by many as hepburn's best performance.  it is possibly even donen's best film, of a repitoire which is hard to beat.  it is simply a fantastic movie.<br />in short... go watch two for the road!
038533348X|2.0|To be honest, I was left with a strong feeling of distaste after having finished Cat's Cradle. First, there's the book's rather blunt ridicule of science. In Cat's Cradle, science is represented by two characters - Dr. Hoenikker, inventor of the atomic bomb and all-around genius, and a fellow scientist whom the protagonist goes to interview some years after Hoenikker's death. The latter is basically an overbearing pompous ass and veritably invites the reader's contempt, especially given his praise of the former. The former is portrayed as a completely delusional psychopath to whom nothing exists besides research; his complete lack of contact with reality or with anything outside of his laboratory leads to the death of his wife and the severe maladjustment of his children, and aside from the other scientist, the whole town still hates him even years after his death. <br />Hey, Vonnegut, you don't think you're being a bit too hard on scientists there, man? I mean, certainly, given the premise of science being irresponsible, deluded and in many ways blind and repugnant, like Hoenikker, then Vonnegut's \\"parable\\" about \\"over-reliance on science\\" makes perfect sense. But the entire premise is completely intellectually dishonest. There have been, believe it or not, works that have examined the same problem, in the same way of looking at the life of one scientist who is too wrapped up in his work to notice other aspects of life. The film Nine Days Of One Year immediately occurs to me as an example. But that film, though it reached a conclusion similar to Vonnegut's - that, the search for truth aside, one must not forget certain other important things in life - was far more honest about its subjects, acknowledging that they were more than just garish caricatures, and was all the more thought-provoking and powerful as a result. In comparison, Vonnegut's portrayal of science (which, in the book, is always greatly and deliberately praised by the most vacuous and unlikeable characters) is just ham-fisted and crude. Essentially, it proves a point about something that has no basis in reality in the first place.<br />But that flaw, I suppose, would be forgivable. It's not uncommon for artists to oversimplify this issue, and it doesn't mean that the end result can't be good. The real problem I had with Cat's Cradle was the grotesque and very forced \\"comedy.\\" Actually, to be more accurate, it was the way Vonnegut turned _everything_ into grotesque and very forced \\"comedy,\\" and expected me to laugh at it. The prime example of this is that bit where Newt, Hoenikker's midget son, falls in love with a beautiful young circus freak who turns out to be a Russian spy and, moreover, twice as old as Newt. How does that sound to you? To me, it sounds like some gag made on some bad \\"cult comedy entertainment show,\\" and it was genuinely painful to read. Yes, yes, yes, plenty of great literature contains scenes in which characters suffer painful humiliation - but _this_ scene made me feel, very uncomfortably, that Vonnegut _himself_ was actively getting off on inflicting this sort of mean-spirited, artless tripe on his characters. And then there was that bit with Frank Hoenikker, the missing son who suddenly became second-in-command in a small island dictatorship, when he suddenly tells the protagonist where and why he had been secretively running about throughout his youth. Which would've been possible to ignore, if not for the exposition, in which we view him as a talented, creative human being and are told what he _really_ spent his time doing. Why did the author ever bother characterizing him if he was just going to turn it into another hideous caricature with no depth later on? Why am I supposed to laugh at people being abased for no reason? Oh, wait, I get it. It's supposed to prove some kind of facile \\"point\\" about how \\"life is really one big joke!\\" Insightful.<br />I could say more. I could talk about the utterly awful \\"Calypsos,\\" about the way Vonnegut bludgeons the reader with his overwrought message, about that silly religious terminology, and about other things. But that's all secondary. The science fiction element is original, and Vonnegut's an inventive and imaginative author, but this book simply left a bad taste in my mouth.
B000002GVO|5.0|Although some people will argue with this, I think this is the best album that the Eagles ever produced. The addition of Joe Walsh on guitar really gave the Eagles a sound that they had been looking for. Most of the songs on this album have made it to the greatest hits albums and they include \\"Hotel California\\", \\"New Kid in Town\\", \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\", \\"Wasted Time\\", \\"Victim of Love\\", and \\"Try to Love Again\\".  If you haven't heard these songs on the Classic Rock radio station that you listen to, it is time to find another station. This could be the best album of all time.  Yes, Michael Jackson, look out.<br />I can only describe this album with one word. Superb!

0736041850|5.0|I buy lots of fitness and strength training books, and this one is by far the best I've purchased. The book may look small, but it provides an extensive listing of exercises and includes tips about variations that will change how you work each muscle. This is important for a couple of reasons.<br />To maximize your gains in the gym, you have to constantly change your program so that your body doesn't hit a plateau. Regularly incorporating new exercises will also keep you from becoming bored with your workout. This book will show you how using a rope attachment with the pulley works a different part of the triceps as opposed to doing bench dips or doing a kickback. Also, the illustrations show you the auxiliary muscles that are recruited during compound movements like presses and deadlifts.<br />At first I was worried that the book might be too much for me to absorb, but it's not because the author does not get overly-technical with the explanations. The text is concise, yet thorough, and the pictures are highly detailed.<br />This is a wonderful reference book, and I highly recommend it.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Ok.  I am a DIE-HARD anti pop-tart-er. No Britney for me.      No Kylie Minogue. And NO Christina.  I classified her along with those OTHER ones.  Then my mom accidentally got the new \\"Stripped\\".  And she MADE me listen to it.  That was about 4 hours ago, and i have been playing it over and over.  If you think that she's just a cute little thing that's decided to change her image by removing clothing items, you are wrong.  This album is a must have.  There are a wide range of styles in  songs, her vocal range is definitely showcased, which is truly awesome no matter what you think of her music, and best of all, it proves she is a true talent because she writes the majority of the songs this time.  I heard once that when she started, the producers of her first album wouldn't let her really cut loose in her vocals; well she proves that they were wrong in trying to hold her back.  She has an amazing voice and i have to admit, I am suprisingly impressed.  I will be spending my own money on this one.  You should too.
006100166X|4.0|This is a great story. It's light-hearted and full of fun, but has its serious side and some truly touching moments as well.<BR>Sherry (Viscount Sheringham) has just has his proposal of marriage spurned by the Incomparable Isabella. Further put out of temper by his dreadful mother and uncle, he storms back to London, vowing to marry the first woman he sees. That happens to be Hero, a sixteen-year-old orphaned neighbour who has been devoted to him ever since they were children. Both are happy with his plan, Sherry because it will put him in control of his fortune and Hero because it gives her an escape from the tyranny of the cousins she lives with. But Sherry, who is both wild and irresponsible, does not find it as easy to have a wife as he thought it would be, while Hero, who was never trained for the position she now holds, finds herself falling into one disaster after another. She finds her position growing ever more difficult, especially when she comes to realise that she loves Sherry, but he does not seem to love her. When yet another social faux pas seems like the final straw for her and Sherry's marriage, she takes desperate action that might save the day . . . or will it?<BR>Sherry and Hero are great characters, and make a lovely couple. Both are kind-hearted, irresponsible, hedonistic and hot-tempered. I also love this book for Sherry's friends. Gil is the token sensible person, Ferdy is well-mannered but thick, and George is a highly romantic figure, desperately in love with Isabella and forever trying to pick fights. The back-and-forth between Hero, Isabella, and Sherry and his friends is what really makes this book. Heyer displays her talent for comedy and for choosing exactly the right word to perfection.<BR>Does everything turn out well in the end? Of course it does - but not in the way you might expect. Keep an eye out for the pickpocket turned groom.

6304884419|5.0|This was a great film by Robert De Niro in describing the rites of passage in The Belmont scetion of the Bronx in The 1960's. Chatz Palminteri and De Niro have a unlikely common interest, keeping Cologero out of trouble. It shows the racial hostility that was part of Bronx life back then and how the Mafia operated on the local level.
B000000W6R|5.0|I know one thing about this cd, and that's that it's there best one, then Gish, then Mellon Collie, the Siamese.  I know it's good cause i've been listening to it since '96.  I think the song that i like the most on it is Whir.  I just love how acoustic it is or atleast the way Corgan did it.  Only one other acoustic song i think compares and thats Cherub Rock on Vieuphoria or Earphoria, which ever way you hear it, and its a pumpkins song too.  But just cause Whir is the best on there, doesnt mean that nothing compares.  I mean, youve got soothe, frail and bedazzled, plume, la dolly vita, obscured, hello kitty kat, blue, blew away, landslide (which i think is much better than the original), pissant, starla, spaced, and girl called sandoz.  I know thats the whole album, but take a hint, plus i think they all deserved to be named.  Also, i dont like whir just cause its slow and thats all i like is slow songs, cause my fav's from the others are XYU, geek u.s.a., bury me and others.  But like i said, 5 stars isnt enough to rate this album by any means.  One thing i think is pretty funny, is how billy wrote girl called sandoz after he met some chick at a party.  Nothin against the song, but how would you like to have a song like that be inspired by you?
0066214122|4.0|And that's not to say the President can only handle these types of books. I mean hey, some people would be surprised if he were this advanced. Personally, I think he's a Tom Clancy kind of guy, and given that he has the power to make those plots into reality, I don't blame him. <br />Me? Well, I prefer lounging in front of some more solid fare. Take Mr Willy's House of Pancakes for instance.  In that book, Mr. Willy decides to sell the House of Pancakes to a major developer. <br />If that's not what you're after, then maybe you should just compromise and read Prey. Now, strictly speaking, it's not a novel because a novel is a book written by authors who are writing for their own personal enjoyment, in the small hope others may enjoy their work. Mike stopped doing that before he started writing. <br />That makes this drivel. <br />Speaking of drivel, how many of you have been to Toronto recently? I know it's not the world's most exciting city, but few people realize that it the fourth largest city in North America. Bigger then Chicago. Plus, I live here. And dude, that says something where I come from. <br />So seriously, you're welcome to stay with me. I could show you around, and if you like the place, heck, come and live here. Of course, you'll have to put up with insufferable Canadians who are about as arrogant as they are small minded, but that's OK, they're also meek and easily side-lined. <br />At the end of the day though dude, it's all about ganja and relaxing enough to realize that the little things in life take up too much of our time. Words to live by man.

B00007E8V4|5.0|The new System Of a Down cd is there 3rd main CD. It was released in late November without much publicity.  Songs like &quot;Chik 'n' Stu&quot; are strange but good and make you think.  Roulette and Streamline are a little calmer than usual but have a rock edge. It's definitely a change from toxicity and you can see the band growing and creating a new style but keeping with the same theme.  I think that all the songs have a message and Serj is probably the only one that can fully explain them.    Get the CD its worth it, all of their CD's are.

B000002HEP|5.0|Kyuss - Welcome to Sky Valley<br />Kyuss's legend often precedes it's name. The band that was plucked from the desert by Atlantic in the early 90s out of relative obscurity, thrown on tour with Metallica and dropped three years later after they failed to catch on with the mainstream, only to spawn an entire genre and become one of the most influential band of the 90s posthumously. An interesting story, but the fact of the matter remains that Kyuss made some great music.  With Blues to the Red sun they established what would become known as \\"stoner rock\\": sludgy, sabbath influenced riffage and trippiness with enough desert punk groove to make them unique. The followup, Welcome to Sky Valley, improved upon that formula and more. Definitely one of the best albums from that era...<br />1. Gardenia - 10/10 - Opening with a pulsing, orgasmic intro, Gardenia throbs with an intense stoner vibe and serves as a fine primer for the monster that was Kyuss.... deep grooving bass, downtuned and spacey guitar lines, and death rattle from hell drumming, all set to a laid back desert vibe. Sky Valley sounds as if it were recorded in an open atmosphere as a jam session rather than in the studio. You can almost feel the arid air across your face... Gardenia is classic.<br />2. Asteroid - 9/10 - This a mescaline trip put in musical context. The image I have in my mind is of moonlit deserts and talking coyotes, etc. Monster riff, and tons of trippy effects thrown in for the stoners to appreciate. One of my favorite instrumentals ever.<br />3. Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop - 8/10 - This is where John Garcias vocals have a chance to shine. He's definitely one of the best rock singers around, check out Unida if you don't believe me... Supa Scoopa picks up the pace a little... Josh Homme's Stooges influence is all over this song. The false endings are a nice touch and have scared the s**t out of me many a time!<br />4. 100 Degrees - 10/10 - Track 2 (side 2, whatever) is the real classic on here, each song being better than the last. 100 Degrees is raw energy in the tradition of Green Machine (blues for the red sun), the kind of song you can drive fast too. <br />5. Space Cadet - 10/10 - This song amazes me every time. Totally a camp fire jam, though most campfire musicians lack the bass skills of one Scott Reeder.... the bassline is one of the best ever. You can't help but drift away during the solo, also one of my favorites.<br />6. Demon Cleaner - 10/10 - The first Kyuss song I ever heard, on Muchmusic's Loud show.. then I fell in love with the Tool cover. Opens with an amazing drum beat, then the sparse bassline, then in comes that trademark fuzzed out guitar line... perfection. I would say Demon Cleaner is Sky Valley's trademark song, and you can really hear the influence they had on the afforemention Tool and many other bands of a similar ilk.<br />7. Odyssey - 9/10 - Another slower Gardenia styled track, except maybe not as spacey. <br />8. Conan Troutman - 8/10 - Fast song with an AMAZING vocal performance by Mr. Garcia, you have to love how he hits those high notes that would kill a lesser throat.<br />9. N.O. - 7/10 - This one's total Sabbath worship and probably my least favorite on the album, which ain't much considering how much this cd rules.<br />10. Whitewater - 10/10 - Another incredible track to close things off. The bassline is incredible and the 4 minute closing jam is a perfect way to bookend a basically perfect record. This is where you put the bong back to it's respective holder and grab a bag full of cheetos. And need I mention the masterpiece bonus track \\"Lick My Doo\\"? Thought not.<br />So if you're still reading this, click the buy button on amazon or try to track it down at your local cd store. No hard rock or metal fan's collection is complete without this CD!
B00005MP58|5.0|I wish that my English teacher would've had a copy of this when we studied this book!  There are so many things than a director can do to convey meanings and feelings that one can only imagine in a text.  This version is VERY well done, and I think it would be enjoyable even for today's students to watch.
B000062Y98|4.0|i tend to like death/black metal more than most progressive/power metal bands. There are many high points but they are equaled by negative ones. The band is very ambitious and very different. I like the guitarists work (very technical) a lot but this is metal, i want to hear a bass... I also wish the singer had some balls and did more than operatic vocals. I like that hes doing something original but im not trying to listen to a broadway production. I do like the vocals better than the guy from dream theaters (although each band is very different). If you like to experiment or like showtunes with metal/medivial influences then you should purchase this album.
B00006RINF|5.0|When I read the reviews for Comalies I thought I had to have it.  I was surprised listening to it, it was even better than I thought.

A great piece for anyone with a good musical taste.
B00006F7S4|3.0|I've never listened to Beck amazingly but I've heard mixed feelings from lots of people on this CD and loving controversy like I do, I decided to grab this one up and see what all the fuss is really about.  I'm throughly impressed with the acoustic sounds of this album but also the deep lyrics.  I can see how many see this CD as just depressing by the tone of the music and the lyrics as well but onto the CD itself.  \\"The Golden Age\\" tackles that feeling we all have sometimes, that we can see it all and it's almost like we don't want to try to go to that source...top song to start the album with.  \\"Paper Tiger\\" is an okay song but not one of my favs at this point, dealing with fragility and strength at the same time.  \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" is a song I can really identify with from the past year, about longing of the heart and just missing someone that is now gone, relationship or otherwise.  \\"Lonesome Tears\\" is probably one of the deepest lyrical songs on the entire album, asking why love makes one so very lonely to the point it matters but also doesn't at the same time, and coupled with the rhythm makes this song so haunting and strong.  \\"Lost Cause\\" actually isn't as depressing at it seems on the first listen...it's actually letting go of someone who isn't right for a relationship and who actually exposes themselves as horrid.  \\"End of the Day\\" is an okay song but doesn't really have any distinguishing facts...sort of mediocre in the sense of the word.  \\"It's All In Your Mind\\" is about someone being dillusional but more than that...the person is so frightened and sheltered within that no one can get close, even as a friend.  \\"Round the Bend\\" starts of beautifully with light guitar strumming but also the background sound that's almost like wind...however, the song itself is pretty deep and not actually depressing by basically saying letting go to everything and enjoying the moment, escaping from it all to a safe haven where no one can see (for more than one reasonof course).  \\"Already Dead\\" seems depressing on first listen but it's also watching something that once controlled dying in view, thus a piece dying but giving way to something new.  \\"Sunday Sun\\" is almost too U2 for my tastes (not a huge fan of U2) and this song almost seems disjointed to an extent.  \\"Little One\\" is actually a really good lullaby and not that depressing at all...it dispels all fears and encourages dreaming as life continues on.  \\"Side of the Road\\" ends off the album is an okay song but actually doesn't end off the album well at all...it would have been better placed up higher in the track listing but it's not too bad but almost reminds me too much of  \\"Sunday Sun\\" for some reason.  All together, this album is actually quite good...it might seem dark and depressing to the core but a further listening might just show there is more happiness to this album than seems apparent or possible.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is my all-time favorite American Recordings CD. I just love this CD, and there's not much more to say other than everyone should pick this up! I've yet to encounter anyone I know who doesn't love it.
B00006LSM3|5.0|From the very beginning of this CD to the end, George's spirit looms.  He knew he was dying when he recorded it, and he comes to terms with that throughout the album, even though to Harrison, there was no life or death, no beginning, and no end. On that note, there's a reading from \\"How to know God\\"(The yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali) at the end of one song: \\"The soul doesn't exist...it is existence\\". The album sounds variously like Dylan, who recently covered one of the songs from this CD at his own show, stating \\"He was such a good friend\\", and Tom Petty(another good friend), but most of all, it's classic George Harrison in every sense of the word.<BR>The CD is at once subtle, yet intense, and maintains a killer groove throughout.  It's unfortunate that he couldn't take these songs on the road, because, while they're complete, each of them has huge potential to be expanded on live.  Maybe if we're all lucky, Jeff Lynne and Dhani will take them on the road and give them the proper workout they deserve.  This CD is truly one of the best of 2002, and should be a cornerstone in any decent collection.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|WHY DID THEY BREAK UP?! I LOVE THESE GUYS! I HAVE THEIR NAME TATTOOED ON MY BUTTOCK (not really). I LOVE THIS ALBUM! I cannot begin to explain all the passion that is put into this album. The stars above are not enough to express the extreme cult love I have towards these fellas. DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE INTO NEVER HEARING THIS ALBUM! If I had 5 albums to keep me for the rest of my life: this would be one of them. NO JOKE! If you pass this album up; it's like missing the Yellow Submarine by The Beatles, or not ever seeing Star Wars (ok; so that movie wasn't that great: but still you had to see it because everybody else did). This album undoubtedly tells a story, and you may take from it what you will, but it has seriously enlightened my outlook on life. LONG LIVE ATDI!...
B00005QZWI|3.0|The music composed is great, but you can tell they are withholding more important tracks so we will pay them more money later on for a more decent set. You won't get the distinct track FOTR actually opened with, what we do have is a lot of tracks that sound different at the beginning and quickly turn back into a repetitive clank, which is nice at first, but there should have been more melody and variety, the first track should have made it on here before all the noise! It really should have been at least a 2-disc set. The 'Enhanced' part of the disc is mostly worthless promo material and just annoying, but does include some short interviews. The first ten or so tracks start out unique, then quickly move into clanking, loud repetitive territory, after that there is a lot more melody and emotion in the music until the CD stops. Do not buy the SE version, you'll be robbed. There is no excuse for the ripoff that is this disc however, consumers/fans deserve better than this. However, this is all we have to choose from (right now, anyway) so it is better than nothing and most of the included music is great and you'll likely play it over and over. The good news (I guess) is that THE TWO TOWERS sounds just like this score, only poorly remixed, so we are getting some left out tracks on that CD.
B000000993|5.0|I'm not gonna bother to write much because I believe this album gets all the respect in it's reviews. It's one of the tightest albums of all time. Keep in mind though that this is not a every song is 3 minute long single album: this is a movie: a spiritual experience if you will. I reccomend listening to it on a cold foggy day or night, with some incence with the smell of salt water to set the feel just right: that will give you an attachement to it. Also; in case you guys haven't noticed the \\"secret\\" cow picture: it's underneath the back black casing that holds the cd. Also; Adam's artwork is just as big a factor as the music: hold the rib-cage up to the light to see the fat naked porno-star (yes she's a porno star). Also this is Paul D'Amour's last album with Tool: he is now producing albums (Spikey: the bassist): the last input I saw on him was producing the Murder City Devils (A great band) album Thelma. Check them out too. Jesus loves ya baybay: he eats babies too.
0142002038|5.0|This is my favorite James Bond novel. Ian Fleming created a character with a gargantuan appetite for the more worldly pleasures. For a land that could supply our hero with such an appetite Fleming chose his own beloved Jamaica. The melding of the story with the setting is Fleming at his best. Jamaica was a land of beauty, mystery and intrigue. Fleming captured this so well and gave us a remarkable villain to reflect that esoteric quality of the island.
B00005ASIL|5.0|Does anyone know if this album has the different version of &quot;Bouree&quot; with the extended bass solo?  Thanks!
B00000292K|4.0|As a musician this was a very brave attempt for Miles. He totally abadoned the sound of his previous 70's efforts and came up with this &quot;way out&quot; sound for &quot;On The Corner&quot;. Being a musician myself I can definitely understand this direction. This is what I call a &quot;listening album&quot;. You can't just put this on in the background and let it play unnoticed. I've disected this album many times and still find it more amazing every time I listen to it. It is, in fact, only two pieces of music but each part is different, whether it be a different percussion sound or different guitar sound at a particular time during the piece. Though this album has little Miles Davis horn playing on it the rest of the musicians on the album show that they are very much there and into the new Miles Davis direction. Again, as you read in a previous entry, THIS IS NOT a good Intoduction To Miles Davis album. But once you get to know Miles Davis' music as a whole you'll very much enjoy &quot;listening&quot; to this album from a musicians stand point.
0767817648|5.0|Simply put, this a great movie! Roy Scheider and Daniel Stern give wonderful performances, and the helicopter chase scenes are unbeleivable! This was one of the first DVDs I bought, and I only wish there were more extras on the disc.
B00007E8V4|4.0|Wow. 16 songs yet it doesn't quite span 45 minutes. Sometimes it's nice to hear a song that isn't 6 minutes long (cough, Tool). None of the songs are groundbreaking, except for Roulette which is totally different from anything they've done before. Right now Innervision is their single but I can bet Roulette will be the second. Or so I hope. Not one song is bad. Before the CD came out I heard they'd put most of their soundtrack songs and covers on here. They only put Streamline on the CD. Where's marmalade, storaged, johnny, the metro (berlin cover), or snowblind (sabbath cover)? All in all a very good CD but if you have already downloaded all the songs skip it.
B00005OAIE|1.0|This guy sounds as if he's never learned how to enunciate ANYTHING.  He swallows vowels, consonants, and any life that might be in his &quot;music&quot;.  He's definitely not brilliant, nor do I understand how people could possibly listen to the entire CD, much less appreciate it.<br />There is some promise in his guitar playing, if only he'd keep his mouth shut while he was doing it, we'd all be better off.<br />Save your money for something a little more moving.  You'll thank me for it.
B00005NDEN|5.0|Originally released late 1974, in Japan by Elektra/Warner Pioneer, reissued by Toshiba-EMI.  The tour for this LP in Japan gave Queen fan-demonium of Beatlemania-sized proportions!
