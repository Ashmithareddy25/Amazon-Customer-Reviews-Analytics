B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am about halfway through the first book on my Kindle Touch.  I did have to change the font size and spacing, but once I did that it is just as normal as any other book I've read.  I don't see what the big deal is!  And I have noticed exactly one typo so far and that is all.<br /><br />Nothing more to say that hasn't been said already.  The story is brilliant!  Highly recommend!
0740745271|1.0|A few things in the book I like, such as palming.<br /><br />The magic eye 3-D pictures-staring into space before or beyond 2 objects to make them merge into a 3rd picture can CAUSE strabismus, crossed, wandering eyes, and double vision. I and a friend developed this condition from using the magic eye 3-D exercise, activity. The magic eye exercises produce tension, strain, incorrect use of the eyes, abnormal brain function with the eyes and a type of artificial 3-D. It does not produce completely true 3-D as the normal eye sees when looking normally, directly at a object, relaxed, with clear vision.<br /><br />A small imperceptible or increased amount of strabismus in the eyes from neck, head tension, injury from accidents, computer work, playing 3-D video games, unbalanced clarity in the left and right eyes or other causes can result in full blow strabismus, double vision when the magic eye activity is practiced. I know this from experience.<br /><br />In extreme cases, certain artificial 3-D exercises can help correct strabismus but it must be done by a ophthalmologist, in person office visits because each person, condition is different and specific ways to do the exercises and 'only certain exercises are used for each individual case'. My friend that was injured by doing these exercises was cured by using the Bates Method and also by an ophthalmologist that taught him how to do only specific 3-D exercises for his condition. A lady at the post office said her grand daughter was cured in this way by an ophthalmologist. I am not totally against this method but do know it can be done wrong and usually is when tried on your own, from a book.<br /><br />The Bates Method, a true natural cure is the safe way to correct strabismus and unclear vision. It does not consist of the magic eye, artificial 3-D pictures, exercises. Some eye doctors teach it. It cured my double vision, slow left eye movement caused by the magic eye, artificial 3-D exercises. I also had a neck injury but experienced double vision from magic eye 3-D before the injury. After the injury, the magic eye exercise brought the double vision back in increased amount with impaired eye movement. Many eye doctors are warning patients about this.<br /><br />Here's more explanation;<br /><br />Warnings, Descriptions For Artificial 3-D Fusion Autostereograms, Magic Eyes Pictures;<br />I do not teach, advise Artificial 3-D Fusion Eye Exercises, `Autostereograms, Magic Eyes pictures'. It can cause strabismus, impair the eyes convergence, divergence, accommodation, un-accommodation, the eye muscles and eyes movement and cause crossed, wandering eyes, double vision, astigmatism, blur in normal eyes and more so if there is a slight or advanced strabismus or other eye, medical problem, imbalance of the brain hemispheres or other brain functions, neck injury, tension, mis-aligned skull bones, other conditions. The Artificial 3-D exercises can make a slight strabismus condition worse. It causes strain, tension, stress and confusion in the brain, eyes, retina and eye muscles. It is not the Bates Method.<br />  Artificial 3-D Fusion exercises are not necessary to obtain clear vision, normal eye movement. It was not taught by Ophthalmologist Bates. The Bates Method alone can cure strabismus; there are plenty of other activities, methods with true fusion, 3-D practices to gain clear, balanced vision, coordinated eye movement in Dr. Bates book, magazine. Dr. Bates and modern Bates Method Natural Eyesight teachers teach different activities, natural ones with true 3-D (3-Dimensional, depth, distance... perception) vision for correcting crossed, wandering eyes `strabismus' and amblyopia, unclear vision.<br />  Artificial 3-D example; looking at a pen placed between and before  2 red, blue circles which are in the peripheral field, to create an illusion of a 3rd circle between them. (Most books make this more difficult by not using the pen. The eyes just stare into space. I added the pen tohelp prevent strain.) Thinking red makes the circle turn red. Thinking blue makes it turn blue. This strains, confuses the brain, eyes, retina and eye muscles..  Dr. Bates has extra similar but different practices that correct strabismus naturally. Search treatments for squint, crossed eyes, double vision... in his books.  Look for the practice using a candle flame.<br /><br />Some Behavioral Optometrists, Ophthalmologists teach forms of these Artificial 3-D Fusion exercises, tests a special way for each individual person's strabismus condition and obtain good results. It should be used for strabismus (crossed, wandering eyes) only. Ask a Bates Method Behavioral Optometrist, Ophthalmologist for guidance if you have tried the Bates Method FIRST, worked with a Bates teacher and still need additional help. Follow your doctor's directions. Do not copy it from a book, website created by an unqualified person. The doctor's exercise might help correct imperfect convergence, divergence, fusion, strabismus when applied correct. It must be practiced with the guidance of a Bates Method Behavioral Optometrist, Ophthalmologist. The eye doctor will teach the patient which exercises, activities are to be done for specific conditions, distances that the patient's eye movement, convergence, divergence, fusion... needs improvement. The doctor might have the patient practice with the 3-D image card placed at only one, two distances or at a variety of close, middle and far distances, fusing the two images into a 3rd by looking at one or a variety of different close distances/objects before the card and/or one or a variety of different far distances/objects beyond the card. (one distance at a time.) Distance of the card might be varied. Spacing between the two images might be at a variety of widths or limited. Merging, fusing images that are further apart or closer together being accomplished with advanced fusion training, if needed. How many, length of time each or only some of these activities, routines are practiced is determined by the student's condition; divergence or convergence impairment, eye, eyes in, out, up, down, angled.., degree of impairment and other eye-vision and brain conditions. Other treatment, pictures... might be added.<br />  This is NOT a one size fits all just carelessly thrown in a book, webpage for every person's treatment!  Only a professional can prescribe a safe, correct, precise routine for each individual. Practicing too much or too little at a specific distance, at the wrong distance, on pictures spaced a specific width that's not needed, the wrong activity... can impair divergence, convergence and cause other eye, vision problems, astigmatism, cause and increase amblyopia.<br />  Some teachers place the Artificial 3-D in their books, school to attract attention, seem professional. They teach it wrong. They should warn about the side effects. It effects how the brain works with the eyes, retina, eye muscles. It is not to be toyed with. It must be applied by a professional experienced in the function of the eyes, the brain, brain hemispheres, visual cortex, nerves, muscles and other functions. You do not want to interfere with a child or adult's natural brain, eye development, function.  Accommodation, un-accommodation of the eyes and lens work-occur with the eyes convergence, divergence, fusion. All are affected, improved or impaired when the exercises, tests are done correct or incorrect.<br />  Most vision teachers do not teach this the correct way, do not warn about the side effects of doing it wrong because they cannot prescribe for every individual person's condition in the class, in books and usually do not know the entire, correct Behavioral Optometry treatment. Even a Behavioral Optometrist, Ophthalmologist needs the best training and experience, know exactly what part of the brain needs work. They also need to learn the Bates Method of Natural Eyesight Improvement so they can give their patient an option; true natural (Bates Method) treatment or if needed, the artificial 3-D and be sure it's done correct, and apply both methods; the Bates Method and the professional Artificial 3-D.  The artificial 3-D is a temporary treatment. The Bates Method is a permanent practice, an art, natural correct vision function.<br /><br />The Artificial 3-D exercises do produce a natural 3-D effect created by the eyes, retina, brain, left and right brain hemispheres, visual cortex. Seeing the correct fused image indicates the brain, eyes and eye muscles are working together, eyes are balanced-aligned. But; I call the exercises Artificial 3-D because it is not the normal way a person uses the eyes-vision to see an object clear. The Artificial 3-D has the person staring into space between and before or beyond 2 objects placed in the left and right peripheral field, merging these two into a 3rd object which is an illusion of being in the central field. In reality it is 2 areas/objects of the peripheral field combined and still in the peripheral. So; the person is using the peripheral vision to see with. Diffusion occurs. This prevents Dr. Bates #1 natural practice of central-fixation (true central vision). Shifting, natural eye movement is also prevented, impaired. Artificial 3-D causes strain, tension, confusion in the brain, eyes, can cause dizziness and other side effects. Impairing the eyes natural movement leads to unclear eyesight.<br />  True completely natural 3-D vision for healthy eyes, correct eye-brain function, clear vision occurs when;<br />looking directly at the object you want to see, directly at the distance the object is at, in the true central field with the mind, eyes 'mental-visual attention' on/at that object, distance. And; the central field, (the retina's fovea) `visual-mental attention' are moving 'shifting' part to part upon the object.  True natural fusion produces a completely natural 3-D vision created by the eyes, brain, left and right hemispheres, visual cortex. You can determine true depth, distance of objects. Time, speed to travel to, from one object to another... You see the object's texture, shape, all parts large to tiny, light, shadows.<br /><br />Try the Bates Method first;  relaxation, central-fixation (centralizing), shifting, switching `looking' close and far, bead string, pens in a row (natural healthy fusion with true 3-D), phoria swings, memory and imagination, natural movement, long swing, left and right brain hemisphere activation and integration, color treatment and other natural methods are usually all that are needed. See the Switching, Bead String and other chapters in teachers, doctors books to test and correct the vision.activities, routines are practiced is determined by the student's condition; divergence or convergence impairment, eye, eyes in, out, up, down, angled.., degree of impairment and other eye-vision and brain conditions.

0345803485|5.0|I agree with other reviews that there are repetitive adjectives in this series, however, some of the repetitions are necessary.  You have to admit that the series is highly entertaining, heart wrenching, humorous, unforgettable.... , and educational (especially the red playroom). I wish the author make the main characters more solid though.  On the other hand, the author did an awesome job in developing the characters' emotional journey in a gradual, comprehensive, and believable way, taking you on a thrilling and breathtaking emotional roller coaster ride with the main characters.
1441711724|5.0|The story is well-written and would be a pleasure to read on paper, but it is even more of a treat to listen to this audiobook version. Martin Jarvis is a fantastic reader! He uses so many subtle variations of his voice to make each character distinct without caricaturing them. The voice he chose for Mr. Hyde was eerie and thrilling, so that I ended up wishing the character had been given more lines of direct dialogue.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Worked great on the Kindle Fire at first but after a month or so started to such the big one. My advice to you don't buy this!!!!
B001CDZZI6|2.0|The product itself is fine except I had to buy it twice.  I accidently ripped the number at the back of the paper book.  I e-mailed customer support to ask about getting another one.  Over a month later I am still waiting.  Because I needed to complete the survey for a work retreat, I bought it on my kindle (thanks for being there Amazon). I have never heard back from my original e-mail, and there are absolutely no phone numbers on the web site.  Even though I don't need to take it again, I could have passed along the book and password to someone else considering I paid for it. I was not the only one to tear my number.  Another employee tore one number and simply went through the letters and alphabet to figure out the password.  We certainly figured out one of her strengths -- dedication.

B006SAR6P8|5.0|Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a fantastic ride, but most of the film is spent on the revenge spree from the events we learn more about in the second film.  Make no mistake, there is still murderous mayhem, but nothing to the level of The Bride taking on the Crazy 88.  No spoilers here, but the range of emotion from all the leads is fantastic.  Extra kudos to David Carridine in his role as Bill, whom we get to see really explore all sides of his character.

My sister is probablyb the only person who odsent like the hunger games because she read the first two pages ad said that it wasnt the type of book that she would like to read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this day for months and as soon as my friend told be this was out on aneroid app store I immediately hopped onto my Kindle Fire and downloaded it. Of course, I was a little bit upset at first because I had already downloaded the game from [...] and lost all my progress. But it's OK! I STILL LOVE THIS GAME!

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this game when it was the app of the day.  It is a \\"crossword\\" game, in the japanese style called nonogram.  If you like logical puzzles, such as sudoku and the like, you will enjoy this game.  It requires basic critical thinking (ie, there are 20 spaces wide, and it tells you 19 will be filled, therefore the middle 18 have to be used no matter which way you place them), but once you master the basics, it moves you on to more complex applications of the same.  It is a progression of harder/longer/more intricate puzzles, but the basic logical application stays the same.  What is nice about that is that super logical beings will enjoy moving through the complexity and seeing how fast it can be conquered.  Less logical beings can still enjoy it, since it is the same basics reapplied thoughout the full experience.<br />  I've already zoomed through 15 of the games, and I'm given to understand there are 2500 or some ridiculous number of total puzzles.  Can't reall beat that.  I'm having such a blast that I would gladly have paid $4.95 for it.  If they come out with a second follow up, I predict I will pay the full price to get more of my addiction.  Look at the screenshots, as I did.  If you find them at all intriguing, then this is definitely the game for you.
B0086700CM|5.0|really fun,good graphics.i like how you can switch characters and how the little sayings and pics when u die change according to what character you have. its really bothering me how people are so like addicted to this omg lovelovelove this lovelovelove tht .chill.apple ppl dont evn like it anymore its old news for jusst about every1 and comming frome me a non apple user. kindle fire all da way!!!!!?

B007URVZJ6|3.0|Great brief introduction to creating ebooks for Kindle, though to take the bones of this book and add 20 pages of detail would reassure the novice more than keeping it so very brief.  Also a comparison of how Kindle sits in relation to other e-book formats, whether there are compatibilities or not, and so on, would be helpful to set the overall context in which the novice is working.  Plus, most of us are used to more sophisticated layouts, even in Word, so a real explanation of how much simpler e-book formats are would be splendid.  Otherwise any new player is in the dark here.  Thanks so much.

B005LAIIS0|2.0|My wife and I spent a week last Saturday night watching this mess. Ok so it just felt like it took a week before we got to the most lackluster ending in the history of bad movie endings.<br />The best thing about this movie, the plane crash event. Without a doubt that was the best crash ever. It was intense. We jumped whenever that plane bumped and were nearly as disoriented, as were the survivors after the crash!<br /><br />The worst thing about this  movie...everything else! Unfortunately the film should have ended after the crash. Nothing, not even the vastness of the great Alaskan wilderness ever managed to rise to the intensity level of the crash. Why? Nothing else in the entire film makes the slightest bit of sense. They decide to leave the crash site, which is the only thing they have for shelter (and I might add any hope for rescue). No effort to inform possible rescuers that anyone survived the crash (which way did they go George, which way did they go?). Who are these people? What made them such outcast? Why are they so angry? Do they even really want to survive? You never get to know any of them and that's apparently a good thing because no one survives anyway. Why can't you get her back Liam? Is she dead? Did you kill her? Why in god's name didn't you pull the trigger? We don't even get to like the wolves. Early on in the picture Liam's character shots a wolf that had to be near record size? He was better fed than the dog next door. What possible reason would an animal that well fed have to risk exposure to all that civilization? Do wolves trophy hunt?  2 stars for the plane crash.....
B006WAIV6M|5.0|The concepts in this book are easy to understand, yet profound and potentially life-changing. Habits rule our life, whether we are aware of it or not. But the moment we become aware of our habits and how we can influence them, we have the power to reshape our lives so that we become healthier, more successful and happier in the end, not through raw discipline but through automated habits. Note that changing and creating a new habit is not effortless in itself, but this book can definitely help make the process easier.<br /><br />As a student of social psychology many of the studies sounded familiar. But what sets this book apart is the way DuHigg explains the concepts with his excellent storytelling. The book was a quick and easy read because the stories were so much fun to read and at times awe-inspiring.

B0086700CM|5.0|I had this game on my ipod before it broke. :'( I was happy to get a kindle fire as a replacement I have been waiting forever for it to come out it rocks!
B0086700CM|5.0|My mom has this game on her ipad and I was completely addicted. When I got my kindle fire it was the first thing I looked for. I was dissapointed when they didn't have it. Now I'm playing all the time!!!!
B005LAIGNC|4.0|Many have written about the story that needed to be told; my comments will be mostly just about the movie; from one who's loved many war movies (I'm 56 y.o.).<br /><br />From the first scene, I was loving the realistic CGI (I only wish \\"Memphis Bell\\" looked anywhere near as good), and hating the way the fighter and bomber pilots spoke. .<br /><br />The drama dialog was appropriate, and I appreciated the drama scenes in general, but in every battle scene, I felt the dialog was just not right.<br /><br />Similarly with the music. I'm one (of many I suppose) for whom the music in a war movie drives the pace of the action and the scene cuts. \\"Midway\\" is a good example; sometimes I'll watch the movie just because I'm so drawn in by the way the music melds with the action. I feel the same about \\"In Harms Way\\"; the music draws you in.<br /><br />One thing I do really like about the scenes where B17s are under attack;  I liked the bit of extra attention to the trauma and horror being experienced by the guys inside the aircraft as they meet their fate. (I grew up watching the \\"12 O'clock High\\" series, and also enjoyed \\"Memphis Bell\\", so I've been through many of these with B17s being shot up and breaking up as they fall out of the sky. )<br /><br />In general, the Air War over Europe was horrifying, and many men such as our Tuskeegee Airmen as well as the Eigth Air Force had to face up to their possible end on each combat mission. (Attrition rates in the air over Europe were very high.)<br /><br />This story needs to be told and appreciated, and \\"Red Tails\\" is another good vehicle.

0307474259|4.0|With crystalline clarity, science writer - Gary Taubes breaks down the process on how people accumulate excess fat and why under conventional and fad dieting it is so hard to lose pounds over the long haul.  The answer is quite simple and (spoiler alert...) public enemy #1 is carbohydrates and sugar.  Taubes then spends the next 220+ pages offering a very lucid, layman's explanation on what the consumption of said elements does to one's body and how it ultimately creates a vicious cycle of insulin resistance and other inconveniences that ultimately leads to the weight gain that has been a curse to modern society.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is not a diet book that offers a detailed regimen and recipes to put one on a fast track to lean and trim.  Taubes solution is offered within the first few pages and the remainder of the book is a detailed explanation to support his arguments.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game. its fun when I have nothing to do but I'm 13 and I really don't want to see sexual adds popping up so I get why the moms are worried. nn no h8ters cause I do love this game
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is the 2nd in Suzanne Colling's Trilogy. It's an absorbing, fantasy tale that has its highs and lows. All in all it's a good read. Characters and story line were presented in the Hunger Games and this continues with the next saga. I enjoyed it but not sure it's the right book for the very young (7-14) due to the violet nature of the story.
B0086700CM|1.0|all of these 5 star reviews have the same simple wording.  looks like the developer is working hard on promoting by filling the review list with their own.  Anything that wants you to piss away your money in the game is a trap to begin with.
B000K7MMPE|2.0|Episode 2 is actually episode 4.  Episode 4 is, indeed, listed correctly.  I have enjoyed these old series from the BBC, including Jane Eyre and Sense and Sensibility, but would have enjoyed this one much more if episode 2 were actually present.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|Nothing too original here but is entertaining and decent acting.Not too contrived. Characters well developed. The ending is OK but not spectacular.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had this game for i-touch for so long! than when it finally came out on kindle I loved it!! its better on my kindle! complety love it
B0054S6N04|5.0|Jaine Bright and her three co-workers and best friends are out one night having drinks and the subject turns to men. On a lark, they create a list of all the characteristics of the perfect man. What started out as a joke soon ballooned to local and then national notoriety as the list goes viral. And that's not the worst of it. While a lot of men have their noses out of joint about the list, one person is murderously angry because of it and wants to teach the women a lesson.<br /><br />This story was alternately funny, sexy and suspenseful, achieving a wonderful balance of all three making for a perfect reading experience. All four women were well developed, with their personalities true to that form. The relationship between the women was fun and entertaining. Jaine's burgeoning romance with the sexy detective next door was steamy and nicely drawn.  Even though I guessed who was out to hurt the women pretty early on, it didn't interfere with the suspense level and the ending couldn't be more exciting.<br /><br />I listened to this on audiobook and hated for this one to end. It is one of my most favorite by Linda Howard.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is great for free time.  VERY addictive! I am 12yrs old and I love my kindle fire and this adds to the great features. This is an awesome game!!!!
B0031RS64G|4.0|[[ASIN:0765322889 Gardens of the Moon (Malazan Book of the Fallen)]] is the first book in a ten book series called The Malazan Book of the Fallen. The series is arguably the most epic in scope, the most complex in narrative style, and the most detailed in terms of cultural, sociological and religious aspects. Comparisons to other great fantasy epics will no doubt include [[ASIN:0618640150 The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition]] or [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]] or even [[ASIN:0812538366 The Wheel of Time, Boxed Set I, Books 1-3: The Eye of the World, The Great Hunt, The Dragon Reborn]]...but a better and more accurate comparison may be to Frank Herbert's magnificent sci-fi masterpiece, the [[ASIN:B001F0WXY0 Dune (40th Anniversary Edition) (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)]] chronicles, and Glen Cook's gritty and character-centric fantasy series [[ASIN:0812521390 The Black Company (Chronicles of The Black Company #1)]].<br /><br />[[ASIN:0765322889 Gardens of the Moon (Malazan Book of the Fallen)]] starts off much like [[ASIN:B001F0WXY0 Dune (40th Anniversary Edition) (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)]] and [[ASIN:0812521390 The Black Company (Chronicles of The Black Company #1)]], in that you are literally thrown into the middle of this fully realized world, replete with an ancient but still living prehistory (in the form of the T'lan Imass and the Jaghut), a powerful but aloof alien species (in the form of the Tiste Andii), and a host of elder gods who are anything but passive and who routinely interfere and direct the lives of the general populace.<br /><br />I remember when i was a teenager and I had heard of a movie called Dune which was apparently based upon a best-selling novel. The premise intrigued me to the point where I read the book and then immediately saw the movie by David Lynch. I did  not see the movie alone. I took my cousin with me. My female cousin who knew nothing of sci-fi or fantasy and who probably was looking for a movie like Gremlins or Ghostbusters, rather than a strange sci-fantasy like Dune. And the movie was incredibly strange. If i had not read the book...i don't think even I would have been able to pick up on all of the subtle nuances and grand scope of things without having read the book first. I can't imagine what it must have been like for my poor cousin, who was so confused and befuddled afterwards that all she could do was ask \\"What is the 'water of life'? and why did he keep saying 'the sleeper has awakened'?\\"<br /><br />I recount this story only to illustrate a potential problem point: readers who are looking for the standard/typical mode of fantasy storytelling which have become so predictable that many times we're not looking for diversity in narrative, but rather looking at what type of new \\"power\\" is being contested or won. No, Gardens of the Moon will be as baffling and mysterious and potentially frustrating for many readers who are looking for something straightforward and simple to explain. Such is not the case with this series. Steven Erikson has created a complex and living breathing world and populated with various races and cultures and countries and thrown them into this story.<br /><br />And what is the story? It's hard to say really. There are so many narrative plot points. But I think the fundamental story is that something happened thousands of years before, something so terrible and cataclysmic that the repercussions of the event have reverberated throughout history, affecting the elder races and which have now culminated into a series of devastating and world-ending consequences that the modern races and their current use of magic must now contend with the here and now.<br /><br />I having been reading this series for the past few years now, and am on the last few novels. These books are not easy to read, but they yield so much pleasure in terms of epic storytelling and the range of characters.<br /><br />I will point out two things that you may need to know about the entire series:<br />First, Steven Erikson believes that all characters, big and small, matter. You might agree with that viewpoint, but if you think about what that really means, it means that each and every little character gets their share of the page, meaning what would normally be a 400 page book could turn into a 1,000 page book because the lives and dreams of each and every character is detailed and told. hence the massive length of most of Erikson's books.<br />Second, Steven Erikson's prose style is almost as complex and flowery as his story and settings. This prose is as purple as purple can get. He tends to wax poetic and philosophically on things and may even meander here and there, but the beauty of the series is in the details. And my god, there are some details. Details that you may think aren't much when you first encounter them, but then you realize how they contribute to the overall understanding and appreciation of the entire story.<br /><br />But with that said, these books are marvelous. And if you can get through the first book, as dense and complex as it is, then you will be rewarded by the 2nd and 3rd books, [[ASIN:0765348799 Deadhouse Gates (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, Book 2)]] and Memories of Ice (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, Book 3), which are about as good as anything i've ever read. The book Deadhouse Gates (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, Book 2) will break your heart with its grueling story about Coltaine's Chain of Dogs. And Memories of Ice will astound you in its scope and power; it is perhaps Erikson's one Masterpiece, though some may argue that the entire series is what constitutes his masterwork. but if one were to give the word masterpiece to any one of his novels, it would probably have to be Memories of Ice.<br /><br />But in order to get there, you have to go through Gardens of the Moon (Malazan Book of the Fallen), which is not his best work, but the beginning of his greatest work.ings that you may need to know about the entire series:<br />First, Steven Erikson believes that all characters, big and small, matter.

B006T5FDLG|5.0|Great pickup if your a diehard Metallica fan, and great edition to the already awesome Death Magnetic! Great little E.P. Great catchy songs and some memorable hooks! Hate Train is reminiscent of the track Fuel! Each song has its own punch in the face feel! Great stuff! Give us more!!!!!!!!
0345803485|5.0|I am not a good reader at all and I could not put this book down. It was a love story mixed with juicy sex, but in a tasteful way. My marriage has improved significantly and my husband is very grateful for me reading this novel.  I even picked out certain chapter pages to read out loud to him and it continues to spice things up for us.  Can't wait to finish the 2nd book and get to the 3rd!!!

0345803493|5.0|I thought the 1st book was amazing, but this was even better. The story continues and we learn a whole lot more about why Christian Grey is a dark mysterious character. I could not wait to finish the 2nd book so I could move on the #3, it is so addicting reading these books. We recap and talk about it all day at work with the ladies. I am looking forward to a Book Party on the Trilogy and can't wait till they make the movie. Strongly recommend these books to rekindle a marriage in need.  My husband and I are truly mad about each other because of some of the creative ideas from these books.  Thank you, E.L. James!!!
B007L96VCY|5.0|Unfairly savaged at the time of its original release, Paul McCartney's second solo album, \\"Ram,\\" is a magnificent tour de force, combining complex, soaring melodies and arrangements with playful lyrics that, while they often verge on nonsense, are consistently evocative, powerful, and effective in context. \\"Ram\\" has always been one of my very favorite albums--by anyone--and, consequently, I have owned, and worn out, many copies, on different formats, over the past forty years. The Archive Collection reissue is by far the most beautifully remastered version I have ever heard, however. (Yes, I think the sound quality surpasses that of the Mobile Fidelity gold disc of a decade ago, although that was also superb.) In addition, the bonus disc is chocked full of wonderful music, much of which was new to me; notably, it includes the classic single, \\"Another Day,\\" a triumph in its own right. This outstanding re-release, which finally accords Macca's best post-Beatles effort the respect it has always deserved, is very highly recommended!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is awesome. and it is funny . love it.it is the best game that I had play in a long time.

0385040253|4.0|The Ashley Book of Knots is THE standard that other books are measured against.  It has quite a few positives.  It is perhaps one of the largest collection of knots every assembled, gives history and usage for most of the knots, and is accompanied by quite a few entertaining sea stories.  If you enjoy working with knots this book is a must have for your knotting library.  Now you may be wondering why I only gave this book 4 stars....<br /><br />The biggest con of this book has to deal with it's occasional lack of clarity for some of the more complex knot work.  As I am a novice at knot tying when I sometimes have difficulty tying these knots as the directions/pictures are not always clear.  For example; when tying some of the flat knots it shows how to start and end the knot but does not give clear directions for how to extend the knot beyond the diagram.  While this may not present a problem for those with experience it does present a problem for individuals like myself.<br /><br />Overall this book is well worth the expense and should be added to your library if you are interested in knots, their usage and history.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome. ^_^ Its not boring,p l no matter how much you play it, and it changes a bit so youre not just running on the temple thing the whole time ^_^ Love it :)
0385736002|5.0|The Alchemyst<br /><br />Imagine you are a 16 year old kid trying to find his way in life. You have a twin sister and your parents are gone for the whole summer on an archaeology dig. You both just got jobs that are across the street from one another.Then you are attacked and you and your sister are thrown into this magical, wonderful, horrific, life threatening world. You want to leave but your thirst for magic keeps you there. And every moment you find yourself in danger. This is the world Sophie and Josh Newman are thrown into. This is the everlasting fight against good and evil which uses legends to help keep the story going. You won't be able to put the book.<br /><br />The story begins with josh and sophie at work.Josh is staking books when a black limousine drives up and a strange group of men get out, gray-faced golems,that walk straight into the bookstore.The air smelling of peppermint and it's not from the coffee shop. Before Josh and Sophie have time to react they are being dragged along on this rollercoaster of magic so that they don't get hurt. Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel, the twins bosses, are the twins trainers in magic.<br /><br />  In this book Michael Scott mystifies you with terrific word choices. He puts you on the edge of your seat with every action scene. He beautifully combines legends and myths with his and only Josh and Sophie are made up people. The rest are actual people, like Nick and Perry, and the rest are myths. This book is the first in a series and is the best of the series. It is an action romance with Nick Flamel trying to save his wife from the evil Dr. Dee.<br />  all in all, this is a beautiful gripping read  that anyone can enjoy.  It has action romance and blends perfectly with the legends that are told. And the author makes you feel like you're right in the action.

0345803485|5.0|The book was VERY captivating! I have read all three parts of the trilogy now & loved each book even more! Language is very vulgar but other than that I found it a good read.

B000MGATTE|5.0|I came to the LISEY'S STORY review page today because I'm trying to decide whether to buy this book on Kindle ... I \\"read\\" it initially years ago, as an audio book, and liked it so much that I immediately thereafter picked it up in hardcover at my local bookstore when I saw it there on sale.  But I am a confirmed convert to e-book format, and have been thinning my collection of hard copies ... much prefer to carry around hundreds of my favorite books with me everywhere, for the weight of a single paperback!  :-)<br /><br />I was reminded of LISEY'S STORY recently, when a few pages of the Kindle edition appeared at the end of something else I was reading (possibly CELL, also by King).  With a sense of happy nostalgia, I started to read those pages ... and was, in a word, horrified by the terrible editing.  Words missing ... words misspelled ... incorrect words substituted (as if someone had done an automatic spellcheck and simply accepted every suggested change without bothering to see if they were appropriate).  I was hoping to come to the LISEY'S STORY page on Amazon and read reviews of the editing in the final Kindle edition, should I decide to buy it ... had the problems I noted in the sample been fixed?<br /><br />Instead, I find a stream of unhappy recent reviews of this book from readers who seem to have been genuinely bored or disappointed by it.  I know you can't please all the people all the time, but I'm honestly surprised by such negative reactions.  I, too, have read everything King has written (except for the DARK TOWER series, which I know I will get to eventually) ... and this novel ranks as one of my favorites.<br /><br />I can't speak to the quality of the editing in the Kindle edition, because I haven't decided whether or not to buy it (still feeling gunshy by the poor editing in the sample) ... but I love the writing and the feel of this strange and powerful book.  It stuck with me for a very long time after I read it.<br /><br />In case it helpsyou decide if your tastes are likely to align with mine, in addition to LISEY'S STORY, I like DUMA KEY, MISERY, GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, GERALD'S GAME, ROSE MADDER, DOLORES CLAIBORNE, THE STAND, THE DEAD ZONE, TALISMAN, UNDER THE DOME, and ON WRITING best.  (And all short stories.)  I enjoyed, but am not as fond of, IT, TOMMYKNOCKERS, GREEN MILE, 11-23-63, and CARRIE.  Really did not like HEARTS OF ATLANTIS, BAG OF BONES, INSOMNIA, PET CEMETARY, or SALEM'S LOT.<br /><br />That wasn't a complete list of King (either as written by him or read by me), but maybe it will give you an idea of whether you might like LISEY'S STORY.<br /><br />On a final note, Amazon, publishers, authors, editors -- I don't know who's responsible for editing Kindle editions?  But please stop (as a group!) doing such a half-assed job.  My e-books are not less important to me than my paper copies.  They are more important, because these are the editions I return to again and again.  I am a professional proofreader, and the sort of problems I'm complaining about should have been (at least mostly) picked up in a single proofing round of the prepared edition.  We're not talking about expensive weeks or months of editing here!  I know what proofreaders make, and it's ridiculous to suggest that taking this step would be somehow too expensive to do for a Kindle edition.  Hell, I'd be happy to volunteer my own time if it would help to solve this recurring problem.
1451627289|4.0|So close to an outstanding book.  A bit long winded, obsolete detail oriented and straying from the hook.  I wanted the action to continue, but the bedroom farce and feel goodie \\"our town\\" feel weighed me down.
B007SGM084|5.0|Ok, so there are lots of mixed reviews about this trilogy. Personally, I loved it! Before I read it, all I heard was that it was \\"mommy porn\\" and there was lots of sex. While there is lots of it, there's so much more to it. There's a bigger story than just sex, sex, sex. It actually bothers me that some people focus solely on that aspect of the series. I'm a sucker for romance and at the end of the day, the love story in these books in undeniable. I've also heard people complain about how poorly it's written and what not. The things these people pointed out really didn't bother me. Sure, Ana rolls her eyes or bites her bottom lip often but who cares? And in terms of it being highly unrealistic... yeah, because there are so many sparkly vampires walking around these days! I'd say there are a hell of a lot more men like Christian Grey (riches aside) walking around than there are like Edward Cullen! Come on people, it's a piece of fiction. Who cares if it's not what you consider realistic! It's a good book with a good story! Last time I checked, that's what was important. I was immediately drawn in. I hope James writes more from Christian's perspective because the little excerpt she gives us at the end of Fifty Shades Freed left me wanting more! If you're on the fence with this series, just buy them already. I highly doubt you'll regret it!
B0086700CM|3.0|i had 100000 coins or so and i was going to buy a new character but the game baught other thing i cant use because of my kindle and now i have only 100 coins
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is about as much fun as I've ever had playing a defense game. totally enjoyable without having to buy coins too, which is a big plus.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I read the whole trilogy in a few days!  Real page turner, hot, hot, hot!  Don't wait!  Get it now!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a really good book. It goes into detail about terms people have heard of but are not that familiar with. It also give you a good plan plan to follow  to become \\"Bigger, Leaner, Stronger\\" just like the book entitles. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in working out, bodybuilding, people that want to change their body, or to anyone who just wants to learn something new.

0061146307|5.0|The world of misfortunes can lead anyone in a big misadventure.  But no matter what, you can still find the answer to your problem. But as for the Baudelaire children, it's more than just a misadventure, it's a misjourney. They're encounter a shocking family tragedy, a devious count,  and a fortune that could soon be in the wrong hands.<br />in the book, we meet the three Baudelaire children who have lost their loving parents and their home in a dangerous fire. Violet, the oldest child who has a talent of making inventions with anything. Klaus, the middle child who loves to read and and can remember it all when he need it. Leaving Sunny, who is the infant sibling and she likes to bite things with her sharp baby teeth. With no place left to go, their only family friend Mr.Poe sends them to a family member they've never heard of. He is Count Olaf, a sneaky and devious man who keeps them only in interest of their family, and while he plans to get it in any way possible, the three Baudelaire kids will have to go through many bad events in order to survive their new home.<br />I read the first book back in the fifth grade and I immediately got hooked on the series. It combines the adventurous thrills and even a little bit of black humor. Kids will find the series totally irresistible and will stop to see what will happen next to the Baudelaires. To me, these series may be the best for kids to read. What will happen next would be very unfortunate, indeed.<br /><br />(Grade: A)
B0086700CM|5.0|omg I love this game its the best game ever its so addictive I love it. uh i think thats why i recommend five stars
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed the first book, then I decided to buy the second and of course I needed the third!  Guess I should have just bought the Trilogy in the first place!<br />It was good, not the Porn some were saying it was.....just some Kinky Sex.<br />I was not offended, some might be.  Almost had a Sexy, Pretty Woman, feel, and I loved that movie, so it worked for me.<br />If you enjoy this type, read it!  I used to spend more on lunches than this so it is not too much to pay!

B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is my first review, but I feel that the outstanding freshman effort by this author deserved comment.  Indeed, most of the preceding reviews are accurate.  The book is engaging, fast moving, interesting, and well written.  The characters are complex without being annoying.  While the book has its flaws - typos, confusing references, somewhat derivative, convenient and poorly explained magic - it is, overall, a great read and I look forward to the next book in the series.<br /><br />Nearly anyone who enjoys George R.R. Martin, Jim Butcher, or Tolken, would enjoy this book.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I am extremely pleased with this product!  It is exactly what I was looking for.  This is all the game of thrones books to date - all five books, but since two books are separated into Parts 1 and 2, it actually seems like seven books.  A very good buy!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This is the most terrible movie I have ever watched, bar none.  It has no redeeming social value.  It sucks.
B007SSDDWE|1.0|Okay.  There is so much to dislike about this movie that I could go on and on.<br /><br />Short version: Don't waste your money until its free on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Reg version: Actors, plot, plot holes, stereotypes, predictable all of them sucked.  The story's premise was interesting and could have been written/produced much better.  Really it was like watching a straight to dvd/vhs low budget movie.  No it wasn't even that good, at least then, sometimes, it can be funny but this movie blew.<br /><br />AVOID!!!!! Believe me, I prevented myself from watching it.  I was skeptical but then I was bored and said \\"what the heck, may be it'll be decent\\"  no it wasn't.  I would have been better off twiddling my thumbs for an 1 and a half.
B007SGM084|5.0|I recently purchased the \\"Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy.\\"  Actually, I bought it for my Kindle five hours ago and I only have a quarter of the first book left to read. The first thing I heard was, \\"You have to get this trilogy!\\" If the rest of the series is anything like the first book, I'm happy I did even though the price was a little high. Secondly, I HIGHLY recommend anyone that is interested in reading this book to READ THE REVIEWS AND PLOT FIRST!!!!! I DO NOT discredit the author one bit but, believe me, this isn't like the Titanic movie with a little shot of Rose's chesticles(yes I just said `chesticle'), it's REALLY INTENSE. What good is a romance novel it doesn't get you a lil hot and bothered?! Ha Ha. Besides the jokes, just keep in mind, it is an excellent book. Happy reading :)
B005Q1W10A|5.0|After receiving Season 1 from my daughter for Mother's Day, I enjoyed it so much that I ordered Season 2, and it did not disappoint. I especially liked the Christmas episode.<br /><br />I ordered Season 2 through thetimeisnow and originally had a problem with the order. The seller resolved the problem in a timely manner to my complete satisfaction. If I had a way to do so, I would give them 5 stars for their professional manner and quick response.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a fun game that helps keep your mind active. I like playing this game in my  spare time
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is my favorite free game. I have played it more than any other one that I have downloaded. great deal for the money.
B004WKI204|5.0|I don't often read books by comedians - but I am so glad I purchased Bossypants! I'm no 30 Rock addict or even SNL faithful (especially being based in Australia) but I really enjoyed Tina's journey, anecdotes and hilarious observations. And I am no hairy legged, anti-men feminist (although my husband may disagree - especially with the hairy leg part..), but this is a big 'Up Yours' to all of the female-comedian-haters with the chant 'Chicks Just Aren't Funny'. Team Fey says - 'You Are Wrong'.
0345803485|1.0|I am literally stunned that someone was paid money for this piece of trash.  I can only thank all the heavens that I didn't waste money on this, but was lent a copy, which I have now recycled, because at least that way it will do something good for humanity.<br /><br />  There is just not a single thing that's professional about it- it's poorly written, from the ridiculous and implausible characters, to not understanding that repeating a phrase you like over and over doesn't make it either good or interesting, all the way to completely un-sexy and at times disturbing sex scenes and, as another reviewer mentioned, an understanding of the world normally only held by 13-year-olds.  Especially stupid and naive 13-year-olds.  And, of course, it's written by someone who doesn't understand what BDSM is about and(/or) who is/has been in an abusive relationship for so long that they've learned to justify the sort of behavior that no one should accept.  That man is not sexy, he is abusive.  If this were real life, Christian would eventually kill Ana and tell the world it was an accident.<br /><br /> This is worse than fanfic.  Than BAD fanfic.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for 6 months!!!! its finaly here!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!!!! peace out peeps!!!! nest game ever
B0063GORYU|5.0|I think this app is awesome it is a lot easier than the regular solitaire and it didn't have as many advertisements as I thought maybe like one per game witch you can easily skip so I rate this app 5 stars
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally my favorite app for my favorite device!!! I have been waiting since I got my kindle fire for this app!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|love this game! I have had no problems with it.<br />it's definitely not a game for little kids, and its very addicting. I got this game a little more than 24 hours ago, and I've already played about 200 games. that's how addicting it is.<br />the only reason I gave it 4.5 stars was because it takes a couple games (depending on how good you are) to buy the power-ups. other than that, its a really cool game! would totally recommend it!! especially because it's free! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|it is amazing fun and entertaining when u r bored anyone can play and best of all it is fun and free
B007V2UGPE|5.0|fun, quick game that you dont have to play all the time forever to have fun. log on, play have fun and log off. no worries about saving etc. very fun
B005EGXTEE|5.0|A must read, definitely BEFORE seeing the movie. I couldn't put the kindle down and I purchased the sequel as soon as I had finished it!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I had600 coins and now there all gone and they wont. add up anymore. feeling like it was a waste of my time
1439148813|5.0|This was an amazing book.  I did find that it took a little to get going but once I got past the main technical jargon at the beginning I literally could not put the book down.  I absolutely loved this book and recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about the space program and space history.<br /><br />I was constantly amazed at how much the teams accomplished in such a short amount of time.  I was also amazed at the very few failures that occurred despite what they were doing.  In today's world Apollo would never have gotten off the ground.<br /><br />I also appreciate Gene's word's at the end regarding where America is with space - and I happen to agree.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|This was the product that I was looking for... All that is promised was true.<br /><br />I have a old Bose Soundock. It just used it with an old ipod touch (2nd. Generation). Originally, this Soundock was made just for ipod video or for ipod touch (1st. Generation).<br /><br />I connected the CableJive and ready, all 3.5mm devices can use it with an excellent performance.<br /><br />Just for the curious ones, I connected a little device that receives (input) bluetooth and has a 3.5mm output to the cable connected to the Bose Soundock. Now, I have my Bose Soundock connected to any device via Bluetooth. Awesome!!!<br /><br />Thanks
B004MC8CA2|5.0|now that you can download versions directly on your devicea, this is the best Bible app available.  Finding the book,  chapter,  and verse is simple and fast (very fast)!!!  My new favorite electronic Bible.  Thank you YouVersion!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|read the reviews and downloaded it on kindle fire I love this game it plays like the frontierville on FB b4 they started changing everything. you do wait to refill energy but as you level up your energy bar gets bigger and refills. I've had no problems with timers resetting like others have said they have added some new items as well as a gold rush mini game to do once a day where you can get extra items I love the fact that the goals are challenging enough to give you things to do each time you play and the sick ppl you need to help. I gave it 4 stars cuz I have found it does seem to have connection issues when trying to go to my friends places its over all a great game for ppl who like decorating and working on there land great way to escape and waste time.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game to finally come to the amazon app store, kindle fire users rejoice for you better run and catch this game as fast as you can
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Wonderful CPU!! I have 3 of these and one i7 3770K. The i5 3570K in my experience of the two has been a more stable chip for me.I can tell you, this chip is great!!! ITs stable, no matter what the settings. The integrated graphics are truly amazing considering they are coming from the CPU itself. You almost don't need a discreet graphics card (almost).  ; )<br /><br />One thing I did run into is one of the three chips I have of this variety could not handle RAM any higher than 2400 mhz. It would not run G Skill Trident-X 2666mhz RAM even on the XMP settings. No matter what I tried or what voltages etc. would not post anything higher than 2400 mhz. After conferring with some industry \\"in the knows\\" a conclusion has been drawn that the majority of the chips (CPU's) manufactured in Cost Rica(the 3rd Gen. i5 flavor) do not handle RAM higher than 2400 mhz. Apparently the IMC's (Internal Memory Controllers) on these chips just aren't robust enough to take the higher speed RAM's. At first I was worried that any of the 3570K chips would not run higher RAM speeds. Luckily some do. I was concerned that I might have to go with the 3770K's exclusively if I wanted faster ram speed settings. Glad this did not turn out to be the case.  The 3770k is at least $100 more expensive and I found this chip to be more to my liking. (more stable for me )<br /><br />One of the experts I conferred with indicated that out of 16 consumer retail CPU's (i5  3570K) chips, only 5 or 6 of the lot of 16 would run or post at any RAM setting higher than 2400mhz. Even though the board is rated for RAM speed up through 2800  (even higher settings into the 30k's is listed in this boards BIOS)<br /><br />That said I ordered 2 additional CPU's and luckily they both were manufactured in Malaysia  (marked \\"Malay\\")and both ran 2666 mhz RAM no problems. So I would have to agree there is some validity to what this gentleman was saying.<br /><br />So if your into overclocking and/or going to run RAM any faster than 2400 mhz I would make sure you go for the \\"Malaysia\\" manufactured chips instead of the \\"Costa Rica\\" chips. Its not guaranteed either way, as he did have some run at 2666 mhz from \\"Costa\\" however, chances are more that  you wont be able to run higher RAM speeds than the chances that you will. So far I am two for two on the Malaysian chips and one for one on the costa Rica chips. Either way, great CPU's and if you have no plans to use higher settings then by all means the Costa Rica chips are fine. Enjoy!!
B000IU3XTW|5.0|Its the Foo, you can't go wrong if you don't have this album. I bought it to fill up my collection.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|i'm usually hesitant to buy barbies based on movie characters, but this doll is just gorgeous. they did an excellent job replicating bella's dress from the movie. the only things i was disappointed in were that the doll's shoes didn't look like the manolo blahnik's in the movie (probably a licensing issue, i'm guessing) and she doesn't have a wedding band on her left hand. minor things, but details i expected to find. and those did not take away from the beauty of the doll. the packaging also did an excellent job of looking like the ceremony from the film. if you're a twilight fan, i recommend getting this doll.
B000020617|5.0|Its the Foo, you can't go wrong if you don't have this album. I bought it to fill up my collection.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|ONCE AGAIN CARLOS SANTANA HAS EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.!!!  His colaborations on \\"Shaman\\" and \\"Supernatural\\" were wonderful and well worthy of all the acclaim they received. This new CD is almost all instrumental and purely beautiful. Every song is filled with awesome \\"santana sound\\" guitar/mesa boogie;paul reed smith,etc. His songwriting and technique are just heavenly. Great, Great,job from Carlos Santana and his fellow musicians.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Its the Foo, you can't go wrong if you don't have this album. I bought it to fill up my collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|IT ROOOOOOCCCCCKKSKKSSSS! that's all I gotta say. its is awesome. it is awesome. it rocks. it rocks. it NOT ratchet. there are no glitches. ITS AWESOME!!!!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Of course, coming up with 20 words about why the Foo Fighters are awesome isn't an issue.... if you're thinking of buying the album, then just do it!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book was an astounding find! I couldn't put it down! I can't wait for the next book and would gladly pay more than full price. I have been an avid Sci-fi/Fantasy reader all my life and I only write reviews for the best. Sometimes it is hard to find true gems in all the Independent new kindle writers. This book is a masterpiece of Fantasy. Betrayal, Love, War, Faith, Magic, Political Intrigue; all brilliantly and subtly blended and written. Ryan could teach some of the best fantasy writers how it is done. I cannot recommend this book enough. Support this man! I feel I owe him quite a bit of money.<br /><br />Of course there are many editing issues, but for not even a couple dollars Ryan puts so many well known authors to shame.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I recommend this app. It is so easy to use and able to find words easily.  You will love this app!
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS GAME IS AMAZINGLY AWESOME. But when I try to buy more money with the buy coins thing on the kindle fire, it says there is an error even though I have a wifi connection.  Can you fix this and also AGAIN THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great<br />everyone should. try this game its good a must play Andes its free.play. it now not later goof goog
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app. I have had no problems with it. I play it for hours... Its great on kindle fire. Very easy to play.
B000S1L7IU|4.0|Liked the way Clive Cussler \\"ties\\" things together and the<br />way he writes; this was a good story and found it hard to<br />put down and kept me awake desiring what was to happen next.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The items was shipped timely and I love the size and features of this cover. It keeps the Kindle lightweight and sleek.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|The game is easy to get started on, and gets sufficiently difficult.  I did the first several with my 12yr old,  but he didn't have the patience to do the harder ones. Dh & I work them at the same time on different devices to see who is faster...
B006ZZCLV0|5.0|I try to avoid most fads but am REALLY glad I bought into this one. This series is WAAAAY better than twilight. Its not centered around some broad who's main goal in life is shagging the neighborhood vampire. Its about a girl who really knows the meaning of sacrifice and hardship and overcoming. I greatly enjoyed this entire series and am a little sad I finished it so quickly! I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to see if the rest of the movies will compare :D

B005974CNA|5.0|This is the best Dream Theater album I have heard in a long time. Although my attitude is \\"Dream Theater's blah songs are still galaxies above most music\\", the past few albums had a few songs I wanted to skip over. With this album, they're back to skip-less and I can't stop listening!<br /><br />I'm still at the point where I'm listening to the whole album and haven't yet dissected and rated the entire thing; the best point of familiarity with an album. \\"On the Backs of Angels\\" was the first song that really stuck out. Labrie contributed to the music of \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" and it shows; it sounds like some of his solo songs. I look forward to seeing creative contributions in songwriting from all members; some hadn't been so active. \\"Bridges in the Sky\\" is a song dealing with the idea that someday our existence will stop; I like how Petrucci (while being in a particular religion) has imagined different views of spirituality in various lyrics, and I really loved the sample of the throat singer in the beginning and end! \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\" has a beautiful piano section in the beginning and some insane instrumentals. In \\"Outcry\\" there is an instrumental point that keeps getting faster and kind of sounds like getting caught in a whirlpool. \\"Far from Heaven\\" is a ballad that shares a theme with \\"Breaking All Illusions\\", which stands out to me as the most euphoric.<br /><br />I'm very taken with the ballads on this album. (\\"Wither\\" on the last album just didn't do anything for me, and a few others lately hadn't really hit me in the heart.) Labrie's sensitive voice has a personal feel. \\"This Is The Life\\" has the mark of Petrucci's classic, soaring style. The lyrics can be interpreted in many different ways; it has meaning to me because I view it as a message for people to stop berating themselves about their shortcomings in life. \\"Beneath the Surface\\" is a simple and well-performed song that has the appearance of effortlessness found in \\"Another Day\\" (while stillbeing quite different from \\"Another Day\\"). It's a happy-sounding tune with heartbroken lyrics; it almost has a country sound to it and although I'm not crazy about country I'm crazy about this song.<br /><br />This is also the first album without Mike Portnoy. Whether it is coincidential that this just happens to be a stellar album is yet to be seen, but it seems his heart was not entirely in it for the past few years. He still contributed to over 20 years of awesomeness. The DVD told the basic story and made a nifty one-episode reality show about the drummer tryouts. I enjoyed watching it, especially with family members who weren't as aware of current events (they were guessing which drummer was going to be chosen, then said \\"that makes sense, Mangini even looks like he's already one of them\\").<br /><br />Summary: The feeling on this album is more intense; the overall feeling is darker, but there are also quite a lot of great euphoric moments too. The members are all in top form; few artists have maintained their creative power over such a long period of time. Dream Theater continues to live up to their name with the imagery they create. This album is among their best!
B0086700CM|3.0|This game is super fun and addicting but it is very glitchy and laggy. I have lost numerous games because it doesn't respond or because of it lagging.
0385512058|5.0|This book has elements of a really good story. There are seeds planted in the book that consummate nicely in the end.<br /><br />One of Keith's suggestions on getting to know people is to connect with them on not just a superficial \\"business\\" level, but on a personal level. This is exactly what he does in the book, as he shares personal stories and zen moments in his life.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, the reader is impressed on what really matters in life. Studies have shown that it isn't wealth or titles, but relationships. This book is about networking, but the scope and depth of it reach far beyond the business section of your bookstore!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is amazing and I'm glad it made it to the kindles.<br />everyone should get this game.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I'm not sure what to say about this book.  I think I really, really liked it but was a bit confused initially.  At times I wanted to throw it out the window.  The story revolves around two young illusionists being trained to take part in a competition.  The setting is the night circus that suddenly appears and then just as suddenly disappears.  A quirky yet interesting group of<br />characters make up the entertainers and developers of the circus.  You can't help but to be drawn to each and every one of them. The imagery was amazing.  I was transported to another time and place where I almost felt like I was part of the story. I wanted to be there experiencing what it was like to travel on the paths, enter the tents, and be part of the magic.  I was thoroughly entertained.  My advice - Don't throw it out the window!!!!
0312641893|4.0|I'm the kind of person who reads alot of books, mostly depending on the storyline. I knew this was a re-imagining of Cindrella and I read the book in one day. I did not like the fact that it ended in a cliffhanger; what is going to happen now?<br />The story kept me interested all the way through to the last page. I want to know what happens now. After learning the next book in the series focuses on Scarlet (Little Red Riding Hood) I am disappointed. I have not read that book yet, wondering when the Cinder story will continue. Otherwise great read for avid readers and fairy tale fans alike. (As long as you're okay with a retelling.)<br />I've learned you can't judge a book by one chapter. I might have been four or five chapters into it before I was hooked.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so cute and fun. kids love it and play for hours. mom loves it too!!! addicting for everyone.  love the movies and can now enjoy the fun whenever we want.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is definitely worth reading. It held my interest all the way through and I read it in a very short time span because I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Highly recommended.
0345803485|3.0|I really thought that this book would have been better written, with a little bit of a story line  It was nothing but trash  Someone is just trying to see what they can get away with
B005MYEPXC|5.0|If you know Woody Allen's stand-up work from the 60s you'll know the European vacation sketch with Hemmingway and Gertrude Stein. This takes that singular idea and weaves it into a feature film - with all the strengths and weaknesses that implies.<br /><br />On the one hand it's funny and engaging, a treat of a film. It's well cast with Owen Wilson doing a good `Woody' turn; Marion Cotllard perfect as the coquettish muse and Corey Stoll stealing the show as a laugh-out-loud Hemmingway. Michael Sheen is also hysterical. The humour is a mix of contemporary digs, the rightwing of the Republican Party is the butt of several funny lines, and knowing but funny references to Paris of the 20s (though I admit I had to look up who Djuna Barnes was). The film's message - that the past is a nostalgic illusion and we must live for today - is hardly subtle or original but definitely something we could all do with being reminded about from time to time.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are plenty of flaws. The opening montage goes on far too long. I got it: we're in Paris! The relationship between Gil and Inez is too antagonistic to be credible. And since this is a concept movie, there's no real resolution to it; it can't go anywhere, so Woody just ends it with a downpour.<br /><br />But these are criticisms that are easy to overlook. It's at its best when Owen Wilson is wandering through Paris of almost a century ago and for this part of the movie alone I'd recommend it. Utterly charming.
B0086700CM|5.0|who would not love this game this is the best like it five stars for a reason love bethanie scrivner
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Wow. This game is very addictive.Its a great game really. Ive only played for a few seconds and I like it. Overall all I have to say is : get this game. You wont be dissapointed! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best! the best thing is the death pics.I give this game 5 stars on the kindle fire.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Really cool game for all ages! I really like it continues from the original game &amp; really fun. Don't think about it just download &amp; see for yourself.
B0086700CM|4.0|i love this game and i play it on my ipad but on my kindle fire it started to glitch. turning left just doesnt work, it just keeps going under.....but thats the only thing that got me really frustrated.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|When I saw the price for this I decided to wait a month or two until the price dropped or a free version came out. Three months later no free version and not a penny drop in price. I am sick of this amazon, hurry up and get a free version out for people to play, not some three buck game with only two worlds. This is a rip off!
B0083GPDBO|4.0|The writing was strong, and the acting was very believable. I think that though it has a low-budget feel to it, it works. The plotting was good, although the characters a bit flat. The father, for example, had no redeeming characteristics, while the mother was a saint.<br /><br />I like it, but don't love it. Renting it once is enough.
B0086700CM|5.0|obviously it will be different on every kind of device. on kindle fire, it will progress different than an iPad or iPhone or Android. on the kindle fire, it's working to its full potential. it is very good for the kindle fire device.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is fun and appears to be built well. I am enjoying it with no problems. I do wish I could easily find a reminder about the special types of things and what they mean.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Best movie ever regardless of blu ray, dvd, or pirate version all worth it! Great moovie that anyone could watch make sure you get blu ray!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read Wool 1-5 over the last two days, and then immediately ordered Wool 6.  I love the silo story and want more.  The plot is great, the characters are wonderfully developed, the pace is fast enough - it's exactly the type of thing I most enjoy reading.  Keep 'em coming!
0446585025|5.0|As the title says to each their own. There are those who will love it, there are those who will hate it. Some may forget that this is not an autobiography, but fiction based on real-life characters and you have to read between the lines.Some may struggle to understand when the writer is serious and when she is 'kidding'.<br /><br />One thing for sure, it is original and never boring.  The book clearly doesn't follow the regular composition rules and the order of the topics popping is least expected, just as the topics themselves are. Just remember that this is Ellen DeGeneres, and that this is what she is best at - bringing attention to different important issues through random comical (for better digestion) observations , yet without degrading their seriousness or actuality, and probably leaving her viewers (well, in this case readers) with some afterthoughts.
B0086700CM|3.0|the graphics of this version are pretty bad sadly I have to say the the apple product graphics are more realistic and just look all around better. Kinda disappointed
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|An insightful and heartbreaking book. A must read for anybody struggling with self-acceptance be it weight, appearance or other issues. There is something to relate to in it for everybody.<br />This is not an easy read though, and it may be tough to continue at times, mainly because of how truthful Portia's portrayal of her struggle is. The book itself is more of a study. Compositional  focus on one particular year of dieting is brilliant. There is no turning the corner without recognizing the things for what they are and facing every single detail.<br />Portia is very open and describes with brutal vividness  what one's determined mind can do to one's body and how dangerous it can be. The step by step detailed account of  everyday purposeful and carefully planned regimen helps to understand what can be going on in one's mind, shows the thinking and acting patterns one resorts to, the extremes they can take to. It can serve as an absolute eye-opener for those who have a member of their family going through something like this just as much as it can be an eye-opener for the person struggling. But the tools to recovery are in this description as well.<br /><br />Those who wished for the juicy details of personal relationships and movie sets will be obviously disappointed. The book describes the process of individual struggle with a number of issues, ups and downs (well, mainly painful downs) of self-acceptance and events leading to the turning point. And it does just that.<br /><br />Disclaimer. The book is very honest and spares no details or colours. It might be difficult if you are in that vulnerable stage when looking in the mirror (and reading this book can feel very much like it at times) can send you downwards. I don't discourage from reading it, by all means do. We humans are prone to  doing things to ourselves without realizing the possible grave consequences, and to be aware of your own  patterns is the first step on the road to self-recovery. But the book is a tough ride and I think it is a good idea to know what you are in for before you hop into the cart.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the game yes there is a lot of adds but ignore them and injoy your time with the game.
B0086700CM|5.0|Addicting!  I love this game and so does my entire family! The graphics are great! It never gets old either... hours of fun!
0486275590|5.0|Not only do I love this story, I also love the fact that it is a \\"green\\" book. Dover is really on to something with this type of setup!
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is a great game. but most of the time its a little laggy. but that spent mean you shouldn't get it. this is still an amazing game.
B007SGM084|5.0|I work at a popular adult store and we are selling these books at $15 dollars a pop. So honestly, this $30 dollar pricing for all three books is not bad whatsoever. Plus you do have to keep in mind how popular these books are, every woman in America seems to want to get their hands on them. Just read the first book and could not put it down, so if you ask me get them. It is amazing piece of literature.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is the best for my kindle. Its basic, organized and beautiful! Excellent!!! The bedt is that in this moment are a free apps... Coollllll
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This book by Stephen Greenblatt, is a very thought stimulating discovery.  I was entranced with this book and read it through in a sitting. It is a fantastic writing indeed.  Dr. Larsen
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have a hard time playing the same game over and over again with the only difference being that it gets harder. But with this app i get to play a bunch of different short fun games and earn points to buy even more mini games. it keeps my attention and i play any chance i get. i love it.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I produce powerpoint presentations and always review what i've done before, which can often result in me sitting at my computer for hours.. this time, I was able to view, review and edit which was simple and effective - and play a game of scrabble now and again to keep me sane!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game wasn't too bad. pretty easy to play on my Fire. my 7 year old daughter caught onto the game quickly too.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  The characters are amazing.  I'm not one to read a book a second time but I immediately started reading this book again.  I would love to see it turned into a movie.
B0085776BG|3.0|I went into this movie hoping that it would live up to the history and honor of the Tuskegee Airmen, but it was just an ok movie. The use of new actors was great in my opinion, and while the acting was brilliant, the script wasn't as fleshed out as it could've been leaving me wanting more. The parts of the bomber crews came off as robotic and predictable and the racism faced by the black crews didn't really feel as challenging as I'm sure the Tuskegee Airmen faced in real life.<br /><br />Now, I've always been one to read about the air and sea battles of WW2 and this movie didn't disappoint. Everything was in your face and was spectacular from beginning to end. I've heard this movie referred to \\"Star Wars with planes\\", and it was.<br /><br />This movie did definitely have it shortcomings, from the script to the editing, but if you just want to get an idea of the heroics of the Airmen, this is the movie to see.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Great fun for the entire family. Spectacular visuals for the kids and well written story for the adults. The extras give double the value for the purchase in providing background and behind the scenes interviews<br />5 Stars
B001EN71HC|4.0|This is basically the exact same set as the standard edition.  Same features, aspect ratio, films, etc...  The only difference is you get these with HD sound & picture, and the packaging is different.  The standard set contained a \\"flap\\" style three disc set, while the blu ray set has each disc with its own slipcase.  This is basically my only reason for the 4 star review.  And it's Austin Powers.<br /><br />Is it worth the extra $10-15?  I guess if you're a fan, and don't want the discs getting all beat up from the packaging from the standard DVD set, and are picky about picture & sound quality...then, yes...it's worth it.  Just don't expect any new bonus features.
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|I hate to give anything with George Clooney in it a 1 star review, but I watched this thing after paying for it on Dish because it had a high rating.  This is a pathetic excuse for a movie.  The title is deceiving.  Yes, there are Hawaiian descendants in it, for a total of about 3 or 4 min.  The whole movie  centers around George Clooney's dying wife and her affair with a realtor, which George and his daughter set out to find.  Four letter words coming from the mouths of a ten year old and her teen age sister abound and are not my idea of pleasant viewing, either.  The characters are shallow and uninteresting.  Very boring.  The whole movie you keep on waiting for something interesting to happen and it never does.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad that I can finally play this on my Kindle!!!! :) Now I can play this on Iphone and Kindle! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved all 3 Fifty books, from beginning to end!  Very few books hold my attention, much less make me want to read them more than once!  I loved all of the characters as well.  Ana and Christian's past and present and their unfolding love story tugs at your heartstrings.  This was a perfect book to escape reality for this single, working mother and full time grad student...even if for just a little bit.  Thank you E.L. James!!!  I look forward to reading many more of your books!
B0086700CM|5.0|yayyyyy!!!! I'm so happy this game is finally on here!!! its about time!!! I love this game and so does my 2 year old who can get to 2900M lol jl
B0062OCNAI|5.0|i HAVE READ Sisters and afterward and both were great. I will be watching for her new books, Ihave told my daughter bout her.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is definitely addictive!! I got it two days ago and have yet to put it down!! Its hard enough to keep me entertained and just when I think I get it, the next puzzle throws me for a loop!! I love this game!!!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Wow what a great CD by TRAIN. I listen to it everyday going to work. I just love the songs that are on it. They made good choices when they recorded it.
B001AQT11M|5.0|this is a unique film in it's content. i love snow white herself but that nasty queen is awful and will do anything to poor snow white. of course, the good thing is that in this case good does conquer evil and the evil queen dies and snow white and the prince live happily ever after. the disney team did a great job creating the characters and deciding what they should look and act like. they a very great job creating the seven dwarfs and their own unique personalities. my favorites are grumpy and sneezy. this movie has great family friendly humor and romance. i would recommend this to anyone that likes funny movies and romantic movies as well. this will make you feel like a kid again.
B008469DGY|5.0|great game for kindle fire for two dollars. easy to play. worth every penny. quick download. blah blah blah blah.
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|this is one of the best animated movies. i also love cinderella and sleeping beauty about the same as lady and the tramp. i love watching this movie because of lady, the cocker spaniel. i'm very happy they made a movie with a cocker spaniel. they are my favorite breed of dogs. i have two. lady reminds me about our dogs when they were puppies when they show lady as a puppy. the behaviors is really realistic to the cocker spaniels true nature. they did a great job researching this breed and it's personalities. i also love the romance scenes. it's very cute. thanks disney you did a fantasic job on this one!
B001E45XT4|5.0|The headset is very good quality, the mic and headphones work perfectly. My only problem is that when using the headset for a long period of time my ears are often sore and irritated, however I've had this problem with a number of different headphones and headsets, so if you've got a big head, beware... you may have to wear the headset over a hat or something (that works for me). Fairly inexpensive, great quality, satisfied customer.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I downloaded this book for my Kindle because so many people were talking about it, and because when I read the free Kindle sample first chapter I discovered that parts of it take place in Portland, where I live, so I felt I had to read it.<br /><br />Having done so, I can't claim that I didn't enjoy it, because I did, mostly.<br /><br />But enjoying it requires significant suspension of disbelief as well as a willingness to ignore mediocre writing and editing.<br /><br />Plot-wise it seems to fall into the \\"Jane Eyre\\" genre: innocent young girl who does not know how beautiful she is falls under the sway of fabulously wealthy, mysterious, slightly older man (who is still young enough to be virile, of course) with a BIG SECRET. So, kind of like Jane Eyre, but with spanking and flogging.<br /><br />Once I got past the credibility issues I just relaxed and enjoyed the plot.<br /><br />The sex scenes did not make me laugh out loud, which puts E. L. James way ahead of some other highly successful authors I can think of (I'm looking at you, Ayn Rand), and despite the fact that there was little actual substance to the character of Anastasia Steele I found that I was interested in what became of her, and wanted her to be happy.<br /><br />It reminded me a little of a fun but trashy novel called Scruples, which I read about 30 or 35 years ago. That experience was the closest I've had to the experience of reading Fifty Shades of Grey.<br /><br />This is also basically just a fun but trashy book. If you don't expect great art or profundity, you won't be disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has really connected me to God and helps me understand what He is trying to teach me!!! if you're a Christian GET THIS APP#!!If ur not a Christian get this app!!!
B00723NWJE|2.0|I love Norah Jones to death just like the next guy...but MAN, this is like sitting in a torture chamber coffee house listening to some really bad, boring songs.  I'd rate this a \\"1 star\\" if it wasn't for the fact that it IS Norah Jones & she has an amazing vocal style.  Be honest, if this was the first album she put out 10 years ago...nobody would even know who she is right now.  Would have been swept under the rug unfortunately.<br /><br />Other than the fact that it's called \\"Good Morning\\", the first song is no way to jump start an album...maybe an ender...should have called it \\"Good Night\\".  The second song \\"Goodbye\\" is about as close to \\"upbeat\\" as the album gets.  Unfortunately, it's mired in a stupendiously annoying musical tinkling that is simply annoying & repetitive...\\"Da da da dat, duh duh dat, duh duh dat, duh duh dat\\"...grating.  The rest range from mediocre to poor...pretty much mundane, repetitive, unmemorable, lacking hooks & most criminally, boring.  This gal is gold...but this album isn't.<br /><br />Semi-decent cuts...\\"After The Fall\\" a Chris Issak-esque tune. \\"Happy Pills\\"...as close to \\"peppy\\" as this album gets.  \\"Little Broken Hearts\\"...a moody, semi-kinda cool deal.<br /><br />Now maybe if you were at some shady bar at 1 AM, with this droning on in the background...you could kinda dig it.  But only as background music.  Or maybe if you were trying to sleep one off...could be good.  It's so disappointing cause this woman has got the chops to rule the music world...and all you are left with on this one is droning, dirge-like mush.  Did I mention that I love Norah Jones?  I don't get it.  Would I see her \\"live\\", sure.  Would I love to see her act more, sure.  But this train went down the wrong track for me.<br /><br />As for the album cover...genius!  I mistakenly took the recreation of Russ Meyer's \\"Mudhoney\\" to mean this album would be like an indie spitfire....not the snoozefest it is.  Amazingly GREAT cover...too bad it doesn't translate to the music within.<br /><br />Time to lose this Danger Mouse cat.  Cut him loose on somebody else man.  Sorry dude, but this ain't cuttin' it brutha.  An experiment gone WAY wrong.  I've listened to it a bunch & have TRIED to convince myself I like it but this platter is gonna go on my dust pile whilst I await something worthy of Norah's talent.<br /><br />I have bought all but Norah's 1st album \\"sound unheard\\" without even sampling the goods before purchase.  With some artists you don't question it...you just buy it because they rule!  Guess I'll have to sample her stuff from now on...cause this one is a bummer.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally after waiting about 6 months temple run is on the market. the market its self on the kindle fire is really starting to get some good games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app for reading with lots of different versions to choose from. It has highlighting and bookmarks.  I love the search function.
0345803485|1.0|First of all, I would like to commend the author for having the courage to materialize her thoughts and have them published. It is also wonderful that women can use this book as a vehicle to discuss their sexuality. With that said, this is truly an appalling piece of work and if you have not yet purchased the trilogy, I would strongly recommend against it. I received the trilogy as a gift from a friend and was quite excited to read it because I have heard so much about it and especially since it was on the New York Times Bestsellers list. What a disappointment!! Note to self, not everything on the NY Bestsellers list is worth reading. The plot is predictable and unsophisticated, the characters one dimensional, and the writing extremely elementary and asinine. Truly, the writing belongs to that of a hormonal, pubescent schoolgirl who really should focus more in class. Overall, I feel quite victimized by this friend of mine who inflicted such an unacceptable piece of literature on me.
0345803485|1.0|What a terrible piece of literature. I thought Stephanie Myer couldn't be outdone with her description of a young, awkward clumsy girl getting wooed by a billionaire Adonis; however the publication of this high school girl's dream journal has completely one-upped the Twilight saga. Parts of this book made me ill (not the BDSM parts) but the parts where she decides that even though she doesn't like BDSM, she'll agree to get whipped and chained in hopes that one day Christian Grey will love her, and collapses crying like a child when he doesn't want her for anything more than sex. It's offensive to women, it's offensive to the BDSM community and it's a blackmark on modern literature.<br /><br />I did start to think of how many women will want to explore BDSM after reading this book, and how many of them will find out the hard way that it isn't all champagne and laptops and penthouse apartments with a handsome billionaire.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg this app is sooo amazing! I have been waiting for ever for this game to come out! omg super addicting!!!!!! I just love it! :D

B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game.  It is so fun to play you just want to play it over &amp; over.  Thanks for finally making it for Kindle Fire.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I got a note saying thanks for using me and to make a report. Imade a report and I hope whoever made the note is good P.S. This is the best app ever

B0086700CM|5.0|awesome a a a a a a a i i i i i i i i the the game is the best game ever
145162445X|5.0|I bought this book as soon as it came out hoping it would be just as good as Krauss's previous books and I was not disappointed. His writing is excellent and can reach those of us without physics degrees. He also throws in some humor here and there to make the read not only educational but fun as well! I would definitely recommend this book to everyone I know and have on several occasions.
B0086700CM|5.0|waited for a long time for this. now that its here I cant put it down even my family likes playing it
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I haven't noticed ads and the game is fun. the music is nice and there's a sort of plotline. there are also special tiles that can keep the game going.
B0001BDAQO|5.0|Jacques Loussier's affectionate take on Bach is a primary joy on the planet, and this all-time classic satisfies many musical appetites and aficionados!
0345803493|5.0|Excellent excellent read first book in a week had to get next too oh so fast cannot wate for the next one  grea great u got to read this one!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Where to begin. I kept fast forwarding in hopes the film would get better.  It didn't. Basically, Liam Neeson fights way out of frozen Alaska wilderness with band of misfit dregs of society after a plane crash while fending off one wolf attack after another.<br /><br />Here is a little sample of the dialogue.  Maybe you'll get the idea.<br /><br />Dreg of society guy one:  F---!!!<br /><br />Dreg of society guy two:  We're f----d!!<br /><br />Dreg of society guy three:  F--- me!!!<br /><br />Liam Neeson, directing venomous anger towards wolf:  Mother------!!!<br /><br />That's pretty much it for the duration of the film. Bad.  Really bad.
B004VBAHG6|5.0|It is quite different than other Peter Murphy albums. If you like his older stuff, you might not like it, but to me, it is a great album.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is by far my favorite version of Pride & Prejudice, and I've owned it on VHS, DVD, and now Blu Ray. Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy in my opinion. He does such a wonderful job of conveying what Darcy is thinking and feeling even without speaking - he is able to get so much across with his expressions alone. Jennifer Ehle is perfect as Elizabeth Bennet. She brings her wit, beauty, intelligence, and sense of fun to life. I never get tired of watching this film, with it's wonderful characters, beautiful costumes, and gorgeous scenery. Truly a gem in my opinion!
B005HV6YO8|5.0|Of course I had heard about Sting - but I hadn't listened to his songs. When I saw this album in the shops, I thought it would be a good idea to try it and am I glad I did! He has a long playlist of fantastic songs, the one more fantastic than the previous - all through the album. I replay the discs over and over and enjoy his music even more with time.
B00005YUBL|4.0|There's something truly catchy about these readings. The very opening of Schumann's 1st Symphony, catches us off guard with its power and dignity. Booming strings and whacking timpani from the Staatskapelle Dresden take their place in a musical landscape that seeks to reach fulfillment by sheer might. For Sawallisch, these are big creations that thrive when treated big.<br /><br />All the same, Sawallisch is predominately a classicist. Romantic excesses have no place in Sawallisch's world. We witness breathtaking displays of orchestral playing but Sawallisch has a very tight grip. Ultimately, these are literalist interpretations, ones that achieve their success through strict adherence to the score. These are performances that represent a bygone era of intensity, where conductors would lose their temper, breaking batons and violin bows (not that Sawallisch himself is a violent individual).<br /><br />I'm not sure how to rank these discs, because as much as enjoy the fire, I miss Schumann's sunny lyricism. Instead of letting us hear Schumann's freshness and abandon, the symphonies are transformed into solid creations, almost to the point of being statuary. Is anything gained by avoiding reference to the qualities that defined Schumann as a man, his wandering mind with a boundless nervous energy that ruined his fingers and later his mind? Other conductors find more emotion in these masterpieces; Bernstein and Harnoncourt, while hardly similar, are both gripping.<br /><br />In the end, the decision must lie with the listener, as there as much to attract us, only some people, including myself, ask for more flexibility.
0316044938|5.0|I must say without a doubt this is one of the best books I have read....The story is GREAT it keeps you interested until the end!! Such a wonderful joyful sad book to read!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|lots of fun. I suspect I am missing something but still fun. not far into game not sure of the objectives seemingly doesn't require strategy only quick responses.
B001KP2J3U|4.0|Though not quite as entertaining as the later EVIL UNDER THE SUN, NILE is one of those classy, colorful, all-star Agatha mysteries that you love to pop in on Sunday night as the last movie of the weekend.  I wish all the Poirot mysteries had featured Peter Ustinov AND David Niven.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games. very entertaining.  games for everyone.  love being able to get free coins.  I can play for hours. I would recommend this.
1400069289|5.0|In \\"The Power of Habit,\\" Mr. Duhigg uses interesting anecdotes to provide a background for how habits are formed and reinforced.  He also lays out a framework for understanding what drives our own day-to-day habits and the factors that can make changing those habits successful.
B0018BB21G|5.0|This is a classic of the 1960s, and a beautifully produced album.  I haven't been a big follower of the Moody Blues all the years they have been performing, but recently saw them on their \\"The Voyage Continues\\" tour, which I completely enjoyed, and decided to expand my collection of their CDs.  They were originally LP albums, of course, but I'm glad that someone has been putting this music onto CDs, for those of us who still like to play them.<br />This one really takes me back to the 60s -- at times reminiscent of The Beatles and sometimes a little like early Pink Floyd.  Well done, Moodies!
145162445X|5.0|I heard this man on a radio interview last week on CBC in Canada.  I bought his book and just finished it.  It was as interesting and challenging as I'd hoped.  Once in a while, it's nice to read a little science that hasn't been tainted by politics or religion.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is where I get my information for my show. I couldn't so it without this App. It makes my job so easy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy this app and would recommend it to anyone looking top expand their Bible knowledge. This is a great way to take the Bible with you.
0345803485|1.0|I love erotica books so when I found out this was one, I decided to read it. And the hype surrounding it had me wondering. I love being \\"in the know.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, this book is very boring and repetitive, like everyone says. The same phrases over and over. Characters are weird and somehow interwined in each others lives.  The sex scenes were cool at first but after while got long and boring and just had me saying \\"ummmm.\\"  And Anastacia climaxes so easy. I mean come on now; we all wish right?<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to any other erotica readers. I finished the book although I wanted to stop at the half point. Didn't want to feel like a loser so I finished; the only reason. I don't know who this author is but she definitely probably paid for the publicity; someway, somehow. Ain't hating but she got her money with a bad read.<br /><br />If you like erotica, read Zane books. She definitely deserves recognition and the scenes are amazing!
B0073PZIYI|4.0|Even though the movie has some flaws I still enjoyed it.  I thought the beginning of the plot was well done, you never really knew what was going to happen next.  However, at about the middle of the film it was obvious that the plot was more like a robin hood type of story.  Which I didn't like because the movie became a little predictable.  It also had some unrealistic scenes or events that normally wouldn't happen.  I would say more but I don't want to give away any spoilers.  Overall, I liked the movie.  It was creative and well done.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ive been waiting for like forever for this app to go on kindle fire. SO FUN!!!!!!!!!!! Temple run is amazing.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was very interesting.  Although it could have been written a little better, it still maintained my interest and made me want to find my own Mr. Grey!  I enjoyed this book so much that I also bought the other two, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.  It's full of desires that any woman would want but would not want to talk about.  Great book, I enjoyed it.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have always loved this app on ipod and now we have it on Kindle Fire! It's like the perfect game, it has great graphics, objectives, and powerups!!!!! Now all we need is instagram, jet pack joyride, and a few other things. GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!! :-) ;) :D
B0086700CM|4.0|Thought it was too fast for me, at first, but I am steadily improving...<br />Simple but challenging...and very fast paced!
145162445X|5.0|Being a Christian I was a little apprehensive to read. However, having a love for all things science I decided to give it a go. This book is absolutely fascinating and for me is my new go to reference to combat the stupidity that is traditional fundamentalism. It is wonderfully written and is a real tribute to our understanding of the natural world. I hope that you will pick it up and read because as it did for me it will change your perspective on just about everything.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is an amazing game! any one who will get it will love it!!!!!!!!! I have $300000!!!!! it is kind of like you as a mayor and you run the village and they pay you a rent for their homes:)
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS IS THE MOST ADDICTING GAME IN THE WORLD. I COULD PLAY IT FIRR HOURS ON END. YOU WONT BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN!
B006RED4GA|3.0|The total experience of this movie would be have been improved if the editors would have cut about 30-55 minutes of the slow and 'dead space' time.  The actors are good, the story ok (not unusual), the background music superb for enhancing suspense, but the pace crawls until the end.  I would have stopped half way through but I liked the young female actor and wanted to see what happened.
B004UXUUDA|1.0|I enjoyed the book, even though it wasn't perfect.  The movie skimmed across the top of all the issues without rhyme or reason for what was happening i.e Bertrand. I agree with another reviewer that said this should have been two movies, or better yet just one war era.  Isn't there enough contrived, sappy, predictable love stories on lifetime???<br /><br /> I was extremely annoyed when Richard Rainsferd, who is dying of cancer, rips off his oxygen mask and proceeds to sit on the side of the bed.  Also, another irksome bit was that Julia is seen getting out of the American Driver's side seat.  The acting of William Rainsferd was by far the most unrealistic.  The final scene of the movie put me over the edge.  I wish I had the part of my life back.
0062183591|5.0|We've all met people who self-righteously claim, \\"I never lie or steal.\\"<br />Yet they'll take a pen from the office or say that they can't go to the dinner because they're \\"busy\\" when they're really not.<br /><br />Many women claim, \\"Honesty and integrity is the most important thing in a relationship.\\" Meanwhile, if they ask you, \\"Does this dress make me look fat?\\" and you say, \\"Yes,\\" then they won't celebrate your honesty.<br /><br />Welcome to the human world - the world of lies and dishonesty.<br /><br />Dan Ariely uses simple, yet elegant, experiments to demonstrate how people cheat a little, how and why we lie, and what we can do to minimize such dishonesty.<br /><br />The main flaw with this book is the same flaw with all of Ariely's books (which I've read): that he uses few data points to draw his conclusions.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book caught my attention from the get-go! The characters were great, and so real, nothing fantasy about a story like this. You will not be able to put this book down, I cried, laughed, and LOVED these guys story! Pigeon and Travis were made for each other!
B0086700CM|4.0|it was an all around great game. I loved it and its just like the ipod version. the only thing I had trouble with was the tilting on the kindle fire. I don't know if its just me but that was my only concern. other than that I loved it!!
B007TS6H9O|4.0|By the looks of it, this release already has one flaw....where is Stole My Heart (their best song , in my opinion...)?? this is a huge disappointment for me but i guess i will still buy it because these guys have actual vocal talent (unlike many artists today).
B0086700CM|5.0|I want to have sex with the person who made this game because I like this game soo much!! I love you hunny
B000BYCAJE|5.0|The first time I heard this record in 1969 I was a freshman in high school and I was nervously experiencing my first stint at an overnight camp, Camp Falcon in Carrolton, Ohio, with a bunch of fellas I'd never met before. Marrakesh Express comes on the radio or the tape player and to this day in 2012, I'm back in the cabin listening with my new friends, wondering who these guys were and why we just kept singing this funky new tune. Sure, we had AM Radio with Tommy Roe, The Archies, Steam, Zager & Evans and other red hot one hit wonder bands around the time, but this record, and these three voices, stuck in my mind like glue. From the intense joy of listening to this remarkable record, we all moved on to the electric energy of Woodstock, then the overdone, overlong Four Way Street, to up & down solo careers, sub-par CDs, bad life stories and everything else... but it all started with this amazing recording. David Crosby is right that very few records come along that you can enjoy for hours after 20 years, or now, over 40 years, but this record is still fresh. Among the highlights; the remastered version brings Stills organ and other musical skills to the front on so many tunes, and Helplessly Hoping becomes the most beautiful harmonizing event ever recorded on the planet. While the initial CD sounds fine, this is a little bit finer. The extra cuts are OK but the value lies in the original material, no question. I'm not made out of money, but I've gotten my value, sonically and emotionally, from the three copies of the Vinyl I had, the original CD with less than stellar liner notes, and now this updated package. And this is such unforgettable music I honestly feel like I just bought a new CD! Ah, here's history... my order from Amazon also included John Mayer's new CD, Born & Raised, with a nice background vocal turn... by Graham Nash and David Crosby... Great music, sung by great artists, then and now.
1469984202|5.0|At the suggestion of an author I recently reviewed, I finally got around to reading Wool by Hugh Howey and was greatly pleased with the recommendation.  It seems I benefited from being a little late to the game as the first five stories had been bundled together while I procrastinated. This story is extremely well done from start to finish. I not only enjoyed it, but life pretty much came to a halt as I read it over the Memorial Day holiday. Another good indication of the story's quality is that I immediately purchased First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series) within hours of finishing because I'd run out of book and wasn't ready for the story to end. Wool was so well done. I was truly intrigued by the characters and found myself fully involved especially once Juliette's struggles began in this controlled and broken world of the silo. She was a great character - independent, intelligent, feisty, compassionate, loyal and willing to overcome any odds to survive against seemingly impossible odds. One of those characters who brings to mind the phrase indomitable will and I truly enjoyed this story from start to finish. Everything about this story was well done from social dynamics to the uncovering of the hidden truths. I can only suggest that you read it and hope that you enjoy the experience as much as I did. I'd give it more than a 5, but that's as high as the rating scale goes.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for ever for this app and I cant put it don't its awesome. I'm so addicted!!!! XD

B005LAIIRQ|2.0|If this film mirrors any part of nature, than I'd say it died from natural selection.<br /><br />After waiting a month to see this, and being a fan of survival movies, I finally caught it OnDemand on cable.<br />In my opinion, it was not worth the wait.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in the way the movie was depicted. Very vulgar language. To the point where every other word was \\"F---\\". It definitely took something away from the film for me.<br /><br />I understand the depressing nature of the film and what the director was trying to do, but when the language is way over the top like that, it stresses nothing. Everything ends up being vanilla. I get it - they're oil workers. OK, let's move on and develop the characters in the story.<br />When all is said and done, there was over 160 F words. Not necessary to deliver the point.<br />I could list dozens of other hard edged, intense movies that get the point across with out having to literally insert that much bad language into the script. Almost comical.<br /><br />I found it week in character development as well. Men running from wolves.<br />They die one by one. That was it. Other than Liam's character, no other character was well developed. I really didn't feel sorry for any of them.<br /><br />Half way through the movie I was convinced God made them crash to thin out the gene pool.<br />I was actually rooting for the wolves. By the time it was over, I wondered why I wasted two hours on a movie I got nothing from. Very hollow.<br /><br />To Liam's credit, he did a good job acting. But he was surrounded by other poor actors, and a depressing script with little chance of any redeeming features.<br /><br />This really felt like a dark, half-hearted effort, which could have been so much more.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nothing boring about these games. they will keep you entertained for a while. a little challenging but you will get the hang of it
145162445X|5.0|\\"Where did the universe come from?\\" is the basis of a conversation that is woven through the history of humanity. This book is an intelligent and intellectually stimulating response. Loved it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is coooool! !!<br />I love this game because it is solo addicting you will never want to stop playing
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game is awesome...until it freezes.  Then it resets and you can't play for hours or days at a time.  I put it up with it for awhile but it just got too frustrating.  I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it thinking that might help but it didn't.  If they can figure out how to stop it from freezing it would be BY FAR A FIVE STAR APP!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is so fun!!!! I have it on my iphone and I loved it!! I jut got it on the kindle fire and now I cant stop playing!!!!!!!!! its sooooooo fun!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very rare problems its fun for my Kindle Fire especially on long trips. Very few glitches I do wish for more variety when unlocking games.
145162445X|5.0|This book is simply amazing. After reading I have a much deeper understanding of the subject matter and am delighted that this was assigned reading for one of my classes.
1455510319|5.0|Lately, I have been reading historical narrative books so I look forward to reading Michael Connelly, The Fifth Witness. I saw the movie , LIncoln Lawyer and I have read Connelly books before, The Scarecrow and The Poet. I like him as a writer.  I love the fact he was an investigative reporter before and  I love his easy writing style. It flows and keeps you interested. The Fifth Witness- I give it an A overall and the ending, I give it a A-.<br /><br />The story is a simple one of a banker who oversaw the foreclosures was murdered and one of the clients that their house was going to foreclosure on-Lisa Trammel who protested the bank and even got a restraining order against her becomes the lead suspect.  She hires Mickey Haller for a lawyer. Mickey law practice goes into a recession too and he begins to help homeowners who are being foreclosed. Lisa Trammel was his client for foreclosure and now he represent her for a murder rap.  I learned a lot about the foreclosures and the process and strategy of the legal battles. For example, I love how you give tabs of when the judge give the prosecutor a yes on one of her request, now, you think the judge owes you one and you play your cards accordingly and he gives you one. The pick your battles mentality comes into play here. I learned that the prosecution is like the home team in sports, they have the edge especially closing arguments, they start and they end, the defense is in the middle.<br /><br />When I put the book down, I couldn't wait to start reading again that's how I know this was an great book. I like the characters, Haller is an interesting person, pushes the envelope and wins at all cost, even if it means using what his daughter said- to win some points with the prosecution. I get a kick out of Haller having a driver,Rojas and how his office is is Lincoln Car. I knew that when I saw the movie, The other characters are Cisco, the Biker, he is the investigator and the enforcer and the rookie, Bullocks , new lawyer right out of law school are all pretty interesting. I know there is history that I am not aware of like his ex-wife Maggie, there were probably stuff that readers that follow the story was aware of that I wasn't. But that did not matter. I love the story, the twists and the schooling of the foreclosures and the legal maneuvering.<br /><br />The book is an A. Great story, you learn a few things along the way and keeps you interested throughout the book. I gave it a A- for the ending. It was good but I was expecting wow like the book. I definitely recommend it and especially now that is in paperback.yer right out of law school are all pretty interesting.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I read Slammed about nine months ago and I am a little ashamed that I am just now writing a review. I have read it twice since then and it only gets better with every reading. I have read over 250 books this year and Slammed is most definitely in the top five. It is such a gorgeous story. You can't really classify the genre because it encompasses so much. Will and Lake are such well written characters. Actually every character in the book is written so true to life and completely human and real. I also want to give a personal thank you to Colleen Hoover for introducing me to the Avett Brothers. Their lyrics only added to the beauty and depth of the story.
B0086700CM|5.0|so fun!!! absolutely love it!!! I play it all the time and stay up waaaay too late because I just can't stop.
B000002HMH|1.0|There are very few people or bands that can keep their integrity after they have \\"Made It\\".  Usually the \\"money, fame, and fortune\\" goes to their heads resulting in the death of whatever spark manifested istelf in them to allow them to create or do the great things they did to get them to that position of greatness.<br /><br />Unfortunatly, Metallica is a textbook example of a great force against evil that at one time condemned the slack, lifeless, greedy warmongers of the world that just wanted to suck your blood dry for a penny. They sold out the true principles of Rock N' Roll and turned their backs on the very people who believed in their music and message and joined the very people they were previously denouncing.<br /><br />They joined the POP world which includes such insipid, ludicrous, vamps as Madonna and Lady Gaga.  In short, they became greedy businessmen with only one concern and that was to make money.  This cd is the absolute turning point were one can hear their degradation into the mediocrity of the pop world.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|I liked this book, but..... At times it was repetative, some cliches. I got a bit tired of the characters. Not really that many surprises, one could figure out where it was going. I liked it, but didn't love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love most of the games in the pack. However, some games are difficult to control on my Kindle so I have not been able to beat those.  The sushi game is my favorite.  I think this pack is pretty great!
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|If I want to see how miserable life can be without any hope of redemption I will just turn on the news next time.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Personal story of a person born, raised, and escaped from a political/cultural prison in North Korea. Insight to life in prison from \\"education\\", lack of food, clothing, education, and effects of isolation of outside world news has on a person. A true education of withholding everything and how it effects your health and point-of-view.<br /><br />At times, I felt his pain and was walking with him when he escaped North Korea through China and then through South Korea to the USA.<br /><br />Many of his thoughts and memories reminded me of the stories I read about WWII prison camps and prison camps in general.<br /><br />An easy read, but captive story.
B0086700CM|5.0|My son requested this game for our kindle and the entire family enjoys playing it- even our 3 year old! Very fun!
B0072NWJRK|1.0|I was not able to download the purchase. It turns out that Kindle does not work on wifi in numerous countries. One of them is the Philippines.<br />This is not disclosed on the Kindle website. A friend can download in Finland but not in Sweden. I will purchase a wire to connect the Kindle to my laptop next time I am in the States. I should also be able to download via wifi there.
1475143389|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I loved it. What I really liked about the book is that the author doesn't try to sell you on some magic pill, or magic plan. He cuts all the BS out and just gives you the straight facts. From my experience, the straight facts are what works. So if you're tired of spending endless amounts of hours in the gym with no results, I really suggest you read this book. You won't regret it.<br /><br />On a side note, I had some questions about my workouts. The author provides his personal email in the book and I decided to write to him to see if he would respond. Not only did he respond, but he gave me a very detailed and informative answer. It showed he really cares and is not just about selling books to make money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|l like it but you have to have points to unlock new games. l like the shsui game, but a lot of the games are hard to figure out.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Anyone who demerits this album because it's \\"not like his previous music\\" is a tasteless moron.<br /><br />You can still clearly get an upbeat Jason Mraz vibe from the songs, except that this brings musicianship and melodic depth to a whole new level for the artist. I fully expect this to win awards throughout the year, just as John Mayer did with Continuum. Even Jason's voice shows increased maturity in his control and restraint, making vibrato and pitch changes far more effective.<br /><br />As far as musicianship, the album features fantastic use of a brass section, strings, and excellent keyboard work that first appeared on We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things. The studio quality is utterly impeccable with real-to-life acoustic guitar and electric guitar tones that have a raw, classic blues feel. From start to finish, there is a beautiful smoothness that resonates with you.<br /><br />This album will certainly broaden Jason Mraz's usual appeal to a much wider audience, as great music tends to do. Pick this up not only if you're a Jason Mraz fan, but if you simply like excellent musicianship and vocals.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids and I have a GREAT time switching off and playing. See who can get the bear score. So many games to choose from.
B0086700CM|5.0|As many other Kindle owners like myself have been waiting for Temple Run are finally glad it is here!It is a fun app.Has no lag or glitches I have seen.So far I am impressed!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|Some people said it would not download to there Kindle but it Downloaded to mine. It is also a great game passes time quickly.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|\\"The Black Ice\\" was a totally good read.  From beginning to end, it keeps the reader engaged and working the case.  I am not much of a detective, but I didn't get the sense of predictability.  There was some foreshadowing, but that's how writers tease us all.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Wonderful album. Great songs and faultless vocals.<br /><br />Good mix of songs on the album, up-tempo and ballads. The fact that rebecca co-wrote them makes this debut even more incredible.
B00846REIS|5.0|Well, I've read Fifty Shades Trilogy & I admit that was hot too, but this book STAYS WITH YOU. It's a book I want to read again & again. Yep, the sexual banter is terrific! I originally ordered on my Kindle but I just pre-ordered the paperback for my library because I feel it's a book worth having. Thanks Sylvia for a great read. The H/h are flawed, mercurial(both), passionate(you know, just plain HOT!) Buy it!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|GREAT! season, definitely worth buying it. Good quality playing on amazon's part 99% of the time, I only had a problem with one episode playing for awhile(about 5mins not a big deal at all). If your into Breaking Bad and you haven't seen this season yet then I don't know what your waiting for just a fantastic season.
0385535139|5.0|This was definitely one of Grisham's best books in years; The Confession, while a good story, made me wonder if Grisham was going to start becoming repetitive and falling flat. I was reluctant to read this one, but I finally did and was pleasantly surprised - this book restored my confidence.  While the story is \\"nothing special\\" (i.e. it's a standard tort case), the characters were AMAZING.  I loved the characters, they made for a very amusing, and at times heartwarming, read.  I am much more inclined to read his next legal novel.<br /><br />On the other hand, I wish the amusement hadn't relied so heavily on ethical violations and unethical behavior.  I am reading more and more novels that really on unethical behavior (and in this case staggeringly unethical behavior - my jaw dropped at times) to engage the audience.  I feel that this reinforces the negative view the public has of lawyers, and I think that does both lawyers and society a disservice.  I think some people believe this behavior to be the norm, rather than a severe outlier.<br /><br />On the other hand, this book does an excellent job of showing two of the different strata of legal society; the big firms and the small firms.  Most people don't realize how colossal the difference is, and how hard some small time firms struggle to make do (and  how hard the lawyers in the big firms work for those big bucks), so I appreciated that.<br /><br />Overall, as a recent law graduate and long time Grisham fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and have renewed faith in Grisham's work.  Keep them coming, but maybe try to engage the audience without reinforcing so many stereotypes!
B0086700CM|3.0|it lags a lot on my kindle fire. but cant complain as its free<br />do sumthin abt it<br />I sud liv to see this issue fixed
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved these books. I couldn't put them down. I hope Mia is going to get her own book.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game may seem simple and not very fun but once you start you cant stop until you beat your best score you wont ever want to stop I promise!!!!
B004SEUJNM|3.0|I imagine most sports fans like the \\"Rocky\\" storyline.  I like the Blu-ray Book concept and have purchased several classics in that format.  The quality of the \\"Rocky\\" blu-ray was not as good as I had expected.  The picture was a bit grainy.  But since I was mainly interested in adding \\"Rocky\\" to my movie collection, I can live with the average quality; and the $10 Blu-ray Book price was a deal.
B0086700CM|5.0|totally addictive! !  crazy fun and FREE!!! I just know you will love playing too!  try it out kinds like Indians Jones on steroids lol! !!
B0078N2T8I|1.0|Please let my loss be worth something.  Seriously. this is 2 hours I will never get back... The acting was great, the story had great potential, but too long and TEDIOUS to watch, and the ending was not worth the wait.  It had Such potential, like a real \\"Noahs Ark\\" type story but this was just down right painful.  Augh, I feel like anyone giving this over a 1 star is probably looking at it from some cinematic avante art student way and the botton line is it was not that entertaining.  Sooo dissapointed.
B0086700CM|4.0|I'll have to agree with another reviewer that most of the reviews seem suspiciously similar. I'm not much of a game player, but for FREE, I was curious enough to check it out.  It crashed my Fire the first time and froze briefly another time. Haven't played it enough to tell if that will be the norm. I did think it was fun. Because i'm a relatively poor game player, I especially liked that it varied where I started each time I died rather than forcing me to do the same thing over and over and over till I mastered it.
B007SGM084|1.0|not buying this till price drops. this is way too expensive. you can buy the books cheaper. shame of you
B003L77G10|5.0|It is so enjoyable to watch a great show without commercials and to rewatch what you did not understand or see the first time on regular TV. Then I share it with others!
1878424505|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is beginning their Spiritual Awakening. There is so much truth in this little book, it is another spoke on the wheel. It's easy to read and to comprehend. I will purchase more and give them away as gifts...Thank you
B007J4T2G8|1.0|TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  UNLESS YOU ARE A TEENAGER, I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS BEING A BEST SELLER.  TOTALLY OVER COME WITH BOREDOM VERY QUICKLY.  IT STARTED OUT FUNNY, THEN A FEW PAGES LATER I PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND TWO WEEKS LATER I'M STILL TRYING TO READ IT BECAUSE I PAID WAY TOO MUCH FOR IT.  I KEEP THINKING IT WILL GET INTERESTING BUT SO FAR, BLAH. [[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
1455502626|2.0|The main character in this book is a horribly sexist homicide detective who in the real world would have been drummed out (and probably jailed) for blatant disregard for the constitution.  All female characters are \\"hot.\\" The plot is as thin and contrived as the action scenes. Nothing to recommend here.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is definitely a must read. I have enjoyed reading this book from start to finish. It keeps you entertained for hours.
0345803507|3.0|This trilogy is about a pervert who uses his childhood as an excuse to sexually abuse women. Until he 'falls in love' with Ana. But she's too young to know that what he is doing to her is sick. What woman whats to be treated like this? When she finally leaves him in the first book, I thought things would get better, but no, in the second book she goes back to him. The third book is the best book, story-wise, but again when Christian goes off on a tirade I thought Ana would ask for an annulment, and walk away for good. But, no, again. I think Nora Roberts' Female Characters are stronger than Ana. Just because a man is rich and handsome doesn't always make him a decent human being.
B0086700CM|5.0|ci habe been waiting for temple run for android since, forever! cant believe it is finally available and free. great job developers. ( would give it more than 5 stars if possible)
B0086700CM|5.0|addicting! I can not put this game down! I totally reccomend it! sometimes a little frusterating when I mess up but its worth it!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love it its about time they got temple run for the kindle so happy i play it like all the time you should get it
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I luv this app! You can look at sattilites in Earth's orbit, including the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. Also you can look at almost every star around you even in the day. Best .99&cent; my mom's debit card has spent!!!
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Received this DVD (on time)and put it in the DVD player the next day. It came like it said \\"Brand New\\". Played all the way through the movie without any glitching or pausing. I think this movie sends a very good message, even to someone who is for the death penalty. \\"God forgives anyone, you just have to ask\\" this movie shows that very well! Excellent 5 stars I give this product
B0086700CM|5.0|Ah! Finally this game came out for the Kindle Fire. I'm so thrilled that if finally came out. It could be a tinsy bit laggy at times. Other than that, its great. Must have!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|good for cross platform organization, can access from anywhere and read it on the go. nice interface. two more words
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The precept of this book is deplorable: young, hungry people killing each other for the amusement of the bored well-to-do. The book is almost sheer violence, somewhat offset by 'teen and family affection. I stuck with it to the end, but have no desire to read a next in the series. The writing is somewhat immature, like a young writer not yet having reached her best work.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I just got Rome and I was surprised Bookset quality.<br /> Impressive for its printed images, the quality of finish and have that could well be the best series in my opinion.<br /> Confirmed audio in Castilian, but with a poor Dolby 2.0, but with a 1080p picture quality second to none.<br /> Worth spending a little more and take this series with this issue.
B0086700CM|5.0|Amazon FINALLY got temple run!! I have been waiting so long for it!! Its tons of fun and the graphics are great.  Its pretty addicting and its just fun to play!! If you want a fun game... get temple run.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ive played the game before and loved it, I have the Lg optimus T P509 phone,and it says its compatible. I go to download it and it always says application not installed.  Any ideas why or how to fix this?
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game woo freakeenn mucchhh it is sobgoodd love it h h's sis sj sj sud she jaw wj
B007URCTOG|3.0|The movie was okay. I felt the story was good but just so many unfinished pieces in the movie that was just a let down for me. It started off well but slowed down then stayed slow and then tried to fit in stuff. It was a really sweet real life story I am sure but I felt like they could have done things better with the movie. Of course it is hard not to like a movie with Channing in it I did feel like some of his parts were choppy which was not his fault just the fault of the story line. Still nice to see.
B004XJHBCE|4.0|...performance improvements are badly needed. FO shortcuts often take seconds to open on my dual-core DX2 with nothing else running in the background.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This movie was well made and I thought Daniel Radcliffe done a wonderful job with this. Which he has done lots in theatrical since Harry Potter but I have not seen anything but this. I really thought the movie was thought out well it is based on a book and I loved the ending. It was suspensful and was not what you would say scarey by no means but creepy. I knew I had to see it when my son walked in after watching with his mouth open and could not say anything. I like the time period which I am guessing is 1918-1919 not sure though. The house is beautiful propes were great and Daniel done an awesome job and was no Harry Potter, He played his part and he played it well. I think this one is definatly worth you time to check out.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This has always been a great app and one I use all the time, but now it is even better!  I use the app for reading and study of religious material primarily.  I like to highlight certain items using specific colors, it always annoyed me that I couldn't hit the same color each time in the color wheel.  Now with the &quot;last chosen&quot; colors being listed I can have a regular and consistent set of highlighter colors.  Thanks for this wonderful app.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|I really was not expecting much out of this movie. My son and husband wanted to see it and so I rented it and I watched the whole thing which was pretty good for me to do if it is a movie that my son wants to watch. The ending was even good what else can I say. For a low budget I thought it was done exceptionally well. I do not like movies filmed the way this one was and usually turn them off immediatly but it did not bother me. Hey it is worth the rent.
B0086700CM|2.0|the graphics need to be better and there needs to be less lags on the kindle fire this would male the game much better
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I first downloaded it because I had thought it was like the original Oregon Trails I had once remembered playing in elementary school. Even though it wasn't close to what I had expected, I find myself using my kindle just so I can play this app.<br /><br />I dont have anything bad to say about this app, Im actually quite glad I haven't experienced any of the problems other users are experiencing. I dont know how far other users are, but Ive  been playing for awhile, level 50 (like I said... ifs addicting) and the only thing I had about this game are the disasters that happen randomnly. You have to pay real cash to avoid them or take serious hits to your city. It just sucks how much they pressure you to buy the cash. I refuse to spend real money on this game so I constantly find myself always being short  coins.<br /><br />One thing to remember when playing this game is to  cherish your lumber! lol I was just hacking away at them becausw they were just in the way, but I didnt realize how much I needed it for weaponz and medicines. So know Im just waiting for coins to expand where I have some trees, or wait til the trees I planted to reach full growth... which is taking forever!
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been waiting for this for a long time!! I like how its so big and I can see everything!
0345803485|4.0|Good read.  Fast read.  Hot & Steamy.  Very graphic so, must keep away from children.  It isn't my usual type of book to read but, I have enjoyed parts I & II so far.  I'm just starting part III.  I think if I had known what it was about and how graphic it was, I may not have picked it up.  I'm glad I didn't know!!!

B006Z7Z3R2|2.0|For months leading up to my viewing of this film, all I heard was how clever and creepy and worth-my-time it is.  Am I missing something?  This seemed like pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.  I agree with many fans of Ti West that he is a talented director who knows how to exercise restraint (House of the Devil was really good) and give his films character.  However, despite the good direction, atmosphere and acting, I can't get past the fact that the ghost story in The Innkeepers was nothing I haven't seen before.  Unless, like I said, I missed something.  I watched this with a good friend whose opinions are pretty close to my own, and he agreed with me that House of the Devil was much better than The Innkeepers.  If you're a fan of this type of ghost story, and you're a bit older than the twenty-something set (like me), then you've probably spent a lot of time watching ghost stories just like this.  Throwing a bit of ambiguity into the story near the end didn't do much to help its plot, either.  I don't know, maybe someone out there can tell me what's sailing over my head because I just don't get why so many people are rallying around this movie.  I just felt it wasn't that good even though I really, really wanted to like it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very responsive weather app.good graphics with accurate forecast. small footprint so it does not slow down the operating system, good stuff
B0058EBNAO|5.0|it has all the weather info I need. easy to use.  great UI, graphics and widget. I love the weather clock.
B005Z28M58|2.0|Friends, Lost, Will & Grace, 6 Feet Under, Sex and the City all had such moving, touching finales. Whomever I speak to about these particular shows can quickly recall a moment where they cried or felt a pulling of their heartstrings at closure. In all honesty, as a full fledged fan since the Pilot episode...I don't think I ever got that feeling from the final episode of DH.<br /><br />MYSTERY- So if I go ahead and confess to a crime I didn't commit...the police is just gonna take my word for it? Prosecution didn't bother to look further into the credibility of a belligerent woman hopped up on morphine pills. She could be screaming that she's Anastasia, Heir to the Romanov Dynasty and they're just gonna believe her? Even with the incriminating evidence of Bree's conversation with Ben, \\"the people\\" are just going to drop all charges in a snap? I find it laudable that it wasn't even diminished to an accomplice to murder, withholding evidence, and/or improper disposal of a body. The neat and tidy way this was all wrapped up in under 30 minutes makes a joke out of our judicial system. If this was just for the sake of entertainment, I have to admit this fainting in the courtroom stint has already been done before by Renee Zelwegger in Chicago and it worked better! Where as she was nominated for an Oscar in this role, I'm sorry Marcia Cross but better luck next time.<br /><br />SUSAN- I still think it was a terrible idea to kill off Mike and I've yet to find a fan who is fully on board or accepting of this decision. It's obvious it was a hasty creative choice done solely to prove a point during the off screen legal battles with Nicollette Sheridan. Who ended up suffering? The character of Susan and the fans...and it most certainly wasn't for the better! Which is why there was no flash forward for her, how much of a happy ending can she get?<br /><br />GABRIELLE- Does anyone find it odd that after the jury found out the man was her child-molesting stepfather, nobody reallycared for that fact? Shouldn't she be liable to more questioning as a suspect of sorts? How is it she was at the center of this year's mystery and got off without a scratch? Can't say I was surprised about their move to L.A.<br /><br />BREE- We are made to believe a republican who moved to Kentucky just won her local elections without a hitch? With all the skeletons that resurface from our everyday politician's closets, how is it her promiscuous sexual past, 3 marriages, DUI, adultery, gay son, daughter w/ an out-of-wedlock baby, and becoming tabloid fodder for a major criminal case where she was tried for MURDER not pose a threat to her standing in the poles? Even 1 of those things would be enough to slander your ability to run for office. Secondly, that union between Trip & her was so contrived. It felt forced and just a desperate attempt to give her a man at the last minute. After her long track record I think it would have been beautiful to see how she has realized she doesn't need to be co-dependent and to focus on her career instead of getting laid. It would have been more suitable to leave her as the happy independent woman with the world as her oyster rather than Susan. Finally, we've only known this guy for 3 episodes...why would Marc Cherry find a need to do this?<br /><br />LYNETTE- If at gunpoint I had to pick the most heart warming moment...it'd be a stretch, but I say it was the scene with Tom & Lynette. Very sweet, but by no means a tear-jerker. How funny that she only said like 3 lines and it was Tom who took it away. That said, it made no sense to me why on Earth Katherine would ask her of all people to be the head CEO of her food franchise American branch. Bree didn't seem like the most appropriate person to turn to? Your supposed best friend, knows all about cooking for the masses/croissants & french pastries, etc. Not to mention the fact that Bree was the head of her own company and managed to run said company until it was taken from her. How befitting for Katherine to help her friend get her foot back in the game while accomplishing her own plans. A love interest is not what Bree needed...a new start and chance is what was in order. Instead Lynette was her first choice, a woman who never ran a company but was vice president of a marketing firm. She knows about advertising and maybe pizza establishments, not corporate food service & delicacies!<br /><br />EDIE- Marc Cherry tried everything in his power to have his audience forget Edie Britt. To the point where it was so apparent and obvious that she was blatantly excluded from the final scene. Ultimately his plan backlashed though, instead his efforts further fueled the fan's memories of this beloved character who aptly noticed her absence. So in wanting us to forget & ignore, everyone did the complete opposite! If he truly wanted to keep his word and make an \\"homage to ALL the characters of wisteria lane\\", this capable writer could have found a creative way to incorporate the major characters who are missed without necessarily needing the actors to be there themselves. With this scenario he chose to keep, it limited our choices as to how to do characters such as Edie Britt justice. In light of the legal matters off screen and this creative route he forced upon us, the viewer's hands were tied in terms of this finale moment & Edie Britt. Rather Ellie the drug-dealer from Season 5 gets a mention...rude, rude, rude!<br /><br />KATHERINE- Dana Delany specifically requested to Marc (and was very vocal in interviews) about wanting to keep Katherine a lesbian if she were to return. Is there a reason why he ignored her input? If getting Julie Benz as Robin was a problem, couldn't we have said she just stayed back in Paris to hold down the fort? There you go, instant happy ending for Katherine! Instead, he turned her into a wishy washy, flip-flopping hazbian who becomes rich, snobby, & stuck up. How is this a great ending to a character of so many layers who starred in this series for 3 years? BTW, I love how they didn't bother to tell her Mike died...this didn't cross any of the girl's minds?<br /><br />OTHER CHARACTERS- It was a long time coming, but Renee finally grew on me by the finale with that hilarious moment when she snapped at Ben in the sweaty wedding dress. Although it was quite random and unexplained why Julie (of all people) was in the limo...I don't think I ever saw those 2 interact. Meanwhile the maid of honor was missing, but I do have to commend Renee for all she did in the courtroom. If I was in her shoes and my partner was being deported, I would have done the same. These women were such flaky \\"friends\\" to her. I'm sad the viewers didn't get to find out what happened to Bob & Lee, a quick little reference of their daughter would have sufficed. Unfortunately this was not to be, Marc Cherry figured we were more interested in watching Trip chase after Bree and buying old record players. BTW, where was MJ during the wedding/childbirth moments? Where was Lynette's baby? Her speech when she declared \\"to remembering...\\" is very ill-timed when it seems all the housewives can't seem to remember they have young ones in the family that need to be tended to. As an afterthought, what happened to Chuck's partner who wouldn't rest until Bree was behind bars? His cries for vengeance were only the cliffhanger for every episode in the latter half of this season, then he gives up? And was the drama with the girl moving into Susan's house absolutely crucial?<br /><br />Sadly, Marc Cherry claims he's had this well thought-out ending sequence since the premise of the series was initially created years before being picked up by ABC. If that's the case, I am highly disappointed. So many speedy conclusions, all too convenient, the rest was riddled with inconsistencies, holes in the plot,<br />unaddressed/forgotten issues, dropped storylines, and improper farewells to women we've gotten so invested in. While the attempt was duly noted, this series ending will never stand in the likes of the hardhitters of iconic endings like the ones mentioned at the beginning of this dissertation. And no amount of cliffhangers from characters we're never gonna get to know in the last 5 minutes of the show will distract from what was sorely lacking. Friend & family ask why I'm so disillusioned by this and can't just let it be, it's because I've gotten so involved. The response I get is \\"it's just entertainment, it's just a show, Marc Cherry & his writers simply stopped trying\\". To add insult to injury, we know these absurdly over-payed actress' couldn't care less, they've got their careers and future to worry about and in the meantime are laughing all the way to the bank!!!! So I'm glad everyone involved with the network ends up with a happy ending, while the actual story (the artistry) and the viewers who kept them alive during the low periods are left with a piece of their hearts ripped out...and not in the poignant sort of way (more like the Hollywood uses you and spits you out sorta way). So thank you for all the good times Desperate Housewives, there are parts of you I will miss and most certainly the rest that I'm most relieved to get rid of =(.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|A great puzzle game. Well crafted, and a joy to play. I just received an update with even more puzzles. Thanks!

1451648537|5.0|I didn't feel compelled to write a review until I finished the book, so here it goes...<br /><br />Overall, I liked the way the story was told.  It started off with a personal introspect into the early years of Steve's life, however, about halfway through, it read more like a history of Apple, Inc. than a biography about the company's co-founder.  However, the way the story finished was very moving.  The author tied together the culmination of Steve Jobs the person, the visionary, the father/husband, the CEO into a very compelling story worth reading.<br /><br />He may not be the most \\"likeable\\" person, but you can't deny that he had arguably more impact and influence on our society and the \\"digital age\\" than any other person in the past century.  He is right up there with the likes of Henry Ford and Albert Einstein.  Steve Jobs' legacy will be remembered for years (decades, centuries?) as one of the greatest that shaped the way we live and interact with technology. His passion and convictions were undeniable in shaping who he was, and the visions he pursued.<br /><br />It was a great biography and life story of one of the most compelling figures of our lifetime and worth reading, Enjoy!

0345803485|3.0|I read it, and yes, this book will bring out your \\"inner goddess\\" but I have a feeling its also a bit unhealthy in the sex-ed department.  I cannot get on board with abuse, no matter how erotic it seems.  The author of this book is obviously not a professional.  It is very poorly written, and repetitive.  I got extremely tired of the same words over and over, and the lack of communication in the obviously unhealthy relationship.  And she really should have put more effort into learning about Americans and the way they speak and their day to day lives before trying to write a book about them.  So many british terms and slang, that it doesnt make sense for an american to say it.  And you cannot pull $50 out of an ATM at your bank.  That irritated me.  Read the books if you want to spice up your sex life, but dont read them if your looking for an amazing novel.

0439023513|1.0|The first two books had great touches, despite the undertone of children forced to kill children.<br /><br />There were great touches here, too, but Mockingjay had several sub-plots that went nowhere.<br /><br />In order to lay these points out, I have to:<br />***MAJOR SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />I'm not disappointed because we didn't get a fairy-tale ending (Katniss's children playing on a graveyard certainly doesn't qualify as a fairy-tale ending), it's because of the disappearing storylines.<br /><br />Since I'm a guy, the Katniss-Peeta-Gale triangle was tedious, but after the build-up, Katniss should've chosen one over the other.  That Gale move away meant that this conflict just disappeared.<br /><br />Annie is shown to be mentally disturbed, but when we learn that she had a baby, she seems normal, with no explanation as to how that happened.  Was it Finnick's death and the birth of her baby that settled her down?  Or something else?  No explanation.<br /><br />The 7 surviving GAMES victors vote to hold a GAMES involving the Capitol's children (including President's Snow's granddaughter), to inflict on them the pain they inflicted on the whole country for 75 years.  But then nothing further happened with this.  Coin's death should not have affected this vote.<br /><br />While Boggs lay dying, he told Katniss to \\"do what you came to do,\\"  which showed how intuitive he was.  He also said \\"don't trust them.\\"  This also shows great insight on his part as we learn about Coin.  But he also told her to kill Peeta, who at this point was still unstable.  This hinted at what would've been a confrontation second only to Katniss vs. Snow.  Instead, it fizzled out into absolute nothingness.<br /><br />But perhaps the biggest disappointment involved Snow's death.  While waiting for Katniss to exact punishment on him for all the suffering he inflicted on the country in general and on Katniss in particular, he simply keels over, depriving Katniss (and the reader) of the satisfaction of seeing him get a measure of justice.<br /><br />So even in death, he stands victorious over Katniss.

B0086T71MM|5.0|i've read the other reviews here and i have a bit of a different take on this episode.  what really stands out for me is the sense of entitlement which wholly engulfs some characters and the way it has thoroughly rotted their characters.  the most obvious two are roger and pete.  they hate one another yet are cut from the same cloth.<br /><br />roger inherited his job and money from his father.  he feels owed anything he desires. the proposition made to joan is going to affect his wealth so there is no other thought but that she should do it, even if she is the mother of his child.<br /><br />pete came from old money and family.  they lost the money but he married for money to climb back up. every \\"sacrifice\\" he's had to make climbing back up annoys him greatly.  he shouldn't have to put up with this, he feels.  any sacrifices others have to make don't matter as long as they don't inconvenience him.<br /><br />meagan is a much more charming and beautiful version of the same.  she knew what the deal was, that she marry don and reap the considerable benefits of being married to a wealthy and powerful man in exchange for being a stepmother on weekends and primarily his wife the rest of the time. first. she feels entitled to be an ad agency pitch person and now she feels entitled to become an actress even if it means three months out of town and neglecting her other duties.  some reviewers feel don is being sexist for being against this but i feel she is violating their basic contract with one another. she is not entitled to these dreams. she could have made sacrifices to achieve them instead, like the legions of waiters/actors who surround her. instead, she expects don to sacrifice so she can achieve her newest dream (he already made it possible for her to achieve her ad account dream with no struggle up the ladder). there is also no indication that she has any talent at acting. so she is expecting sacrifice by others for what may well be a mediocre talent.<br /><br />around these three are the people who have sweated for one reason or another to get where they are.  often, sheer talent and/or perseverance alone has kept them afloat.  just a few of these are: peggy, ginsberg, don, and joan.<br /><br />there are obviously other things going on in this episode but this is what really stood out for me. i think it is a marvelous parable on the dangers of a sense of entitlement. all three of these characters also manage to burn through their relationships because they are never satisfied with what they have, they always feel they are due more in a spouse or significant other.<br /><br />as an added note, i don't think it is a coincidence that the jaguar car is most likely to appeal to one of these entitled characters instead of the ones who've had to claw their way up the ladder. they would feel entitled to own such beauty and could care less about its impracticality (mechanically faulty).  it is don from the hard scrabble background who sneers at it and its humongous toolkit.  remember, don could fix a faucet with his bare hands, not the entitled pete with his huge toolbox of wrenches.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0307730697|5.0|The \\"Raw\\" in my review title describes how open Adam Brown's family was in giving information about their loved one to the author, Eric Blehm.  I am a good friend of Adam's older brother and I can tell you that everything you read in this book is completely accurate. Many things that Adam's parents could have easily left out were included.  They did not let their pride or shame keep them from telling Adam's compelling story. The Brown's also open up into their spiritual beliefs and how their faith in Christ helped them, even when they had given up on Adam. You will be moved by their pure honesty.<br /><br />The \\"Relentless\\" refers to everything Adam was about.  He just never gave up on anything.  He wouldn't accept failure at anything, it just was not in him to do so.  In an interview his dad said, \\"Some would have called Adam a strong willed child, but in Arkansas we called it hard-headed!\\".  I believe it was partly due to Adam's relentless nature, that he was able to work his way up to the DEVGRU unit of the Navy Seals.<br /><br />And lastly, the \\"Patriotism\\" refers to Adam's love for his home.  He was proud to be from the United States of America.  He was honored to protect our freedoms, even if it meant risking his own life.  Adam Brown was not afraid to die for us, especially if it meant taking down another bad guy in the war on terrorism.  He was Fearless.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who had anything to do with this book coming to fruition!

B003QTUQGU|2.0|It's been a long time since I watched the original Alice in Wonderland and I was never all too partial to it so I went into this not biased against a remake. I didn't see this in the theaters and didn't see this in 3D (just did the Instant Video just now) and I found it rather boring.<br /><br />I didn't particularly care what was happening to Alice. It was visually stunning but it wasn't enough to keep my interest. In fact, I kept wondering about the real world and how Alice was going to answer Hamish and deal with her cheating brother-in-law more than I cared about her killing the Jabberwocky. I mean, it's obvious she would become the real Alice at the end, and take up the mantle of the Champion so of course she was going to kill the damned monster. There was no urgency to the story since it was so predictable. And that made it quite boring in my mind.<br /><br />But maybe the 3D effects would have made up for the lackluster plot, like it did with Avatar. But since I didn't see it with them, I came out of this movie supremely underwhelmed. And I wish I had spent my money (not to mention my time!) on something else.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|Let me start by saying this is the first Avenged Sevenfold album I've listened to.  I have to say to me it is a true masterpeice and those who don't believe me just listen to the lryics of the album and the emtional context it has to say to the fans.  It mixes the hardcore music with some softer songs which at first surpised me.  But as I listened to the album song by song the journey these guys went on after the death of their close friend and band memeber help them heal threw their music and getting the feelings into the songs and keep on going because of the music they wanted their fans to see and hear.  Only song I have not made up my mind about is the song entitled God Hates Us for it is a pure metal song with screaming parts in it vocals wise.  But if you are into Metal Rock music mixed with softer songs that express emtional lost, heartbreak, and feeling all twisted up inside because you hurt that much inside then pick this album up and go on a journey threw the music and lryics because to me every song on the album amazed me and will amaze you.
0307352145|5.0|This book was well organized, fluidly written and compassionate. The author brings years of experience, both personal and from counseling others, to her subject. Without bashing extroverts, she outlines the sources of today's 'extrovert ideal' and traces the impact of this thinking through trends in education, business and health.<br /><br />Whether you are an introvert, seeking to find your way in an extroverted world, or a parent/spouse/manager/ friend of an introvert trying to understand them, this book will be of tremendous benefit to you. It avoids stereotypes and offers genuinely usable, easy-to-apply information. Topics discussed include how introverts can be successful in (and add value to) their extroverted world, bridging conflict and stress between the two personality types, and why people are wired so differently from one another.<br /><br />I recommend reading this in conjunction with [[ASIN:0670022829 Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn]]. It provides an insightful counterpoint to the extroverted approach of that book.

0385473788|5.0|I remember reading this as a teenager and liking it but, not<br />really being moved by it.  I am now in my early40s and was<br />very astounded after reading Anne's words.  Without Anne<br />knowing it,she was a true writer. How sad she did not live to<br />be an adult. for those who have never read it. It is the story of<br />a girl and her family hiding in Holland (in her father's office building).<br />Anne Frank was 13 and she kept a diary of about 2 years(June 1942 to<br />Aug ,1944). Anne wrote to an imaginary friend named &#34;Kitty&#34;. She<br />poured out her heart and soul to her diary. I can't believe that are any<br />readers who are not moved by anne's story,if readers are not they<br />must be brain dead!<br />Anne talks alot about her family,her feelings about what is happening to<br />Jews,the outside world,the other people hiding out with them-the van Daans<br />-including all their little quirks and mrs van Daan's annoying behavior.<br />I do not want to explain what happened at the end but,Anne lives on for<br />all time through her book and speaking of which,this particular edition has<br />passages that had been left out of earlier editions because of Anne's<br />frank discussion of sexuality. It also has some black and white photos in<br />the middle section of the book showing some of the people in anne's world.<br />This book is a must read book about world war 2 and read it for Anne.
B006ICOK00|5.0|purchased this and was able to make some pretty cool time lapse videos of my children. not sure what the other two reviews were about, because my camera has no problem staying powered...? this camerca does exactly what it says it does. you can create some neat videos with this thing..well worth the price!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not bad just started but so far its cool. Downloaded it and tried it. Will update at a later date.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I just love this game. Some are easy to start you out but quickly the puzzles become more challenging as you progress!  Great game on the Kindle Fire. It would be good if u could lock the squares done as I do spend some time correcting ones I touch on the way past. Technical improvement that would improve it but doesn't detract from the fun. Thanks.
B0086700CM|4.0|i love the game, but it has A TON of lag. sometimes it doesn't register what ur doing on the screen. but besides that, its a great game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades is the best series I have ever read! I was so into them I read the series in three days! Then re read it!!<br />Its passionate, sexy and will get your marriage pumping!<br />Laters Babe!<br />X
1401235417|4.0|While I have mixed thoughts on the \\"new 52\\" from DC Comics, the \\"Court of Owls\\" storyline that kicks off the new run of Batman was an exciting tale that offered some insight into that hero as well as Gotham City. Scott Snyder continues to impress as a writer and Greg Capullo is a solid artist. While Snyder could have done more with the supporting cast that surrounds Batman/Bruce Wayne, he does present an exciting tale with some truly interesting and intriguing villains instead of going back to the bullpen of usual suspects. Snyder clearly knows the lead character and he does a good job in pulling the strings on Batman and in capturing the mood of Gotham City. He also shows how the hero and the city are connected. Keep an eye on the team of Snyder and Capullo--and their run at Batman. Recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|idk y peoplez rating one star for this a<br />AWESOME game people rating 1 star are retards!!!! u should get this game NOWWWW
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book because of the considerable amount of hype.  The book was to say the least a huge disappointment and I put it down about half way through reading it. The author repeatedly used the same sentence over and over again about the main character biting her lip. I wish I could get back the 2 hours of time I wasted reading it...
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|great game idk y peoplez are rating one star this game is so awesome best game I have ever played in my whole life
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I am absolutely addicted. To this game. I have had it for about a week now and can't put it down!!!  I have to admit I have even chose to play this rather than read which for me is very rare. Love it!
B007L96VCY|5.0|Fresh, silly, funny, inventive, original, fun, emotional, straight to the heart, a magnificent beauty in itself. I am amazed to read that when it came out it was not a hit record. At the time I was living in South America, and some gringo kids that went to school in the Usa brought it with, you know, The Allman Brothers at Fillmore, Led Zep, Black Sabbath, The Stones, etc... plus some wonderful Sunshine and as you can read, the rest is history. So, after years of listening to RAM in cassettes and vinil, and wondering when this jewl was going to get a decent release, a remaster cd of RAM is going to make my summer of 1971 into my summer of 2012. The extra songs are great, specially in context. Another Day before RAM and a few after make the perfect road cd. Just great music.
B0013V33DG|2.0|After reading all these reviews I too am in the minority. I have seen about 130 operas but must admit this is not in my top 100. To be fair to the opera I should probably  watch it again. First the sets were horrible and Eurotrash like. I found Natalie's frenetic behavior annoying...cuteness to the point of ugliness. And I found the entire score unmemorable. I wish I had the Sill's performance to compare it to. I just did not enjoy the opera comedy. I always pictured Jeanette MacDonald in this role, someone with a little more elegance who could win the adoration of an entire regiment. Lucille Ball on uppers is just not fun in an opera. But I will give it another try. She must have really bothered me since Florez did not stand out in this opera like he has in so many others I own.
B0086700CM|5.0|finnwlly ive have been waiting forever. I was even thinking about writing a request but I though that would be too much.....any way thx a lot for adding temple runner..!!!!!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game lots of fun somewhat time consuming ive enjoyed playing it so far. Great graphics. super easy to learn to play.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie really took the time to make this album, and it really shows.  Blown Away, the title tack, is simply fantastic.  There is something for everybody on this album.  I think one of the more underrated songs is Do You Think About Me.  It's such a pure song, and Carrie sounds wonderful on it.  Only track I skip is Nobody Ever Told You, but I just don't relate to it.  Well done Carrie.  Another all-star effort.

0345803485|5.0|I had been tld by many that Fifty Shades was a must read. They were correct. I am an avid reader, but it has been a long time since a book has enthralled me like this one. I cannot wait to get through books two and three.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was just waiting to get this application for some years!! I really love it and I'm so glad that I can play it!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is great! I love solitaire so this was perfect and FREE! I definitely recommend getting it. I play all the time.
0060245867|5.0|I'm a semi retired certified school teacher.  I still do some substitute teaching, and very often I have come across this book.  I never miss a chance to read it to the kids, and even those kids (including the grown-up one writing this review)who have heard it over and over still get a good giggle out of this book.<br /><br />I'm sure that the author of this book -- who looks like she's a hoot to be with -- had in mind pure entertainment in a fun, wholesome, fantasy yet surprisingly believeable book.  I have no proof that she had a philosophical statement to make, but I certainly like the way it communicated some characteristics of cause and effect -- namely that they can't always be proven or disproven.<br /><br />Of course, as a philosophy enthusiast, I do agree with a lot of cause-effect argument, but every once in a while it's fun to see a totally inverted, yet fun way to look at it.<br /><br />The illustrations -- especially the little mouse in boxer shorts -- were worth the price of the whole book.  The book is aimed at early elementary school children, but it is also equally entertaining for a big, overgrown kid old enough to have grandchildren that age -- namely me!
0743244249|5.0|An excellent introduction to the works of this important contemporary writer.  Insightful, witty, and articulate, DeLillo is a master of language, every word rich with meaning.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I have always loved this Disney movie and I am so glad to have my own copy of it now! Wonderful Wonderful!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing books...read all three twice in a three week time period. Enjoyed the romance, suspense, plot,  and ease of reading!  The triology has a beginning and an end which makes it exciting to read.  HOPE FOR MORE BOOKS SOON!
B0013F1D02|5.0|I've never heard of this movie before I saw it listed as an Amazon Prime movie. The preview looked intriguing enough so I decided to watch it one morning.<br /><br />I'm so happy I did. This movie is filled with a little bit of everything: action, adventure, comedy, romance. The performances were great. Claire Danes is stunning. I loved Robert De Niro's performance as the flamboyant pirate. And Michelle Pfeiffer is still beautiful. It is a little long (2 hours) but the story wasn't slow at all. This is a great movie for the entire family.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had this great app a month before it came out!!!! all u have to do is download the app download everything pro from the app store you can get hundreds of fun apps like instagram and more from any appstore that there is apple / android and many more BUT MOST OFF ALL TEMPLE RUN IS AWESOME! !!!!
B004EN8KE2|4.0|Catching Fire is the second book of a trilogy written by Suzanne Collins. This book continues the story after Katniss and Peeta win the 74th Hunger Games. They now experience the life of a winning tribute with all the fortune and fame. Katniss and Peeta should be very happy after winning, but there is news of a possible rebellion towards the Capitol, a rebellion they may have helped create. Also, the Capitol decides to throw in a twist to the 75th Annual Hunger Games, being it is the Quarter Quell. This book is filled with excitement and anticipation. You will want to find out what happens to Katniss and Peeta, and it is very hard to put this book down once you have started. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book filled with excitement.
B007RXRSEY|2.0|was so looking forward to getting this album was not pleased slash's first album amazing really this one not so much only enjoyed 3 of the tracks and that sucks because i was so happy that he was making another album. so do check it out before you buy this one sorry slash...
0439023491|4.0|White Oleander was written by Janet Fitch. The main character is Astrid Magnussen, a 12 year old girl who lives in Los Angeles, CA.  She and her mother live very conservative and relate little to society. Astrid's mother is a poet and does not pay much attention to her. Astrid feels alone and eventually ends up in foster care in various homes. She has a very difficult time getting comfortable with her new families. The book sends you on a heart wrenching journey of failure and success. Once you get into it, you will not want to put it down. You will want to know what is going to happen to Astrid and if she will be okay. White Oleander plays with your emotions making you feel sad one chapter and happy the next. I recommend this book to a young adult woman.
B007L96SI6|4.0|You know how you can tell you really like a record? You go back and play it again and again. I gave it four stars because I have to reserve five stars for her next. This girl has a superb,raspy voice. Buy and enjoy. I did.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun game. for the energy crisis and impossible amounts of time just take your kindle off the network time, speed up the time, and harvest all of the crops and collect the money from buildings and food from animals. DONT RESTOCK. Send forward in time again. enough to get the longest timed animal ready to harvest. DONT HARVEST ANIMAL. Manually send the time back- I usually do a week- for energy and crop planting. and the free gift. when you run out of energy speed the time up 2 or 3 hours. got to Lvl 90 with all of the land parcels and 1mil coins before I got bored ofthe quests. good luck.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I bought this on my Kindle without reading any reviews because it was on the top ten list...about 2 chapters in I realised I was waiting for him to turn into a vampire or her into a werewolf because I had no idea what was going on. Also the book was very similar to Twilight. Strong, rich, controlling male with weak, submissive, impoverished female (also clumsy). The comparisons go on. So I headed to the reviews and only then realised what I had bought. The thing about this book is that you have to finish it. It's quite compulsive but has absolutely nothing new or unique in it...except for the domination part. I agree with the other reviewers that the emails to each other were the only character developmental view point we had other than that if you're into the worst type of Mills & Boone style writing with adult non-supernatural twilight characters...knock yourself out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it because it doesn't need wifi<br />but I sometimes get boring.I also like it how you can keep on playing the game that you completed.
B0086700CM|5.0|This might be the best game ive ever had on my kindle fire its just so fun and addicting. Really passes the time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really fun it is awesome I play it like every day  and when my mom tells me to stop im like wait let me just feed these animals and shes like; &quot;what.&quot;

B007JM4CWY|3.0|its fun to play, but quickly escalates from easy to a impossible. a slower progression to more difficult levels is required.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is very fun. and I'm glad that imanji studios came out with it on kindle (finaly!!!!) all my friends have it on their ipods and finally I can be in the loop! Now only if they came out with 'texts from last night's. ;) I also have had no problems with this app either!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|didn't use to have to be connected to wifi in order for recording to play.  now  I cant start a recording to listen to on my commute home from work. reported the problem and they say they're working on it but I gotta wonder. used to think this was 5 star app. now I'm just disappointed.
145162445X|4.0|I found this book both informative and enriching. As a christian this only added to my faith in God. This book was nearly as good as the bible.
B00005B1W5|5.0|I don't care what God you believe in, and don't care if you believe in any God at all.<br />Listening to this music gives you a spiritual experience, without a doubt!<br />My friends, of all races, religion and background all agree!<br />One of them said song #5 (tribute) is what good sex should feel like!
0967851408|5.0|I have only started this book one month ago but it is a very powerful book.  Its written in a great week by week way, that allows you to pace yourself and really absorb the lessons that it contains.  It really helps you to \\"key\\" into what is really important to YOU and what makes YOU happy, which actually makes you a more considerate, unselfish individual.
B007ANGYV4|1.0|I think he actually wrote the book himself and than translated it as well. Too bad- could have been an interesting read.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg this is the best thing on earth I love temple run :) (:  so much fun :) (: :) (: $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ *********
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great! I suggest that the creators of this game make Temple Run 2!!!!!!!!!!  p.s. I &lt;3 this game!
B007SGM084|5.0|I thought it was a great trilogy. Easy read and kept me interested! I'm not a big reader, but these books I could not put down.
0345803485|1.0|I was very disappointed with the book. Not a good writing!!! All of the sexual scene so boring- same descriptions over and over again. Could be good book if someone else write it. I think the author has good sexual fantasies but could not put them on the paper without sound funny and unprofessional (as a writer)
B005LAIGP0|1.0|Beautifully filmed and well acted -- the entire cast works very hard to sell this story -- but you never feel connected to any of the characters and the story is ridiculously bad. Save your time and watch something -- anything -- else.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love you temple run!!! ;) Best game ever on kindle fire. I been waiting for a long time. If your lag try to reset your kindle fire
0143117009|1.0|I'm guessing Diamond was given a huge advance to write this book based on his last success, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" - which was a terrific book.  Collapse opens up with a completely non-sensical description of Montana based on anecdotal stories.  He mentions global warming many times for no apparent reason.  The book seems more like incoherent ramblings rather than the careful analysis of a skilled researcher.  I rarely put down a book once I start but I couldn't bear to continue after 3 chapters.  Sorry Jared, but terrible book.
B0086700CM|5.0|anyone could play this and it keeps me busy when I want to forget about people or otherthings. I'm so happy it finally came out for kindle fires. it has everything on it (not every every thing but enough to understand it). LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is awesome when you are chased by Spider monkeys.The best part is when you go under a line of fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally Temple Run has come to aneroid!!!!!!!!!!! Now I don't want to get an ipod touch too! Perfect game too. Not one thing is wrong with it!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is the best app ever because you can buy your own colors.you also can get bombs but you have to buy them with your coins for 400 coins you get 10 bombs if you have 1000 coins you get 20 bombs and for 1649 coins you 50 bombs.the other best thing is you can play any body you want to if you pick choose your opponent.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think its good because it is the best game i have ever played and ive been waiting for this to come out as an app for kindle forever
B001DJLCRC|2.0|Our search for a show to help us kill a few hours each week led us to try Breaking Bad based on reviews we had heard. After watching the first season, we will not be ordering the second.<br /><br />Overall the acting is good, and other technical pieces are well done. However, the plot line is very dark, and the characters seem to be steadily engaging in a series of bad decisions moving to worse decisions.<br /><br />The show deals with terminable cancer, drug culture, healthcare woes for the middle class, and portrays even the 'good guys' in a negative light. The themes the show uses are discordant with my value system, so the show is not enjoyable.<br /><br />I can see why the show is so critically acclaimed, and the use of suspense is effective. At the end of the season though, I don't feel motivated to continue.
B005HSL626|5.0|this app is great but now half brick you need to get jet pack joyride for kindle fire please please :)
0307951529|5.0|As someone who has achieved some success and has enjoyed the freedom of the self-employed lifestyle, I'm generally very critical on business books -  however, 'The $100 Startup' has instantly taken a place among my favorite business books (right up there with 'ReWork').<br /><br />This book is perfect for so many different types of people -  the person with a passion who has always wondered 'how could I do this for a living?', the person fed up with the drudgery of a typical 'job', or the person that wants to succeed in doing things on their terms and actually enjoying their professional and personal life.<br /><br />Guillebeau's writing is friendly, motivational, and conversational, which makes it a pleasure to read and easy to remember many of the ideas.  The real life examples show just how easy it can be to get started, and should get any reader over their fears of 'what if' (or the fear of success!), providing motivation to get started as soon as the back cover of the books is closed.<br /><br />The cover states 'Reinvent the way you make a living, do what you love, and create a new future', and that is exactly what each page will show you how to do.
B0086700CM|4.0|Firstly, I want to say I was so excited to find this in Appstore.  But I'm somewhat disappointed.  The screen lags on the larger screen such as on the a Kindle Fire. Otherthan that, it's awesome.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I've watched a lot of cop shows and 99% of the time, I can figure out Who Done It in about 10 minutes. Not so with Season 1 of The Mentalist. The pilot blew me away in the first 5 minutes. I was hooked. Blonde (what else?) Aussie actor Simon Baker is perfect in this role - clever, witty and a bit of a wise guy but also balanced by compassion and an honest desire to help people in pain. Season 1 is just great entertainment.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing!!!!  i don't get why some people say it lags because it doesn't.... this deserves 19746463883938477463381 stars :D
B004EPYZSK|5.0|My 35 year old son and I both loved this film. It is sort of like Independence Day set in the 1873 Wild West. Cowboys and Aliens was a fun ride with a feel good ending. What more could you want?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exciting trilogy.  Similar to the \\"Girl With The Dragon Tatoo\\" series.  Keeps your attention all the way through all three books.  The difference between this series and the Larson trilogy is there could be more to come.  Can't wait to see if there's a fourth book!
B0086700CM|5.0|I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER!!!! I CAN'T BELIVE IT!!!! :-) :-)  ALL OF U WHO GAVE IT ONE STAR, UR WEIRD!!!
0756404738|5.0|I really tried to ration this one out, and not read it as quickly as I read The Name of the Wind. In the end, I ended up going through it almost as fast. Really fantastic fantasy- this is one of those books I hate to finish, because I just want it to keep going and going. I'm sad I now have to play the waiting game for the third novel.<br /><br />Parts of the novel move slow, and parts move fast- but I'm ok with that. I trust that Rothfuss knows what he is doing in building the character of Kvothe. He's done an amazing job so far, and I can't wait to see where the story will go in the third installment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a great game to play when your bored :)  had a great time when I was in drivers ed playing it. you can enjoy with lots of friends. tons of fun Gamez to play. I would recamend this game to any type of person.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very fast paced and it creates a challenge for the players mind through the relentless onslaught of traps. this game is very well done
B0086700CM|5.0|Been waiting forever for this game on kf and its finally here!!! So much better than the expensive wanna-be apps. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS GAME!! :) So glad its free!
0345803485|4.0|Although, the writing is very repetitious, I found myself in the '70s, Paul McCartney singing \\"Let It Be\\" in the background, me sitting cross-legged reading \\"The Fear of Flying\\", discovering a whole new side to my \\"flowerchild persona\\".  Set 30+ years later, this little tale is great for those women who missed the whole experience of discovering their sexual femininity in the '60s & '70s.  I thought Erica Jong was writing porn back then, and the fact that there are women still learning the  pleasure & excitement of \\"forbidden passions\\" is a good thing.  The scenarios were quite predictable & became rather boring, yet it did leave me wondering if Anastasia & Christian were \\"star-crossed\\" lovers,  (a very popular phrase during the dawning of the age of aquarius).  Overall, a fun read for me.
B0086700CM|5.0|I get tired of games really easily but this one I never get tired and it is way more fun than angry birds
B007SGM084|5.0|A really great read.  Very well written.  Couldn't put it down!!! This series will definitely put some spark back in your romantic life.
B0074MZSWW|2.0|Looked forward to hearing the entire album.  'Hold On' was getting all of the air play and nothing else.  Turns out, that was all that was worth listening to.  Disappointing.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Yes, it works as advertised. But if you assume you can convert STEREO tapes... you are mistaken. Of course, it does not actually SAY 'Stereo' in the specs - but it does not say 'MONO Only' either... In this day and age, everyone assumes things are stereo - in the 60's that was different...<br />I consider this a rip-off!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put this trilogy down! It was a great series of books and I hated when it ended. I would have loved a little more on the lives at the end of the book, but still overall I thought it was great!
0307269752|5.0|This book was a full size hardcover edition, exactly as I hoped for.  In perfect condition, it is a nice addition to my library.  The content (story) was well written but took a little while to get  into.  Once you get into it you can't put it down.
0062014102|4.0|I'd like to give this 3.5 stars instead of 4, but I can't. Oh well.<br /><br />It's hard for me to criticize The Holographic Universe because it was the beginning of an incredible journey for me. On a recommendation from a friend in college, I read this book and become endlessly obsessed with the world of quantum physics and the sometimes unbelievable nature of reality and the human brain. This book was a great introduction to the weirdness that happens around us every day and it was explained in a manner that I found accessible even though I had never learned about it before.<br /><br />Plenty of the concepts introduced in this book have been necessarily repeated in many of the physics related books I've read since (such as the double slit experiment), thereby not only clarifying them further for my own understanding and also lending some legitimacy to The Holographic Universe.<br /><br />BUT, and that's a big \\"but,\\" be forewarned that this book is generally based on wild speculation that, while mostly intriguing and fascinating, can get pretty \\"out there\\" at times. While I appreciate a daring leap of faith as much as anyone, and many things discussed here are at least worth considering even if only for fun, there are several times that the author makes statements that just made me say \\"WTF,\\" even at a time when I was quite receptive to new age-type trains of thought. (One thing that comes to mind is when he claims that he materialized a pile of pasta out of thin air if I remember that part right.)<br /><br />Taking the legitimate (and very interesting) science at the beginning and applying it to how it could potentially explain more supernatural type events is entertaining, but the author is a little too convinced for my taste and makes a few claims that I just couldn't possibly stand behind.<br /><br />That said, I still wind up rating this book rather highly for the simple fact that it did essentially change my life and send me on a course to learning how unbelievably incredible our universe actually is. For curious, open minds.
0802473156|4.0|Profound & easy to remember keys to the self-awareness that makes relationships last. May be harder for agnostics to read due to prominent references to Christianity. Yet,the essential (and well-explained) \\"languages\\" are timeless and universal. Aids communication and compassion between individuals whose differences in personal styles may trip them up in building long term relationships.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is probabley the best game on kindle! ive been waiting for a long time. now just put minecraft on it and ill be happy.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this game!! I am a huge sudoku fan and this is it with a twist!! I can't put it down. Takes a lot of concentration.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Helps me to keep jobs by priority and not forget the little things I need to do.<br /><br />I keep my list online and also my phone and keep both in sync.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a must read! It is a great book and I've already read it twice. I also purchased the other two books that are in the trilogy. They are just as good!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|perfect in every way.  large, easy to use and read.<br /><br />to the reviewer who said 0/1 resulted in an error instead of the correct answer of 1, that apparently has been fixed.<br /><br />excellent calculator!

0871404133|5.0|This book gives on a preview of how evolution of the human species may play itself out on this planet. We see the evolution from the clan to the tribe to the nationstate with ever greater occupational specializations. Now we have the barest beginnings of a world government and the possibility of no more war, just elections.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Usually, I don't like to write reviews on Amazon (generally out of sheer laziness).  And even more usual for me is not liking science fiction.  I'm more of a high fantasy kind of person.<br /><br />\\"Wool\\" absolutely blew me away.<br /><br />I found myself hooked from the very first page, something that these days I find happens less and less with me, even if later on I decide the book OVERALL was a good book after having struggled through the first 100 pages or so.  I couldn't bring myself to put my Kindle down.  I read the entire book in one sitting.  It's meticulously crafted, with deep characterization.  You can tell the author really cares about the people they have created, and that makes you want to care about them as well.  It was impossible not to worry about what was going to happen next to these people.  I loved the twisted sense of the \\"cosmic joke\\" that we see early on in the book, and finding out what's really going on left me extremely satisfied.  And yes, those statements were horribly vague, but I would hate to give anything away!<br /><br />As others have noted, what helps make this book so enjoyable to read is the excellent attention to grammar, punctuation and spelling.  Some might roll their eyes and call those of us who comment on this grammar Nazis, but it really is distracting when you read a book that's riddled with typos and run-on sentences.  The gripping story is definitely 95% of the reason that makes up WHY you should read this book, but the flawless execution in writing mechanics certainly helps.<br /><br />Thank you for sharing your work with us.  It's truly a gem of a find, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity.

B0006HC0I2|5.0|Hey, I have been touting crime noir films for the past couple of years so why not review, as here with Jean Gabin's 1954 Touchez Pas au Grisbi, a French crime noir in honor of, well, the name of the genre. And a later generation of French directors who went crazy for Hollywood gangster epics in such films as \\"Breathless\\" and Don't Shoot The Piano Player. Especially when said this crime noir stars Jean Gabin, last reviewed here in a very different film, Children Of Paradise.<br /><br />Well, let's cut to the chase (literally, as this plot unfolds). It seems that long- time crime boss Max (Gabin) has pulled a caper (heist, okay) to set himself and his confederate Riton up for a well-deserved retirement from the rackets. And everything was going along just fine until old buddy Riton got a loose tongue over some show girl (played by a very young Jean Moreau) and spilled his guts out to her about how he could keep her in clover. Problem is that young showgirls are as fickle and calculating as any other woman mixed up with bad actuarial table criminals and she has another crime boss on the hook, one Angelo. Naturally she mentions the loot to Angelo and sets off an explosion of maneuvers by him to get the kale, and by Max to keep it.<br /><br />The cat and mouse of this pair drives the rest of the movie with old Max showing one and all why he was (and is) the king of the hill, even if he may have lost a step or two. Angelo's big mistake (besides thinking that Max was over the hill and easy pickings) was kidnapping Riton, an act that set Max on a fight to the finish. See the film to get the details of that fight to the finish. What is important though is the use by the director here of the many tough guy moves made by Hollywood gangsters in the heyday 1930s including a few off-hand beatings of opponent gangsters to get information, a few off-hand slaps at show girls (by Gabin of all people but that is part of being a boss and no chump), and a car chase, natch complete withmachine guns ta-ta-ta-ing. Ya, the French picked up the genre very nicely. Gabin might be a little too suave (except for those off-hand girl slaps) to be an American 1930s gangster but he fit the more demure 1950s just right.

0671004107|3.0|Being a fan of Carl, I was expecting something a little more. The general idea of the galactic highway was very cool, but the book was too long on the set up, and when they get to their destination, there is maybe a chapter of nothing exciting at all. I am very disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Months back when the first rumblings about The Hunger Games began I wanted to first read the books and if they were enjoyable, I would go catch the movie. Suzanne Collins wrote a compelling story. It moved forward violently at times. It was skeptical about the first person narrative but it worked for this story. What Collins did with making Katniss likeable was brilliant. Collins tells Katniss is not likelable and also has her killing people and yet you still can't help sympathize with her and like her. This may be her biggest success and also the biggest problem with the book. Douglas Wilson wrote about the moral dilemma intrinsic in the gladiatorial Hunger Games.<br /><br />Some have found fault with his logic but they have missed the point. Wilson is not arguing against killing in war or for corporeal punishment. He's arguing that killing in a forced entertainment game is wrong. I think he's right. There is a moral conundrum. You can hear it when Gale and Katniss are talking about the games right before Katniss is being taken to the Capitol.<br /><br />  \\"Katniss, it's just hunting. You're the best hunter I know,\\" says Gale.<br /><br />  \\"It's not just hunting. They're armed. They think,\\" I say.<br /><br />  \\"So do you. And you've had more practice. Real practice,\\" he says. \\"You know how to kill.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Not people,\\" I say.<br /><br />  \\"How different can it be, really?\\" says Gale grimly.<br /><br />Collins, Suzanne (2009-09-01). The Hunger Games (p. 40). Scholastic Books. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />The games themselves kept grating me and I couldn't put my finger on it. As I watched the movie Monday night, it came to me. The Hunger Games are frightening because it's real. We've already seen these kinds of gladiatorial games back in Rome. And Collins combined an historically horrific reality with a present American obsession, reality TV. Is The Hunger Games then so unimaginable? I don't think so. The right circumstances. The right compulsion. And this could be us.<br /><br />And Christians have already shown their fortitude and willingness to die in the coliseum. Christians have been put in a similar situation and they chose death. Therefore, brothers and sisters, be vigilant. Read discerningly.

1594744769|5.0|Saw this book in a store and the cover caught my eye. Read the jacket and I was hooked.<br /><br />The author's use of the photos to tell a story gives you a nice visual to go with the plot. At first I was expecting a ghost story but it really is a somewhat subdued thriller. The story makes you want to read it to see what could possibly happen next. I found the setting and the pacing to be perfect. The length is just right and the ending lends itself well to continue the story. I can't wait for it!
0307352145|5.0|The title says it all!<br /><br />Introverted, quiet people need more respect for being who they are. There is an extrovert ideal in this nation that began in the early 1900s. Before that, people were respected for their character and craftsmanship instead of their vibrant personality.<br /><br />This book has made me very happy. It's about time someone came out and said that half the population of the U.S. is introverted and they have so much to offer - including leadership abilities. They often get overlooked for management or leadership positions because of their discerning, quiet demeanor. But this kind of person often makes the best leader.<br /><br />I enjoyed every bit of this book, which took years for Susan Cain to research and write. It was a labor of love to give quiet people the confidence to be who they are and know when to act the part of the extrovert.<br /><br />Thank you Susan! I will highly recommend this book to many friends and family!<br /><br />This book was provided by the publisher. I give it 5 stars!
B004LUS390|5.0|I had been searching for a good drawing app that was more than a simple doodle toy for kids. At first I was hesitant to pay $1.99 based on the reviews of incompatibility issues, but I just downloaded this today (version 1.4) and I can assure budding artists out there that this is NOT the case. Any bugs have seemingly been fixed.<br /><br />The app works perfectly and flawlessly, it saves in different formats and even exports to Twitter, which is fantastic. The best part about the paid app is the multiple brush choices you have, as well as the ability to create up to six layers. I am also very impressed with sketch sensitivity.<br /><br />This is no mere sketching app. Take your time to explore the Help menu and get used to SketchBook's extensive functions. You won't need any other drawing app after installing this one.

B007OWG3LM|5.0|Simply put, this is a fantastic CD. As a long-time fan, I found myself trying to say 'This CD's sound is just like [previous Sigur Rós CD].' It's impossible to make such a comparison though, because this CD is draws from just about all of its predecessors to form a natural evolution of the Sigur Rós sound. Familiar listeners will hear the band's trademarks... sweeping, ethereal sounds, lush orchestral movements, melodies that evoke cold, windswept landscapes. This is a CD to listen to as you curl up under a blanket with a warm drink and low lighting and just... contemplate its awesomeness.<br /><br />For newbies to the band, this CD is a fairly good intro (other CDs that are good jumping-off points: \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" or \\"Takk...\\").<br /><br />FWIW, my early favourites include Track 3 (Varúð) and Track 5 (Dauðalogn). I suspect the former will likely have universal appeal.<br /><br />Overall, a very worthwhile and solid effort from Jonsi, Goggi, Kjarri and Orri.
B0086700CM|5.0|Once I got my kindle I imitatly looked for temple run and after about 7 months of waiting it popped up and I have to say between the mutant monkey the funny comments after I die and the store it was definitly worth the wait.

145162445X|5.0|Like Brian Greene, Laurence Krauss has the remarkable ability to express extremely difficult, mind-bending concepts in such a way that they become comprehensible to laymen like me. And with humor and clever turns of phrase to boot. I found this book to be entertaining and engaging as well as thoroughly informative.<br /><br />For additional entertainment, I suggest reading the negative reviews of this book by creationists - people advocating the position that a magic, invisible man in the sky is a more reasonable explanation for the origin of the universe than the scientific theories proposed by Krauss. You just can't make up comedy like that!
0439023491|5.0|As soon as I finished the first book of the Hunger Games, I immediately sought out the 2nd book to continue on the adventure.  I was not disappointed with the sequel. Catching Fire kept me as engaged as the first book (if not more so) and I again was not able to put the book down until I finished reading it.<br /><br />If you read the first book: [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] - then you know the premise behind the story. The second book picks up with the victorious characters from where the first book left off, and the adventure continues at a frantic pace, with several unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />I enjoyed the lack of predictability of the second book, and look forward to reading the third book in the series soon (although I have decided to take a short break before starting the 3rd book because I know that these books are very difficult to put down once you start them).<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first book, this is a must read.
B0086700CM|5.0|owsome game is so fun i cant stop playing it . coooooooooooool and verry fun and adiccding and owsome.  grate game ;-)
0439023521|5.0|I found this first book of the Hunger Games series to be very engaging and well written, even if the subject it is based on is more than slightly disturbing. Not since the Harry Potter books had I read a book that kept me turning the page at a frantic pace to find out what happens next.<br /><br />With that said, I would warn you to make sure that you have enough time to devote to reading this book before you start it, because once you get into it, it will be very hard to put down. Even at the end of chapters, you will be left wanting to start the next chapter right away.<br /><br />I think the first 5-10 chapters may have been a little slow for me, but once I figured out the premise of the story, and the \\"Games\\" started, I was not able to put the book down until I finished it.<br /><br />Be warned, the subject matter is not for the faint of heart or easily offended. It involves the death of children. However, I thought the book combined the perfect amount of fiction, with realistic characters to place the reader in a state of mind of considering the possibility of the potential for the type of scenario described in the book to potentially occur in the future.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Reading \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning\\" I found a correlation to \\"Once\\" written by Morris Gleitzman.<br /><br />The main argument of these novels are the suffering of child in a society affected by thirsty of power and individualism, which is masterfully described by Gleitzman<br /><br />\\"You know how\\" against the more descriptive and less confidential described by Lemony Snicket i.e.<br /><br />\\"Unless you have been very, very lucky, you have undoubtedly experienced events in your life that have made you cry. So unless you have been very, very lucky, you know that a good, long session of weeping can often make you feel better, even if your circumstances have not changed one bit. So it was with the Baudelair orphans\\"  (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Lemoy Snicket, page 57)<br /><br />The plot of A series of unfortunate events is quite different here the main characters are: Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire due to a domestic accident they have lost their parents the beginning of their unhuman suffering summarised in the first paragraph and in particular Violet,  the future heir of a considerable sum of money.<br /><br />For Klaus reading is a fundamental step for the developing of the society if you read carefully you will be able to resolve any kind of difficulties and problems and even the reader is involved:<br /><br />\\"There are many, many types of books in the world, which makes good sense, because there are many, many types of people, and everybody wants to read something different. For instance, people who hate stories in which terrible things happen to small children put this book down immediately\\" (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Lemoy Snicket, page 83)<br /><br />Philosophically speaking I think that there is a battle between the innocent world represented by Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire and the adult world inhabited by Mr. Poe and his dirty house (like his soul), Count Olaf (the devil) the winner will be described at the end.
B0086700CM|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love temple run. However, I have noticed that there are some bugs to this game.  For example, the game will have slight freezes during actual play.  Another bug is that the game becomes too fast too early.  (I am a decent temple run player, so this is not just an assessment based on skill.)  The good news is that both of these problems will hopefully be fixed soon with an upgrade, and the game is still very fun even with the little problems.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a bit repetitious and I think one book would have covered the whole story.  But that is how you make money.  lol  I loved all three and could not put them down.  I was sad when I got to the end because I wanted more.<br /><br />I think the author was living out her fantasies.  This is the kind of man that women can dream about.  He had everything--looks, money, devotion--and on top of it she was his one love--wonderful.  I would go to sleep fantasizing about this man.  I really wish she could continue her books till they grow old.  lol<br /><br />Some things were a little unrealistic.  Not many women would want so much sex in one day unless they were nymphomaniacs.  As time moves on it is difficult to maintain such intensity. lol<br /><br />She needed to tell more about his affair with the older woman and why he ended it and became a dominant.  She also needed to tell more about his life with his mother and how it warped him.  The sex, although nice, was repetitious.  By the way, not all women like to have fingers inserted into their vaginas and get an orgasm from it.  But then we are all different.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved the book.  I think Halle Berry's baby daddy would be perfect.  He is so handsome.

0345803485|3.0|Guilty of finishing the series in 4 days...easy read. Sad how low the quality of our books are becoming... I give the book a low B ...good story concept but lacking eloquence in the delivery. It had very mediocre writing style...repetitive. Inner goddess?-corny \\"down there\\" geez get the woman a thesaurus, i gasped, he gasped, we all gasped, \\"mouth into a hard line\\" \\"ghost of a smile\\". Ill admit that the first sex scenes was good...but constant repetition of it and a lack of substance to the writing really took away from the quality of the book. IT's like the author copy pasted the sex scenes, using the same template and just changed the location and the sex toys. I literally skipped over the sex scenes after a while because after reading one you have read them all. Many unrealistic elements- rich, billionaire, great looking and amazing in bed? Really now? and ORGASM every single time they have sex, he says her name, and just by looking at him. Phooey. I'll admit I am in love with the character of christian grey, but unfortunately a guy like him doesn't, and i don't think will ever exist. Really, the only thing maintaining my interest was my curiosity to how the relationship would develop and my need to finish things I begin.

0802798225|5.0|This is the first time I've written a review on Amazon for a book, but I loved this one so much I had to write something. I started this book in the morning and literally could not put it down until 1am that night! The characters were very real to me, the story very sweet. Every time a chapter ended it left me needing to read more to find out what was going to happen. The story flowed very naturally and was an easy read. I'm definitely going to check out the rest of her books!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This is a fantastic movie!  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and it was actually really funny as well.  The best MI yet.
B0083YKKXW|5.0|Downloaded this and have given it several listens for a fair review.<br /><br />Firstly through interviews, we were told this was classic Genesis meets Yes. Don't go expecting Dance On A Volcano crossed with Yours Is No Disgrace though which is what I was expecting.<br />Personally I don't think this meets the mould. I'd personally say it's a bit closer to GTR meets 90125 crossed with some Zeppelin and The Beatles which is no bad thing.<br />Makes a decent hybrid actually..<br /><br />A Life Within A Day - Probably the albums most prog orientated track. I'd more say it's Yes crossed with Led Zeppelin with a heavy Kashmir type riff. A fast Yes type<br />jazzy middle section really lifts this track into the class!!<br />Tall Ships - Opens with a nice acoustic part from Steve giving way to a bass riff from Squire leading to a chorus that smoothly sails in (excuse the pun). Great track.<br />Divided Self - Starts with a Beatles type riff from Steve. Basically a pop tune with a nice solo from Steve.<br />Aliens - This one sticks out like a sore thumb (sorry Chris). The melody and playing is actually quite nice but the lyric just stands out as a bit wierd.<br />Sea Of Smiles - Good catchy chorus on this one. One of the albums strongest tracks.<br />The Summer Backwards - Another Beatles(y) type track. Nice one this. Quaint. Seems to finish too early though.<br />Storm Chasers - The albums 2nd heavy number. A thumping Zeppelin type drum beat with Steve taking lead vocals.<br />Can't Stop The Rain - Classic Squire on this one. The albums best track for me. Could've sat nicely on Fish Out Of Water 2.<br />Perfect Love Song - Joined onto the last track. A great riff from Steve. A nice closer.<br /><br />To sum up a pretty strong album. The production is excellent and the vocals are perfectly layered in. If you enjoyed Beyond The Shrouded Horizon then you'll like this.<br />To be honest I think fans of Genesis, Yes, Zep and The Beatles would enjoy this.<br />I'd have preferredthem to just stretch the song a little more to let them breath a bit. Some of them you're sitting enjoying and they seem to end too quickly.<br />At 46 mins you feel that there's 15min missing as we're so used to Cds being about an hour long.<br />Chris & Steve's vocals do sit nicely together, I think this is one of the many plus points of the album.<br />Still well worth checking out and I'll be playing this all through the Summer.<br /><br />Here's to the possible upcoming tour. Hope they do Silently Falling :)
B005SFR7YE|5.0|It would be rare to find someone these days who has neither seen the stage show, nor watched the film (with Emmy Rossum, and Gerard Butler) of \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" Even those who have not actually seen it are, for the most part, familiar with the plot, and perhaps even some of the music. However, for those few who have not, and even those who have seen Phantom at every possible opportunity, you NEED to see this production! Sierra Boggess, Ramin Karimloo, and Hadley Frasier give an incredible performance; but, in my opinion, Sierra Boggess, as Christine, outshines them all; her techincal precision, clear and beautiful voice, and depth of emotional expression all come together to create a spell-binding effect--I get chills each time I watch her in this performance (especially during \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\"). I think back to being wowed by Emmy Rossum's performance in the 2004 movie, and now, I know it just doesn't even compare. The power of each performer in this production will blow you away.<br />To wrap this up, as I was reading reviews and considering whether to purchase this DVD, I read something along the lines of \\"When you watch [Sierra Boggess] in this production, you don't see her, you see Christine.\\" I think they really hit the nail on the head. So, if you've never seen Phantom in any way, shape, or form, see this version. You won't regret it.

B000C4A1EO|1.0|After garnering a huge following and momentum in the 80s and on the verge of a big breakout,.....then nothing, silence for years, the tail end of the \\"peak\\" metal years I might add, and then finally this piece of **** emerges, you can tell right away from the cover it looks like the band sold out, and the music confirms those suspicions. This band was like a \\"trust fund baby\\" that didn't know what it had until it was gone, like a spoiled brat that blew all their money, Helloween blew all their momentum and reputation from the \\"Keepers\\" albums. Kiske may be a \\"beloved\\" singer, by the fans, but his anti-metal influence on the sonwriting coupled with BAD,BAD, BAD advice from management and producers,and combined with some of the most silly, absurd, ridiculous lyrics and songtitles ever penned, makes for one of the worst Helloween albums ever, only to be outdone in it's \\"badness\\" by the criminally horrendous \\"Chameleon\\" that just about put the final nail in the coffin for Helloween. ( see my Chameleon review for that story)

B0086700CM|1.0|Obviously fake reviews. Here's one star for doing that. Personally, I'm turned off by developers employing shady tactics to get their app more visibility. Not going to download the app either. Lame lame lame.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game it my favorite the second it came out boom it was on my kindle i got to two million.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an excellent book.  Could not put it down.  What I like about purchasing a book for my Kindle is that I can preview the book.  I get 3 chapters of the book to read, if I like it I can purchase it. If I don't like it I do not have to buy it.  In this case after reading a few pages of the book I bought it.  It was full of romance which I like, it was well written.  I enjoyed this book so much I purchased book two.  I wish the trilogy had been available when I purchsed the first book I would have purchased that rather than 3 separate books.  Hopefully you will have more books available like this one.  I am on the 3rd book and it's just as interesting as the first.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|After reading Fifty shades of grey i couldn't stop reading. It's such a well written trilogy with excitement, romance and sex. It's just easy to read and fun!
B003MC5N28|4.0|In a perfect world, the hero of the story dissents from the perfect lifestyle for reasonable and beautiful reasons.  In an \\"ignorance is bliss\\" kind of world, a young boy loses his ignorance and his bliss because he wants everyone else to truly experience life. A beautiful story.
B007712XAU|5.0|we missed season 1 of downton abby, and followed it all of season 2.  it was wonderful and the dvd was in good condition. nancy and pete mcgillivray
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Glu has a great range of games. This and Lil kingdom are my favorites. I hope they keep up the great work.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game was only for ipods. and it always made me mad but finally those people came to their senses and put.it for phones and kindles I'm glad they finally made sense
B007PTJOV0|4.0|similar to Mario. This game is really addicting and makes you want to keep on playing. I really reccomend this game to everyone.
145162445X|5.0|In summary, it's a fantastic book, and he gets his facts straight. Check it out if you have even the slightest interest in cosmology.
1594200106|5.0|'Few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart. Those first images, the echo of words we think we have left behind, accompany us throughout our lives and sculpt a palace in our memory to which, sooner or later - no matter how many books we read, how many worlds we discover, or how much we learn to forget - we will return.'<br /><br />The story begins in the early summer of 1945 in Barcelona, in the wake of the Spanish Civil War, when ten-year-old Daniel Sempere is taken to the ancient, cavernous Cemetery of Forgotten Books for the first time by his antiquarian bookseller father. From the hundreds of thousands of books contained within the endless corridors of the labyrinthine bibliographic mausoleum, Daniel must choose one book to adopt; he will, he is told, be that book's guardian for the rest of his life. He chooses The Shadow of the Wind by an obscure Spanish novelist called Juli&aacute;n Carax - a choice that will change his life forever.<br /><br />Captivated by the book, Daniel becomes intrigued by its enigmatic author. Over the years that follow, as he grows from a young boy into an awkward adolescent, he uncovers various clues about Carax and attempts to build a picture of the man. He is told that Carax was killed in Barcelona at the beginning of the civil war and discovers that his is the only surviving copy of The Shadow of the Wind; a sinister, faceless character who smells of burned paper and calls himself La&iacute;n Coubert, the name of a character created by Carax, has been going around burning every book by Carax that he can find and Daniel's copy survived only because it had been kept safe in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.<br /><br />With the help of his frequently entertaining sidekick Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres (a man with secrets of his own), Daniel begins to piece together the truth about the tragic events of Juli&aacute;n Carax's life, events which appear unnervingly similar to those taking place in his own life. In the process, he stirs up emotions amongst those who once knew Carax and attracts the decidedly dangerous attention of the vengeful and sadistic police inspector (and ex-Francoist torturer and assassin) Francisco Javier Fumero, whose quest for vengeance threatens the lives of Daniel and those close to him.<br /><br />It's difficult to go into any further detail without giving too much away, so I won't. What I will say is that this is a fabulous, captivating book; a book about books, which is the very best kind of book for a bibliophile like me. There are plot twists and turns aplenty; there are characters to love and hate, and there is tragedy, romance and humour (especially when Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres is about). Once I began reading, I really didn't want to stop. This truly is an outstanding book..

B003QSMCKO|5.0|This movie is awesome... not just as a kid's movie. Truly a great piece of art. Really captivates the viewer... and does a wonderful job getting the viewer attached to the main character, Mulan.
B0020M99LC|2.0|I understand that many folks enjoyed this as a fresh interpretation of James Bond.  I haven't read the original books, so I cannot weigh in as to whether or not this take on Bond is more or less in tune with Fleming's original character.  I can only convey one woman's reaction.  Based on many years of exposure to the other Bond films, I just cannot take Daniel Craig as James Bond.  Bond, to me, is supposed to look more like a Cary Grant, have a good sense of humor, and to kill only out of necessity.  He is supposed to fit in smoothly among the upper crust, due at least to his years of exposure to the ultra wealthy's expensive haunts and preferred activities.  Craig looks to me like a poor man's Steve McQueen, with none of the latter's boyish charm or calm cool self-confidence.  He looks more like a street thug or an angry, recently retired, rugby player.  His haircut looks like he must have cut it himself, in between running down alleys to rob liquor stores and beat up drunks.<br /><br />The film seems much more violent than any of the other Bond films I have seen, and completely humorless.  The special effects appear to be effective and realistic, and the villains are cold and brutal.  For guys who like cold realism and plausible plots, and who don't want to feel threatened by lead actors who come across as handsome, smooth, and well-educated, this may be just the ticket.  But there are so many brutal realistic humorless films.  Do we really need another one?  It's also seems particularly gratuitous to feature a scene where a completely naked Bond is tortured sadistically by having his genitals beaten to a bloody pulp, then threatened with castration.  (What a fun night at the movies!)<br /><br />It feels like some sort of a plus that the women are portrayed more realistically, and in a less overtly sexist fashion.  And I appreciate that Craig's Bond appears to actually be interested in some kind of real relationship with the lead female.  But I can't imagine thatmany women, after seeing this particular Bond and type of story, will will be very eager to go to see another one.  I won't knowingly expose myself to any other such film again.
0061365343|5.0|We've listened to Little House cds since my girls were about 5 years of age. Cherry Jones has a perfect voice for these recordings, soothing and entertaining all at once. This is the first book in the Little House series. We have listened to it for several years now, and I have learned much by listening along with my kids, like how cheese is made and what rennet is. Great pioneer history in an entertaining format. Excellent for car rides!

B0081KTI0E|3.0|The wife and I watched this movie over the weekend, my thoughts.... there were a few good moments, the acting was sub-par at best, I kept seeing Daniel Radcliffe and thinking to myself it's Harry Potter. I can say without feeling bad this is one of those movies you can watch once and not hate yourself after.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded it on a website and JUST FINISHED UPGRADING EVERYTHING then I go 2 app store and see temple run download it pray that it dissent delete data and everything GONE!!!!!! worst of all it cant be fixed

B007HO392S|1.0|I got this CD because of the song Good Girl, which is a great song. Now for the bad, Good Girl is the only song on this album worth listening to. Two Black Cadillacs and Cupid's Got a Shotgun are the 2nd and 3rd best songs and they are medicore at best, and rest of the album is horrible. Either this album was rushed or all the good song writers are sending their material to other artist. I'm really disappointed in the quality of the album and it was truly a waste of money. If you haven't brought the album yet, don't, save your money and just pay to download Good Girl.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|if you like strategic games with no controls this is the game for you. try it and see how you like it. what is the worst that can happen you can always delete it later
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney has done it again, this album is bangin. Femme Fatale is one of Britney's best albums to date. The highlights are Til the World Ends, Hold it Against Me, and I Wanna Go. All the other songs are pretty good too. Britney really took her time on this album and didn't fill it with filler songs just to create an album.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Enjoyed it!!  This was my first ipad book purchase.  Easy to read on my iPad.  Quick, engaging, ready to see the movie!
B0086700CM|5.0|This gameis really fun. I played it on my sister's iPod because I couldn't get it on my Kindle. Thank you guys!
0345803493|5.0|The story line just keeps getting better and better with these two characters.  In the second book you really see Christian's feelings for Ana coming to light.  The ending had me in tears and just so happy..A must read!!!
B0081JAED0|4.0|Believe it or not, I have not reviewed a record in months. There has been nothing out there worth purchasing. There are a bunch of albums slated for release in the upcoming months, so I'm jazzed about that.<br /><br />One of the disks I've been waiting for - for about six years - is the new disk from Garbage: 'not your kind of people'.<br /><br />Like an iTunes junkie, I once again bought the deluxe version - 15 songs as opposed to 11 on the regular version.<br /><br />The sound is new but not new - such is the beauty of Garbage.<br /><br />Each of their disks is slightly different but has a familiar vibe that go through all five of their recordings.  'NYKOP' (you don't think I'm gonna write that title out each time I use it, do you?) has a modern day sound and still sounds like they took some pointers from Blondie's 1977 disk,  'Plastic Letters' .  This is not a bad thing.<br /><br />I don't know that this disk is better than their last one, 'Bleed Like Me', but I find it way more appealing than 'Version 2.0' and even better than or even 'Beautiful Garbage'.<br /><br />I am digging \\"Man on a Wire\\" - it is totally rocking.  Totally meant to be played LOUD (well, when I could still hear........no worries, I'm going to an ENT tomorrow).  Same can be said for \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\".  I am loving that too.<br /><br />\\"Sugar\\" has a nice ethereal feel to it.  You want a dance-like tune?  Try \\"I Hate Love\\".  If radio still played groups like Garbage, it would make a really good single.....which is more than I can say for their first radio release, \\"Blood Like Poppies\\" - I'm not digging it - at all.  It kind of has all the right elements, but it is not firing on any cylinder for me.  ...and \\"Felt\\" feels like something off their first disk. Not a bad thing, just a little too similar.<br /><br />As for the four bonus tracks, they don't seem so bonus.  That is a good thing. Most extra tracks are total throwaways that you end up wishing you didn't spend the extra dough to get them.  But \\"The One\\" and \\"What Girls are Made Of\\".  \\"Show Me\\" is good.  \\"Bright Tonight\\" sounds a little too much in the vein of \\"Sugar\\", which was done much better.<br /><br />Still  with 'NYKOP', Garbage releases a more than solid disk, which is great. Unfortunately, music trends have moved on in the 7-8 years since their last release - and even back then the industry was leaning towards marginal individual artists who have little to no talent and penchant for auto-tune.<br /><br />I'm glad to see they can buck that trend while still doing something \\"old\\"....and do it with talent.get them.  But \\"The One\\" and \\"What Girls are Made Of\\".  \\"Show Me\\" is good.  \\"Bright Tonight\\" sounds a little too much in the vein of \\"Sugar\\", which was done much better.<br /><br />Still  with 'NYKOP', Garbage releases a more than solid disk, which is great.

0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved, loved Fifty Shades of Grey :-) I thought the book was super easy to read and follow.  I found myself really drawn to the Ana and Christian and their story.  And I think we all are searching for someone like Christian in our lives...
B0086700CM|5.0|one day I got on the store and saw it I had the game.  to 2 days and my high score is 1000000
0345803507|5.0|This wrapped up the story of Ana and Christian and I really, really enjoyed the ending of this book.  I actually found myself holding back the tears while reading this one.  The love for one another has grown so deep and the ending really explained things from Christian's perspective...I can not wait to see what E L James writes next!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a fun time filler. it reminds me of the origenal Oregon trail.  I wish thay would bring that back out.
0446572993|5.0|I've probably read pretty much everything that Baldacci has written.  This is undoubtedly the best.  The character of the assassin who rids this country of of the nasty folks working against us is very believeable amd dynamic.  Even the supporting cast of characters including the FBI agent, the \\"innocent\\" and the lesser players such as the \\"blue man\\" and the sleeper agent are well portrayed.  Even the bad guys are well done.  An exciting novel.  I hope there will be others in the series.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run has finally come to amazon!!! I have been waiting for ages to purchase this!!!!!!!! honestly I would have paid like $50 for this app!!!!!!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|The product is great. Love Florence and the Machine. It was available at a great price so I snatched it up. Thank you Amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this on my kindle for the longest!!!! This game is soooo fun and addicting!!!! I absolutely love this game!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this app ive played it on my friends iphone and ive been waiting for it to come out as the kindle fire version :)
B0086700CM|5.0|Besides the fact that this game is absolutely amazing, I think all kindle owners were cheated for how late this was released. I am thankful it is out now, but temple run has been on ios for about a year. Why there was such a delay I don't know, but the initial temple run craze is over, making all the glorious fire owners late. Anyway, I highly reccomend downloading this app, just make sure you are playing it when you have nothing else to do because you might get fired from work or beaten by your mom or something like that.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|Not for everyone, die hard fans will no doubt love it!<br />Loving the series isn't a prerequisite, it's still enjoyable if you know nothing about the series, though it would be kind of confusing.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it the best game ever very addicting love everyone. ages 7 and up must have app .I was so happy when they put this app up for the kindle fire
B0058YPL66|5.0|love this show soooo much cant wait to get it cant wait to see the new season! love its so much! best show to come on tv since adventure time!
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally! I checked every day for temple run amd now its finally jere! This game is SO addicting. If I could only have 1 game on my kindle,  this would be it. You HAVE to get this game!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg addicted to it! you must get it!fun fun fun fun!<br />who wouldn't want to be chased by ugly monkey things?
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is finally on Amazon! A great 3D game at no cost! While this game may run slow on certain devices, the quality is great for a mobile app. I can admit that I've spent hours upon hours trying to make that hardest jump and going 5000 meters.
B004UID2LC|1.0|MALWARE. it was great for a while, until the latest update that is. Both of my antivirus programs detected it as soon as the update installed. Immediately uninstalled. too bad this happened, because it was a fantastic app
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever. I can waste my life playing it. it is so much fun. I can't wait to play it now
0345803485|3.0|Ok...so an erotica, BDSM, or romance novel reader I am not....but as another reveiwer stated this is pure literary crack. The first book anyway. I bought the two other books of the trilogy before I finished Fifty Shades. I couldn't bear knowing I may go a day without the sequel. That being said......it is not very well written. I'm half way into Fifty Shades Darker and I am getting annoyed. Very repetitive ... gasping, sighing, lip biting, flushing, etc.... Its getting old quick. My first experience with BDSM or any type of erotica was The Story of O which I enjoyed throughly. This doesn't begin to compare. Go ahead and read it though....its not worthy of all the hype but its entertaining.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|The delivery time was very fast (3-4 days) and the product came as described, free of defects (visually) and minor cover wear.  Haven't tried it out in a player yet, but if it doesn't work I'll update the post.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have waited forever to get this game for the kindle fire and now that I saw they had it, I downloaded it immediatly
B00004D35R|1.0|I did not know certain videos were for certain regions this  DVD does not play on any of our machines except the lap top rather frustrating.
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game!!! im so obsessed. like it on my phone.. but so much better on the kindle. :) download!!!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|A lot of the reviews for this book have stated it didn't hold up to the three earlier books (GoT, CoK, SoS), and gave it a low star count due to that. I feel that is somewhat unfair. This book is still entertaining, and better than the majority of novels out there, as a bad GRRM book is still better than 95% of the garbage that is published nowadays.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love it. it is the best game ever and i mean BEST. if there were six stars i would so givw it six.
0345803507|5.0|Every minute is a page turner and every twist in the story kept me reading. I couldn't put these books down and never heard a bad thing from any of my friends who read them also.
B0086T77MG|1.0|\\"Sherlock Uncovered\\" is not complete. Not only is it less than half the length, it should be a free \\"Extra\\" with the Season Pass.<br /><br />Are we to pay another $1.89 with a butchered part 2 of this extra.<br />$1.89 for 9 minutes is just plain greedy.....<br /><br />If you want to see the full version it is on YouTube for free.....
0345803493|5.0|The best Trilogy that I have read in a long time! The 2nd book picked up right where the first one left off and there was no way I could have predicted what was going to happen.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Let me keep this short and succinct.<br /><br />The vast majority of indie published kindle novels on Amazon are horrid.  I have said that I'd vote republican before I would buy another indie novel on Amazon (been burned bad a few times), and I would probably open an artery in my neck before voting republican. (not that I am a fan of democrats, I just really hate modern republicans, ignorance and greed are not virtues!)<br /><br />I read the first 5% of this on a friend's kindle and knew that I had just discovered an exception to my \\"never buy indie on amazon\\" policy. I bought it and read it.<br /><br />So my review:  With regard to story, plot, character, world building, and prose quality this novel is competitive with the top writers currently being published by the major fantasy/sci-fi publishing houses.  I won't deduct for the editing because this novel has very few editing issues, an amazing feat for a self published novel.<br /><br />I fully expect Mr Ryan will be under contract with a major publisher in the very near future and I am looking forward to more from him.
B0086T71MM|4.0|It was an episode all about two differant leading ladies , Peggy and Joan. They take differant roads to get what they really want in life . The Megan scene with her friend crawling all around like she was either drunk or five was annoying and was best left on the cutting room floor. Also thought Don was a little preachy which got on my nerves. Just because he does not cheat anymore does not make him a perfect angel.<br /><br />  I cried at the end when Don kissed Peggy's hand. Pete really made me want to vomit in this episode and I was really hoping Trudy would throw him down an elevator shaft. Also loved Megan's dress and Peggy's ensemble she wore to her lunch date.

1401235417|5.0|I've always loved Batman as a character, I love the stories that people have told about him. Chuck Dixon, Grant Morrison, Paul Dini, Jeph Loeb, Frank Miller; but none of these writers have written Batman as I have wanted to see him. Ive always seen Batman as too grimdark, or too campy, or surrounded by so much plot armor that he effectively becomes Batgod instead of Batman. Scott Snyder, who himself considers himself a horror writer, writes the Batman I want to read. The tone, Bruce's thinking, his internal dialogue, the right amount of grimdarkness, and that special moment where Batman rises above despite being apparently beaten. The Court of Owls is one of the best Batman tales in recent memory. A unique villain that pushes Batman to his very edge, and the thought that they know Gotham better than it's protector.<br />I also loved the art. I was hesitant with Capullo, he used to work on Spawn which is extremely gritty and in my initial opinion not fitting to Batman. I grew to love Capullo's art as it matched the tone of the story that Snyder was trying to tell. It fits the story and blends seamlessly with Snyder's writing style and enhances the book greatly.<br />From a die hard Batman fan, I approve of the new52 Batman, and will keep reading as long as Snyder and Capullo keep creating these amazing stories, and I look forward to the Night of Owls, which is fantastic so far.

1423140591|4.0|I've been a huge fan of anything written by Rick Riordan for the longest time, so I was so happy that he decided to write more stories about Percy and his friends! This second book in the heroes of Olympus series definitely was action packed, and I really enjoyed it!<br /><br />One of the best parts about this book has to be the plot. It had a lot of action and suspense, but it also had some very nice sweet moments. After not seeing Percy at all during the first book in the series, I was SO happy to have him back in this one! It was really interesting to see him without his memories of his life and it kind of reminded me of The Lightening Thief where he had no idea what was going on. I especially liked when he started to remember again because it really brought back memories of previous books from the series. Of course, Percy still knows how to fight and he such an amazing fighter!<br /><br />I really liked the two new characters we meet in the series: Frank and Hazel! At first, I wasn't sure how much I would like both of these characters, because I really loved all the characters from camp half-blood. As the story progressed, I really started liking them more and how much they cared for Percy. It was really interesting to see the type of powers that they had and they were a really great addition to this book! I will also say that it was really nice to see Juno (Hera) and Mars (Ares) in this book and how they interact with Percy (who doesn't have any memories).<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this book and I was SO glad to see Percy again! I am really looking forward to the next book in the series, The Mark of Athena, which comes out this fall.

B005FVA63A|5.0|I bought this beauty a couple of weeks ago and got it a week later.  This little perfection contains everything for the ultimate ZooTV fanatic. From The Fly shades, to 12 and 7 inch vinyls and don't forget the 84 page hardcover book containing previously unreleased shots of the band during the making-of Achtung Baby plus Achtung Baby B-sides, From the Sky Down documentary, Zooropa and other great material presented on CD/DVD format. All-in-all, it is quite overpriced, however, if you really loved this era of U2, don't wait another day, you know you want it.

I was in laid-up(No pun intended) with a sprained ankle and a friend gave me this to read. It was \\"mind candy\\" and had an okay story. I may be one of the few that didn't find this really erotic. It was kinda sad actually. Glad I read it. Wanted to see what the hype was about and of course will read the next 2 books. Why? Well why not?
B0084IG7KC|5.0|A few spoilers, but if you are interested in the movies, I imagine that you have read the books.<br /><br />I fell inlove with all of The Hunger Games books, and the first movie was exactly what I wanted. I knew the movie was going to be different from the book. After all, you can't have a movie in first person (Unless you want the movie to suck) One of the great things about the movie is it provided things that you had no clue were going on while the Games were going on. You see the beginning of the revolution in District 11, seeing that Rue's death, along with Katniss showing her respect towards Rue is actually what sparked the rebellion in District 11. You see Haymitch hard at work providing parachute drops for Katniss. This movie is what all book to movies should do, take advantage of it being on the screen, working with what they have.<br /><br />To me, the movie is \\"The other half\\" of The Hunger Games, it compliments the book, and the book compliments the movie. There are changes, and the young teens will of course complain about them, but they really are minor. The origin of the Mockingjay pin, the fact that Peeta doesn't lose his leg in the movie. But it adds essential things that the book doesn't provide, the death of the Head Gamemaker, which is PERFECT! So, you might say that the book is missing things that the movie has, which is fair, it is why I think the movies and the books really do go together perfectly.

B005LZW8FO|4.0|To set a few things straight, \\"Another Earth\\" IS a sci-fi film in the strictest sense of the word, but do not go into it thinking of it that way.  It depends upon a suspension of disbelief but let's delay that discussion that for a moment.<br /><br />The plot is pretty straightforward: Rhoda, a bright, young girl headed to MIT leaves a party and takes her eyes off the road because her car radio announces a mysterious new planet is visible in the night sky.  Just as she spots it she slams into another car, killing a man's pregnant wife and child and leaving him in a coma.<br /><br />Four years later she leaves prison a ruined young woman, barely able to speak to anyone.  She takes a job as a janitor at a high school, probably fulfilling some testament to the ruination of her own educational dreams.  And when she tracks down the man whose family she destroyed, she flubs that, too, and ends up lying to him and telling him she's from a cleaning service, and she cleans his home every week for him.<br /><br />That's mostly it, but at the same time it isn't it at all.  So much goes on in terms of mood, posture, the length of the shot, and almost always the ever-enlarging aura of the other planet, one that seems to be mirroring us in every way.<br /><br />And that's where the really interesting dilemma comes in: could an earth that is SO much like ours--one that very well might have been EXACTLY like ours until the moment we (and they) spotted one another--be infinitesimally different ENOUGH that Rhoda might be able to escape the horror of her life, and the wrong that she did that night, the very night we spotted each other?<br /><br />I want to tell you more, but I worry so of spoiling it, which I will not do.  But there are three important things you should know about this film:<br /><br />1.  Don't dwell on the picky questions that sci-fi people tend to dwell over and could ruin your enjoyment.  Don't wonder how this planet escaped our detection until now.  Don't worry about how it affects our tides, or orbits, or atmosphere, or any of the little nitpicky things that would get in your way.  Think of the sci-fi in a less demanding sense of, say, a \\"Twilight Zone\\" or \\"Outer Limits\\" TV episode.  It is absolutely necessary for the other earth to be there...it's just not something that demands scientific specificity.<br /><br />2.  This is an independent film: low budget, hand-held cameras, occasional fuzzy shots, etc.  But it is not bothersome or \\"Blair Witch\\"-y.  This is a nice, quiet drama that is thoughtful and serious, and ultimately packs a punch.  It has a terrific ending that I will continue to mull over for some time.<br /><br />3.  An interesting note about the actors: William Mapother (Ethan from \\"Lost\\") is the man whose family was destroyed, and Brit Marling is a heretofore unknown actress who also wrote the movie...and it's a very good movie at that.  Both are pitch perfect in their respective roles, and this movie made me feel I was eavesdropping on two real people undergoing a very dramatic process.<br /><br />Stay with \\"Another Earth.\\" It is an extremely good film with an extremely powerful ending. .bout how it affects our tides, or orbits, or atmosphere, or any of the little nitpicky things that would get in your way.

B0086700CM|5.0|been waiting for this game on kindle for a long time! love it!! cant wait until it gets updated to be better!
0385338694|1.0|Slow and not written very well--huge disappointment--didn`t get too far into it--waste of time. I actually threw it away--good thing I only a penny (shipping was sadly way too much!!)Lesson learned--you get what you pay for!!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I don't normally leave very many reviews, but I was compelled to write one for \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand.\\"<br /><br />We saw this for sale at our local Target store and remembered that we had heard/read good things about the show.<br />It was the beginning of a long holiday weekend, so we thought it was a perfect time to delve into a new series.<br />I quickly pulled up Amazon on my iPod to check the reviews and saw that this show had an incredible amount of 5 star reviews, so we purchased it thinking there was no way we could go wrong.<br /><br />15 minutes into the first episode we began wondering what we had gotten ourselves into, and what the 5 star reviewers were smoking.<br />We were THIIIIIIS close to just shutting it off and calling it a $20 loss.<br /><br />WE ARE SO SO GLAD WE DIDN'T!!!<br /><br />Even 1/2 way through the first episode we could see all the things we were truly disliking, getting noticeably better. The costumes, the backgrounds, the digital effects, the action, the blood, the camera work, etc. (And the 1 or 2 characters I was immediately disliking got killed off, so we were good there too.)<br /><br />I'm not going to go into full detail about why this show is so delishisly good, because there are TONS of in-depth reviews out there for \\"Blood and Sand,\\" but I just wanted to put it out there that the first episode is quite deceiving, and is of a much lower quality than the rest of the show. So please don't judge in haste like we almost did.<br /><br />By episode two, the show is in full, glorious swing!<br /><br />This show will surely be your next guilty pleasure.<br /><br />(We've already finished \\"Blood and Sand\\" and have now moved onto \\"Spartacus: Gods of the Arena\\" and are loving that as well! We can't get enough of all that delectable debauchery!)
B0007RT9LW|5.0|The movie was flawless and loved the alternate movie version better than the original.I would have preferred a BluRay but for the cost I couldn't pass on the deal.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Excellent game. I love playing it. Great graphics. I play lots of games and this is one of my most favorite ones. Ivan play for hours.
0007466064|5.0|So far it is great----quarter of the way through. Hope it finally ends after 5000 pages of drama . Good guys are not always good and they lose ---a lot !
B0086700CM|5.0|Great app. This is a very easy and addicting game to play.  My daughter and I play all the time.
1419702238|5.0|My son absolutely hates reading. I have no idea what it is about this book - and the whole series - that made him ask me to buy every single book from this collection. He even re-read them several times!
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Wow! What an incredible production from BBC Earth with the soothing voice of David Attenborough. The details and the images are stunning, while the information presented gives your brain some morsels to take with you. The camera work is breathtaking as it celebrates life in its many forms!
145162445X|5.0|A very well written review of the physics of the quantum world.  It is fairly easy to understand for the nonphysicist.  No math so that is a plus.  It brings the concept into focus and allows one to visiualize just how something from nothing can occur.  It changes the whole concept of nothing to something in a way that is meaningful and awe inspiring.  It is amazing in so little of time since Einstein we have begun to master the physics of the cosmos which allows us to understand it.  And we as humans is the cosmos becoming aware and understanding itself.  This thought just fills me with pride in our species and a reverence for the cosmos even more.  Very much worth the read. I recommend it highly.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|The music and images are so beautiful and entrancing. I love this type of work, saying so much without a word spoken. The time and attention they take to get these amazing tracking shots is commendable. Simply mesmerizing!
B0086700CM|5.0|it wouldn't  work on my tablet every time you go to open it just takes you back to the thing you were on previously AWFUL!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game. fun challenging puzzles that you and solve quickly but require some thought and planning to solve with fewest steps.  small puzzles that you don't have to worry about losing your progress.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|These lights are literally the best thing I have ever bought for my bike.  I originally purchased one to see if it would fit my bike, and then when I got it on I immediately ordered a second one for the back wheel!<br /><br />This is not too too hard to install on the wheel, it takes some patience and looking at the directions carefully.  But once it's installed the lights will stay on and look amazing at night.<br /><br />These lights turn heads when I ride by people at night, and are great for some nighttime photography.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was truly an amazing series. Im disappointed that I'm done with all of them. Wished they had more. Once you pick this book up you won't put it down till you complete all of them!!!
B00018D3RI|5.0|I bought the DVD's for S&H a couple of years ago, and have recently been re-watching them (along with re-runs of the show currently showing on RTV), and I really am amazed how well this show holds up so many years later.  You can see the recycled cop storylines throughout the years from cop show to cop show, but S&H was so unique in it allowing it's 2 lead characters to honestly and truly care about each other.  Possibly TV's first true (and strongest) 'bromance' as they call it today, the relationship between Starsky and Hutch was the glue the held the show together.  As a fan of the show, you have to be commited to that relationship as well in order to completely enjoy it for all that it is.<br /><br />The show was also important for it's Captain.  It wasn't common place in the 1970's to see a black man in a position of power on TV. Captain Dobey not only fit that role, but did it with class and honesty with a fun streak tossed in.  He was respected by those he commanded (he cared about them as well) and he was a well rounded family man.  He was a much needed and much welcomed part of TV history.<br /><br />S&H was also unique in that it tackled difficult issues without backing away from them with easy answers.  Drug addiction (\\"The Fix\\" is easily one of most powerful and controversial episodes of the show), homosexuality (in a brilliant and powerful episode called \\"Death in a Different Place\\"), alcoholism, violent crimes against children, death of loved ones, etc.  It never made light of the issues and always treated them with a respect that one would not expect from a show of the 1970's.<br /><br />As someone else wrote in a review down below, you won't see a show like this ever again on television.  Sure it was corny at times and there are a few episodes that just fall flat (what show doesn't have those?), but in the end, it's a show that is not afraid of itself and one that cared about the characters and their relationships above all else.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|Just watched Avenged Sevenfold live in the LBC DVD and it was spectacular. Since I can't see them in concert this was the next best thing and A7X just rocked the hell out of my living room. This dvd was the best money I ever spent!!!!!!!!!
0345803485|2.0|I am reading this book because someone loaned it to me and I was curious as to what the fuss was about.  So far it's a terribly written romance with a LOT of sex in it and I've got a feeling I'm not even up to the worst parts yet.  It takes seven chapters to get to the racy stuff and the \\"romance\\" part of the story reads like the Twilight fan fic it was.  You can tell that Ana is meant to be Bella, Christian Grey is Edward and Jose is Jacob.  Ana is kind of the same self-absorbed twit as Bella Swan and of course Christian Grey is the same self-contained god with a secret that is Edward Cullen.  The funniest thing to me so far is that although Ana is supposed to be an very intelligent college graduate (with a Thomas Hardy obsession instead of Wuthering Heights) she keeps referring to her \\"inner goddess\\" and her genitals as her \\"sex.\\"  I cringe every time I read it.  I'm not a prude but the sex scenes are ridiculous, too frequent and unrealistic.  (Excuse me but how many women have multiple orgasms while losing their virginity? How many virgins are instantly great lovers for that matter?)  I could skim past the frequent sex scenes if the writing was better and the story was interesting.  This is as stupid as Twlight and is the smuttiest thing I've ever read.  I'm not sure if I'm going to bother finishing it or not.  I'm just thankful I didn't buy the book.  If you're curious borrow it or get it from a library. It's not worth buying and definitely not something you'd want your kids reading.
145162445X|5.0|Lawrence Krausee has done it again.  His insight into modern culture has created a lasting impression on education.  To write the book, Krauss expanded material from a popular lecture on the cosmological implications of a flat expanding universe he gave to the Richard Dawkins Foundation at the 2009 Atheist Alliance International conference.
B002ZHKZCY|5.0|Great acting, action and music.  I am not a particular fan of spy movies in general, but this one is so superb, I watch it at least once a year.  I give it all 5 stars, but still want to mention a few negatives that I havent seen anyone else note in their review.<br /><br />The few Russian lines that our two main assassins have to deliver are gibberish.  I am a Russian native and cannot understand a word of Russian spoken by Matt and Karl.  Why couldn't someone work with the actors to make the lines at least understandable, it's not like there is a whole conversation to carry, just a few lines/sentences...  I know it's nothing to those who do not understand Russian, but for me it's kind of a pesky issue, it takes me out of the story every time and I cant take them seriously at that moment.  That makes me curious - how well does Matt do with French and German(I think it was German?) ?  Is it at least understandable?  Or is it as bad as Russian?<br /><br />Last one - Matt Damon's makeup is too heavy.  It actually looks a lot better on this Blu-ray.  When I saw this movie for the first time in the movie theater, it surprised me how obviously made up his eyes were.  It was just a bit too \\"Matt Damon must look like he hasnt slept in a month, lets slap a lot of dark eye makeup on him\\".
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I've been waiting for this game for over a month and now I cant stop playing.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have not encountered this glitches that reviewers are talking about. overall an excellent game. lots to do. it does follow the cash for items model of similiar games I.e. Farmville etc. can't complain. Gameloft knows how to make a good app game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Enjoy the game.  It does become addicting.  Grandchildren play and has gotten me hooked on.  Now I play more then them.

B0086700CM|5.0|It took way too long for this to come out on the kindle fire, but it was so worth the wait! Awesome game!
145162445X|5.0|This book is written in a fashion that anyone can understand, but that doesn't take anything from it's depth. You will come away with an appreciation for the beauty of physics and an expanded sense of awe at the complexity of the universe.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the. the game me and my dad cant get away from this app. Its the best. really cool.
B0000062Y2|4.0|Yes, it was as I remembered it from years ago. Its production from those years ago<br />failed to keep up with the 'times' as it came over on the narrow screen. One other thing was that the production was for the American/Canadian continents, and I had to buy a new Toshiba DVD to play the DVD. It was $40 Aus.so no big deal
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is my addiction! I love it and constantly playing it all the time even on my phone!(: I would recommend it for ANYONE and EVERYONE!(:
0441013597|5.0|If you have ever watched the movie just know the book is much better and doesnt have sting in it. I could write you a book report but im doing this review on my droid (sorry)  so if you like indepth sci-fi this is the novel that got it right.  Long live the intergalactic jihad!
B005ZUR724|5.0|Its a full featuted mmo on a portable kindle device. its relatively inexpensive and pretty fun. Graphics are great for what they are. I totally recommend this game!
B007EC6FIS|5.0|What an excellent album! Actually, I really liked Perfect Symmetry, and liked a little bit of Night Train. Yes, some Perfect Symmetry songs were really weird and I didn't like, but the great ones were really great (and after years, you end up listening only to the good ones anyway!). But I was not disappointed with them coming back to their usual style, especially when they make songs like the ones in this album!<br /><br />We find the usual number of insanely good songs (Disconnected, A Day Will Come, In Your Own Time, Sovereing Light Café, On The Road), and I still couldn't find a single average song. No songs to be skipped in this album, which is quite remarkable and I can't remember happening for me, with them or any other artist. And I have been listening to this thing in a quite psychotic way...<br /><br />I still think that Perfect Symmetry has the best \\"best songs\\", but is very top heavy. Its top 4 (Pefect Symmetry, Lovers Are Losing, Black Burning Heart, Love Is The End) is better than in any other album, even Hopes and Fears. But this Strangeland is possibly the most consistent from start to end (can't say for sure, need some time to listen more).<br /><br />After reading the reviews, I started thinking that Under The Iron Sea is overrated by Keane fans. I loved that one too, but for me is clearly below the other 3 albums (besides the outrageoulsy great Frog Prince, Leaving So Soon, Put It Behind You and Hamburg Song).
B0086T71MM|5.0|What a great episode!  I had no idea what would happen with the three plot lines.  Thank you, Mad Men!
0345803507|5.0|One of the most interesting books i've ever read! Let me just say, i read the first book in 2 days, the second in 3 days and the third in 3 days as well.  It's a book you just cant put down! I loved Anastasia and Christian's story. I don't want to give anything ways but.. i honestly hope that E L James comes up with the 4th book soon!
B005K17RU0|5.0|accuweather is my favorite out of all the weather apps out there and I have tried them all its the most accurate it have a nice clean line look and navigation is easy
B007OWG3LM|5.0|\\"Valtari\\" is the latest Sigur R&oacute;s album, and it is their most laid-back to date comprising pastoral choral pieces. Listening to this is akin to floating on a calm ocean. Everything flows into the next, making this an album to be experienced as a whole, a far cry from lead vocalist J&oacute;nsi Birgisson's 2009 solo debut \\"Go\\" which was more upbeat and electronic.<br /><br />Standouts include the tender piano/string \\"Var&uacute;ð\\" with J&oacute;nsi's ethereal vocals juxtaposed against an ornate soundscape with strings and harmonies ascending to a skyscraping climax. Awesome and enthralling, my favourite. \\"Rembihn&uacute;tur\\" is a gently ascending number with J&oacute;nsi coming in midway, while \\"Dauðalogn\\" is like a Hymn. J&oacute;nsi sings on the first 5 tracks, while \\"Varðeldur\\", \\"Valtari\\", and \\"Fj&ouml;gur p&iacute;an&oacute;\\" (the latter with delicately tinkling keys) are largely instrumental with J&oacute;nsi's harmonies adding instrumental tone on some.<br /><br />The music is dense and requires time for everything to come into focus, but once it does, there's no letting go.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I would never in a million years have picked it up off a shelf.<br /><br />Thank God for friends.  It was a lovely lovely book.  Beautifully written and although it was a fairly big book, you were never wondering if it would end.  It was one of those books that as you get close to the end, you are dreading it as you know it's going to be a long time before you find another book to equal it.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|Scissor Sisters finally manage to recapture the magic and exuberance of their eponymous debut on their aptly titled fourth album \\"Magic Hour\\". Featuring an eclectic array of songs, the collection opens with the bouncy Elton John-style piano rocker \\"Baby Come Home\\" which recalls \\"Take Your Mama\\". \\"Keep Your Shoes\\" is a dance number with a skeletal groove. \\"Inevitable\\" is an absolutely gorgeous ballad with Bee Gees-style harmonies, co-written and co-produced by Pharrell Williams. Lead-off single \\"Only The Horses\\" is a piano-sprinkled dance number with an exuberant chorus co-produced with Calvin Harris.<br /><br />Other highlights are the ballad \\"Year Of Living Dangerously\\" (with electronic flourishes), the skeletal \\"Let's Have A Kiki\\" (with spoken camp lyrics), \\"Shady Love\\" (with Dubstep effects and Jake Shears rapping \\"She gone vote for Obama, and she likes to dance to Madonna\\"), the lilting Latin-tinged \\"San Luis Obispo\\", the incredible club banger \\"Self Control\\", the midtempo \\"Best In Me\\", the lovely epic ballad \\"The Secret Life Of Letters\\" (co-produced with Stuart Price), and \\"Somewhere\\" (with whirling synths and chiming guitars, again co-produced by Stuart Price), which is actually the entire album.<br /><br />The Deluxe edition contains \\"F*** Yeah\\" (with Shears rapping over a buzzing Dubstep rhythm), as well as remixes of this and \\"Let's Have A Kiki\\".<br /><br />A magical return to form.

B0073PPKNM|5.0|Jazz chanteuse Melody Gardot's new CD \\"The Absence\\" is produced by Brazilian composer and guitarist Heitor Pereira, adding a Latin lilt to her soft breezy sound.<br /><br />Opening is the sunny \\"Mira\\", with Gardot scatting and singing to rhythmic guitars. In a similar vein is closing number, the celebratory \\"Iemanja\\" which is sung in Portuguese (with a hidden instrumental jam after a 10 minute wait).\\"Amalia\\" is Folky, \\"So Long\\" is a tender acoustic piece, while \\"So We Meet Again My Heartache\\" is an achingly beautiful ballad with lush strings and emotive vocals - my favourite. \\"Lisboa\\" starts with chiming bells leading to a Jazzy guitar-driven ballad.<br /><br />Everything stands out really; \\"Impossible Love\\" (with enchanting guitar, clarinet and strings, and some spoken vocals with Gardot flitting between French and English as she tries to share her frustration at trying to get an affair to work), the prowling \\"If I Tell You I Love You\\" (with some Eartha Kitt-style purring and growling), the horn-sprinkled slow shuffle \\"Goodbye\\", and the spare hushed \\"Se Voce Me Ama\\" (with tenderly plucked guitar and some harmonising with Pereira). Regally understated and beautiful!
0345522303|5.0|I must admit to being a fan of the Nightrunner series ever since I stumbled across the first book.  I fell madly in love with Alec and Seregil even though I did have trouble with book four, Shadows Return.  To me it really seemed to drag.  However they are back in fine form in CASKET OF SOULS.<br /><br />With the exception of the very first book, Luck in the Shadows, CASKET OF SOULS has to be my favorite.  It is set in  Rh&iacute;minee and we get to watch two masters of the shadows ply their craft as they work to discover who all is in the various factions that are not happy with the current Queen.<br /><br />Also children from the poorer quarters are dying which really concerns Alec.  While he is investigating that, close friends of both of them start to die without a mark on them.  Is there any way that the two are connected?<br /><br />We get to watch Seregil deal with his fears over losing Alec again and Thero try to throttle his love for a completely inappropriate woman.  In doing so, we get to know them better than ever before.<br /><br />I highly recommend CASKET OF SOULS  to any followers of the Nightrunner series.  It is well worth the wait.  And to any lovers of dark fantasy, I recommend the entire series.<br /><br />I rate this book a 4.5.<br /><br />***I received this book for no charge from NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review.  No monies have or will exchange hands.

6302787068|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />  It's hardly a mystery why the \\"Aladdin\\" myth attracted Disney's animation crew back in 1992.  This timeless story boasts everything: exotic locales, a scrappy hero, flamboyant characters, opulent royalty, giddy romance, despicable and devious villains, and, most tellingly, the endless possibilities of magic as epitomized by the genie.  However, as Disney's animators crafted this dynamic spectacle of a movie, I think they must have been concerned that one of \\"Aladdin\\"'s greatest assets -the protean, boundlessly energetic, and fast-talking Genie, as voiced by the inimitable comic pantomiming maelstrom Robin Williams- might ironically turn out to be one of its greatest liabilities.  In the Genie, we have a dominating, omnipotent character who can seemingly do anything.  So, once Aladdin gets possession of the Genie's lamp, isn't the movie over?  Just three wishes, and it's happily ever after.<br /><br />  Besides, doesn't Aladdin succeed solely because of the Genie?  You may recall that Aladdin (voice of Scott Weinger) promises to free the unbridled genie with his third wish.  However, after the Genie makes him a fabulously wealthy prince on the verge of wooing the Sultan's (Douglas Seale) alluring daughter Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) toward matrimony, Aladdin wants to renege on the deal because he feels he cannot continue this ultimate charade without the Genie's continued help.  Understandably, this puts the Genie in a funk and leads to a series of plot twists that place the Genie under the control of the ruthlessly ambitious Sultan's vizier (consultant) Jafar (Jonathan Freeman).  It seems that Aladdin goes from hero back to hopeless zero.<br /><br />  But hold on thearrrr, as Quick Draw McGraw would say, Disney shows us that Aladdin is not such a hopeless nothing.  From the beginning of the film, where we see the penniless orphan and his pilfering simian accomplice Abu (Frank Welker) acrobatically elude the Sultan's security guards led by the burly, irascible Razoul (Jim Cummings), we notice that Aladdin is nimble, clever, street smart, plucky and adaptable.  Even after being trapped in the Cave of Wonders by a disguised Jafar (who needs Aladdin to obtain the magic lamp) and finding the lamp, Aladdin tricks the trickster Genie into freeing him without wasting a wish.  Furthermore, even the Genie's vast power has its limits.  Besides servitude to whoever has the lamp, the Genie informs Aladdin that he has no power over death or love.  In other words, he can't be an assassin, or the Messiah, or Cupid.  If Aladdin wants to woo Jasmine, he ultimately has to do it on his own.  And when Jafar exploits the Genie to become a sultan and sorcerer and uses his power to neutralize his friends, Aladdin again has to find it within himself to defeat Jafar on his own.  Instead of false princely status, he uses his courage, sly wit and Jafar's voracious desire for ultimate magic to bring him down.<br /><br />  So you see, \\"Aladdin\\" belies its ethereal, insubstantial structure and supernatural fantasy elements to remind us that, after all, even if you have true friends to help you along, the true magic to make your life better lies within you.tan's security guards led by the burly, irascible Razoul (Jim Cummings), we notice that Aladdin is nimble, clever, street smart, plucky and adaptable.  Even after being trapped in the Cave of Wonders by a disguised Jafar (who needs Aladdin to obtain the magic lamp) and finding the lamp, Aladdin tricks the trickster Genie into freeing him without wasting a wish.

B0086700CM|5.0|the game is a treat timewaster and a really fun game to play. it kept me entertained for a long time and it still does :)
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is awesome ; my sister has an ipod and I'be been waiting forever for it to come on my kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading Catching Fire. It had lots of action that was very interesting.I hope you'll like Catching Fire too!
B007NZDES0|5.0|I saw this show live, and it was truly one of the most incredible concerts I've seen...and I've easily seen a couple hundred.  That voice!  It was a sexy, sensual, beautiful and highly original concert experience.  If you are thinking...ugh...how good could it possibly be...they do ballad-y songs.  Well, trust me...this will blow you away. This is a class act all the way.  And the sets are amazing.  Enjoy!
145162445X|5.0|Easily understandable by the layman, clear, concise, compelling. Uses empirical evidence and simple logic to prove his points. Not only a book you will learn from, but also one that provides great entertainment. Highly recommend.
0439023513|5.0|Contains some Spoilers!<br /><br />I read all three books of the Hunger Games Series. I know some people were disappointed with the third book, so going into it I wasn't sure what to expect and I thought I would come away disappointed as well, but I really loved all three books. Its obviously not an easy read there's a lot more Violence and loss of life (but its an all out War, so its to be expected) and it doesn't have a cookie cutter ending as well as much romance as the first two books, but what really drew me in was how they were going to resolve everything, I think the romance just takes on a different image; instead of all the kissing you see her anguish of losing Peeta and how much he meant to her and kept her together, he was her light. Of course it threw me, when they finally rescued him that he had a mental break and that the Capitol had turned him against her through brain washing, but President Snow was an evil character, it wouldn't have looked right for everything to fall into place right away for Katniss in the culmination of the series. But as hurt and angry as she was she never gave up on him and fought hard to get him to hold on, he still loved her. I think all the hardships she went through made her realize what she truly wanted; I felt that this was the point for the character of Katniss to realize how much she actually did love Peeta and how valuable He was to her because he helped her keep her humanity. The ending was beautiful and appropriate, she fell in love with him and they stayed together after everything they had been through. Perhaps I read to much between the lines but I don't know if anybody else caught on to the fact that they made love at the end of the book before the Epilogue:<br />\\"I wake screaming from the nightmares...but his arms are there to comfort me. And eventually his lips. On the night I feel that thing again, the hunger that overtook me on the beach (From Catching Fire)I know this would have happened anyway....so AFTER,when he whispers, \\"You love me. Real or not real?\\"<br />I tell him \\"Real\\"<br />They will never be the same people from the beginning; they are understandably scared, but they are not as hopeless and depressed as some people want to write them off as. They're each others comfort and support and love. Truly Loved it!<br /><br />From the obvious hopeless romantic:)
B0073PPKNM|3.0|I must confess that I am a huge Melody Gardot fan. I awaited the release of this album with great expectations. I ordered it from Amazon for delivery on the day of release. The music arrangement is fantastic. However, Miss Gardot's amazing talent is absolutely squandered by poor recording and sound engineering! Melody's voice sounds as if it was recorded from the next room. The sultry texture and tone inflections of Melody's voice are largely lost. For those of you who have a low quality sound system, you might like this album. For those of you who have a high resolution sound system, pass on this album. The quality of recording and sound engineering is not up the standards set by her other albums. (Five stars for Miss Gardot's amazing talent + one star for recording and sound engineering)/2 = 3 stars.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Very addictive and well-designed puzzle game. No unnecessary graphics reducing performance, clean interface, an overall well designed app. Android needs more of these.
B006JTS5OO|2.0|I purchased the Wocka Wocka value pack for my children due to the inclusion of a movie soundtrack.  Based on the outside packaging, it appears that CD soundtrack is included.  However, a code is given for a download from the Disney website.  You have to become a Disney Rewards member if not already, and then you can download a Zip file of the soundtrack.  For us the, we had to try 3 different programs to find one that would actually open the file.  We have still been unable to burn a CD of the soundtrack, and currently can only listen to it from our computer.  It's a pretty disappointing purchase for us, and I wish we had just bought the regular movie version only.
B007P3TMW2|2.0|I watched the movie on my flight to Washington, so it had all of my attention. I found it hard to follow and not at all what I thought it would be. I guess just like alot of movies the best parts are in arthe previews. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock  are hardly in the movie, I would have liked to see more of their characters.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I just saw them live on the opening night of their US tour so I can't wait to get this in the mail and experience it all over again!!
0345803507|5.0|This was the best out of the 3 books. Made me laugh, made me cry, kept me on the edge of my seat. The Shades Trilogy was so good I read them all over a long weekend, because I could not put the books down. I really loved the characters and in each book you learn more about them, leaving you sad that you say goodbye to them.
0307949486|2.0|Larsson is an inept writer, and the story needs work.  With some serious editing, and a length of 350 - 400 pages instead of 700, *maybe* this could have been a decent book.  As it is, it's just...blah.  If Larsson had just followed the basics of writing that have been taught for ages, it would have been a much better work.  You know, things like:<br />- Keep the plot moving<br />- Don't fill the book with banal detail<br />- Don't introduce too many non-essential characters<br />- Don't introduce uninteresting and inconsequential sub-plots<br /><br />Larsson instead completely ignores all of these basics, and as a result this novel is a boring, tedious read.  The movies (both the Swedish and the American) are far superior.  Why?  Because they are only two hours long - they include the interesting parts, and cut all of the drivel.
0345803485|5.0|Alot of sex but worth the read you have got to look at the story instead of the sex. Left me wanting more to read. Complex, tender and alot of other emotions.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I got hooked when watching reruns of Serenity on the Syfy channel.  I could not stop watching. So, when the movie was aired, I knew I wanted a copy to watch whenever I wanted to just get away for reality and ride along with the characters in the movie.  I would recommend this movie to any syfy fan.  This is just a great movie.  To bad the tv show only ran one season.
0345803493|5.0|This book is awesome it picks up where the first one left off. Starting to get an even better understanding of the main character. It stirs all of your emotions.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|Somehow I missed this show while it was running on t.v.  Received the first season as a gift, and now am ordering the next season.  Looking forward to receiving it!
B0015DWLD0|4.0|Have you been to India? Have some of your friends talked about going? In case you also are thinking of going maybe now you won't think about going after you read the following.  It is The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga. I always had a bad feeling about India after I read a story about the country and about the huge population that live on the streets.  What has stuck in my mind is the story I read about a family living on the streets, the youngest being a small girl, who sits there with a red swollen vulva showing and the explanation is that her numerous brothers use her for their own gratification. The horrow of it has stayed with me. Also in The White Tiger anything about India talks of the huge difference between the castes - the rich are beyond belief in their enjoyment of the life their riches afford them while the poor are treated like slaves.<br /><br />As a dog lover reading about the starving dogs roaming the streets and the elephants living unrestrained with their droppings, which are huge, for everyone to walk in, made me angry that the life style this conveys.  The people especially searching the garbage for their food, and stories about their shanty towns they live in, that is if they have a roof over their heads at all.  It is rumoured that the number of people in India will shortly surpass that of China, with no restraints in sight.<br /><br />The White Tiger tells it all - it is a very good read. I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is everywhere right now, with positive reviews.  It's also likened to the Twilight series which I loved so, I bought it.  The start of the book wasn't so bad, although I realized the writing was stilted and pretty elementary from the get go.  By the time I got to the Red Room I was really having to talk myself into continuing with the book.  I kept telling myself that I paid money for it so should at least read to the end.  But I'm sorry to say, I just couldn't do it.  I could have read it if the writing had just been better, more convincing, more sophisticated, but it just didn't work for me.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I obviously haven't seen it yet, and I normally don't do this, but Beyonce had one of the best prequels to Alien of all time.

9056912445|5.0|If there's one book on the endgame I'd recommend every aspiring chess player have, this is it!! The book is loaded with clear instructions, games, and tests making the study of the essential endgames enjoyable. You cannot fail but emerge a much stronger player after absorbing the material in this book. This is an endgame book that can be read cover-to-cover and not simply used as reference material. The author, Jesus de la Villa, deserves full praise for providing this book to the chess world.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Just a beautiful concert. I have been waiting for [[ASIN:B000056MMD Sade - Live Concert Home Video]] to be released on Blu-ray and while that hasn't happened, Bring Me Home is just an awesome concert experience that will pacify my wants for now. An older Sade shows that her voice is just as good as it was over a decade ago singing a nice mix of the songs that made her initially famous and some newer songs that are less well known. Superb audo with 3 soundtrack choices and even some extras, this is a must for any Sade fan. Bring her home, you won't be disappointed.
159562015X|5.0|So many of the self-evaluation books my employers have required their staff to read have been so focused on weaknesses, and not really on strengths.  I love the concept of focusing on strengths, and I love the deep analysis of each personality type.  The book totally had me pegged.  It was fantastic - - not because it told me anything *I* didn't know, but it told my EMPLOYER that everything I had been saying about WHO I am is true :-)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Truly one of the worst books I've read in a very long time. Can this writer ( and I use the term loosely) honestly think readers will believe that the completely innocent young lady did not run screaming in the night after seeing Christian's \\"play room\\". And how many times can you insert \\"holy crap\\" into the dialog. The relationship which actually included a contract is one of the most ridiculous ideas I've seen, and the thought that some sane woman of intelligence, which we can only assume was Anastasia, since she had just graduated from college, would actually consider is beyond realistic. Save you your money and your time......this was so not worth $9.99 on my Kindle. Maybe if it was free!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it all the other ppl had it on there stupid iphones but now I have it and my pic is bigger hahaha
145162445X|5.0|This was a great follow up to the video of the same name. This gives the insight and background to many of the comments and jokes during his presentation. It also includes a little info not given in the original.<br /><br />Lawrence wasn't instrumental in my deconversion, but was helpful in keeping me sane when I hear arguments like \\"you can't make something from nothing, therefor god did it\\".<br /><br />Rock on, Larry. Rock on.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so good and addicting...I played it for like an hour l love it you should get it right now and the great thing too is its FREE!!!
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|This movie stinks!  It's amazing they could make this bad an action/adventure film with so promising a premise.<br /><br />For starters, the film is at least 30 minutes too long.  The extra time is padded with pointless conversations and inane philosophizing about life's meaning.<br /><br />There is absolutely no chemistry between Neeson and the other actors (all of whom, besides Neeson, are completely miscast).<br /><br />The cinematogaphy is bland, the scene sequencing incoherent, the editing amateurish, the story unimaginative.<br /><br />There aren't even enough wolf scenes to make the film worthwhile.  Even the ludicrous inter-species fights in \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" were more interesting.<br /><br />Save your time and money: watch Cliffhanger or Vertical Limit instead.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I loved this book! I loved the mix of different mythologies and really connected to the characters as i myself am a twin. The history entwined with the plot was amazing. If you love fantady snd adventure, you'll love this book. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!
B008133DO8|1.0|Disappointed that we paid for this.  Not at all like the last season - raunchy, filled with sexual perversion and R-rated images.

B0074MZSWW|1.0|I bought the cd in large part because I enjoyed the band's appearances on television, and in particular because I like the song \\"Hold On\\", so I was pretty disappointed when the cd arrived and I found that the first track (\\"Hold On\\") had some very disturbing, dissonant buzzing and static, which interefered with my enjoyment of the last thirty seconds or so of that track. I contacted Amazon and arranged for a replacement cd to be sent. Imagine my surprise when I found the same defect on the new cd. It appears that the band decided to do this on purpose, since it is simply not possible that they overlooked such an atrocious assault on the senses. Just raise your middle finger at your audience, like some distemperate waitress who spits in your coffee. As a paying customer, I am insulted to get taken this way. I won't be buying any more from the Alabama Shakes.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I was surprised at how much I got caught up in the characters. It was a true depiction of what highs and lows you go through with your first love. I would read more by this author.
B007L96SI6|5.0|I am not going to go through each track by track because many of the reviewers here have done that quite succinctly. I have been a Haley fan since last year (Halien), and I have been waiting for this album since the season finale. Heck, she held her own with Tony Bennett at last years finale show, and blew me away every time she and Casey performed.  This new album is a joy. Every track is catchy, with her trademark bluesy voice, retro style, and ode to the old school traditions. Plus it is contemporary, without being dystopian, atonal, or contrived. I have listened to Listen Up three times, and I still get \\"goosies.\\" Much better than what those hack judges have done recently.<br />Haley, please go on tour ASAP, and bring Casey with you. (and Elise Testone, too.)<br />This album is a must, and I hope it goes to #1.<br />Review Part 2<br />I have been requesting KCSN and KCRW in Southern California to play \\"Listen Up\\" but to no avail. I have yet to hear Ryan Seacrest play one track on 102.7 FM. It's as if the zombies have taken over the radio, and they keep playing the same mind numbing songs over and over again. Haley Reinhart has produced the freshest sounding CD in a long time. In terms of musical consistency, I am reminded of singer- songwriters like Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, Elton John and Chicago, where one song after another is a treat.<br />Most new CD's are not even on this level anymore. Think Chicago 7, Gaucho by Steely Dan, Madman Across the Water. Some of her melodies I cannot get out of my head, they are that infectious. So join her fan club, spread the word, keep the faith, and show up when she's performing, because Haley Reinhart has got to stick around, for us baby boomers and our kids.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game to pass time. still don't believe in paying money to play games though. please add me if you do decide to play and ill help u along SN: amanley

1435107683|5.0|We purchased this book as part of the Sonlight B core. It has so far been one of my daughter's favorites! She loves the silly endearing antics of Owl as he does things such as inviting winter into his house, making tear-water tea and trying to be upstairs and downstairs at the same time. We ditched the schedule because she was so thrilled with reading this book that she could not put it down!
B00723NWJE|1.0|It amazes me that someone with her voice could be made to sound so bad. This album is one maudlin depressing song after another.  I keep waiting to hear the Norah Jones that was so stunning with the Peter Mallick Group.  Instead, there has been a procession of pretty bad to mediocre stuff, and I'm wondering if she needs a new agent or label to get her going again.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|This is an amazing cd and it was delivered without a mark on it and very quickly ! I am very happy with my purchase and will order again and tell all my friends about the quick and easy purchase I have made here on this site .<br />Thank you .
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I own the 'Alien Quadrilogy' and hesitated to upgrade for a long time. I hate nothing like a greedy studio that tosses out another edition of the same movie every two or three years. The 'Quadrilogy' is more than enough for any but the most hardcore Alien fans, and if you don't care about Blu-ray one way or the other, seek out a copy of that. You will be happy.<br />There is a major visual upgrade, the sound seems 'better', though it was difficult to reach the perfect balance. If I was happy with it in a dialogue scene, as soon as things started blowing up/aliens started screeching/guns started blasting, etc, I'd have to turn it WAY down. I am not enough of an audiophile to pronounce judgement on whether this was my soundbar's fault (it's a nice soundbar,though) or something about the Blu-ray mastering ( I do not recall having the same problem with the Quadrilogy).<br />There are many extras that were not present on the Quadrilogy, but unless you're super hardcore, not enough new stuff to make it alone worth the buy. It's mostly the same as 'Quadrilogy'.<br /><br />I was VERY curious to see what the upgrade from DVD resolution to Blu-Ray would do for the films, and here is where your money's worth is over the DVDs. It's a MAJOR AND SERIOUS upgrade. There were actually several instances where I thought it actually was a negative, where some of the 'scare' is lessened because you can see the alien coming three miles away, where before it just pounced suddenly out of the shadows. That's 'tomayto/tomahto' though, because my fiance, who had not seen anything but the original, was plenty creeped out. I may just prefer my aliens lunging out of the dark because that's how I've always seen them.<br />But other than that one small personal minus, it's seriously cool- you can every little detail on every piece of the ship, where I couldn't before, even on the 'Quadrilogy'. One can see the truly enormous amount of craftsmanship and attention to detail that went into the set, costumes, and of course the aliens. Given that they had no idea their work would ever be put to such a test as 1080p, it's a true testimonial to the quality of their work.<br /><br />I had a lot of trepidation because quite a few of these reviews mention the set will not work properly on a sizable number of Blu-ray players, and I've had so much trouble with mine already I was reluctant to risk it. (It is a newish player, was top-of-the line last year when I bought it and way more expensive than it needed to be for the amount of grief it's given me). THEN, though, I started noticing reviewers saying that the region-free version does not have these glitches. Amazon US does not officially sell the region-free version, but check out the \\"new and used from...\\" section and you will eventually find someone offering the region-free version. I have also heard of people just going to Amazon UK and purchasing it.<br />I've read several reviews noting the Region 1 version is packaged in the 'hardcover book' type cardboard style...the UK version is packed like a tradtitional set, in the familiar 'Blu-ray blue' plastic with plastic 'leaves' inside that each disc snaps in/out of, then the whole thing is slipcased as you see in the product description. I prefer this style.<br /><br />I got mine from a guy selling his region-free set through Amazon and paid a very reasonable price. I haven't worked through the whole set yet...have not started the bonus features and probably will not for awhile as I'd already watched it all on DVD. So far, though, I've had no problems and the set is AMAZING. It was, all things considered, well worth the upgrade from DVD.stumes, and of course the aliens.

B000JML7EC|4.0|I had never read Treasure Island, but upon receiving my kindle and the fact this was a free read, I downloaded a copy.  I had always thought I should sit and read this one and I am happy I did.  The story never really got stagnate.  As in the story hanging around the sea port town too long or sitting in the island cabin.  The story keeps moving along with twists and turns.  It was a great adventure on a great ship with the cook to a little known island.  If you havn't read it and enjoy adventure stories and mystery, dissete, and double crossing and most of all sea adventures, I suggest you try out this gem.  It's not too long and a great read.
B0086700CM|5.0|best time killer on the kindle fire!!! makes it that much better that it is free!! highly recommend to everyone young and old
B0081KTI0E|1.0|This movie almost put me to sleep from the beginning.  It builds up as a great thriller only to let down as a non-horror/thriller.  They could have further developed the plot, characters and made it much scarier that it is.  Plus the ending is horrible!  Save your money and wait for this to come to TV!
1241681244|5.0|Although I never lived in NYC, and know little about the markets, I knew the characters Wolfe has created. The most dispicable character in my humble opinion, are the two politicians, and the character of the Rev Al Shapton, who is a quasi politician.  Wolfe candidly describes the problems of the courts, the justice system and we the people with all our faults and blemishes.<br /><br />As Clarence Darrow once said about his two thrill killer clients,\\"even rich people are entitled to a defense.\\" I do not find Sherman as a hateful character. Perhaps because I do not find fault with someone who makes a lot more than I, or someone who is unfaithfull. The only flaw I find is my failure to understand how some one is \\"master of the universe\\" can turn into the mush Wolfe makes of him. There were a few moments when Sherman shows his \\"manhood\\". But most of the time, he seems a quivering mass of tepidity. (if there is such a word.)<br /><br />This novel was written before the incident at Duke, where the local DA, for political purposes, tries to convict the Duke La Crosse team. The real villians of the criminal justice system are no longer the Bull Conners of the past, but the elected DA's other public officials, and yes, the minorities who blindly follow people who are not their saviors, but self promoters. I think Wolfe was brave enough to write this story keeping political correctness out of his work. Wolfe has described our society with the shades drawn up. The novel reminds me of thelong running TV series,which somehow managed to be a comedy. I think it was sucessful because it showed everyone's pretensions, faults, and contradictions of personalities and groups.<br />Nobody, from parents, gays, and all ethnic groups were treated equally.<br /><br />Compared to most of the trash that is written today, this novel is probably going to last beyond our generation. It is an accurate description of our times. The language uses 4 letter words accurately, as used in life, not forthe sake of foul language, or sex to spice a story with sophomoric writing, for sophomoric readers, and publishers who promote and encourage writers to produce trash, instead of art.<br /><br />If  you are looking for a book with a hero, don't read this. There are few real hero's in real life, and there are none to be found here. In the end, perhaps Sherman, becomes a hero because he apparently learns something he didn't know when the novel begins. Finding knowledge in a pile of poop is something most people never learn.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I kept reading only because I felt I had to be missing something because of the hype.  I wasn't.  It was naive, repetative and I just wanted it to end.
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG I have been waiting sooooo long for this! but I cant believe that they didn't make it like $5.00 like seriously.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is incredible. it is so much fun and it is free. you must get this app. awesomeness so much fun
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this puzzle game. It is very challenging until you get the hang of it. The first stages are fairly easy, but that dramatically changes at level 1.6. Do not be discouraged, though; this level is NOT impossible and there is no typo/glitch, despite what other comments might suggest. It just takes a lot of extra thought. Once you get past this and start better understanding the game and picking up on the strategy needed to finish the more complicated puzzles, it's smooth sailing! I have had no problems with the game on my kindle fire. The squares are a little small, but you can adjust the size of the board by pinching the screen, as you can with many other apps. In all, I think this is a great game that exercises the mind well. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you're the kind of person who craves mental stimulation and loves sudoku, then you should really download this game.

159514188X|5.0|I decided to read this book after the author (Jay Asher) critiqued a manuscript of mine. I was cynical, expecting some sort of pedantic mush I guess, but what I found was a first-rate mystery using a novel narrative technique that I was really happy that I'd purchased. Sorry that I read it, though, because now I can't ever read it for the first time again! High School students really love it, and with good reason, but I believe that it's good enough for any adult to enjoy as well. Keeps you guessing and doesn't preach (although a teenager will say that it does.) Very nice work!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fantastic book. How he comes up with ideas ? well it doesnt matter as most of his books rock.<br />Big fan of this one
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are fun and worth playing. if at first you don't succeed with these games just keep on trying.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|a must read. very touching book. and yeah you can actually shed a tear or two.<br />For anyone who has pets this book you can relate to
B00679T1EO|5.0|Series 2 was even better than series 1, I loved them all, because they even had a bonus section that explained about this drama and deleted scenes..<br /><br />This is a better buy than the regular UK version that is edited..
B001HN694K|4.0|This was DELIGHTFUL!  I have not been a big fan of the story Alice in Wonderland growing up (I'm 40+) - - but I have to say I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE.  Perhaps part of that is because this is really a SEQUEL to that original story.<br /><br />It's colorful, amusing and very entertaining (the imagination that went into making the characters come to life, the sets and all the people who pulled it off were top notch!)<br /><br />Mia Wasikowska was perfect as Alice!<br /><br />I will be buying this.
B006X4VVFU|5.0|This Xmas special was fantastic, it continues the other two series..<br /><br />If you like award winning UK UNCUT blurays with fantastic storylines, please buy this special to complete your collection..<br /><br />The actors are unbelievable and you will have lots of fun watching the whole UNCUT SERIES..
0713904666|5.0|I am not a big fan of novels written by college professors because they are usually dull and precious. But I was assigned Stoner as a part of our book group, so I read it, not expecting much. Wow, what a great book. Better than many novels written by the well-known American literary lions such as Faulkner and James. Very simply written, stripped of everything that wasn't necessary. It is truly a work of art, and a great read at the same time. John Williams should be much more famous than he is, having written one of the really great American novels.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so happy this game finally came out!!! Ive been waiting forever!! Can u put hunger games stuff now??? Or the smurfs??? Or a game where that bird flies???

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run on the kindle fire is great for multiple reasons-<br />* Temple Run is FREE which is surprising since it's such a popular and fun app.<br />* Unlike time killer apps Temple Run keeps going with different objectives.<br />* You can set goals for yourself with the objectives and the stuff you can buy for support.<br />* It's cool how the obstacles change up in theme making it less boring.<br />This is a great app at a good price as of now.<br />NOTICE- If this app freezes up or doesn't work with an &quot;error&quot; pop up it's one of two:<br />You're kindle is messed up with your apps and Internet.<br />  (This is for the error pop ups and and the fact it won't work.)<br />It's how it is and will soon stop and ware off.<br />  ( This is if it freezes up and messes up your game.)<br />  PLEASE DO NOT UNINSTALL THIS APP UNLESS BOTH OPTIONS ABOVE DO NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally, I have been waiting forever for this game, it just came out and already has 1500 bought. that proves its fantastic if you didn't like this fame you would either have never played it or you would have to be insane

B000XJ5TOK|5.0|This review is for the blu-ray, not the movie. I didn't care for the movie, I bought the movie for my girlfriend.<br /><br />The video quality and the sound are both fantastic. A great blu-ray update for this movie.<br />Why I gave this blu-ray a 5 stars, besides the beautiful blu-ray conversion? There are no trailers, no commercials, no previews, no anti-piracy commercials, none of that. When you pop in the blu-ray it goes straight to the main menu. Oh how I wish every blu-ray I bought would do this.

B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Thank you for the quick turn around time, glad to have the music to enjoy this Memorial weekend.<br />The BOOK I ordered though I returned immediately after opening it - for the price the quality was extremely poor made - more of a manufacture issue but also I saw one at the retail store and it was different then the one I received.  MORE pictures and in color.
076115678X|5.0|Great Book, lots of good info, definately recoomend it. You will not be unsatified, plus it comes with a dvd also.
B003Y7PM5E|4.0|I bought this on a friend's recommendation, not really knowing what exactly to expect.  I had, of course seen the movie, but really did not remember the sound track.  The music on the record divides nicely into two genres, rock and more melodic folk/ instrumental.  While both were well recorded, I found the often haunting instrumentals, the more musically enjoyable.  All in all, nicely recorded and a very pleasureable listen, particularly the vinyl which is an import.
0385334206|2.0|Part memoir, part novel, part experimental meta-narrative, \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is a jumbled assortment of literary devices and imagination rolled into a book peppered with felt-tip drawings by the author. To give it a plot is to loosely give you an idea of what's going on in the book though really it only makes up for a third of it or so: Kilgore Trout, pulp novelist, is invited to a literary festival at the behest of his only fan, a wealthy eccentric called Eliot Rosewater, in the same town where Dwayne Hoover, a Pontiac salesman and Burger Chef franchise owner, is slowly losing his mind and is destined for a fateful encounter with the eponymous Trout.<br /><br />I quite like Kurt Vonnegut's work. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" was pretty good, while his posthumously published \\"Armageddon in Retrospect\\" was enjoyable as well, though I've started and stopped \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" maybe twice now because I've found it unreadable and difficult to get through. I made it through this book, one of his more popular and well known works, but I found it not without its own problems.<br /><br />What's annoying the most is the random nature of Vonnegut's writing. When he writes his fictional narrative he diverges into stark, almost patronising, moments of explication where he has to inform you what something he's just mentioned is. For example what the United States is, what capitalism is, a moment in history, and then an explanation followed by a drawing of something irrelevant like a t-shirt or a finger. Then he goes down another sidetrack into a moment of memoir about his own life before getting back to the (increasingly boring) story. Then he addresses the reader, informing them when he is writing fiction and that everything he says and does when doing so is made up (duh) and telling the reader when he's writing non-fiction. Then he tells you what a burger is by drawing a cow and then a burger. It's all so frustratingly pointless.<br /><br />Vonnegut, rather tellingly, writes at the start about recently turning 50 and how this book is a way of getting all of the junk out of his head, and the book ends with the words \\"make me young, make me young!\\" so maybe the novel is a reaction to growing old/a kind of late mid-life crisis. Or the rather wearying and scatological form of storytelling in the book might be a reaction to his fears of mental illness which plagued his mother, eventually causing her to take her life, and which dogged Vonnegut throughout his own life, leading to his suicide attempts.<br /><br />The patchwork nature of the book belies the claims of other fans of his work that it is a masterpiece, which I contest. The fact that the book reads like Vonnegut bouncing around the walls of his brain does not make this anything more than what it reads like - a mess. The characters are barely there, the story is irrelevant to Vonnegut's seemingly sole purpose of showing how a novelist is like a puppet master - the meta angle - which, reading it in the 21st century, is quite dull. It's also quite a miserable novel in tone with Vonnegut labelling doing a job without purpose \\"suicide\\" and boiling down descriptions of male characters to penis size and female characters to breast/wait size.<br /><br />The book comes across as a hodge-podge of non-sequiturs, scraps of ideas, half-baked stories and a lot of Vonnegut talking to reader about how his book doesn't really hang together, how pretentious the role of the author is, and how doomed we all are. It's like reading a book by a mentally deranged bore standing on a box pointing out the bleeding obvious. \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is a long way from being a masterpiece and is quite dull to read as well as being one of Vonnegut's least interesting books.art about recently turning 50 and how this book is a way of getting all of the junk out of his head, and the book ends with the words \\"make me young, make me young!\\" so maybe the novel is a reaction to growing old/a kind of late mid-life crisis.

0743244257|5.0|In Part One of COSMOPOLIS, DeLillo primarily examines the lives of two characters. The first and dominant character is Eric Packer, a young hedge fund manager worth tens of billions of dollars, who risks the complete loss of his fortune and fund if the Yen rises. Eric is at the nexus of capital and technology and believes that he can spot and profit from movements in money and information that are unseen by others. Says Eric: \\"There's an order at some deep level...A pattern that wants to be seen.\\" Says Kinski, his Chief of Theory: \\"A consciousness such as yours, hypermaniacal, may have contact points beyond the general perception.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, the second major character introduced in Part One is Benno Levin, a former trader and generic laborer at Packer Capital, who lost his job. Thinks Benno: \\"There are great themes running through my mind. The themes of loneliness and human discard. The theme of who do I have when there's no one left.\\"<br /><br />In Part Two, DeLillo examines the tropism toward destruction and death in these two characters. In Eric's case, this tropism manifests as his huge bet on the Yen gradually sours. Then, DeLillo seems to ask: If a man like Eric can't win, will he attempt to take the system down with him? In contrast, the plight of Benno, who was trashed by Eric's cyber-capitalism, represents a different question. Namely: Is there anything a victim of capitalism can do that actually rights the ruthless wrongs inherent to the system?<br /><br />COSMOPOLIS is a surrealistic satire that is tersely hilarious. It begins with the sleepless Eric in his 48-room apartment near the FDR Drive, where he enjoys an atrium, screening room, and shark tank, and ends in an abandoned tenement near the West Side Highway where the characters have no roles to play in life. Along this riches-to-rags continuum, DeLillo supplies innumerable instances of amazing writing and insight. The man, truly, expands what you see. Here, for example, is Eric during his confrontation with Benno.<br /><br />\\"He'd always wanted to become quantum dust, transcending his body mass, the soft tissue over the bones, the muscle and fat. The ideas was to live outside the given limits, in a chip, on a disk, as data, in whirl, in radiant spin, a consciousness saved from void...It would be the master thrust of cyber-capital, to extend the human experience toward infinity as a medium for corporate growth and investment, for the accumulation of profits and vigorous reinvestment.\\"<br /><br />This is not my favorite DeLillo novel. But COSMOPOLIS has great insight and style and is eerily prescient about risk taking on Wall Street, which, like the hubristic Eric Packer, is clearly willing to risk and embrace economic meltdown for big paydays.<br /><br />Recommended.confrontation with Benno.<br /><br />\\"He'd always wanted to become quantum dust, transcending his body mass, the soft tissue over the bones, the muscle and fat.

0385737955|5.0|The Plot:<br /><br />Thomas wakes up trapped in a dark box, with no recollection of his past, his identity (other than his name), or his purpose. Soon, the Box is opened by a group of teenage boys he doesn't recognize, and Thomas emerges from the Box into a bizarre world which is surrounded by huge concrete walls on all sides. No one can tell him who he is or why he is there, because they all started in the Box too.<br /><br />The boys tell him that the he is in the Glade. And outside the Glade, through the huge doors in the concrete walls, lies the Maze. They have formed a small yet functional society within the Glade, surviving until the time when one of them can find a way out. And the only way they can conceive of to escape is to solve the Maze.<br /><br />Every day, the doors open. The Runners go out, searching for an exit. Every night, the Runners return, the doors close, and terrifying monsters prowl the corridors of the Maze. To be trapped in the Maze at night is to guarantee a horrific death.<br /><br />The Runners have been searching for an exit from the Maze for years, but have never found a solution. But Thomas feels an inexplicable pull to become a Runner. And although he can't explain why, he thinks he can solve the Maze.<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />Holy cow, people. This book was insane. I was completely riveted from page 1, something that rarely happens. Even with books I completely adore, it normally takes me a chapter or two to immerse myself in the world of the book. But with The Maze Runner, I was in that Box with Thomas. I was confused and uncomfortable and determined to make sense of the situation.<br /><br />As the book went on, I, like Thomas, was completely perplexed and frustrated by the mystery of the Maze and why they were trapped in the Glade. But James Dashner had an uncanny ability to predict what I was going to ask, and then have Thomas ask that very question. For example, when they're explaining that getting trapped in the Maze at night is a death sentence, I wondered if they'd attempted climbing the walls. Then Thomas asks, \\"Why don't you just climb the walls?\\" So although I couldn't figure out for the life of me how they were going to escape the Maze or why we were there, I was frustrated with the characters instead of at the characters.<br /><br />The pacing of this book was excellent. While the action doesn't really kick up until about 1/3 of the way into the book, I still felt my adrenaline pumping right away just because of the strangeness of the situation. There was suspense simply in not knowing why any of this was happening. Then, once Thomas gets his bearings a bit better, the real action picked up. So basically, I felt like I was having heart palpitations for the majority of this book. In a good way.<br /><br />The characters were also well developed. While not every Glader was fully fleshed-out, the main ones all had their own personalities and layers. I felt like I knew these kids, and I found myself cheering for some and rolling my eyes with Thomas at others.<br /><br />Even the dialogue, which I sometimes find really annoying in sci-fi/dystopian books when the author feels the need to throw in a bunch of made-up \\"future\\" slang, somehow felt natural in this book. Maybe it's because Thomas draws attention to it almost immediately, saying it sounds weird and foreign. Since it's acknowledged in the book, I accepted it and moved on. Eventually, it began to sound natural, to me and to Thomas.<br /><br />Bottom line: I thought this book was amazing. It's not for everyone. It's got an extremely high \\"weird\\" factor. And the suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire book may not be what others are looking for. But for me, I completely and totally adored this book. I couldn't put it down (literally. I read the whole thing in a day, something I was not planning on doing). It's unlike anything else I've ever read. My only complaint is that my library doesn't have Book2 available RIGHT NOW.2 available RIGHT NOW.

B00003CX96|5.0|I grew up in Bloomington, and was 19 years old and working in a pharmacy on the Indiana University campus when this movie was filmed... I remember it well. Originally the working title was \\"Bambino.\\"<br /><br />My late mother was an extra in the climactic race scenes. Director Peter Yates was hoping a couple of thousand locals would be available as extras to fill the stadium stands, but only a couple of hundred showed up. Like any good director, he worked with what he had, filming short scenes with the extras in the background, then having them all move to a different position for the next shot! In the end several scenes from that years' *actual* little 500 event, with thousands of spectators in the stands, had to be spliced in to the finished movie for effect.<br /><br />Breaking Away remains one of my favorites, obviously I'm biased as it is a \\"time capsule\\" for me of my own coming of age in Bloomington, Indiana. My (now grown) sons also enjoy it for the glimpse it gives them of their hometown's past.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|THE PLOT: J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) encounter troubles when a dangerous alien criminal, Boris (Jemaine Clement), escapes from his moon-based prison and goes back in time to kill K before the agent can capture and imprison him. When K (and all of his influence on the world) dissolves away, only J remembers him, which sends him back in time to 1969 to save his partner.<br /><br />WHY YOU MIGHT LIKE IT: The formula hasn't changed much. Will Smith does a really good Will Smith impression, and most of his wisecracks are amusing. There are some standard \\"fish out of water\\" jokes when K goes back to the less-than-tolerant 60's, but that is far less obtrusive than it could be. The weapons, the creatures, the special effects, and the slap-happy plotting are great, chewy fun, like a B-movie with an A-movie budget. In other words, this movie walks pretty much the same lines as its predecessors, and it does so with a comforting and addictive flair.<br /><br />WHY YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE IT: If you are a person who thinks more than he feels, you'll very quickly notice some gaping holes in the plot, most of which yawn wide open in the third act. Movies that involve time travel usually have to dance around shaky logic, but this film doesn't even bother with that. At a key moment in the plot -- the final climax -- J uses his time travel device in a way that doesn't even TRY to make sense. The screenwriters must have known this, because the scene moves too fast for any viewer to really stop and understand it. Then the story very quickly shifts into heartstrings territory, providing the audience with a conclusion that is so sweetly sad that it is nearly emotional enough to distract from the fact that it, too, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />Adding to the story's befuddlement is the addition of an alien character named Griffin. A fifth-dimensional being, Griffin is able to view and exist in multiple timelines at the same time, making him both omnipresent and omniscient. He is essentially God, if God were an effeminate voyeur with a cold. As a God-like character, Griffin acts as a double-barreled deus ex machina. He provides the story with more than a few easy outs, but the solutions he provide raise further questions that the movie is in too much of a hurry to bother answering.<br /><br />It's all in good silly fun, most people will tell you, and they're right. It's quite enjoyable if you're willing to suspend your disbelief a little longer than you might normally, even for a movie about time travelling aliens. Fastidious viewers will find a lot here to rant about, but the kid in you might find enough reason to shrug off the flaws and just enjoy the ride.mniscient.

098357670X|5.0|This is the most amazing book about Caricature I have ever consulted. I have always been a fan of Mr. Richmond's work. I have been into his blog for a while and I had looked forward to getting his long awaited book with all his tips and tricks about how to make REAL funny caricatures.<br />I don't think this is a book for those who are starting in this. I guess it requires a certain degree of expertise. As he explains, it's really difficult to teach someone how to observe and this particular form of art requires a lot of observation and that's something you may not learn in a book regardless how good the author is, however, it's really inspiring. All those fantastic examples of his work really will make your eyes keener and it will make you eager to start creating your own images (it's kind of frustrating to see you'll be far from creating as compelling ones as Sensei Richmond, but keep trying). Sometimes you may feel he assumes you know how to deal with many things (petty ones if you want, but if you're new to this you will have questions that probably won't have an answer in this book) like how not to end up with a huge caricature for not being contained for the head shape or how to create the amazing cross hatching that adds the amazing volume and life he gives to each rendered image.<br />I guess there's no such thing as a book that will make you as skilled as you want to be. But this book is a mirror of what you may become if you truly want and put your soul and effort on it!<br /><br />It's a great book, great quality printing all examples of the process are nicely colored.<br /><br />If you want to start your bibliography about this art, this book is a MUST. Don't buy anything else. But if you have some spare bucks also buy the Lenn Redman's \\"How draw caricatures\\" also available in Amazon. Classic approach and also great results.[[ASIN:0809256851 How To Draw Caricatures]]
145162445X|5.0|This book, regardless of the shotgun approach by people who have not read it to urge people to not read it, is informational and encouraging. While some might feel the need to be told they are bad, and that stealing and murder are wrong, Krauss delivers a complicated subject in an approachable way - without telling you that you should be on your knees begging for punishment and favors (big plus there).<br /><br />What you might not get right away is what encourages you to look more into the topic -along with other topics tangentially related. And besides, this book is a one time payment, not 10% of your gross life's earnings church's expect of you -- so some cheap and actual truth quick and easy.<br /><br />10/10

B0072IVGRY|5.0|The Cult have scored with Choice Of Weapon.  I have liked or loved every album post-Ceremony and pre-Sonice Temple, this album feels like a masterpiece in the vein of Love or Electric.  The album blends seemlessly the two styles present on those earlier works.  Instead of sounding derivative strangely seems more unique than anything they've done since 1994's self titled release.  The Wolf, Life > Death and The Wilderness are standouts among an album void of duds.<br /><br />Here are some details regarding the vinyl edition of this album which is the version I purchased; The vinyl appears to be 150G housed in a medium cardboard, gatefold sleeve.  The tracks are spread over one record with five tracks on each side.  There is a bonus disc on white vinyl which includes the four bonus tracks present on the second disc of the deluxe CD or iTunes edition (Every Man And Woman Is A Star, Embers, Until The Light Takes Us and Siberia).  The white vinyl second platter with the bonus tracks is mastered at 45RPM but the album proper is not.  The records are housed in full color inner sleaves with pictures and artwork only, no lyrics or detailed liner notes are present.  The wax appears to be of high quality and plays noise free.  The inner record sleeves are on the rough side, I recommend anti-static/dust inner sleeves for the actual housing of the records.<br /><br />If you love The Cult I see no reason why will not love this album or possibly even consider it a masterpiece.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Gut wrenching, gritty account of a man born into a hell on Earth. If you are looking for emotional storytelling, this is not it. The subject of this tale was brainwashed from birth with only the essentials that allowed him to survive. He had no basis for the emotions most of us take for granted. Only after being out for years did he even understand a little of what we usually experience from birth. The author has to constantly explain why Shin behaves as he did as it is outside of our understanding.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Other reviews are covering this series well, explaining the extraordinary plot developments in a story that is plainly riveting.  I don't think I can sing praises higher than what others have already written.<br /><br />  I can say that Hugh Howey for me compares favorably with Dan Simmons, Stephen Baxter, Neil Stephenson and others who are well established and writing with an enviable collection of sentences that never veer away from near perfection towards the story's culmination.  Or continuance as the case may be.<br /><br />  Additionally, the story, people living in a Silo with video feeds of the destroyed earth outside, is written with an intense prose compelling you to complete it in a sitting.<br /><br />  If there is one flaw to discuss it's that I found him too early.  If I had waited, I could have had 20 books to read and not just 5.<br /><br />  I understand that he's already sold the movie rights but I think this should be a cable series like Breaking Bad, or Son's of Anarchy but instead of delving ever deeper into chaos and violence, here they would be working to better their lives amidst the unfocused individualistic motives of a humanity seemingly bent on it's own undirected destruction.<br /><br />  Excellent.  And thanks Hugh Howey for a wonderful, well written story that has me thinking about it long after I've finished it.

B00003CXD5|5.0|I have the Blu-ray version which is only one disc, but, what a disc. It is in b/w, but the sharpness of the DVD is great. Don't, I repeat: DON'T start with the movie, but, instead go to the special features and start watching there. You will be treated to a night out at the theater or to a Drive-in, as you will get theatrical trailers, cartoons, newsreel, a very funny comedy short and finally a great movie. As I was watching this movie, I was trying to think of what to call it, as it doesn't fit into anyone category: it's not a real western, nor a spaghetti western, not a love story, not a comedy, not a true action movie, but, there is action and suspense. I had just finished reading a true copy of Zane Grey's \\"Cabin Gulch\\", which was about the gold strike in Idaho and what Gold did to those that came upon it, so, as I was watching this movie, I could see where this story was going, the only thing was, I didn't know which one would fall into the Gold Fever and become an animal, so to speak. There was the scene where the bandits were emptying out the bags, and they didn't realize that it was gold dust. I was confused by this action, but when I listened to the radio version that is on this disc, they gave me the answer, of which, I won't tell. This movie is not 'family' fare for the younger ones and maybe not even for teens as it is in b/w and not the type of shows that they would be used to seeing. Get your pop-corn ready and enjoy. When you finish watching all of this, put the commentary on, as it has many enjoyable facts about the movie. +JMJ+

0393064476|5.0|The poem by Lucretius, \\"On the Nature of Things\\", does not strike one today as being of any particular interest, beyond \\"style\\" and a certain aesthetic appeal.  We live in a world today that has become, in its own way, very \\"atomistic\\" and \\"Epicurean\\", and so the intellectual slant of the poem does not impress.  This is often the way with things:  They can appear to us to be very plain and ordinary, while their tiny \\"signal\\" from the deep past is worthy of greater attention.  This is what Prof. Greenblatt hopes to achieve, to amplify this tiny signal so that we appreciate its power and beauty in the course of human history.<br /><br />Like much of Roman antiquity, it proved to be a fragile remnant that was nearly lost.  Prof. Greenblatt tells a story about its recovery by an Italian book collector in the early Renaissance, someone who was both a humanist and deeply involved in (secular) aspects of the Catholic Church.  The tale revolves around the strangeness of the poem and the strangeness of the times.  Atomism was a perceived threat to Catholicism on the one hand due to its confrontation with Aristotelian concepts that Catholics had fully woven into their doctrine, and Epicurean ideas were threatening because the focused on the importance to seek pleasure, over the suffering and misery that was Christ's lot.  Many principles  discussed in the poem were contrary(and perceived as threatening) to Christian dogma, as it was understood in the early Renaissance.  Prof. Greenblatt suggests that not only did the modern world evolve to become more in accord with the ideas of the poem, but the poem, in itself, had some positive influence on this evolution.  The thoroughly-researched book that has resulted displays a very fine historical portrait, one that leads us not only to appreciate the intellectual content of Lucretius' poem, but also its erotic beauty.  In addition, I personally appreciated very much his vignettes of people whose lives were somewhat influenced by the poem following its recovery, perhaps, most interestingly, by his discussions of Poggio, the book collector who found a copy of the poem in a monastery.  The poem resulted in much less consternation and censorship than might have been expected, due to the general lack of availability and translations in the years immediately following its recovery.<br /><br />To provide a better perspective on his presentation, let us examine one of the chapters in his book as representative.  Let's examine Chapter 8, \\"The Way Things Are\\".  The first paragraph sets the stage:  \\"\\"On the Nature of Things\\" is not an easy read.  Totaling 7,400 lines, it is written in hexameters, the standard unrhymed six-beat lines in which Latin poets like Virgil and Ovid, imitating Homer's Greek, cast their epic poetry.  Divided into six untitled books, the poem yokes together moments of intense lyrical beauty, philosophical meditations on religion, pleasure and death, and complex theories of the physical world, the evolution of human societies, the perils and joys of sex, and the nature of disease.  The language is often knotty and difficult, the syntax complex, and the overall ambition astoundingly high.\\"  This suggests how this poem came to the Christian world in an \\"alien\\" or \\"otherworldly\\" way, and the chapter concludes with:  \\"Certainly almost every one of the poem's key principles was an abomination to right-thinking Christian orthodoxy.  But the poetry was compellingly, seductively beautiful.  And we can see with hallucinatory vividness what at least one Italian, later in the fifteenth century, made of them:  we have only to look at Boticelli's great painting of Venus, ravishingly beautiful, emerging from the restless matter of the sea.\\"<br /><br />It is odd that a poem could be regarded as intellectually dangerous, in itself, because as an isolated remnant of an ancient culture, it did not come to the Europeans as a coherent threat.  Nevertheless, one recognizes that we are all children of imagination to varying degrees, and, merely based on the way our imaginations operate, exposure to fantasy or new ideas can pose challenges.  In the arrival of Lucretius' book after submergence in the past, did the poem pose a danger of encouraging atheism?  \\"...Lucretius was in fact not an atheist.  He believed that the gods existed.  But he also believed that, by virtue of being gods, they could not possibly be concerned with human beings or with anything we do.  Divinity by its very nature, he thought, must enjoy eternal life and peace entirely untouched by any suffering or disturbance and indifferent to human actions.\\"  No, he was not an atheist, but his \\"message\\" was not a welcome one for Christians.<br /><br />\\"These views were certainly contrary to Poggio's own Christian faith and would have led any contemporary who espoused them into the most serious trouble.  But by themselves, encountered in a pagan text, they were not likely to trigger great alarm.  Poggio could have told himself, as did nome later sympathetic readers of \\"On the Nature of Things\\", that the brilliant ancient poet simply intuited the emptiness of pagan beliefs and hence the absurdity of sacrifices to gods who did not in fact exist.  Lucretius, after, all, had the misfortune of living shortly before the coming of the Messiah.  Had he been born a century later, he would have had the opportunity of learning the truth.\\"  In other words, we see in the recovery of this poem, a parallel with modern views, but perhaps just one small influence leading to the modern world.  This was the significance of the Renaissance and humanism.<br /><br />In the first and final paragraphs of the chapter, Prof. Greenblatt has framed, in part, the theme of the chapter.  Now he is exploring it.  He has focused on its intellectual content.  He emphasizes in the beginning the disturbing aspect of the poem for Christians, but what is the overall challenge of the poem, its \\"key principles\\"?  In the latter part of the chapter, he lists these, discussing them slightly, and we are able to grasp the startlingly modern tone of these principles, and how this poem could have served, in part, as an inspiration for our modern age.  Here is the list of the main points, which are written, in the book, in boldface type, and which Prof. Greenblatt wishes to emphasize are present within the body of the poem, emerging as part of the intellectual content:<br />1.  Everything is made of invisible particles.<br />2. The elementary particles of matter - \\"the seeds of the things\\" - are eternal.<br />3. The elementary particles are infinite in number but limited in shape and size.<br />4. All particles are in motion in an infinite void.<br />5. Everything comes into being as a result of the swerve.  (\\"The swerve ... is only the most minimal motions ... But it is enough to set off a ceaseless chain of collisions.\\")<br />6. The swerve is the source of free will.  (\\"Lucretius' image is the split second on the race track after the starting gate is opened, before the straining horses, frantically eager to move, can actually propel their bodies forward.  That split second is the thrilling spectacle of a mental act bidding a mass of matter into motion.\\")<br />7. Nature ceaselessly experiments.  (\\"There is no single moment of origin, no mythic scene of creation.\\")<br />8. The universe was not created for or about humans.<br />9. Humans are not unique.  (\\"They are part of a much larger material process that links them not only to all other life forms but to inorganic matter as well.\\")<br />10. Human society began not in a Golden Age of tranquility and plenty, but in a primitive battle for survival.\\")<br />11. The soul dies.  (\\"The human soul is made of the same material as the human body.\\")<br />12. There is no afterlife.<br />13. All organized religions are superstitious delusions.<br />14. Religions are invariably cruel.<br />15. There are no angels, demons, or ghosts.<br />16. The highest goal of human life is the enhancement of pleasure and the reduction of pain.<br />17. The greatest obstacle to pleasure is not pain; it is delusion.<br />18. Understanding the nature of things generates deep wonder.<br />Of course, this gives only briefly, a flavor of a single chapter.  The other chapters are woven together, connecting with this one, in an overall and complex harmony.<br /><br />Prof. Greenblatt has done an admirable job in writing an engaging, entertaining, and informative history associated with the early Renaissance, and focusing on the recovery of Lucretius' ancient poem and its consequences.  I feel that the scholarship of the work is very high, so that we are not only treated to an interesting story, but one built carefully on historical accuracy.  I can recommend this work highly, especially as Prof. Greenblatt is able to establish a broad perspective for the historical point in time when humanists recovered Lucretius' beautiful poem.ter, he lists these, discussing them slightly, and we are able to grasp the startlingly modern tone of these principles, and how this poem could have served, in part, as an inspiration for our modern age.

B005LAIIS0|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />In Norse or Viking mythology the wolf took on an almost god-like persona. Despite the premise of The Grey, wolves are generally not dangerous to humans.<br />Having said that there have been incidents where wolves got used to seeing humans, and would single out certain folks, even able to tell if the human was armed or not. In those cases they usually go for the head or neck area, or an area close to an artery.<br />The Grey tells a story of survival after a handful of oil-men are stranded from a plane crash in the brutal Alaskan wilderness.<br />It was supposed to be John Ottway's (Liam Neeson) last day on the job. We find him writing a letter to his wife, telling her that he plans to commit suicide. He's interrupted by the howl of a wolf. He kills the creature. That's his job to keep the predators away from the oil-men.<br />After the crash, he and a small group of men rush to a forest line, set up camp and build a fire. It's clear the wolves have tracked the men and surrounded them. Hypothermia is setting in. The men share personal thoughts and stories around the fire to keep their minds off the danger. When John gets a turn he recites a poem that he remembers hanging over his Father's desk, \\"Once more into the fray, Into the last good fight I'll ever know, Live and die on this day, Live and die on this day.\\"<br />One by one the men succumb to the harsh environment, the fierce cold and the deadly wolves.<br />This is one of the best survival films to come along in awhile.

She is a little too stiff in this episode, but it's the first time out in her role as Captain. I don't know who the blonde was, but she is drop dead gorgeous.  The sound is excellent, unlike many other shows I have watched on Amazon. Wish they had CC though. For a first show, I would have to give it a five star rating, hope I won't be disappointed in what comes next.

This writer does not mince words.<br /><br />Here Morrison offers us a poetic treatise on what it means to be a man, what it means to encourage resilient individuals and a resilient culture, what it means to survive and what it means to be free.  Frank Money (an emotionally battered Korean War vet) and his younger sister Cee haven't had the easiest lives, and Morrison paints a vivid picture of 1950's America as seen through the eyes of those who have been marginalized for generations.  It's brutal, sincere...but also beautifully hopeful and unapologetically American.<br /><br />It's not her best - but it's still Morrison, and it will haunt you like only she knows how to do.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this book just sucked you in from the very begining.  I read all three books in 1 1/2 wks.  Still wanting for more.  Heard there may be a movie- cant wait to see who plays Mr. Grey.  mmmmyumm.<br /><br />VCR

B001L5VUNO|5.0|I hope Signorina Bartolli never ceases to amaze and entertain us!!!  I know there will be distractors, but when you are at the pinnacle of your art, not everyone appreciates your contributions (for whatever reasons).  I am sure there have been people who disliked the Mona Lisa and the Sistine Chapel ceiling & alterpiece (Pope Leo - too much nudity; Jesus was originally painted nude in The Last Judgment).  Even David (Michelangelo - Firenze) has hands that are too big and his penis is uncircumcised, hardly a King of the Jews;  Moses (Michelangelo - Rome) has horns, not rays and Mary (Michelangelo - Vatican PIETA) would be about 10 feet tall is she stood.<br /><br />Like Madam Callas & Dame Joan before her, I am sure she will weather this storm.  We are all very well aware of the flaws of Callas & Sutherland, but we still sit spellbound by their art.  We now have had enough time to fully evaluate Bartoli and she is not found wanting.<br /><br />As much as I would like to hear her Norma & I Puritani, this is much better: Vivaldi, Scarlatti, Salieri, Scrificium and now this.  I hope she continues to find these lost jewels and present them to those of us who are her adoring fans.  She is truly a great musicologist as well as a great singer.  May she never quit being a musical archeologist.  Since there seems to be a dearth of great new works, it is refreshing to have something different to which we can listen.<br /><br />Truly a MUST for lovers of Baroque bel canto.  It's not all pyrotechnics, there is also that ethereal Baroque legato that Sutherland introduced to us about 50 years ago.
B00785P2QC|4.0|eh it was not very bad there has been a lot worse than this. it is nice to have when you are very bored
0345529057|4.0|Indeed the four books. I am reading now the first and no problems so far =P.<br />The only thing I disliked about the product was that the box cover has the HBO's series pictures and the set is selled as books of a HBO series and not the author's books. But it is just a personal opinion.<br />Never spent money so well.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so challenging and fun.... I cannot imagine my kindle fire without this game! Definitely a must have for anyone
B0086700CM|5.0|super fun game. very addictive. nice to play when I need to blow some time. easy to play. my five year loves this game also
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have played a couple kinds of number puzzle games Suduko, Kakuru, and now this one. Suduko is entirely to easy. Kakuru is challenging  but there are limited books and even less programs available because they are such hard puzzles to create. This is challenging at the mid to higher levels and hopefully once I've finished this program I am able to find books/programs to continue doing them. Working your brain with puzzles like this keep you in your toes. I really ENJOY this app. It is a MUST HAVE for all puzzle people or people who just enjoy a nice brain challege.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This author keeps the reader wanting to know more, what happens next and sparks your fantasy world! After the first book, I had to buy the next two!
B001EC3JME|3.0|I've used this holster off and on for the past year with a Nebo Redline. I had high hopes for it and honestly wish I could give it a higher rating. But I can't. Here's why:<br /><br />1. It is very difficult to squeeze a Redline into this holster, and equally difficult to get it out. Yet these are precisely the kind of flashlights that would benefit from such a holster. While the tight fit might be useful for someone scaling the North Face, I'm afraid I have much less demanding requirements where a more flexible fit would be welcome.<br /><br />2. The rotating design seemed like a very nice idea, but it doesn't really work that well in practice. If the holster is belt-mounted, then jackets will cover the light during the cooler months. Even when it's warmer, the normal swinging of arms gets in the way. The design is effective only when someone is stationary and needs to have both arms free and relatively fixed away from the light.<br /><br />3. While the holster uses a clip design, the clip is so inflexible that I have to undo my belt to loop it through. The holster cannot be clipped or unclipped with any degree of ease.<br /><br />It these restrictions don't disturb you, then this holster might work out. However, I also own a Nebo holster that cost less and proves to be much more practical. That would be my first choice.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is my favorite game ever. I love this game.I play it all the time I have wanted the game for ever.
B00E5I2MCM|4.0|I admit that growing up I was more of a DC than Marvel kid, but now enjoy both sides of the comic book realm, as well as of course some of the smaller comic franchises such as Dark Horse and Image. Trailers to this movie looked interesting so I watched it and was impressed, enough to even buy it once it came out. The second and third movies not so much, but the Avengers was amazing and this movie started them down that path. Though I felt the main villain was a bit weak, this is a great movie even if you're not a comicbook fan, and is fun for the whole family.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the bomb.com I logebitbso very muchbitbis the best game ever its so addicting butbj get sk mad at it sometimes but j still love it hahhaha<br />  #teamtemplerun
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After hearing all the hype about this trilogy I figured what the heck, I'll read them. Let me tell you, I finished all three in less than a week and I loved them, but....<br /><br />The repetitiveness, I almost couldn't stand it. Yes, I loved the sex scenes, and I loved the characters, I was pulled into the book, but really? The author couldn't have found different words to use than \\"crap\\" or having Anastasia orgasm at the drop of a hat? And the constant fighting? I thought they were supposed to be in love? I've been with my husband for 10 years and haven't fought as much as these carachters do in the first month of them dating.<br /><br />And also, I am, by no means a dumb person, but some of the words the author used in the story, I had to look up. What peson uses some of these words in every day speaking? Some of the language just didn't flow with the book.<br /><br />Over all I really enjoyed these books and will someday probably read them again.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really like playing it but it is slow to react on my kindle sometimes. But besides that, it is an awesome game!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|By far the best version of this game I've played on the phone...  Challenging puzzles, lots of levels, easy to use - a great thinking man's game!!
B000001EKX|5.0|I am so surprised  that none of these reviewers seem to know that this was the first record ,produced by Kenny Kerner and Ritchie Wise. They couldn't sell it ,so the band signed with Bill Aucoin and the rest is history. Just thought you all deserved to know.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the absolute best game ever! its so addicting and it challenges your reflexes and your agility skills....its bunches of fun...its nothing bad to say about this game. It works great on the kindle fire....dont trust the bad reviews they just probably aren't  getting the hang of the game so they give bad reviews...I am very picky when it comes to games...and i only write reviews for the best games and since im reviewing you know it's a fantastic game!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|First 3 or 4 chapters are slow and then it takes off and holds you for the rest of the book. The author keeps you guessing as to the good and bad guys or girls.
B0086700CM|1.0|this app is horrible. the game is fun and addictive, but it doesnt work on half the devices my family has. please update.
B0077ATSU4|5.0|emotional. A story that had to be written.Perfectly acted and directed A must see. the kid and the wonderful Max Von Sydow's<br />performances were perfectly backed up by Tom and Sandy
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game. Thank you amazon. This is the best game I could play this game all day. Awesome for ever.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love Temple Run! When I was able to get it on my Kindle Fire I was so happy I screamed. Get it now!!

B006NXIO7O|5.0|I highly recommend this action packed movie.  The trailer that was published does not give this movie justice.  Very good movie!
145162445X|5.0|This was a terrific read.  Compellingly written and not too difficult for a layperson like myself to comprehend. If you enjoy being well informed, this is worth reading.
1401937519|5.0|This story is so amazing, beautiful, touching, and even life changing.  It may help you eliminate fears of death and make life seem a lot more vivid, real, and meaningful.  This book is about healing, loving yourself and the profound effects of knowing your magnificence can bring into your life.  This is my absolute favorite book EVER!  I cannot stop recommending it to my friends!  It is so worth reading!!!!  If you are unsure about this let me tell you that it is wonderful story.  You can also get a very good briefing on the story at [...] - by looking at the videos.  The book goes into so much more detail and is worth purchasing even after you view the videos.  I love it!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have just read three reviews of the book \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" and am so pleased with the honest reviews given by the people who wrote about the book.  I had heard so many talking about this book and was about to buy it and am so glad I didn't!!
0345803485|5.0|While most people focus on the sexuality and erotic portions of the book, I found the entire storyline of the whole series to be absolutely riveting. I would read ANY book E. L. James authors with or without the erotica included.
B0073PZN8O|3.0|Like others before me, this is an OK movie and I'm glad it only cost 99 cents.<br /><br />It's a good concept but the Bonnie & Clyde angle is dull.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy is really worth watching & I wish that he had more screen time. If you're a fan of his and feel let down by his lack of screen time, I suggest a film \\"Peacock\\". He's even more amazing in that then in this.
B008133DO8|5.0|I can't believe 'they' are going to leave 'us' like this.  I have to wait how long to resolve this narrative?  Ever so wrong, Sherlock; ever so wrong.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it's a lot like super Mario bros. I love Mario so I thought I should try this out. I wasn't disappointed. its really cartoony but that doesn't bother me too much.
0143119680|5.0|I love the writing style of the author this is a great book to read. I have recommended it to everyone that i know!
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Forget the bad reviews about how UN-realistic the movie was on the events. The movie in my opinion was wrongly titled and wrongly presented in previews as some fight for survival against this super huge wolf. Not so....its a story of mans basic survival after a plane wreck in the cold icy mountains, the wolves just happen to be one of their terrors while trying to survive. Its sorrowful and warming at the same time. The reviewers that gave this poor ratings are probably used to Fast & Furious type movies, if thats your only type taste in movies then I feel sorry for you, expand your horizons & your mind ...and remember, its just a movie, its called entertainment.
B005MMZ916|3.0|Watching here is like ROKU...stops and starts on AMAZON....I thought the show is well done and EVA GREAT IS EVIL...people die faster her for sure....will watch the rest ON DEMAND now.
B0086700CM|5.0|I thought they never put that game on amazon!!!!!!Because they all ways put those fake tempo run they were stupid

B0084P9202|5.0|It's been 4 years since the last Sigur Ros album and for a while fans wondered if we'd ever get to hear it. But since then we've received the fantastic live album [[ASIN:B005ML1W4K Sigur R&oacute;s: Inni­ (Blu-Ray + 2 CD)]] and now, yet another masterpiece, Valtari. Like their previous albums, this is a hushed back, subtle-vocal work that transcends mind and genre. Listening to Sigur Ros is like experiencing a reverse hangover. It is peaceful, relaxing, imaginitive, inspiring..a journey. I really don't know how else to describe it.<br /><br />It should also be noted that any Sigur Ros album is an ALBUM, meaning you should really listen to it from beginning to end, no skips or rewinds. It is a narrative of sorts, and should be experienced that way. That being said, I have to point out that Var&uacute;ð and Fj&ouml;gur p&iacute;an&oacute; are two stand-out tracks worthy of the admission price alone. Var&uacute;ð especially. That is one of the greatest songs I've heard in years. I love every song, but those are the stand-outs in my opinion.<br /><br />OVERALL: If you're a longtime fan of Sigur Ros, prepared to be pleased. If you're just getting in on the game, Valtari is as great of a place to start as any. Newbies might also want to check out the song [[ASIN:B000W1TKNA Saegl&oacute;pur]] - it's another one of my favorites.<br /><br />ENJOY! :)
B0086700CM|3.0|just look at the reviews there's 1158 and its 5 stars...seems like the company that made this is using workers to create 5 star reviews...they're all very similar.

B0086700CM|5.0|I hav ben waiting 4 this game 4 a long time and am so excited that it is finaly here
1419702203|3.0|Somewhat. For many years now, too many people comprehended the Beatles as two musicians: John Lennon and Paul McCartney. In fact only recently did I learn that one of my all time favorite Beatles' songs, \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" from The White album was indeed penned by George Harrison.<br /><br />This book weighs a ton and is filled with many photographs. It was bittersweet looking over these pages knowing what was to come. Not all that crazy about the photo selection though. Much of it concentrates on early Beatles and then George's time in India. Would have preferred some attention to the Beatles' psychedelic period. Where's all the fun and vibrancy of the 60s? George's low key personality is naturally reflected, so the tone shouldn't come as any surprise. Still, I searched for depictions of London's Swinging Sixties but was disappointed by what little was included.<br /><br />As other reviewers have remarked, George Harrison's first wife, Patti Boyd, gets zero mention here. For the record, Patti Boyd was a huge part of George Harrison's life at the height of his career. George's widow Olivia is behind this, and she's playing with fire if she thinks she can rewrite history.<br /><br />Looking forward to eventually catching up w/ the corresponding DVD.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game I will play it forever and never stop playing it. it is the best game ever made
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|The screenplay is very poor, fights are also poorly choreographed. Really you would not find reasons to watch this.<br />Do not get attracted by reputable actors, they are not playing any major roles.
B007URVZJ6|2.0|The content is not as helpful as it ought to be, the formatting for it is ridiculous to say the least. And to think, a sorry looking book like this is supposedly teaching you how to put a book on amazon. Well thank you amazon for giving it your worst effort.<br /><br />Someone needs to be fired!

0985114606|5.0|Eva Tramell moves to New York with her best friend. She already has a job and when she goes to her office she see a man that is truly beautiful. She later finds out that his name is Gideon Cross and he is also her boss. Things heat up pretty fast with Eva and Gideon.<br /><br />This is the first boo I have read from Sylvia Day and I fell in love. A lot of people say this book is like 50 Shades of Grey (Which I loved) but I don't. Yeah, Gideon is rich but so is Eva if she wanted.<br />I really loved this book the only thing that sucks is that I have to wait until October 2! The love and passion between Eva and Gideon makes you melt. I really am a sucker for true love and that is what this book has. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book!
B00755646W|5.0|Good price, excelent quality!<br />I had been waiting for this release a long time. Hope in the end the blond ambition tour will be released too. It only came out on laserdisc in the past.
B001BFFTO0|2.0|**updated review**<br />Amazon gave me a full refund without any trouble. Kudos to them. I visited a Timberland to try on different sizes and found that size 9 1/2 was the best fit. That's a full size and half smaller than I what usually wear. The store's price was about $40 more expensive than Amazon's, so I decided to repurchase the shoes here.<br /><br />I have been wearing these shoes for a couple weeks and I really like them. They are stylish and very comfy. I can't say much about the durability but these shoes seem very well built. My only issue is that the mouth of the shoe is very narrow, so you have undo the laces at least half way to get them on or off. Another caveat is that the color of the shoes can vary quite a bit. In the store, the \\"tanned\\" version ranged from reddish brown to dark brown. The natural color seems to be somewhere in the middle. I would recommend buying some shoe wax to protect the leather. The wax also makes the leather appear darker and more vibrant.<br /><br />I still recommend trying on multiple sizes before purchasing. For not being true to size, I give the Earthkeepers 2/5. Otherwise, I would rate them 4.5/5.<br /><br />**old review**<br />After reading all the warnings about these shoes running big, I decided to order a size 10 1/2 instead of my usual size 11. When I got to try them on, they were still very big. There was at least an inch between my big toe and the front inside of the shoe. Since the makers of these boots decided to forgo sizing conventions, I don't know what to order next. A size 10 might work but that might still be too long. If I go for a size 9 1/2, my feet might fit lengthwise but the width might be too narrow. I think I will save myself the trouble and return them for a full refund. There is a timberland store near where I live, so I will try my luck there. Hopefully, amazon won't give me too much trouble with the refund; I had cut a tag off to lace the shoes up properly.<br /><br />My advice is to get these shoes from a store where you can try on multiple sizes before buying. Finding the right size through Amazon is like shooting in the dark. People here seem satisfied with their shoes once they found the right size though, so they might be worth the effort.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I have been a huge Phantom of the Opera fan for years.  I have a room full of Phantom of the Opera memorabilia, so you can understand when this movie was available for pre-order I jumped on the bandwagon.  Well, the DVD arrived this afternoon and within 10 minutes it was in the DVD player.  I was already familiar with the music as I have purchased the soundtrack, but I was breathless watching the production.  I waited so long for a sequel to this love story and was not disappointed. I am so curious and dumbfounded as to why it did not do well in London.  I had read The Phantom of Manhattan and the story is based upon it; I thought the production was done very well.  It is hard to fit a whole book into a little over two hours, but it was portrayed quite well.  I am so happy to finally have the opportunity to see this show.  Very well done and I highly recommend.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is a show that keeps you hooked after every episode.  It's plot cleverly incorporates issues in society commonly found after September 11th. The amazing casting makes this a must watch television series!
B006ZEDZNY|2.0|Unfortunately it shows many aspects of the \\"paradise\\" islands that people vacation at.<br />I found it kind of slow but it's ok to watch.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|As I write this, I am about half way through the 2nd book.  Enjoying these stories very much!  When my daughter told me about them, and tried to get me \\"into\\" them, I thought it all sounded rather boring to be honest.  I like supernatural stories - ghosts, vampires, werewolves, zombies - you get the picture.  Or science fiction is good - future, past, weird science, etc.  So yeah, this trilogy just didn't \\"grab\\" me.  But I finally sat down to read the first book, and like I said, I'm 1/2 way thru second one, and am thoroughly enjoying it.  There is an element of science fiction and maybe even a small fraction of supernatural (i.e. muttations) to it.  Saw the movie, and can't wait for the 2nd one to come out.  :)
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Rebecca Ferguson is a rare breed. Her voice is something that is not to be taken lighttly. The critics say it is the \\"perfect cross between Aretha Franklin and Amy Winehouse\\" and I believe every word of it. This album is a wonderful ensemble of beautiful ballads, and nice uptempo songs. And not a single song is overproduced. I recommend this album to anyone who loves soul, or has fallen in love with Adele (which is the entire world).
0689835604|5.0|We read this book over and over with our two year old! It's one of his favorite books. I've even found him playing with his teddy bear mimicing the actions of the book.
B000005RQT|4.0|There seems to be a major resurgence of interest in 1970s music as today's 15-25 year olds rediscover music from that decade. I grew up in the 70s and my friends' teenaged sons and their friends are now frequently asking me about 70s bands and looking for lesser known bands and albums from that era.<br /><br />Deep Purple is one band I've told them all about.<br /><br />Having said that, Deep Purple is hardly a \\"lesser known\\" band but, in my defence, I've discovered that many of the young guys asking me about 70s music are not very familiar with Deep Purple. So to help rectify that situation.......<br /><br />My favorite Deep Purple album is Machine Head. I've reviewed it on Amazon with a 5 star rating and I recommend buying the 25 anniversary edition with the Roger Glover remixes and the extra tracks. Machine Head is one of the essential albums for any collection of 70s music. You need to have Machine Head in your music collection before you can claim to have a respectable collection of 1970s music.<br /><br />In Rock is also one of the Deep Purple albums I recommend buying for your collection. It's not up to the standard of Machine Head but it's a good album nonetheless. I've given Machine Head a 5 star rating so, by comparison, I'll give In Rock 4 stars.<br /><br />There's a less expensive version of In Rock available on Amazon but I recommend buying this anniversary remaster with the extra tracks and extra remixes by Deep Purple bass player Roger Glover.<br /><br />The strongest tracks on this album (IMHO) are Speed King and Flight Of The Rat. They've both been posted on You Tube if you want to check them out before you buy this album. Amazon also has these tracks available for download on its US site. But at the current price of this CD, buy the CD rather than the mp3 downloads; the remasters and the Roger Glover remixes are worth the extra few $.<br /><br />Deep Purple was a band that went through a number of personnel changes over the years. You'll see references in the reviews to Mark 1, Mark 2 etc., referring to the different personnel lineups in the band at various times. This is the Mark 2 lineup of the band, the one that released Machine Head, and IMHO the most influential lineup in the band's history.<br /><br />I saw Deep Purple in concert a few months ago in Victoria, B.C. Great show! Three guys from the Mark 2 line up (Roger Glover, Ian Gillan and Ian Paice) are still in the band; they're in their mid to late 60s but they still put on a really good show. Ian Gillan's voice isn't what it once was but it was still a reallty good show. If you get a chance to see them live, GO! One track from this album, Speed King, was included in their current live set.<br /><br />Bottom line: In Rock is a good album and one that's worth getting for your Deep Purple collection. If you're discovering/re-discovering or exploring 1970s music, this is an album you should check out.nces in the reviews to Mark 1, Mark 2 etc., referring to the different personnel lineups in the band at various times. This is the Mark 2 lineup of the band, the one that released Machine Head, and IMHO the most influential lineup in the band's history.<br /><br />I saw Deep Purple in concert a few months ago in Victoria, B.C.

Ian Gillan's voice isn't what it once was but it was still a reallty good show. If you get a chance to see them live, GO! One track from this album, Speed King, was included in their current live set.<br /><br />Bottom line: In Rock is a good album and one that's worth getting for your Deep Purple collection. If you're discovering/re-discovering or exploring 1970s music, this is an album you should check out.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|This movie brings me many memories from my childhood. When I found out they released it on blu ray, and at that incredible low price, I knew I have to have it in my collection. Great job on restoring this movie, the picture quality is just amazing.
B00001OH7U|5.0|There seems to be a major resurgence of interest in 1970s music as today's 15-25 year olds rediscover music from that decade. I grew up in the 70s and my friends' teenaged sons are now frequently asking me about 70s bands and looking for lesser known bands and albums from that era.<br /><br />David Bowie can hardly be classified as a \\"lesser known\\" musician but I've discovered that many of the young guys asking me about 70s music have heard of Bowie but they aren't sure which of his many albums to check out first. So to help rectify that situation.......<br /><br />This 1976 release is one of my three personal favourites among all of Bowie's extensive catalogue (the other two are Alladin Sane and Ziggy Stardust) and is one of the essential albums that should be in any respectable collection of 1970s music.<br /><br />Bowie has changed his image and sound repeatedly over the years. This album is from his Thin White Duke period, which started circa 1975 and followed his Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars phase, which lasted circa 1972-74. If you're not overly familiar with Bowie, this is, by far, the best album of Bowie's Thin White Duke period. If your music collection only has room for a only a few Bowie albums, this should be one of them.<br /><br />I recall seeing an interview with Bowie many years ago in which he said that he had such a bad cocaine habit in 1976 that he didn't remember making this album. It's still a great album in spite of Bowie's cocaine addiction while making it and his inability to remember recording it.<br /><br />For those who aren't overly familiar with Bowie, there are also two albums from his Spiders From Mars period you should check out: Aladdin Sane; and Ziggy Stardust & the Spiders From Mars. Both are great albums, both have survived the test of time and both (IMHO) would easily rate among the 1970s' top 100 albums.<br /><br />Of those two albums, I have always prefered Alladin Sane over Ziggy Stardust so, although I recommend buying both of them, I'd suggest buying Aladdin Sane first if you don't yet own either album.<br /><br />Bottom line: I'd rate Station To Station, Aladdin Sane and Ziggy Stardust as Bowie's best three albums and as essential albums for any serious collection of 1970s music.uying both of them, I'd suggest buying Aladdin Sane first if you don't yet own either album.<br /><br />Bottom line: I'd rate Station To Station, Aladdin Sane and Ziggy Stardust as Bowie's best three albums and as essential albums for any serious collection of 1970s music.

0765365278|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series is the most amazingly deliberate approach to epic fantasy.  He wastes no time in introducing a multitude of characters with no intersecting plot lines all performing their own part in developing the bigger picture of the story while continually compelling you to follow along closely as each character endures their own amazing and detailed adventure.  I found my self quickly drawn into the stories as well as the backgrounds and side plots.  This promises to be the best epic yet as far as I can tell surpassed only by the Wheel of Time at the moment but with Sanderson's development since Elantris it seems only fair to say that this series will speedily take him to the top of Sci-Fi/Fantasy writing in the years to come.  Summation: If you like fantasy, read this book... Then read all his other stuff cause he's started a whole new ball game in the fantasy world.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|-1 star for ads I still like it just the ads, those pop up and get in the way,  the games are great,  just those pesky  ads.

1400079276|3.0|I have read a few Murakami novels, and I have to admit a bit of disappointment with this one. In this work it is as if he wrote a novel which is clearly centered around some mystical phenomenon that unites the experience of all the principal characters, then edited out all direct references to it, leaving only a shell around it. The rest of us us can only guess as to how all the various strands of narrative tie together. The effect is more enigmatic but less haunting than in, say, Hard-Boiled Wonderland.<br /><br />However, the tone is somewhat warmer than his other works, and does not suffer from the lack of his usual disaffected 30-something male protagonist. The tale and the characters themselves are quite engaging and enjoyable during the read.  It only really suffers in its paucity of closure.<br /><br />If you like his work and enjoy the idea of puzzling out the possibly non-existent substance behind an ethereal tale, by all means check it out.
B0036OP0QQ|3.0|I really had been looking forward to getting this collection set, for a long time. To my amazement, with a few of the Cds, I had to retype the titles and retype an entire CD, because the words came up in French?!?! All of the songs did play as listed on the cover, but a lot of extra work came into play and I did not want to wait for a return in fear I might be disappointed again. The songs are great though....
B00466HN6S|1.0|An embarrassingly unfunny movie, that has virtually nothing to do with Easter.  My 6-yo son feigned interest, and has never asked to see it again.  Do not waste your time or money on this film.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this album.  We've known for a while that JM was heading in this direction (California folk/rock ala Neil Young), and I was worried that the album would sound contrived.  It does not, at least to me.  I think this album is what \\"Battle Studies\\" should have been.  I think JM was heading in this direction, the \\"California rock\\" sound, but hadn't fully dived in at that point.  Because of that, I think \\"Battle Studies\\" ended up sounding kind of generic, didn't really have a cohesive direction to it.  I ended up liking some of the songs on it, but not at first listen.  It had to grow on me.<br /><br />This album is great from the first listen.  There is a clear direction to the album.  And it doesn't come off as contrived to me.  It's definitely not \\"Continuum\\", and it's not supposed to be.  It's different in almost every way (lyrically, instrumentally, thematically).  \\"Queen of California\\" is a great opener, and sets the tone for the album well.  It has a James Taylor feel to it (think Mud Slide Slim album).  The outro piano part reminds me of the Allman Brothers \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" era sound with Chuck Leavell on piano.  I say all that, but it doesn't sound like JM is trying to sound like anyone else.  The vocals and lyrics still sound like it's coming from him, not him trying to sound like Neil Young or James Taylor.  That's what I like about this album.  He can wear his influences on his sleeve without it sounding contrived.<br /><br />\\"Age of Worry\\" is a great song, very different and interesting.  It has a classic, grand Americana sound, and an interesting melody.<br /><br />\\"Shadow Days\\" and \\"Something Like Olivia\\" are probably the most radio-ready songs on the album.  Nice, simple, well done songs.  \\"Something Like Olivia\\" doesn't exactly fit with the style of the rest of the album, but it's still a great song.  I really like the guitar sound he gets on it.  You can hear the space between the amp and the mic, hear the space in the studio.<br /><br />\\"Born and Raised\\" has quickly become my favorite song on the album.  Again, he definitely aims for a CSNY sound, but it still sounds honest, sounds like a JM song.  It gets stuck in your head easily, which JM has a knack for doing.  The harmonies by Crosby and Nash are simple, but really add a lot.<br /><br />\\"Walt Grace\\" is also an impressive song.  It's a departure from JM's normal song writing style.  He's usually introspective, writing in the first person, or making general observations on society (\\"Waiting on the World to Change\\", \\"Belief\\").  This is a third-person, story telling song, which I think is a lost art.  Paul McCartney was great at that, writing interesting stories in songs.  Here, JM is able to convey an entire story in 3 simple verses.  Very visual lyrics, and the lyrics fit with the music.<br /><br />The \\"Born and Raised Reprise\\" finishes off the album well, and the bonus track \\"Fool\\" is great as well.  It sounds like it could have been on \\"Continuum\\", but he gives it a folk feel with the harmonica.<br /><br />Again, wonderful album that I haven't been able to stop listening to all week. At some point, I still want JM to make a blistering blues guitar album.  He's too good of a blues guitarist not to.  He still hasn't just let it rip on a studio album yet (though he does on the \\"Where the Light Is\\" live album).  I think the next generation of guitarists needs a new blues album to be inspired by, like JM was inspired by \\"Texas Flood\\" and \\"Axis: Bold as Love\\".  But, in the meantime, I'll definitely enjoy this album.
B007SGM084|5.0|I fell in love with this series after reading the first book. This is a tale about a man who has a messed up past and has certain urges. He meets a woman who seems to intrigue him so he has a business proposition for her. But It turns out that the proposition doesn't last very long. This Series has its ups and downs. I laughed, cried and felt myself wanting more. The hype isn't about the Characters but about the story its self. Yes its fantasy but It could also be a reality.  I like all different types of books but this one is definitely worth all the hype its getting out there. I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00371V6SE|4.0|Well, I saw the movie (twice) before I read the book, so I already had an opinion before I started the first page. I was already a big fan of the story due to the movie so in reading the novel I discovered that the movie was reasonably true to the book and the differences only made the book more interesting for me to read. Well worth it.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|So far, I think that this is the best Foo Fighters album yet. \\"Rope\\" and \\"Walk\\" are the best songs on here. Also, I like \\"Dear Rosemary\\". Get this album now.

0525425764|3.0|I give the Theodore Boone books a 3 because I believe in \\"anything to get kids to read.\\" I do however believe books aimed at children should show respect for their intelligence. The first Theodore Boone book states, \\"Mr. Mount was in his mid thirties and had once worked as a lawyer at a gigantic firm\\" yet the third book, The Accused, states of Mr. Mount, \\"Mr. Mount was in his mid thirties and he often talked of leaving the classroom and going to law school.\\" Please, Grisham fans, even young ones, deserve better. Those of us that pay the price for the books or kindle books deserve better.

B0086700CM|5.0|I ABSOLUTLY LOVE THIS GAME AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO IT COMING OUT ON THE KINDLE FIRE&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; AND NOW IT FINALLY IS!!!!!!
B002LVUKIS|5.0|First off I have to say I did not get to writing this review for some time after I picked this game up from Amazon. Ever still I must say I love this series very much and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good stealth series to dive into. I however will not be reviewing as much story as I am game play, and even a added bit for a video fix regarding the first two games. This is intending as being informative while still not being a spoiler, as it is not my intent to tell you about the characters other then listing some factions and the name of the character you play as.<br /><br />So I originally bought this set for my old PC running on XP to find that the original games did not work do to texture loading errors and so on. The Eidos forums supplied no support regarding the first two and their errors (not to my surprise). So I ended up playing Thief: Deadly Shadows cause it was the only one that would run, but I loved it. So after playing through it and wishing there was more I traded it to a friend so that maybe he could get something out of it too.<br /><br />Amazingly after Ordering a Falcon Northwest PC running Windows 7, all the games ran fine after getting the set back from my friend I lent it too. Only thing that had problems were the videos that needed a simple fix for the first two in the series. Here it is before I start in review of the individual games.<br /><br />  _______________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Thief1/2 VIDEO FIX BELOW.<br />If your videos don't play on the first two, here is a fix I use for it that with some intermediate knowledge of computers is simple to do. To test if it works run the intro on the main menu to see if your fix works. Excerpt from a support page on The Looking Glass Forums.<br /><br />\\"Scrooge's Permanent Movie Fix<br />1) Locate (use \\"Search\\") the file named \\"regsvr32.exe\\". It is located in the Windows SYSTEM directory (if 9x/ME) or SYSTEM32 (if 2K/XP). Copy it in your thief installation.<br /><br />2) Create a text document named \\"RegIndeo.bat\\" and copy/paste the following text:<br />\\"regsvr32.exe /s LGVID.AX\\" (without quotes)<br /><br />3) Save it (The file extension must be .bat)<br /><br />Simply double-click on the file when your movies don't play.<br /><br />Note: it is not needed to repeat the operation in all your installed Thief/Gold/II, simply use one of them. The \\"registration\\" process will fix the problems in all installed Thief games present.\\"<br /><br />  _____________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I love these games now that I have been able to play them, and consider them to be the most unique and enjoyable stealth games out there. Also, out of my lurking nature developed from playing these games, I really couldn't see stealth any other way. I am new to this series as I picked them up early this year, so I am no old fan. I wish I had found this sooner, but now am just thankful I had found them in the first place. So to the reviews you wanted to read...<br /><br />Thief: Gold. For an old game this certainly had some broad levels that were quite dynamic for the time. It gave a lot to story while keeping the game's levels interesting with unexpected twists. One thing that has always been in Thief games that started in the first one is their ability to completely change your objectives and throw you for a loop during a mission. So these games are never that predictable and have great moments that force you to think for an alternative. Many weapons in your armament have unique abilities to overcome obstacles, neutralize them, or even destroy them. Some things have been around ever since the first game and I will list them here...<br /><br />Black Jack: This is a basic weapon that is handy for knocking out opponents from behind with out alerting nearby enemies. It is however near worthless in a fight so is a weapon of stealth only.<br /><br />Gas Arrow: This is another stealth weapon that can knock out multiple opponents within a close radius. This is a more expensive option but allows you to remain in a safe position while silently knocking out enemies.<br /><br />Moss Arrow: In times when the floor you need to cross will make to much noise and there is no way around, Moss Arrows are another key to stealth. These arrows spawn a patch of moss that covers a decent radius of a floor making footsteps in that patch silent.<br /><br />Noise Maker Arrow: When you gotta make a break around a couple of guards, these can be used to distract them. They are very noisy as the name says so point it where you want them to look into.<br /><br />Water Arrow: This douses fire from torches to most fire places. This is one of the most practical weapons that darkens areas so that you remain unseen.<br /><br />Flash Bombs: When times get tough and you don't feel like fighting, throw one of these to blind those guards for a short time. Note that you can blind yourself to if you are not careful with one of these.<br /><br />Broad Head Arrow: A basic arrow that is used to damage or kill enemies.<br /><br />Fire Arrow: A much more damaging arrow that is useful for very tough enemies.<br /><br />Mines: A even greater step to insuring your enemy's ultimate demise would be to throw one of these in front of their path. Note that in the first two games you can also set these off so be careful with them.<br /><br />  _________________________________________________<br /><br />The Thief games on the Dark Engine (being the first and second Thief games) worked off of a set of missions with videos connecting them with story. So that is why the videos are so essential to them and is why I also included the fix in this review. So if you are getting video trouble, again I prompt you to go through the steps of the fix, otherwise you lose the whole story and will not have a very informed or enjoyable experience.<br /><br />In this installment the factions of the Hammerites, and the Pagans are introduced.<br /><br />Thief: The Metal Age. So as a direct continuation to the first game, with some minor improvements along the way I think it held it's own in the series. While some considered it to be far less, I think it included so much and had much more vastness to some of the levels that it really deserved a lot more from fans. To me I honestly liked this one for the level design over the first, as it was far less glitchy as the first. To me this was an equal extension, but it had far enough to keep it fresh with both story and design. This gives a much more industrial side to the series, and accents it quite nicely.<br /><br />In this installment the notable Mechanist faction, a deviant version of the Hammerites, comes on the scene as the main part of the story.<br /><br />Thief: Deadly Shadows. Being that this was released four years after the former game Thief 2 I will try and sum up things that changed and that were kept. Items that were taken out or changed go as listed.<br /><br />  _________________________________________________________<br /><br />Rope and Vine arrows: These were replaced by a more physics practical item known as the wall climbing gloves. However the gloves are not available to the user until later on in the game, which some considered to be a fault in the game.<br /><br />Speed Potion: This was not included in T3. This also includes Slow fall potion, as well as Invisibility potion.<br /><br />Sword: This was replaced by the dagger, that in my opinion was a good change because it was not as heavy and made more sense for a Thief to have. Still has a one hit kill on a unsuspecting opponent, otherwise known as the back stab.<br /><br />Frog Beast: These little guys were not included most likely because Garret the character you play as was not associated with the Pagan faction in story any more.<br /><br />Keys: These are now less cumbersome and once acquired just make doors open and do not need a key to be selected from inventory. This was just a simpler step to be less confusing.<br /><br />Lock Picking: This is now a more realistic sort of mini-scene that uses the mouse positioning as the player's hand with the pick. It goes in steps that unlock in procession upon hitting the sweet spot with the mouse.<br /><br />Player Physics, and Environment Interactions: While not being the most state of the art as what might have been expected by this time, they still are a improvement from the original two games. They still have some glitches such as the player getting stuck on detail objects forcing you to reload the previous saved game. There is still no finesse in setting an object down as just dropping a held physics prop still is very loud and alerts near enemies if present. While that may not seem so bad it can be annoying if you happen to pick up a object by accident. My advice is find a corner away from those you do not want to alert and drop your held object there.<br /><br />  _________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I may have missed some items but those are the general things that are noticeably different from the Dark Engine installments to the Unreal 2 version as T3. So now to my review of Thief: Deadly Shadows. As I will refer to it as T3, it has some characteristics that do change it's feel over the first two. It retains the same design and story within the existing universe, but expands in the areas of graphics and story. Overall the plot seems much more interwoven and well written then the first games. For also changing studios it did well I think to continue after a four year void of no sequels.<br /><br />Game play features a lot of the classic strategies as the original ones did. There is controversy over the lack in changing or adding a immense new world, but this feature was also a ported to the Xbox so the game was created to fit what the Xbox could handle at that time. It also held a bit more of a fresh start for the new player base on the console, so thus the game could not simply be named Thief 3, and took on it's title it has now. This created some frustration for long time players since Eidos had catered to the console generation a little more for the continuing Thief game they had been waiting for.<br /><br />T3 works differently in the way the levels pan out. It still takes place in the city, but it allows you to explore and travel as you will through loading gates, instead of being guided mission by mission as the old predecessors did. However T3 does have actual missions but it lets you tackle them when you are ready, and in almost every case you have to travel to the mission start point, that is usually denoted with a glowing Keeper glyph. This is one of the top reasons I love T3 so much, is that it is very open world designed and is not linear as so many games are. This can be confusing some times but rewards you with that great feeling when you accomplished your goals on your own. This installment is best described as a much more real feeling Thief game over the previous ones. There is more I could add about game play, but I think this has given enough info regarding what these games are relatively about. I hope this improves your experience and further convinces you into buying this great series.gans are introduced.<br /><br />Thief: The Metal Age.

B0055PGUYU|3.0|The first thesis of the book is that habits work by a  cycle of trigger, action, reward process.<br /><br />The second thesis is that what makes the cycle so persistent is the energy of craving behind it.<br /><br />Habits control much of our life. They are a very efficient means of processing information -- thousands of time faster than our conscious thinking mind.  So they are very, very useful. But they can set traps for us by causing us to behave in ways that are counter to our better natures.<br /><br />And they can allow others to manipulate us.<br /><br />This book points that out, and has some data to support its theses of the habit cycle and the craving that gives them a life and energy of their own.<br /><br />That data draws on advertising and market research and history. In that aspect, it's more empirical than most explanations of habit.<br /><br />The theses are interesting - but ultimately not convincing as  a complete explanation.<br /><br />So, how do you change habits? The book's premise is that the first step is becoming aware of the triggers. Once the triggers are found, the author recommends forgetting about the why, and working instead to substitute a better action than the current outcome.  That's probably a reasonable starting point for most people.<br /><br />A key element in changing the action associated with a habit is a belief that the action can be changed. That's critical. If you don't think you can change the habit, you won't.<br /><br />Another useful element in changing habits is community. People can help you see both your triggers and actions, - even when they've become mostly invisible to you.<br /><br />There are a few more ideas in the book worth considering. One of them is that there are key habits that spill over into everything else. Change those, and the effects of the changed actions will ripple through your personality.<br /><br />Another idea is about the role of habits in a bureaucracy, such as in a corporate structure.In that environment, habits have an additional role of defining acceptable behavior among competing groups with different interests.<br /><br />The author also explores the moral consequences of habits. Are you morally responsible for your habits, if in fact, they override or ignore your ability to see and choose consciously? Or, are you only responsible when you know you have certain habits and don't change them?<br /><br />On a scale of 5, I'd give this book a 3 ½.<br /><br />It is somewhat thought provoking for those who will use it as starting point for looking at the role of habits in their own life.  But it is ultimately unconvincing and a bit shallow for those who really want to grapple with deeply ingrained habits that limit their lives.<br /><br />And I suppose some marketing types will find some ideas here about how to use people's habits to manipulate and exploit them.

0345803485|1.0|I'm at a loss - seldom have I read anything so badly written. I can't believe I had to colour in even 1 star for this nonsense. And it's on the New York Times Bestseller List?!? We are truly doomed. This book is terrible in every way imaginable - terrible plot, terrible character development, unbelievably terrible dialogue, terrible writing style, and just when you think it's got to get better most of it is repeated! Like another reviewer, I too thought that the author must be a teenager, but that's a bit insulting to teenagers. I am a teacher and I spent the first few chapters thinking that if any of my students submitted this drivel they would fail. I guess the author is laughing all the way to the bank. If this book can get published, then I think we should all access the novel within us, and send it to Vintage immediately.
145162445X|5.0|Most enjoyable book. I particularly liked the bits about the cosmic background radiation photons to protons ratio, really is a fingerprint of the big bang, I never knew that before, thanks Lawrence for making this stuff accessible to us plebs. The fundies will hate this of course as it is yet another nail in the coffin of their ignorant superstitions.
B004UID2LC|5.0|most awsomest thing EVER lolz I luv it sooooo much. Luv luv luv really easy to use simple fast and effective and the best part is after you download the bids you don't need Internet connection to wach them. idk y its free cause most free apps r cheap and lame but this is amazing
B00000F169|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of movies to be honest. Anything I watch in the theater with friends just bores or disturbs me, and most everything else just doesn't match my taste. I am, however, a HUGE music freak and one of my favorite bands is Pinback. I learned in an interview with Rob Crow and Zach Smith about how their name is taken from the character in this movie and they often have used direct quotes from Dark Star in their songs. So how could I resist? Let me tell you- this movie is incredibly creative, unexpected, and get this: it actually made me LAUGH! Now that's next to impossible! There are so many classic parts in the movie, especially with Pinback's little mishaps and failed attempts at making the crew laugh, the beachball alien, Doolittle's attempts at convincing the bomb not to blow up, and sooo much more! People laugh at how corny old space films are such as making fun of their concepts of cellular phones and other things we have today in a much superior form. Not so with this movie! There's so many cool things going on in here that we still aren't capable of and work out awesome in the movie, particularly the ability to talk to Captain Powell's dead body through a wire hook up to his brain. Now that's just cool, and not just because he's encased in ice! This is a great movie, and the fact that there was a low budget for it with cheap special effects only makes it more charming. These effects are actually integrated insanely well and don't even remotely detract from the film! I can't wait to watch it again! My favorite band may have led me to one of my favorite movies!
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome and<br /> addicting it is hard to put the game down and do work that is how good of a game it is.
0446572993|4.0|An enjoyable read, with the storyline moving right along. The ending was somewhat expected by the way the bad guy was inserted in the book or maybe its just because I've read so many mystries.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant believe it's finally here! This is the real game people, so get excited! Even if you've never played it, you'll love... and it's free!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is an enjoyable game and a great time waster. The only issue I have is that when a call comes in and my game is interrupted, it doesn't save my progress in the board layout I'm currently playing. Even if I'm nearly finished in a particular tile layout, it will make me restart the layout after the interruption. Please fix this glitch and I will change to five stars. Otherwise, a very enjoyable game. Will consider Artifacts 2.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application is easy to use and great for organizing, planning  and notes!  I am very happy to have found this app.
B005HSL626|4.0|It seemed to me that this would be a terrible game just by the title. Since it was free, I decided to download it, and it is actually pretty fun.
B0086700CM|1.0|I gave this review a 1 to get your attention! This game is great. I got it for my kindle and it is amazing. There is absolutely no lagging or freezing up. Just kick up the sensitivity on the options menu and you should be good to go!
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally they realesed the REAL version. :D Good graphics (for an app) Works great on my kindle fire. :) I have to admit, this is one of the most addicting games I've ever played!
B00824ZJ84|5.0|Seriously- one of the best albums of 2011-2012. I would rank it up there with Adele's 21. A fun retro, soul album. Her voice is absolutely stunning and the songs are deep (this ain't a Kesha album ya'll). Teach me how to be loved and shoulder to shoulder are breath taking ballads; while Diamond to a Stone and Too Good to Lose are fun disco-esque soul/pop numbers. Every songs on the album is good.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome awesome game but after a couple of days it wouldn't work get it and c how ot works 4 ya!:)
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|I had heard good reviews and expected more. It was too gory and mostly predictable, with the exception of the end - which wasn't very good anyway.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just can't seem to stop playing it because it's so fun and addictive...and FREE! Highly recommended!!!!!! Even though I seem to be experiencing some lag.
B0086700CM|5.0|Downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire and it is very fun! A good way to kill some time but watch out because before you know it, you've been playing for hours.
B0086700CM|5.0|I spend hours playing this game!! no lag. works great on my kindle fire! good job to the devs! look forward to more games like this!
B007SGM084|5.0|This is an awesome trilogy about love, sex, abuse, and how fine a line it can be to overcome abuse to find love and change your outlook on life, love and happiness.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting to play this myself, my friend's friend kept telling everyone that there is a cheat in the game.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Wow, this is the book where things really start to come together.  It was hard to put this one down - and the ending is a mindblower.  Love this series!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|GREAT GAME! Love that it is something new. Games that require a litle thinking are my favorite. Plus no ridiculous permissions.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|The movies themselves are great. The Toy Story trilogy is arguably the best set of animated movies of all time. The packaging itself is neat as well. Some do not like the fact that the discs aren't protected by anything other than foam slots in the toy box. I recommend this product to fans of any Pixar movies!
B0086700CM|5.0|i have been waiting for this so badly i have to play it other ppls phones thank u god :)
B0086700CM|5.0|yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes! THE TRUE GAME HAS COME AND I DONT HAVE TO PLAY IT ON MY PHONE!

B007V2UGPE|4.0|Definitly a fun game but it does get a little choppy after awhile. However it is a fun game and would recommend it to a friend.

0156034026|3.0|The concept of this book is rather unique and interesting. Several books about post-9/11 America have been published, but few, if any, tackle the rising \\"Islamaphobia\\" that popped up afterwards. This story, which is told from the point-of-view of a Pakistani immigrant living and working at a prestigious firm in New York City, does a good job of showing that side of the story. Now, Changez may or may not be the most likeable character and a few readers may take offense to some of his actions and reactions in the book (e.g., as the review above notes, Changez \\"smiled\\" when he saw the Twin Towers get hit), but I think that makes him a more complex and interesting character. His relationships with other characters, especially Erica (who you may like or plain hate) is what makes up the bulk of this book beyond post-9/11 issues.<br /><br />The flaws of this book distracts a bit from the story. First off, it's obvious within the first sentence that this story is told from a second person point-of-view. It's a tricky way of telling a story, especially a novel of this length, and honestly, I don't think it really worked. You get glimpses and hints about the person, the American, he's talking to, but not enough to really make him a well realized character. The way this story is told becomes more annoying when Changez isn't telling his life story, when the story jumps back to present day Pakistan and pulled me out of the story more than once. It's hard to explain, but some of the sentences, such as \\"Oh, I can see that you are looking at me quizzically\\" (note, this sentence doesn't really appear in the story, but lines similar to this do crop up) just come off as odd and mess up the flow. The ending of the story will either satisfy you or drive you bonkers-personally, I wasn't a fan of the ending.<br /><br />It's definitely worth a read, especially since it has been adapted into a movie that should be coming out in the next few months/2013. If you don't let the  manner in whichthis story is told trip you up, you'll find some very good story telling in here.
B000I9X67W|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, it' a comedy with values. I was disturbed that it wouldn't play, when I went to watch it one night there were scratches and hesitations on it. I had to replace it with a second copy.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its really hear I cant belive it. I love this game and its free. Thank You Imangi Studios! I love thos app.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is really fun every one at school is talking abount it but Thiri is one person that dose not like it I think you should get it best app in the world
B007MU85D0|5.0|I stumbled across this group here on Amazon under the recommendations they had for my music tastes. They were spot on, shortly after listening to the CD I started hearing their songs on the radio which is no surprise. If you like Indie/Alternative you will love Of Monsters And Men.
0321344758|5.0|Because I am from Brazil, I had to wait two months to start read that book and I have to say: this book is worthy of each waiting day.<br />The \\"rules\\", the tips and all experience shared on this book is a content that every single people who works on web needs to try. That's simply incredible! Thank you Mr. Krug.
B006QPVH6O|2.0|The story-line had a lot of holes in it. The movie was written as if it were an expose of the DOD hiding an expedition to the moon. The suspension of disbelief is a requirement to make the movie interesting. Unfortunately, there were too many obvious flaws to make that possible for more than brief periods. The entire amount of action or drama is easily exceeded in the first five minutes of most mediocre sci-fi or action movies. Not wretched, but definitely disappointing in a Cloverfield way, only worse.
B003O86FMW|4.0|loved this series.  while the first book was definitely my favorite, i could not put down the other two until i finished them.  there were a few parts that dragged a little, but by and large, they were enjoyable reads.
B007704HO6|5.0|This is a must read book for cat lovers and admirers of the human spirit. Rarely can you read something so raw and gritty, yet it brings tears to your eyes and hope to your heart. This is not a pretty book, but it is an honest book and every word in it rings true. I absolutely adored reading it, spent the rest of the day googling James and Bob, and send my heartfelt best wishes to the two of them. What a very special pair who so well deserve each other!
0553582038|2.0|I loved the first three books then I hit this book and it felt like literary masturbation.  I don't think I'll read the rest of the series unless the author can peak my interest again.
0446572993|5.0|Honestly, two or three books ago I almost gave up on this author.  Sure glad I did not do that.  This is my favorite Baldacci book.  Believable.  Great action.  Enjoyed this for sure.
1609613937|5.0|Wow... finally a book I can recommend without reservation for my patients and friends as the best single resource to jump-start a journey to improved health.  In my 35+ years as a busy Family Medicine physician, I have always looked for resources that were based on sound reasoning, the best science, and were practical, simple, and effective. John and Mary McDougall's book meets all these requirements in an easy to read, well-organized format. Their recommendations, in addition to being based on peer-reviewed science, reflect their \\"practical wisdom\\" gained from years of clinical success with the residential 10-day McDougall program and the more recent residential 8-day McDougall Whole Foods program. Dr. John McDougall's 40 years of experience provide real life case studies for the book as well as concise answers to the questions that often arise regarding diet and health. He addresses the environmental and moral dimensions of eating a starch-focused diet as well.<br /><br />The Starch Solution will also be most useful to patients with chronic diseases. Scientific studies over the last 20 years have shown that by using the proper nutritional approach many chronic diseases can be stabilized, reversed, and often cured. Chronic diseases and their associated complications account for about 80% of health care costs and a huge amount of suffering not only for patients but for their families. This book lays out a proven approach to reduce these costs and suffering.<br /><br />This book provides a foundation for other outstanding resources that target specific chronic conditions. Examples that I have found useful in my practice are Neal Barnard's Program for Reversing Diabetes (Type 2 Diabetes), Caldwell Esselstyn's Preventing and Reversing Heart Disease (Arterial Disease), and the DVD by Jeff Novick RD \\"Calorie Density: Eat More, Weigh Less, and Live Longer\\" (Obesity).<br /><br />My recommendations are grounded in years of experience working with patients. Most recently I have participated in residential and nonresidential programs applying the diet advocated by Dr. McDougall and have been amazed at the results. Although still writing new prescriptions, I spend most of my time reducing and taking patients off their medications. It has been a very rewarding experience for all involved.ave participated in residential and nonresidential programs applying the diet advocated by Dr. McDougall and have been amazed at the results.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run I always would take one of my sublings ipod and try to sneak a game in when they didn't know I was doing it so now I can play it on my kindle.  :D
B005FRF6PC|5.0|Most of the ladies in my bookclub are tennis members and we all enjoyed this<br />story even the couple of gals who were not tennis players. This was written<br />from a different cultural perspective where the lifestyle is much different than here in the US. Enjoyed his lifestory so far, found it intriguing.
0547569653|4.0|\\"Sometimes you just do things!\\"<br /><br />As a philosophy, it isn't bad.  Scott Jurek, the great ultramarathoner, learned that little chestnut from his father while growing up.  While Scott didn't like that reasoning when he was younger, he found as he grew up that it was as good an explanation as any for why he would subject himself to the rigors of ultramarathoning.<br /><br />This is a good, short book that covers Scott's life up to 2010.  He details his early athletic endevours (he started running to get in shape for ski season) and talks about his big races.  There isn't an abundance of running advice, though Scott does mention several books he has read on running that influenced his life and career.  The title \\"Eat & Run\\" is appropriate, as Scott focuses not just on running, but his vegan diet as well.  He explains why he started going vegan, how it has helped his career, and then provides a new recipe at the end of each chapter.  I wish I had some cooking talent so that I could try out some of the recipes.  They sound delicious.
B0086700CM|5.0|finaly it came out. I WISH AMOZON WOULD KEEP UP GETTING MORE APPS AND ALL OF THEM. BUT GET THIS APP .ITS COOL
0670023329|3.0|I try to read everything I can find on Korea.  This book and several reviews caught my eye.  Unfortunately, this escape took up about 30 percent of the book (a good magazine article at best) and the rest was filler about North Korea.  So, if you are looking for a good non-fiction book about North Korea, buy this book.  If you looking for something that gives you the story of his escape, wait for the short version to come out in a news magazine.
B0086700CM|5.0|Once I found out that it was in the app store I knew I had to get it. I love this game sooooooooo much and it is great for road trips.
B007549W62|5.0|It's strange how everyone is so split across the board on this film... some love it, some hate it, in equal measure... look at the review numbers 1,2,3,4,5 stars in same quantity... that doesn't happen very often, if hardly ever! I loved this film, because it grabbed me from the moment it started, with its grunge mood and no BS character build-up... Boom, nuke blast, everyone runs for cover... we find ourselves stuck with some regular run of the mill folks who have only one thing in mind, survival, despite what is a totally alien outside. Cooperation turns to lethal self-interest, with an ending (small spoiler alert: reminiscent of THX 1138) which leaves you with a deep feeling of sadness and disgust towards the human race. Yes, this isn't for everyone, but if you like somber, bummer, claustrophobic films, this one's for you.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I first read this book back in middle school. So, I decided to revisit this classic tale now that I have more appreciation for literature than my pre-teen self.<br /><br />At first the writing seemed overly simple, lacking in any deep descriptive detail, but as I read, I found how well it seemed to fit with the tone and the story overall. The tale is told from the perspective of a young boy in a highly controlled society where even emotions are kept under tight wraps. All that changes when he is chosen to be the next Receiver, keeper of the society's memories. Things start to unfold gradually, then a little more rapidly as time goes on. The boy learns that the world used to be different, and how people gave up many things, like pain and emotions and feelings of attachment, in order not to feel that way anymore, if everything is the same, then no one would have to suffer anymore. A sort of play on the famous saying, 'It's better to have love and lost...', except this society truly believes it's better to have never loved at all.<br /><br />I believe the themes in this book are pretty poignant, even in this day. How much are we willing to give up in order to feel safe and protected? Our rights? Our families? Even our humanity? Jonas slowly starts to realize this as the tale progresses and he learns dark secrets about the family and home that he grew up with, delightfully ignorant to all that is around him. I loved his curiosity to find out more, to experience even the memories that were painful.<br /><br />Overall, this book is not an exciting read. There aren't many action scenes. But it is an enjoyable one, one I was glad I revisited now that I am older, and I would like to believe, somewhat wiser. However, I was a little disappointed by the ending. There was so much build up, so many questions that begged to be answered, but sadly they weren't. Where did Jonas go? Is the rest of the world like the society he lived in? There were so many. Instead, we are left with aslight hope and a town that somehow reminded me of the Christmas town from Nightmare Before Christmas...
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run so much even before it came for kindle. it's so much fun. Why didn't they make temple run for kindle earlier
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run. I had it on my phone and it wasn't near as good as it is on the kindle
B0086700CM|4.0|I loved this game its a lot of fun and will. keep. you playing for hours. the only thing about this game that's off is the slowness, the controls can be slow to do,  and the game background will sometimes freeze up for a second so you don't know what to press to avoid sn obdticle that may lie ahead. overall though I depfinantly would recommend this game.
B0086700CM|3.0|I have had this game on my kindle fire for a long time. its a good game but once every thing has been upgraded and the game play really heats up, it starts lagging.
B006QVRVJK|4.0|So what happens in NYC when parents of two boys decide to have a private meeting in order to resolve a conflict between their children?  Meet two couples, who are equally concerned about well being of their 11 year old sons.  Two boys got into a fight and the fight got physical.  Before long, one boy is grounded and another one nearly looses his tooth.  Surely, these young people need to be punished and thought a lesson; so - their parents decide to meet and assess what to do next.<br /><br />The entire movie is entirely set in a NYC apartment of one of the couples.  It starts as civil and cordial meeting between two pairs of concerned parents and turns into, well - carnage.  In nearly two hours, we see these four people fighting it out with each other in words.  It starts as one pair of parents against the other, but then lines become blurry as aliences between them start to shift.  Every now and then, pairs would re-group, but then things would fall into a chaos again.  It is witty, contemporary story about modern life, alienation between people, parents and their children; greed, glutony, assessment of our priorities and purpose in middle life.  Great cast of actors, wonderful verbal duels.  I truly enjoyed this movie.  I always loved Roman Polanski's movies and this one adds to the wonderful collection of his already prized work.
B005LLX582|5.0|I could watch this movie 100 times (I may have to simply to understand the sequencing of events).  It was sublime in the theaters, and it has lost none of its grandeur on my big screen TV.  If I could only see one movie before I leave this world, it would be this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg! I am so happy they finally made Temple Run for Android!!!! It has taken them long enough. Oh bye, have to go play Temple Run!
0375703764|5.0|House of Leaves is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma, and that is something it does extraordinarily well. The base story would be a workable challenge, a morning jog for the mind. The second layer, the narrator's interpretations and experiences, are an obstacle course fit for a Navy SEAL. The third, the experiences of those around the narrator, which act on, around and through him? That's parkour in a completely non-Euclidian world, one where the very laws of physics and reality seem naught more than a suggestion.<br /><br />The book starts spinning like a top when you follow the action, a mirror is handy for some sections, and a pad of paper to keep the action straight. A fun, deeply challenging read, not for those seeking a light bit of fluff, but a workout that leaves you wanting a smoke and a drink afterward.
B007SGM084|5.0|I started reading this book on a Thursday and finished it on the following Monday. I just couldn't put it down. Once I started reading, I had to know more. I read it about a month ago and I'm really thinking about picking it up again in the next couple of weeks.

B0034G4OXQ|4.0|When certain generations think of Clint Eastwood, they think of his acting career.  But this remarkable man has earned his best credentials later on in his live, once he assumed his place behind the camera.  Many actors turn to creating their own production companies and directing movies, but none has done it with so much success as Clint Eastwood (and occasionally, Robert Redford). Every single movie that was directed by Clint Eastwood created some form of stir.  Here comes a man who is not afraid to ask difficult questions about difficult (and different) experiences in ordinary people's lives.  He is not afraid to challange his viewers and does not back down from his ideas, not matter how difficult they may be on the audiences.<br /><br />In this film there are three parallel stories: one is a sotry about successfull Parisian journalist who escapes death, another one is about a young London boy who looses his twin brother to death while his mother ends up in the rehabilitation center, he is sent off to the foster care.  And there is a blue collar worker in NYC who has psychic ability to speak with dead that haunts his personal and professional life.  Each one of them is struggling with their experiences that other people do not seem to understand. They are outcasts in a society that is so quick in labeling people.  Until one brief moment, when lives of these three people intersect and change their destinies from that moment on to hereafter.<br /><br />Although propbably not as powerful as some of his earlier films, this is still a wonderful story and a great message from Clint Eastwood to his audiences that keeps growing and growing with every story he has to tell...

B007CKNX28|5.0|Last month we hit the highway for a road trip which took us to Asheville NC, Black Mountain NC, Knoxville TN and Nashville. The only reason to return to Chicago by way of Nashville was to find 'Third Man Records'. We found it and had a blast perusing all the unique items on display. Meanwhile Jack's brother told us of his travails using the GPS while driving to Detroit. He was a very cool guy running that store.<br />  We bought numberous items like official Jack White guitar picks. But I'm here to review my purchase of 'Blunderbus' which was not on sale at the time at 'Third Man Records'. And that is why I bought it at the next best place. Amazon is our favorite place to purchase CD's and this purchase was typically perfect. Arriving quickly at a righteous price. Amazon you are cool.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Walking Dead season one is one of the best TV pilots I've seen in a long time, what's not to love? yeah it's based on a graphic novel, but it's filmed like a feature length movie with awesome acting and great character development each scene has a creepy cool mood that kept me enthralled in to the story after watching season 1 I knew I had to own it on DVD<br /><br />Ok first thing about the DVD is it upscales nicely assuming you have a legitimate copy and not one of those fancy fakes, I had to purchase mine elsewhere due to all the fakes that are being sold online I wanted a genuine studio released DVD because the fakes don't play normally and they don't upscale correctly here's a tip most fakes are sold as new, and are shrink rapped to look new but they are not, also they tend to come with a realistic looking cover box you'll also notice jagged lines during playback and the picture will go in and out of focus, so buyer beware<br /><br />Now back to the original disk set there are some nice special features that included  break down of all of season 1 episodes, and a making of short and a convention panel short that's quite nice I'm glad to add season one of the Walking Dead to my DVD and blu ray collection next I'll get season 2 as soon as the price drops. oh one more thing there is no audio commentary that I've noticed unless I didn't find the option but if I'm mistaken I'll revise later thanks for reading my review is for the Walking Dead season 1 Original DVD studio release only if your DVD didn't have the features in this review or played poorly you have a fake.

B00004T0US|5.0|This is an excellent album, and I think Elvis Presley's best. Producer Felton Jarvis should receive thanks for shepherding Elvis throughout the 1970's and Moody Blue is their crown jewel and masterpiece.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Wonderfully written, intricate tale but not confusing, engaging but not \\"cheap\\".<br /><br />I don't even know how to tell you how great this book is; now I think I will give *other books* fewer stars because what books can compare with this one?

B007J4T2G8|5.0|After getting my MBA I was not a fan of reading for a while...recently I heard about this book everywhere form the news to different TV shows, so I decided to give it a try.  To my surprise I was hooked after reading the first one I definitely had to get the other two.  I have heard people referring to this book as mommy porn...I guess some people are closed minded to explore various aspects of sex and are boring in bed...this book helps in a way to spice things up and makes you wonder.  At times it did get al little long but the suspense had me...I hope that she comes out with more books soon.  My husband was glad that I started reading again because it gave him a lot time without me calling him every second....which at times made him want MORE of my attention in many ways!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this games was a fun expierence it made me feel like I was actually running through a temple. I love love love this game.
0345803485|1.0|As a human sexuality instructor, a woman and a mom, I am really bummed that this book has received such praise by many women in our society. First, I am not a prude and am always up for a good sexual story, but this book is about relationship distortion, not relationship development. I am really disappointed in the story line and wish I would have read more reviews prior to paying for it. I read it through, and then took if off of my kindle. I would rather my daughters read something that is smutty good fun than something that implies that women have an inferior role in sexual situations. How long have we fought to over come this mentality? Come on women! Don't put up with this garbage.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game a lot. It is a lot of fun.I think that if I like it you will to so get it today.
