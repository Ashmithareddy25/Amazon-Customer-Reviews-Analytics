B004ZZS4CC|5.0|As sad and at some point disgusting that this book was, I couldn't put it down. Jaycee went thru so much that was never reported on the news. God Bless her for getting help and for having the courage to write this book.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|Bought this for my grandson, who  is 7 years old, and he absolutely loves it.  Carries it with him wherever he goes.  Keeps everything neat.  All his lego sets he keeps in ziploc bags, and is easy to store and uses the mat so he doesn't have to go on the kitchen table where his sisters can bother him.  So glad I bought it.
B001PB3RU8|4.0|A bit over-produced, I liked the MTV Unplugged DVD set better. Nothing like seeing Florence in all her glory in action!
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|Finally! A digital version of Silver Springs as originally released on the flipside of the Go Your Own Way 45 disk!<br />Love the different tracks of the songs.  Very cool to be able to hear the evolution.<br />This one's a \\"must have\\" for any Mac fan.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|Plot was so-so, dialogue was forced.  Segourni was mechanical, predictable, very unconvincing.<br /><br />Worst part was Amazon dropped the feed 3 times.  Had to disconnect and reconnect twice.
B003VS0CX8|1.0|DEFECTIVE .This Bluray does not work.My first complaint at amazon over the years.Even though defective,in order to get a replacement I must pay return shipping so it's not worth it.Other bluray disks work fine on my player.The DVD version included with the set does work but is of no interest to me.<br />A waste of money and more garbage for the local landfill.<br />dc

B00991TCOG|5.0|My kids introduced me to Lindsey Stirling! We love her unique music!<br />Check out 2Cellos, if this is a style you like. And watch some of her videos, they're great too!!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|One of the minor characters, late in the book, is a person who, we now know, figured out some amazing things in astronomy and physics but kept quiet about them for fear of the Church. He probably wasn't the only one. The effect of this poem on medieval society wasn't that it taught people how to think, but that it reminded them that it's okay to think. Watching this unfold in a Pulitzer Prize winning account is entertaining, but the opportunity to consider the same situation still, in today's world, is thrilling.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read these books in a weekend could not put it down! I felt like I was right there with her and I we t back and forth on who I wanted her to end up with but I was super happy with who she did!

B00A8307BG|5.0|If you are  fan of Robin Trower here is yet another MUST have release from a true guitar master!  Eleven remakes, and by remakes I mean that RT truly has made these his own.  These are not the old standards, nothing wrong with the originals or many of the later versions of them, but RT has here given an exceptional rendering of them that surpasses anything previously released IMO.  Clean and clear and downright dirty when needed, each one a joy to the ears, and the tone... rich and full and lucious.<br /><br />The samples here do not do this justice, they are just a tiny taste.  Track listing;<br /><br />Hound Dog<br />The Thrill is Gone<br />When I Heard Your Name<br />Little Red Rooster<br />I Believe to My Soul<br />Shape of Things to Come<br />That's Alright Mama<br />Save Your Love<br />Born Under a Bad Sign<br />Sheltered Moon<br />See My Life<br /><br />You truly must hear to believe tracks like \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\", \\"That'sAlright Mama\\", \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\", and \\"Little Red Rooster\\".  Classic RT blues guitar.  All songs are chock full of RT signature licks and sounds.  And, do you want wah?  You get wah, Robin Trower style, in both \\"Sheltered Moon\\" and \\"SeeMy Life\\"!<br /><br />This a full course of RT cuisine, 5 Star start to finsh!
B0000024YL|5.0|I love this album. It is wonderful. Simon and Garfunkel are the best. Yes, it is old, but it is gold, for sure. I listen to it over and over.
1586217194|4.0|This book was recommended from a friend who enjoys reading sociology books.  Since we have that in common, I looked into borrowing this from the library.  The library only had an audiobook so I just rented it.  The book has very curious scenarios and focuses on the fact that American's overvalue logic & undervalue the subconscious, but possibly more reliable judgements that we make.  It had great examples with research that sparked the curiousity: why Coke's sip test fails though people do prefer it to Pepsi, why U2's music took so long to be played on the radio (phone tallies said it didn't have what it should, but that method gives the wrong impression of a song).  My problem with it was actually the author's voice.  His inflection was good, but his tone was dull.  He didn't sound like a boring college professor, but his voice is one without much variance and it could fade into the background easily or sooth you to sleep.  I wish I could have gotten my hands on the book... (but I don't have money in the budget for purchasing the numerous books I'd like to read right now).  Maybe I will someday.

B00008PX8P|5.0|Either you don't like it or you love it. And I Love it. Led Zeppelin is the best rock band ever. EVER, for sure.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|This album should remove any doubt about the talent of this young man who came from poverty to international superstar in 6 years. The album is well performed with great guitar playing and soulful lyrics. It is interesting that the best is the one actually written by Justin himself-the very emotional:Nothing Like Us. Three of the songs were written by him and he co-wrote the rest I believe. The sound quality of the CD is excellent. A very tasteful album generally eschewing the usual electronic artifacts in most pop recordings today.
B0013J1WKY|4.0|Better than what I thought! I love Christina but my fave is the Xtina Stripped staged. I'm a huge fan of old Hollywood and thought this would be super campy. Was surprised at how all around entertaining it was. LOVE the Trouble video and the Nasty naughty boy performance with the Aussie hottie from the crowd. Highly recommend it.
B00068TJM6|4.0|specially, this watch looks good and the weight is proper to handle<br />I suggest that one especially owner driver cause they can recognize that watch is very useful !!

B004J4WNL2|4.0|Our society values outgoingness, extroversion and can leave those of us with a minority personality type, as well as family and friends,  wondering what is wrong.  It is encouraging to have the personality type analyzed in a positive way.  I was particularly happy to learn that my aversion to telephones is not so unique.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|I know someone that quit reading this book after being disappointed with missing their favorite characters.  Alas, the book is missing many of my favorites too, but enjoyed getting to know some of these lessor characters and Martin had no trouble entertaining me along the way.  Notably, Arie gets a lot of attention in this book and promises to be a major player in books to come. Enjoy!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I go this shipped to me and I didn't get the digital copy code. I got the discs that say that there is an insert for a digital copy code, but no such code could be found. I'm a little angry that I had to spend thirty dollars on iTunes to get something I should have gotten free with my purchase.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This game would merit five stars if you were able to see the leader board. Or a list of times and scores. And maybe a competitive level you can play against another person. Much potential!
0143119680|5.0|Out of all the books I have read the Twilight Series captured me like nothing else. I picked up A Discovery of Witches on a whim and have rediscovered the same addiction. I love the style of this writer in that she weaves in history and alchemy along with a great story. I have a love of rare books myself and the author's 1500 year old vampire's posession of so many, and how she describes them is excellent. I am not normally a reader of romance novels so for me there has to be more than sappy drama. I loved this book and have ordered the second. Ms. Harkness, thank you! You have done a phenominal piece of work!
B000HKYBXA|5.0|I chose to watch this film of Hamlet because Kenneth Branagh was playing the role of Hamlet and was also the director.<br />It was the clearest presentation of Shakespear that I have seen, beautifully filmed and acted.  I would recommend it to anyone.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I am a horse lover and I gotta say, the horses on here are beautiful. Especially the black ones. The unicorns look cool. This game is totally worth being free 100%.<br />I &lt;3 horses! Horse lover 4ever!

B004DNWPY4|3.0|Lots of repetative information in this one.  Interesting information but a bit of a drag to read as the same information is<br />re-presented in different ways over and over again.

0937381888|5.0|There are allot of things you already know if you brew so it's a nice refresher as well as seeing other ways to do thing and be more efficient  I will say I learned allot as well with how  to regulate your gravity readings if there off a bit,learning ph, how to make other brewery setups, etc.  to tell ya the truth it's like I could brew a little.  But the book helped me brew better. As well as understanding of what I'm doing instead of doing.  It's nice to understand how the process works<br />Buy the book it's sweet
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Sachi...you were meant to be a writer.  Your book blew all of your mother's superficial diatribes which she called \\"books\\" out of the water and off of the limb.  As an abuse survivor I recognize the need to maintain a healthy ambivalence and a positive attitude, but there is a time when you'll need to recognize that it is and never was your fault.  You were raised by megalomaniacs who chose not to allow you to recognize your beauty, your grace and your patience.  Let go, be yourself, enjoy your fame as an author....and whatever you do forgive..but maintain your distance from your toxic mother.....she just isn't GOOD for you.
0061122416|4.0|This book was a quick and fairly easy read, albeit at times a bit deep. I would recommend it though as a personal development style of book into thinking about life and life in general.
0345803485|2.0|I got this book because everyone and their dog is reading or did read it. People at my work. Almost every one of my friends. Even if it didn't sound all that interesting, young college girl dominated by a white collar control freak who is smoking hot (I admit you got to give me more here, mystery, thriller, a twist...something???)...I thought it could be really hot. I thought it must be great after all why would so many people buy and read this and then tell their friends to read it??? Right???<br /><br />Soooooooooo...I don't get it?!? The book is boring. It's a quick read with short lines. An avid reader can burn thru this in like 5-6 hours...I did. Sure it's got some sexy hot BDSM going on, but other than that the plot is just days in the life of a humdrum college student with a second job. There is no depth to this book, no meat on its bones. I am a huge reader and most books are worth the money but a good 20/30 % are amazing and leave you thinking about them for days.  This is NOT one of those books.<br /><br />You know what this book is, it's just S.E.X. That's it. I wonder if or what is lacking in today society for women that they would read such a mediocre book just for some erotica? Dude, watch a \\"special\\" flick, play something out with your partner...go get a partner to play something out with. Do something with yourself because if you thought the writing was good in this book something is lacking in your life. If you want erotica read Kresley Cole at least she knows how to carry a story line.  That's my point; there is no story line, so it is what it is. If you are fine with that enjoy.<br /><br />Man, I guess my final impression of this book is just disappointment. That's only because it was blown way out of proportion on the must read factor...other than them getting it on...I just do not see how this drew so many in, maybe it drew in those who don't read a lot. I guess if I only read a book a year or so maybe I would have liked it. Yet, there are so many other books that are soooooooooooo much better and deserve so much more attention than this got. Sad really!<br /><br />If you hardly read and like bondage buy it, if you read a lot don't...you will think it's a joke.ny other books that are soooooooooooo much better and deserve so much more attention than this got.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|A friend recommended and I haven't been disappointed so far.The story of many characters found in the hamlet of Lark Rise and the town of Candleford. The acting is superb!  Watching on the Kindle Fire HD is wonderful and the Dolby sound is great!.
B0000073NC|5.0|Finally with this album my scorps album collection is complete. Always loved the diverse musical direction in this awesome 2nd album by the great Scorpions. The album that introduced 'the scorpions feel/sound'. My personal favourite from the Uli Jon Roth era. My first ever amazon purchase. Great to have received it today, after 20 days of placing order. As I live in Malaysia,it is very difficult to find the 70's Scorpions album here nowdays. This album is just magic from start to finish. This is the ONLY Scorps album to feature lead vocals from 3 band members, Klaus,Uli and Rudy!
B000FC10WU|4.0|I bought this book because although I own and thoroughly enjoy  the DVD of the movie I had never actually read the book and was happy to read that the movie had remained mostly true to the book which it getting rarer these days.  If you enjoy Miss Marple I believe you will enjoy reading about the platinum blond who no one knew found mysteriously in the library.  Miss Marple is an astute observer of human nature and, of course, eventually unravels all the twists and turns (and there are many) of this fascinating mystery.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book the way that August was happy at the end he didn't care what he looked like. I think this book is good life reference on that it doesn't matter what you are on the outside it only matters what's on the inside.

B003WUYRGI|1.0|I honestly don't like this book it is as stupid as a peanut but that's just my opinion. You would even hate it so I am begging you don't  waste your time find another book.Poo
0525478817|5.0|I finally read this after several of my students (I teach high school English) and friends recommended it. I was kind of expecting a Jodi Picoult-type teen angst cancer book, but this was truly a remarkable book. Heartbreaking but not in a cheap way--in a way that felt really, really authentic. I bawled my eyes out for pretty much the last fourth of it, but in a good, cathartic way. I liked the characters, loved the deep dialogue, and believed the love story. It was just a beautiful book. Strongly recommend.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|What a fantastic box!  Joni Mitchell is one of the greatest singer-songwriters of the last 50 years (and that doesn't need the often applied qualification of &#34;female singer-songwriters&#34; either).  She is, in my view, in the same league as Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Leonard Cohen and the other true greats of the era.  This collection of her first ten studio albums at a bargain price shows why that's true.<br /><br />&#34;Red on Black&#34; has written an excellent review which I won't repeat, but suggest any prospective purchaser should read.  I would just add that Joni Mitchell moved in this period from largely guitar-and-solo-voice songs, through more complex arrangements and varied instrumentation, to out-and-out jazz.  If you're like me, you will like some of this material more than other bits.  Personally, I have never quite come to terms with Mingus, for example.  Many people love it, though, and the box is all top-quality music from a true giant of our age and there is a huge amount of great stuff here.  People of a certain age will also probably join me in going misty-eyed while having my teenage and university years flash before my eyes as these classic albums play.<br /><br />In short, it's a fantastic box of superlative music at a ridiculously low price.  Don't hesitate.
0812973992|5.0|I have two Kindels....but still long for a good old fashion book. I wanted one to carry on a trip so I bought this one. The vendor was great and the book in excellent condition.
0425166805|1.0|I read this book when it first came out. I was in high school and I was gullible so it seemed authentic. Shortly afterward I started learning about the reality of these archaeological discoveries. This book and its sequels have been debunked time and again. How can literate people not be aware of the exciting and real truth behind archaeological discoveries? For example, Pacal's sarcophagus lid has nothing to do with astronauts; it clearly depicts Pacal's trip to the underworld in standard Mayan symbolism. No mystery whatsoever. The author believes ancient people (not his ancestors of course--check his writings carefully) were too ignorant to accomplish anything significant. This book is malice perpetrated to keep this guy's income rolling in. Give yourself a break and if you have money to spend on a book, buy something literate instead. And to those who say keep an open mind and read this book, I say keep an open mind and read something authentic and far less insulting to your intelligence. Run from this author as fast as you can!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was not what I thought this book was a great pleasure to read and exciting... I couldn't put it down and when I did I couldn't wait to pick it back up.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|I remember seeing the advertisement for the movie & thinking that it looked cute.  But rarely do I race out anymore to see a film based on the trailer, having been burned too many times.  I soon forgot about it & just happened to see it at Christmas time on cable.  We landed on it while channel surfing & got sucked in immediately.  When there were mere minutes left, the TV shut off inexplicably.  I was surprised that I wondered about the ending for weeks afterwards.  This odd little film got under my skin.  So two months later I finally ordered it on Amazon.  I watched it as soon as it came out of the packaging & considered jumping to the ending where the TV had shut off, but opted instead to watch it in its entirety.  I was happy to discover that it was just as enjoyable as the first time around.  I recommend The Pirates! Band of Misfits for anyone wishing to escape for 88 minutes into a well animated, cleverly written saga of the endearing Pirate Captain & his band of loveable misfits.  I suspect there will be a sequel; at least I hope so.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I was really excited about this book since it got such great reviews but I was very disappointed. It was written as if a young teenager was describing what it would be like to fall in love. The story was not very complex and was predictable. I would recommend pretty much any other book. I had to make myself read it to see if it would get better, and it did not.
0316224588|4.0|If you are a fan of Inspector John Rebus you will like this book. The plot and characters are as good as ever and I enjoyed the Highland setting.

0340822783|5.0|The cover of this paperback edition published by Sceptre is very beautifully designed. I love it. The content of the book is undoubtedly the most magnificent, the intricately interwoven structure is the true-true spot light.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Usually I love Nicholas Sparks books but I was disappointed with this one. The story was fairly predictable and not very complex. Typically his books can make me laugh out loud one chapter and then cry another, but this book was not like that.

Better money was never spent.  The rhythms are great, the lyrics aren't the inane jabber you usually find these days.  True artists.

0061950726|5.0|In Christina Baker Kline's Orphan Train, she narrates the story of a practice meant to be kind that was often cruel.  Due to the waves of immigration, epidemics of illnesses and the difficulty of living in poverty, many children were left as orphans.  Many families had multiple children who were set adrift when their parents died or disappeared.  Organizations sprang up to help with the problem and the orphan trains were created.  Large numbers of children from the big Eastern cities were shipped to the Midwest where couples looking for children could adopt them.<br /><br />That was the way it was supposed to work.  In reality, many families were only looking for free labor.  Boys were taken as farm hands while girls were used as maids, nannies and other darker occupations.  Families were torn apart and the children were often even stripped of their names and renamed to suit their new families.  It was, in many ways, indentured servitude.<br /><br />Vivian Daly, a ninety-one year old widow, was one of those children.  She came over in the great Irish immigration and lost her family in a tenement fire.  Handy with a needle and desperate for an education, she grew up in a series of households, never quite belonging anywhere or to anyone.  As she nears the end of her life, Molly Ayer enters it.  Molly has a similiar background in modern America,  Her father was killled in a car accident, her mother couldn't cope and was hospitalized, and Molly entered the foster care system, where she also bounced from family to family.  When she needs community service hours to avoid juvie, she meets Vivian and agrees to help her sort out her lifetime of possessions.<br /><br />As they sort through Vivian's possessions, the older woman starts to share her memories of that painful time with Molly.  Molly instantly relates and a relationship develops between the two women regardless of the decades in age separating them.  They are sisters under the skin, both belonging to the group that never fit in anywhere or who could afford to trust anyone.  Slowly, as the trunks and boxes are sorted, they also sort out their feelings and secrets and learn to trust each other.<br /><br />This is a charming novel.  The reader will be sympathetic with Vivian and Molly, and ache that there is no better solution for the children left alone in the world.  Although we no longer use mechanisms such as the orphan train, for many foster children the end result remains the same.  One of the most surprising things is the time period.  This occurred around the 1920's, not in the 1800's.  Both the main caracters are believable and strong and the reader will hope for a better life for each of them.  This book is recommended foe readers of more recent historical fiction and those interested in reading how the human spirit can overcome tregedy.never fit in anywhere or who could afford to trust anyone.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I have seen all the Bourne Legacy movies. This may be the best yet. The good news is it leaves openings for future sequals.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book is recommended for many dystopian literature lovers!!!!  I loved it! Please read the rest if this series!!!!! It is the best yet!
B000000W5F|5.0|This is the very first CD I own from Rolling Stone - and I'm loving it. The remastering has been done well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great. App<br />Very realistic graphics. Will help kids learn what it takes to take care of a horse.<br />I have so much fun with this app. I played it with my 2 year old granddauhgter and she loved seeing and hearing the horses. Feeding them is her favorite chore. She loves to mix the feed and gets to stir it and laughs when she hears the horse crunching away. Lots of activities to choose and you have to learn patience for the rewards. I give it 5 stars. The only problem with this app for me was  figuring out how it all worked but it was fun learning.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Good book easy read found to be very interesting and something to ponder. I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in this subject matter.
B00A2H9LK6|1.0|The 1st silent hill movie was actually pretty good...this one...well..it just sucks...skip this one and do not wast your time.
B005KELW26|4.0|This toy was a big hit with my 3 year old granddaughter. she has played with them nonstop since she recieved them
6304308388|5.0|This is a true classic.  Jack Lemmon and Shirley McLaine give the performances of their lives.  Jack Lemmon carries the show but he is aptly supported by a fine cast of supporting players.  I did not want this movie to end...it's that good!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Best calc. App I have ever had and to view the other calc. Part just flip the device on it's side so overall the best one that I have ever downloaded
B004K4AVAG|4.0|After listening to samples I decided Born This Way was one of the CD's to purchase.  In my opinion, Gaga is one of the best &#34;current&#34; female artists.

0143038419|5.0|I finally got around to reading this book after reading [[ASIN:0988498804 This Is How I Save My Life: A True Story of Embryonic Stem Cells, Indian Adventures, and Ultimate Self-Healing]] (which is also amazing!). Reviewers said this book was similar and I'd been meaning to read it for ages -SO glad I finally did!<br /><br />I really felt like I was right there on this incredible journey, experiencing all the feelings, seeing all the magical sights and eating all the pasta:) If you're in the market for an inspirational story and a fun escape from your own life I highly recommend this easy read. It's even better than the movie-just read it!

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I loved the concept of this story. It was beautifully written, with a vivid and enchanting setting. I feel, though, that the characters suffered simply because there were so many of them. I would read another novel from this author, though, especially if it focuses on what happens after.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I have played this game on iOS and it is awesome! I have been waiting for this game on kindle fire HD and it has finally arrived! The graphics are great and the gameplay is so addicting! The best thing is that the game will never be over and we can play forever and never stop! I would give it infinite stars if I could do that, is so good. Well, what are you waiting for? Get the game!
B0058VW36U|4.0|I've enjoyed this game ever since I got it as the free app of the day. It's one of the few apps that I would have been willing to pay for if I had not gotten it for free. It is a little annoying that they have now added a micro-transaction system for some of the tougher puzzles, but it only pops up when you fail consistently.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I play on my kindle fire... its been great. now its giving me an error message saying &quot; marmalade&quot; borders or something along those lines.  then crashes...I want my game back!
B0084IHVC0|4.0|I love old movies from more innocent times. I remember seeing this as a surprise visit to the downtown movie theatre on a Saturday afternoon when I was a little boy. Another Disney classic-- lovable characters and interesting relationships between them. The plot on this one is a bit silly in that 'the butler' wishes to send the cats away so he can get the inheritance left to him contingent on the cats living out thier lives. Of course, why would he care if the cats are around? He'll be there enjoying the material comforts of the wealthy benefactor while enjoying the simple duty of taking care of them. But hey, it's primarily for kids and for those of us who appreciate such light hearted entertainment. The voices were well chosen, Omalley the alley cat sounds like a very cool and street wise but trustworthy dude. The kittens are spirited and ready for adventure and of course Eva Gabor lends her exotic and sensual voice to the classy Duchess perfectly.
B0058SNNK8|5.0|First I tried the Jayna style in a size 6 as I read other reviews suggesting sizing down. They were too small so I gave them to my daughter and bought size 7, as I normally wear a 7 and they fit wonderfully. I would say if you have a normal size 7B/medium in other shoes, order a 7 in these. Its too bad, tho, that crocs don't come in half sizes for those who need one.<br /><br />Have always been put off by crocs as they looked like big sloppy wide clogs. Not so with this Jayna style. Having a narrow heel and wider ball, I was thrilled to find these crocs very stylish yet great fitting. The 3 holes in the comfortable rounded toe keep my feel fairly cool while the sling back holds the shoe on securely and doesn't rub. They are light as a feather and slip on and off easily but don't fall off when walking. They do seem to mold to your feet.<br /><br />I like the massage feel of the nubby foot bed which helps the circulation in my tired numb feet. They feel good even for all day wear. They look great with slacks, skirts, short and even pajamas. I get compliments wherever I go. People cannot believe they are Crocs.<br /><br />I like this Raspberry color, which is a deep bright pink, more than I anticipated. I have a couple of Spring and Summer outfits they match to a tee. The little flower on the side is a youthful touch, but you can take it off without damaging the shoe. Highly recommended.
B001E9641K|4.0|If you enjoy the standard Ticket to Ride, this will be a nice addition. The main difficulty is remembering all the Nordic names for the different cities. One of the tracks isn't quite balanced in the scoring mechanic, so it is a little more enjoyable with 3 people than with 2.
B00BESNKB8|1.0|We thought this was going to be just another action packed martial arts movie. The first 30 minutes had nothing but senseless gore and sexual depravity. I am no prude but this was just crossed the line for me.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Recorded sound quality is very good on this blu-ray. Video editing was very tastefully done with reasonable cuts from one camera view to the next. Several moments of zoomed in views of Mr. Page's hands skillfully at work on the guitar were greatly appreciated. I have absolutely loved Led Zeppelin since buying the fourth album in about 1975. But I sat down to watch this performance with 'realistic' expectations-- they have a lot of hard years of livin' behind them and I wasn't expecting finger strength and dexterity to hold up so well, nor Robert's vocals. Boy was I surprised! This performance was in my opinion superior to those captured on the video feature 'The Song Remains the Same'. For me, Robert Plant sang better here than I've ever heard him outside of their studio work. To qualify this, I believe the instruments were downtuned a full step to allow him to hit the 'higher' notes. But no matter... he sounded great and used very appropriate emotion and inflection for the very wide variety of styles represented here. John Paul Jones was dead on as usual on bass and contributed fantastic keyboard parts, especially on No Quarter which is one of my top 5 favorite Zeppelin songs. Bonzo's Lad, Jason is a second generation rock phenomenon and it occurred to me several times during this show that John would be very, VERY proud! My man Jimmy did not disapoint-- he delivered in spades on every song. I'm still amazed how well he held up to the evening's very full set-list. Standout songs to me on this show were Ramble On, No Quarter, For Your Life, Dazed and Confused, ('Since I've Been Loving You' (my all time favorite song--period was very good and Mr. Plant sang most excellently but I felt Jimmy's guitar parts were better on 'The Song Remains The Same' performance). The absolute hit of the entire show for me was Kashmir. It sent shivers down my spine. My least favorite Zeppelin song and probably the only one I could live without from their entire catalog is 'In My Time ofDying'. For me, this one drags out, as it does on the album. Honestly, this is the only Zeppelin song I don't like so evidently I am odd in that opinion since they chose to include it in this historic evening. If you like it on Physical Graffitti, you'll love it here. Outside of that every song was thrilling for me. The bonus DVD is worth watching one time. I may never view it again but I'm kinda glad it was there. I literally thank God in heaven for the fact that these four English gents got together and created the body of work that has brought me more excitement and happiness than any other band-- and for several decades now. The event captured on Celebration Day has now brought me something else to be genuinely grateful for with regard to Led Zeppelin! I am thrilled to have it in my music DVD/Blu-ray collection. We are fortunate they got together for this one marvelous night and now VERY fortunate to have the best seat in the house-- any time we want to sit down to see it again-- and again!
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Been playing this for weeks and weeks now and I'm still not bored. Some sever issues that can be irritating but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game. Good graphics as well. The only thing I would ask is that there be more boards to play. A must try if not for all a must have
B006PHD0RW|4.0|An enjoyable puzzle game. Definitely worth the sticker price, although I was fortunate enough to get it as a free app of the day. Periodic updates add more puzzles and it has a nice level of challenge.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|really like the game except for the fact that when looking for objects one usually is trapped behind the Icon an that's extremely disturbing.
B000006YCU|5.0|I've been a Dream Theater fan since the 80's before this debut album came out. I grew up on Long Island and took guitar lessons at a small music store in Commack where John Petrucci and Kevin Moore taught lessons before they were famous. Unfortunately I did not take lessons from either of them as I was 12 years old at the time and had no idea what they would become. I was lucky enough to buy this album originally on vinyl when it first came out and now I'm happy to have it on CD. I've listened to it over and over again and never get tired of it.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Set in 1986, 10 years since Batman (Voiced by Peter Weller) was last seen as Bruce Wayne retired from crime fighting, things have changed during the time. District Attorney Harvey Dent who was formerly Two-Face was fixed as he got released and Commissioner Gordon (David Shelby) turned 70 as he has one last week before retiring from the police force and Bruce is in his mid-50s as he's still built like a lion, but there's one problem in the form of a gang called The Mutants who are causing serious trouble for the city as they have done the worst crimes that happened in the city since The Joker. This boils Bruce's blood even with memories that trigger this as he decides to go back in style as his alter-ego known only as Batman as he is kicking all kinds of major Mutant butt around the city, this impresses a 14 year old girl named Carrie (Ariel Winter) who decides it's time for her to become his new Robin for he must try to take on the leader of the mutants with all the help he needs.<br /><br />A quite faithful to the first 2 issues adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking comic book mini-series and perhaps it with part 2 are the best animated Batman movies along with Under the Red Hood, Mask of the Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Sub-Zero. Very well made and animated effort that captures the spirit of Miller's classic story with great voice acting mainly by Weller whom Batman fans know as one of the original choices for Batman back in the late 80s as he finally gets the chance to play the character he always wanted to play. It leaves you wanting for more which gets even better with part 2.<br /><br />This blu-ray has superb quality crystal picture and quality sound too with nice extras that include a digital comic sample of Dark Knight Returns, 2 featurettes especially on how the graphic novel was influential, 2 bonus cartoons from Batman TAS and preview of part 2.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book made me so emotional. In the beginning you are sort of confused and mad at what's going on but when you get to the middle where all the craziness really happens, then you can't stop reading and you can't help but to fall even more in love with the Dean and his relationship with Sky. I would definitely recommend this book!

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  I'm not sure why it wasn't a bigger hit.  An awesome performance by Felicity Huffman!
0525952926|3.0|I find that the most compelling historical fiction are novels that once I've put them down I am not sure where the author's personal beliefs fit in. Not so with this Century trilogy of Ken Follett's. What I suspected in the first book was confirmed in spades now that I've finished the second.<br />Now that said, I understand different people read for different reasons and unlike many others I did not put the book down in disgust, while I have done so it is very rare. If you are reading for the specific purpose of understanding the various and complex reasons that brought Europe, and eventually the world to such a tragic crescendo this is not going to enlighten you. For many people this book really is \\"pure\\" fiction- while they have a basic knowledge that there was a World War, it was really bad, many people died and there were good guys and bad guys, they have no knowledge of the political and philosophical issues at play. Many people would not recognize the names of key places, players and/or events. If this novel stimulates any of those readers to dig deeper and attempt to gain a better understanding of these events then in my book THAT is a success!<br />I enjoyed the book, easy to read-better than watching tv and I would not dissuade anyone from reading it.<br />However, for me . . . I was disappointed with the extremely lopsided political views, anyone not knowing better will have a seriously skewed idea of who and what was really to blame. One particular aspect that troubles me is the rather shallow representation of how the German people arrived at the brink of World War.<br />This historical fiction teeters precariously at revisionist history. I'm afraid too many people will take the author's interpretation as absolute truth, apply it to current situations and feel confirmed in their rather narrow minded and simplistic view of the world.<br />Only the compelling become permanent residents in my library-this one goes back to the bookstore as credit on the next book.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I have downloaded the show and it is not able to play. Maybe my connection speed is too slow. Now i have paid and can't figure out how to let Amazon know. HELP!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the different translations and the 'note' option.  Very helpful when wanting to take notes while reading.  App runs great.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Arguably one of the best Christmas movies ever made.  Chevy Chase has created a holiday tradition with this hysterical 90-minute holiday favorite.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was another excellent book. It had lots of twist, excitement, a true love story. I would definitely recommend reading this series. Very well written.
B009ZQGNPQ|1.0|Series 3 was a huge disappointment to me for several reasons.  The stories did not flow as nicely as Series 1 and 2.  For instance, the storyline about Matthew's indecision about taking Reggie Swire's fortune was a total waste of time.  It added nothing to the series and it only served to show Mary's ugly side.  I also didn't understand why some of the characters' personalities changed.  For instance, Lord Grantham suddenly became an incompetent loser who couldn't seem to hold things together. Then we have two new footmen and Cousin Rose who were awful additions.  All of the stories involving the two footmen and Rose seemed to be written in a hurry and thrown in willy nilly and again did not add anything to the continuing saga of Downton Abbey.  And for all the hype about Shirley Maclaine being added to the cast and her interaction with Maggie Smith's character, that was a total bust.  Shirley Maclaine's acting was awful and her role was so small that she could have phoned it in.  The so-called \\"brilliant\\" exchanges with Maggie Smith never materialized.  And what happened to Cora?  They should have killed off her character when she had the Spanish flu because all she does is walk through the scenes with that silly smile and her head lowered.  The only time she showed any emotion was when Lady Sybil died.  Other than that she does nothing useful and surprisingly shows very little interest in Sybil's baby.  Not once did she hold the baby.  Branson is another character who underwent a huge personality change.  He became a robot.  He needs to ride off into the sunset with his daughter.  The deaths of two main characters did not bother me so much as the poor script.  It appears to me that Fellowes has gotten bored with Downton or maybe his mind has been too much on the American program he is making.  As I understand it, other writers will be making the future scripts and that's usually not a good thing.  I enjoyed the first two series of Downton Abbey immensely, but Series 3 has turned me off so much that I don't think I will be watching it in the future.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I love this book. This is now a book that I use to rate all the other books I've read. Unfortunately that sets the bar pretty high because this book is so amazing that I am having a hard time finding books that are just as amazing.<br /><br />I am looking for recommendations on similar books. Books that are not by Colleen Hoover (I have read Hopeless and I was thoroughly disappointed).
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is the album when John Mayer jumped the radio shark.  In my opinion, it was the beginning of the end for him.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can not say enough about this book.  I loved EVERY second of it and didn't want it to ever end.  I loved the book from start to finish and I was amazed at all the twists and turns in the story line.  What an unreal ride this book was.  I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book.  I have no clue who this Colleen Hoover is but I can tell you that I am definitely buying all of her books now.  This may have been one of the best books that I have ever read.  Honestly.  Great book, great author.  I LOVED it!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I don't want to waste a lot of time learning new applications. The Ebay app was easy to learn and to use. The sound effects are cute, and the updates really helped me keep in touch with how my auctions were doing without having to keep signing in. I would recommend it enthusiastically.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I have been searching for a book like Slammed for awhile now and I was hoping that Hopeless would be as amazing as Slammed. I mean it is by the same author, so I figured it would come close... Unfortunately it didn't. It turned out to be a waste of my time and it will possibly keep me from reading her future books (at least the ones that have nothing to do with Slammed). Now I am a fan of Law and Order SVU, so the subject matter didn't phase me much, but the romance and dialogue was horrible. Romance is not something that I look for in a book, but Slammed completely threw me off guard. It was AMAZING. Point of Retreat was a close second. GO READ SLAMMED BEFORE YOU READ THIS!!!<br /><br />If anyone reading this review is a fan of Slammed, PLEASE give me some recommendations of similar books.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1468161660 Slammed]]
B0000042MY|5.0|This is an awesome soundtrack from an awesome movie.  Even if you haven't seen the movie, if you listen to the soundtrack, you will be inspired to see the movie--that's how it worked for me!
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|I watched this entire documentary.<br />Twice.<br /><br />I found it incredibly engrossing and, as a digital film maker, was staggered by how much research, referencing, and time this took to put in a cohesive perspective.<br />It would've been daunting enough just concentrating on the Hollywood system and its history, but this finds relevance in global cinema.<br /><br />A couple of reviews for this series that I find laughable at least and embarrassing at best:<br /><br />\\"This is not a documentary of fact, but rather an opinion \\"...<br /><br />Uhm... yes, as all documentaries are subjective opinion. I suppose if you didn't pay attention to the first half hour of episode 1, you didn't pick up on the fact that a single editing point in any medium is a subjective decision. Nova, Frontline, CNN - Every single narrative constructed by people involves thousands of subjective choices in order to create that narrative.  The basic beauty of this series is that you are made aware of all of these works of cinema so that at the very least you could watch them and make your own decisions about what they mean to you.<br /><br />Which brings me to the second comment I keep seeing:<br /><br />\\"Why did they not get an actor to narrate and let Mark cousins narrate?\\"<br /><br />My immediate question to that question is, why must every narrator be British or American with a predominantly Midwestern accent (they call it stage-standard in the biz)? I think his tone and dialect fit perfectly and, for me, created it's own sense of poetry.<br />But I feel, that a bigger issue with some of the negative reviews is that this film, in its showcasing other cinema from around the world, bashed a bit of American Hollywood cinema. Especially the contemporary Hollywood stemming from the 80s.<br />And rightly so, considering when you look at the last Golden age of our own cinema, it was in the late 60's/70s, with director-driven pieces where producers provided money and kept quiet (Easy Rider, Taxi driver, The French connection) to let the directors do their thing...<br />As opposed to today's system, where producers without any film experience are holding money over a director's head, and calling narrative shots that they have no business calling, out of fear that the story isn't easy enough to digest for our massive demographic called \\"the middle.\\"<br />I suspect many people unaware of anything other than the Hollywood junk food, may find this alienating, boring, slightly offensive, or all of the above.<br /><br />Watch at the risk of learning something new and feeling something different about what, for many people, is it's own form of religion.i driver, The French connection) to let the directors do their thing...<br />As opposed to today's system, where producers without any film experience are holding money over a director's head, and calling narrative shots that they have no business calling, out of fear that the story isn't easy enough to digest for our massive demographic called \\"the middle.\\"<br />I suspect many people unaware of anything other than the Hollywood junk food, may find this alienating, boring, slightly offensive, or all of the above.<br /><br />Watch at the risk of learning something new and feeling something different about what, for many people, is it's own form of religion.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Bought this (thank goodness it was free) and uninstalled it in less than 5 minutes. Says free but not really as you have to buy stuff to continue playing. No idea if the game is any good as I played the intro and then couldn't do anything else until energy was restored. NO WAY I continue to play.
1449433251|5.0|I already own every Calvin and Hobbes book, but it's definitely nice to have a collection of every comic in a stylish set. There's an 18 page introduction by Bill Watterson and some bonus artwork through the books that make it worthwhile for diehard C&H fans. Even if you're not a diehard fan, but still would like to read the comics, buying the books individually would cost more than it would to buy the complete set on Amazon.<br /><br />My only complaint, which has nothing to do with the content of the books, is that it seems like my books were mishandled in production. Book 1, page 359 is folded and dirty, which also made page 358 dirty. Books 2 and 4 had some adhesive on the outside spine that I had to clean.<br /><br />Since I didn't buy them to keep on a shelf in hopes that someday they'll be worth millions, it doesn't bother me. I'm sure they'll get more abused than that by reading them over the years and when I pass them on to my daughter.<br /><br />I wanted to buy the hardcover set when they first debuted, but they were very expensive, heavy, and got bad reviews because the covers tended to fall off. The paperback versions are lighter, cheaper and seem to be put together well.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is an awesome story for pet-lovers, but not appropriate for children or softies.  It's based on a true story in Japan, which is of great historical value in the town where it took place.
0399160450|4.0|Not his best work. Some inconsistencies with earlier works. Too much of a right v left politics debate, which made the characters shallow. Seemed more like social commentary than the nuanced characters of the earlier works. (Yes this review is the same in a few books, because they have the same issues.)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Sorry, but it read like a high school girl's fantasy, or a soap opera.  The guy is always rich, the girl always beautiful, Cindrella as usual, with sex.  The ending was lacking.  I've heard it will be made into a comedy.  I can see that!
0738711500|5.0|The book is well written and comprehensive.  it gives a clear insight into any beginner who wishes to learn the Tarot Card. The deck is beautifully designed and visually great! I would recommend to any beginner or anyone who is interested in Tarot Card Reading!

B0089EHWQE|4.0|I purchased this book based solely on reviews.  It was a quick read that was very easy to get sucked into.  The characters are well developed and their relationships with each other are interesting.  I have to say that there were places that were hard to read just because of the pain that the characters were going through.  It was also uplifting to see how they could make the best of situations that seemed almost impossible.  I was absolutely drained by the time I got to the ending.  It was worth reading.  But, have the tissues handy!

B000002G7G|5.0|Most people get their initiation to the VU with the banana peel disc.  That is an amazing piece of work especially considering the time as there was nothing like that album.  I'm waiting for the man describes the scoring process perfectly and (amazingly) as a slick rock cut.<br /><br />This album, to me, is the best of the VU albums.  The sonic sound of What Goes On cannot be duplicated and should be played VERY LOUD. I think the suite in the middle beginning at Pale Blue Eyes and then ending with I'm Set Free is a very personal statement by Reed.  With the track I'm Set Free taking on a cathartic feel.<br /><br />Of course, all of their stuff was amazing but this one knocks me out and ranks up there in my all time top 10.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  I must tell you that the songs are stuck in my head!  Josh is an amazing singer!

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Got the series last week and have already seen both season 1 and 2.  I love the series and will be ordering Season 3.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys a good series.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|The remastered version of this film was amazing! I thought that they did a great job at the transferring, leaving  a remarkably vivid movie with rich detail and imagery. I thought tat the color contrast in this was remarkable as well as I have a DVD of this movie and this new Blu-Ray completely blows this out of the water. The sound quality was superior and I love cranking it in my surround sound system as it really makes the experience complete. I did not own the first blu-ray release of this, but from what I have heard the quality of this second release is far superior. All-in-all for any Terminator fan, this is definitely a must have for your home movie collection!<br /><br />* I received a copy of this for an honest review, but this did not effect what was written above*

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I've seen all of the recent Disney movies lately, and I have to say that this has to be in my top favorites that have come out in quite some time. I did not know what to expect when I first saw the movie but the mixture of former with serious material underlying the humor made the movie irresistible. For me as a father, there are so many messages that this movie provides its' viewers. I know that during and after the movie I was able to talk to my girls about some of the concepts in regards to friendship, bravery and what it means to be a hero. We also talked about who their heroes were and I was a bit surprised at who they mentioned. All and all this was a great addition to the Disney line of movies and it is one that I would highly recommend to any and all movie lovers.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and loved the humour.<br />The prime minister of Ireland has just apologised for all the dreadful happenings in the Magdalene laundries and this book gives us only a glimpse of the horror. These aspects gave a reality to the book.<br />The way the stories were intertwined was told well.<br />I was taken back to my home country with the brilliant Irish turns of phrase and descriptions of the people and their lives. I'm sorry I've finished reading it!

B0052REUW0|5.0|Even though I read this book at the beginning of 2013, I'm pretty sure I would list it as the best non-fiction book I will likely read this year.<br /><br />While I enjoy non-fiction, I have to say there aren't many books that can go on for this long and keep my attention, but Steven Pinker's \\"The Better Angels of Our Nature\\" is one every person should read.  He manages to make this subject if not always fun at least lively, and while every now and again it may suffer from a few too many graphs, they are always in defense of an argument.<br /><br />Pinker writes a well-balanced review of the history of violence and integrates it with the latest research on human behaviour and psychology.  I believe this book's most admirable quality is its constant challenging of the author's (and others') own assumptions regarding various theories of human violence, creating a far more convincing argument to its decline over the course of human history.<br /><br />Although likely one of the biggest drawbacks to recommending this book is that it is nearly 700 pages, I can't imagine how Pinker could be as thorough and do it in only 2 or 300.  Despite its length, I whole-heartedly recommend making the commitment to reading it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a book I could hardly put down. I know it jumped around somewhat, but I thought it was well written to get you to a very exciting and emotional ending.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban is one of my favorite singers; a vocal talent that compares to none!  The CD was priced right and great service.

B006Y9BVRM|3.0|(edit 3-9/2013)<br /><br />I've got an SSC017 and a few mechanical Seiko's.  I'm a Seiko fan.<br /><br />The watch I got was ok, but not great.<br /><br />First, the watch was \\"fulfilled by Amazon\\", but came in a very worn generic box, with a Seiko manual, but no warranty card.  It has a \\"store\\" warranty.  This is my major beef with buying any watch online.  You need to be totally careful, and I thought I was... but... a real box, the correct book (mine was Seiko but for a different non-solar model) and the warranty would have been nice.  I may send it back.<br /><br />As for the watch itself, it appears ok.  The band is terrible.  Too stiff.  Does not sit on the wrist well.<br /><br />I've got a Strapcode super engineer in all black on the way for this watch.  If decide to send the watch back, I'll order another like it, but from a more reputable source.<br /><br />(the edited part)<br /><br />I decided to keep it.<br /><br />More about the watch.  Grey market being what it is... sigh.<br /><br />The watch is wonderfully accurate.  Off by about -4 seconds in three weeks.  I like that.  Found a place on a window sill that that I can charge both the SSC021, and the SSC031 I've got.  The \\"031\\" is the Pepsi blue/red version of this same watch.  Its off by about -7 seconds, still well within expectations.<br /><br /> The Seiko rubber diver's strap is very stiff.  Thats, I tossed it.  Instead, I've got a StrapCode super engineer in black.  Very comfy, also very stylish.  The SSC021 is a mix of black and chrome, with a lot of black accents.  The black band compliments it, yet.. the super engineer bracelet (like a flat link Jubilee, sort of) has enough highlights from its many angles that it looks very nice.  I get a lot of questions and compliments on this watch.<br /><br />The black pushers, the black/yellow crown, and the black rimmed bezel all add to the effect.<br /><br />Here's the one problem I have -<br /><br />The watch will only time to one hour.  As a chronograph, that is not very good.  Some have stated that the hour hand does not \\"zero\\" and time.  Thats not my problem.  You can keep track of hours.<br /><br />The problem worse.  If any one actually used the watch they'd know this and complain.<br /><br />Here's what happens.  If you set the chronograph in motion.... the sweep second hand is moving, the minute timer is moving.... its ticking off minutes and seconds.  Then BAM - one hour elapsed and the watch's chronograph stops.  Thats it.  One hour.  No hours to keep track of.  Nada, nothing, zilch - it just stops when it hits 60 minutes.<br /><br />I like this watch.  It looks good.  Its accurate as you'd want it to be.  It appears to be rugged.  Its 200m rated.<br /><br />It just is far short of what a chronograph ought to be.  Thats ok.  Its on my wrist as I'm typing this.... its a keeper.
B006LSZECO|4.0|With all the hype that came with the book, I was somewhat disappointed, but I still enjoyed the book. It was not a book I could not put down for a while.
B00BESM14U|1.0|Completely unbelievable. A 13 year old kid saddled with emotional baggage that very few people have to handle, in fact, can handle. First is given a mickey of pot by way of brownies, (a felony) then later on is given LSD and just blows it off as if he would be lucid after such a encounter. The message of the movie is that drugs are harmless.<br /><br />I don't really care who smokes pot but do it after high school. My experience is that any kid that starts smoking pot in high school will never make the honor roll, probably won't graduate and in the end will not remember anything that he might have absorbed as knowledge.

B00AFEY354|5.0|I'm still incapable of watching this movie without puddling up.<br /><br />I'm still so incredibly impressed with the performances. Emma Watson (\\"Harry Potter's\\" Hermione) as Sam is just flawless. She is sweet and rawly emotional, connecting deeply and indelibly with her co-stars and her audience, and she is simply luminous. Charlie, the protagonist, falls in love with her on first sight, and nobody could possibly blame him. (And, just for the record, as someone who's been speaking American for 50 years, her American accent is inerrant.) All the reviewers talk about Ezra Miller as her step-brother Patrick, and he's truly amazing, funny, sweet, acerbic, on occasion sad and wounded, while never becoming a victim. But it's also a pretty showy role, and that gives a lot of opportunities for scene stealing. Miller rises to those opportunities, and he's clearly a star, but he's given a very big, very visible leg up from Stephen Chboskey's script.<br /><br />Logan Lerman as Charlie is, to me, the most impressive performance in a movie full of great performances. He really is the center of the movie, and his performance is all subtleties, muted colors and minor keys, and it is spot-on and stunning in its power. He's effortlessly funny at times (\\"It totally lied to me\\" is one of the most hilarious line-readings in history) and terribly, deeply needy at others, and so very broken and so very decent. It should be a career-making performance, but is so underplayed and subtle that I fear it's gone much unnoticed.<br /><br />Stephen Chbosky is truly to be congratulated. Writer of the 1991 novel, he adapted it into screenplay form himself, and directed from his own screenplay. You will never in your life see a movie adaptation of a novel that more truly brings the story's heart and soul to the screen. Chbosky's direction is sure and tough and unsentimental, and he's got Vonnegut's authorial gift of not sitting in judgment, without his authorial curse of deepest pessimism. Chbosky's world is one in which bad things are done by ultimately good people, and if everyone is hurting, they're also capable of reaching out to one another, and making connections. Where life is messy and choices are often poor, but ultimately, love sustains and redeems us. It's a good world, even with its tragedies, and one I'll visit again and again in the rest of the years of my life. I'm so glad he was able to share his world with me, and anyone else with the price of a movie ticket, a DVD, a Blu-Ray disc, a Netflix or Amazon rental.<br /><br />The DVD extras feature two commentary tracks. The best features Director Chbosky talking with much of his young cast: Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller, Mae Whitman, Johnny Simmons and Erin Wilhemli all join in on the commentary, although they're spread between locations in California, New York, and London, watching and chatting about the movie together through some sort of networked teleconferencing. They're all smart, witty, and funny, and they've bonded so much that, even spread across half the face of the planet, you'd think they were all gathered together in a single screening room. They're insightful about the movie, nostalgic about the experience of making it, and affectionate and playful toward one another, and they make you feel like you're sitting there with them, welcoming you, the viewer, into their \\"Island of Misfit Toys.\\"<br /><br />The second commentary track is just director Chbosky on his own, and while there are themes he revisits, both within this commentary (he's got an awful damn lot of \\"favorite scenes\\") and from his contribution to the cast commentary, it doesn't feel redundant or repetitive. Chbosky clearly loves the material, and, rather than seeming self-impressed, comes across as sort of stunned with gratitude that the he's been able to make the novel he published eleven years ago into a movie that does it justice, and carries the same compassion and strength. Chbosky is at great pains to creditboth his cast and the hundreds of behind-the-scenes crew who make the movie what it is. He talks about the contribution the sound mixer made to this scene, and the set designer made to that, the generosity of name actors and actresses who were able only to come for a day or two, and worked for scale. He's also always mindful that his audience is primarily young, an age in common with his characters, and he addresses this audience throughout his commentary, speaking with respect and affection about the ways issues in the movie may reflect the real lives of his young viewers, and assuring those with similar issues of those two all-important, universal truths: You are not alone, and It gets better.<br /><br />There are also missing scenes, most of which I'd like to see returned to the movie, and dailies, all entertaining on their own, all interesting when hearing Chbosky's commentaries, both of why various missing scenes or sequences were cut, and why he's chosen to share particular sets of dailies, and a nice featurette concentrating on the warm bonding experience the cast and crew experienced making the movie.<br /><br />I give this very human, very loving movie a full five stars, and my highest recommendation.
B003EYVXXW|3.0|It was interesting about the fall of the empire but I probably need to watch it again to be certain of licenses taken. Am not certain of the historical accuracy.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|A little slow in the beginning but they are trying to give background information. It was such a page turner and I couldn't stop reading. Recommended for anyone who likes a mystery and a little suspense. At the end of each chapter there's a cliffhanger that makes you want to keep reading.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have everything that Josh Groban has produced and although I really like this ablum, I wish he would showcase his incredible voice more as he did on &#34;Remember when it Rained&#34; and &#34;Oceano&#34;.  This cd beats &#34;Illuminations&#34; hands down and has some very memorable, more modern and upbeat songs.  No matter what Josh does though....he never disappoints with his unbeatable voice.  Does anyone out there know how to get &#34;The Right Place&#34; by Josh though?  I can find it on Youtube but can't find it anywhere to purchase it.

0765325950|4.0|I won't write a long review because many have done a good job describing the book in detail.  Overall I enjoyed the story and was happy that the 14 book journey had ended.  I think B. Sanderson is a good writer and that he was a nice choice to finish the series.  I really have little to complain about - I thought the first two books he wrote in anticipation of this culmination were excellent, but that he jammed in a bunch of story lines without proper context in A Memory of Light.  Culminations of personal story lines felt incomplete in many instances &#34;again IMHO&#34; but perhaps he was constrained by Jordan's notes.  Anyway, from a more global view I would recommend the series - I like the full body of work more than many reviewers including the harshly panned middle books which don't move the plot too much but were still well written and interesting.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A good time passer that can get addictive pretty fast.  It's a little annoying to have to post so much to Facebook in order to get more investment points, but the game is free and they need to make money somehow.  Other than that, it's. Sim City lite on my phone and you can't go wrong with that.

0307346617|4.0|It seems like Zombie books, movies, graphic novels have become for our times what UFOs were for the 1950s.  I have read various theories about this rise in popularity.  In our age, threats are far more subtle than a Soviet invasion: the shadowy world of Al-Qaeda, the threat of a pandemic, all these are reflected in stories of the undead.  They are the threat we don’t see until it is too late.  They are our extinction event.<br /><br />There may be other phenomenon at work.  Anxiety of overpopulation, xenophobia and mistrust of immigrants, as well as the old fashioned fear of death.  Death can be a concrete event, or an abstract fear.  In a blunt way, zombies are one instrument in trying to understand the uncertain boundary between life and death.<br /><br />This brings us to World War Z, Max Brooks novel of  zombie apocalypse.  In such an overworked genre, it is hard to believe that anything new or exciting could be done.  But Brooks provides and interesting and compelling account.  Part of the trick is his deft use of the oral history format, perfected by Studs Turkel.<br /><br />Brooks is very good at throwing on the guise of different voices, placing us in the experience of people retelling a history that never happened.  He never allows the fantasy of the zombie apocalypse to eclipse the very human drama of people trying to survive, and then to rebuild their world.<br /><br />Brook has done some good work here, combining genre elements we expect and deserve in a zombie story, with some excellent storytelling and insights of what it is to be human.

B006MW3VGA|2.0|I do not watch TV but caught season 1 on Amazon on a whim and was drawn in by the characters. I was surprised that I cared about how the character fared, in part because the development was believable and there were some characters that had a sense of honor that was refreshing and worth rooting for.<br /><br />2nd season was a disappointment.  The character development was not believable as some of the characters acted quite inconsistently with who they were in the first season without adequate explanation. The first season was more subtle and gentle/kind but the second season had jarring events and behavior thrown in just to get a reaction. The subtle depth and rhythm of the first season was rend apart by the 'cheap shots' taken in the script. It did not feel authentic.<br /><br />Quite dissapointed and won't bother with season 3.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|dear colleen,<br />i just want to say thank you again for your amazing work. i fell in love with slammed and point of retreat, but i am lost at words for hopeless... it was an incredible read, i had so many emotions running inside me. i could not believe how an amazing writer you are. you are incredibly talented and i wish you nothing but success! keep doing what you love because you truly are great at it. don't ever doubt yourself.<br /><br />this story was truly touching, it can relate to real life and i love how you described everything!<br />thank you again! truly a honour to have read this book. i look forward to holder's point of view and to many many more of your books.<br />thanks<br />gloria

B004I2K4DY|5.0|So I came across this on youtube maybe a year ago and added it to my playlist, which I'd then stick on repeat. Kept replaying this over and over. Les Miserables is one of my favorite musicals--even more so than Phantom of the Opera--and I will never grow tired of the music. IMO, no one (besides maybe Colm Wilkinson in the OLC recording) can quite pull off the same feelings as Alfie as Jean Valjean. I wish that he and Norm Lewis (Javert) were in the new movie, but that didn't happen, unfortunately. Norm Lewis has ruined the role of Javert for me--I don't think that anyone else would be able to do it as well as him--he and Alfie really start to get the feelings stirring and their voices are powerful.

B009EANE3M|4.0|Out of the 3 albums they've made, this one is my favorite. Glowing is a really sweet song; I like that they embrace their natural voices instead of trying to sound 'American'.
B009NUV0E8|3.0|Recently watched this after not seeing it since its premiere in 1995 and it is just plain ridiculous. I cant understand why so many people rated it so highly.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Great tunes to help get your sprits up when your down and become moved by the sounds of a band in its early stages.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|This is a timeless, great album.  I can't judge this versus the original recording because I can't remember that clearly that far back, but I think the MP3 version that I downloaded sounds just fine.  I converted the MP3 to WAV and it still sounds fine to me.  A classic that should be heard by everyone.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is one of his better novels.  It also came out just before the computer hacking by the Chinese army was discovered.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I liked this book because stuff started happening in the first chapter! I couldn't put it down, the real story is a total twist and the last half of the book was very unpredictable and you would never guess what the real story is. Good book.

B007REV4T8|4.0|Nowhere in the product description was it mentioned that I would receive a \\"Rental Exclusive\\" edition of the move.  What the heck is a Rental Exclusive?  When I played the DVD, I was unable to skip over the previews, use the menu button to get straight to the movie -- extremely annoying -- I had to use fast forward several times before I was 'allowed' to start the movie.<br /><br />BTW, I think the movie is terrific which is why I want a personal copy.  Certainly this is not the old \\"suspend disbelief\\" Bond where you just enjoy the shoot em ups and car chases and don't worry about the story making much sense.  But then if you'd seen the other two Daniel Craig Bond movies, you'd know that already.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|GREAT BOOK. COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, READ IT IN 2 1/2 DAYS AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SECOND BOOK TO BE RELEASED. I'VE READ MANY BOOKS BUT THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES NEXT TO JANE EYRE & THE 50 SHADES SET.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The game is awesome. The graphics are the most amazing thing yet on a mobile device. The campaign story is a little cheesy (a lot like many call of duty games) but the gameplay is awesome. The controls are very smooth and easy to use.
B004J2TPSI|3.0|Not the best. If you are just plugging this into a stationary computer or something, it may be useful to you. It has a decent range and decent quality, but sucks in an mp3 player. there is no way to keep it from moving around and getting static constantly. It is completely useless to me because of this. I think it has a small tab to hold it to an ipod, but I hated my ipod and returned it. I have a walkman and a zune hd. Cannot use with these. If you want bluetooth on a computer it may work for you, but I prefer a wired headset when at my computer.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story has it all. A must read. The author describes each scene with such passion, you imagine yourself in the situation. This book goes on my top ten list to recommend to friends. There is not much I can add to the other reviewers. This book will live with you for a long time.

B005RYF5JA|5.0|This DVD shows that the Celtic Woman has potential for many more years.<br />The have not stopped to surprice me.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read the book before watching the film.  The book was definitely much more thrilling and filled with so much imagery.  I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  That a teenaged boy survived 227 days at sea is absolutely amazing, but even more so that he did it with an adult Bengal tiger aboard his life raft makes me believe in God!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|badly acted, badly written, urgh just awful, could not even watch the whole thing. Crap, utterly crap. All the good reviews must be from 12 year olds or crack heads, cos this movie sucks.
B009P5S11G|1.0|Haven't listened to it yet, but my friend has the CD & says it's great. Will get to it soon. I like to listen on my way to work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great grafic game that lets you and your friends compete against each other like I play it with my friends and feel the competition even though I am not there.
B007N0REX6|4.0|I think I'm in the minority when I say that I far preferred the idea of the last album.  It was great hearing Slash play with so many different artists, and in particular the different styles.  I even liked the Miles Kennedy stuff the best.  But a review of this album almost comes down to a judgment of Miles and whether or not you like him.  And in my opinion he's great, in moderation.  There are definitely some great tracks on the album and Slash is amazing as always.  I gave it three stars right off the bat because Slash could roll out of bed and manage that much.  But I could only give Miles the one additional.  This is a solid album that should be in any hard rock collection.  But it ain't great.<br /><br />I am an Axl Rose fan in a huge way.  But my main concern isn't because of that fact.  I just think that Miles has a sound too close to Axl's.  Velvet Revolver worked so well because Scott Weiland had such a different sound and there never was a reason to compare the two.  But with Miles I hear enough similarity that I can't help but compare.  And it doesn't go in his favor...  It isn't his fault and I don't hold it against him.  But I don't think he's a good fit for Slash on a continuing basis.  It reminds me of Coverdale/Page.  There's nothing wrong with David Coverdale.  The man can rock.  But he is just too similar to Robert Plant for Jimmie Page to be playing with him and it only lasted one album.  I think the same applies here as well.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Innocent<br />This was a real intense book.<br />There were so many twist and turns, I could not even periodic THE outcome.
B008RYN44U|1.0|I really love it. Have been waiting a long time for No doubt & Gwen Stefeni to put out new music. I listen to it all the time in my car on the way to work.
B00846REIS|5.0|I like  this book very much so. I do wish though that the last book was already out. I hate waiting for them.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book can change lives if you're willing to put yourself on the back of that pickup truck and drive thru that tunnel. Remember in that moment I swear we were infinite!!!!!!
B000W93CHC|2.0|Pillars of the Earth with different names; very repetitive and predictable. I admire Ken Follet but Pillars of the Earth was where he should have stopped.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was just amazing! I would highly recommend this book to all of my friends. Its a great book altogether.
B0086700CM|5.0|My whole family fight over who gets to play!!! We are all addicted!!! All of my girls love to play this even my 2 year old!!
1616550414|1.0|The book itself is probably fine, but do NOT order it from Amazon if your shipments typically come through the Lexington, KY warehouse. I pre-ordered one of these as a gift for my brother in September. When it finally arrived, all the corners were severely compressed, and the bottom edge of the book was damaged, too. We initially thought it was because of poor protective packaging and contacted customer service who assured us a replacement would not have the same problem.<br /><br />The replacement was also damaged, except it was worse. The spine was also compressed on this one and had a huge buckle in it as a result. We tried getting several replacement copies through Amazon because none were available locally, and each one had substantial damage to the cover. This is not ok for something that is supposed to be a collector's item. Some of the similarities in the damage imply that it could have happened at the publisher, but Amazon should have rejected the shipment if that were true. All of the damage is readily visible through the plastic packaging. All of the boxes we received with this book were Very smoky, too, which is not our standard Amazon experience, so I'm not sure if their handling of this item is different/messed up or what.<br /><br />This may not be the best place to complain about the damage to the cover, as opposed to the contents of the book, but I'm hoping to save someone else some disappointment and hassle. I contacted customer service after each damaged cover, and no one really cared, and they certainly did not resolve the problem.
B0048LXHZM|5.0|Bought two of these from two different sellers in two different months.<br /><br />Received the product pictured and they both charged and worked like new.<br /><br />I don't know about the claims that this model number is better than previous versions but i am very pleased with this item.. works smoothly, charges fine, connects quickly, battery life is very good, controls are smooth, responsive and accurate.. prices have been below anywhere else i can find also, for original sony dualshock controllers.  Thanks amazon, and my 2 sellers.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|it is so fun I love how it looks.like super Mario but it is better please try it. it is awesome
B009NYF2ES|5.0|They really did a great job restoring this film. The special features, including the booklet are very nice but as it should be the film itself is the best part of this package. If you haven't seen it, or even if you have get this musical. That changed musicals. Highly recommended
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Okay, it's like any other twitter on any other contraption that uses apps.  Why is it that you have to explain in so many words?
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|got a good deal on it for being a new cd. shipped very fast, small package. exactly what i had expected.
B006QQ77F8|5.0|The plot was very risqu&eacute; for the time this film was made but the censors ban on so much explicit force the filmmakers to make it all implicit and there's a lot to be said for that. The film is truly a masterpiece on every level. Still very enjoyable and it really holds up after all these years. Highly recommend this film
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Does what it was meant to do.  It has not crashed or caused me to waste any more time than when I didn't have this time sucker.

B000JQWH24|5.0|Una pieza de colección. Encontré una muy buena oferta por una unidad de segunda mano de la época. Llegó en perfectas condiciones. Tanto la carpeta como el disco parecían nuevos.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Definitely the most entertaining show on television.  Excellent cast, great story lines, witty dialogue, and characters with depth.  I always have a laugh.  Each time I see an episode I find little nuances that I hadn't noticed before, such as the SWAT team, suited up, looking fierce, and riding in an elevator with Muzak playing The Girl from Ipanema in the background.  Enjoy!
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Thanks for the good 1-Rating reviews. They understand why the movie is bad. I also think that the movie is a shame. Look at the reviews at the german amazon (www.amazon.de). In germany we say that the movie is only for US-guys who don`t know how the war over our country really was. I know a lot of veterans (some US, some british and of course most german) and nothing in THIS movie is realistic.<br /><br />And one question left: WHY are the german soldiers always played like bad guys? Our fathers and grandfathers were fighting for our land, like every soldier. They werent good or bad. In Germany we say \\"ah its a hollywood movie. good action but no historic facts\\".
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this temple run. I stopped playing the first one because it got boring fast. Its seems this one is just full of surprises.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had not watched Downton Abby until this year (2013) but was glad to be able to backtrack and catch-up by watching seasons 1 and 2.  Very good entertainment and I look forward to season 4.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It's better than the last 3or 4 he has written, but like most of his later stuff, it falls apart at the end!
1589795474|4.0|The book emphasizes FRUGALITY. To live a better tomorrow, you must live a worse-off today. This is ultimately living below your means, and live below your means for a long period of time and eventually you will be living large.

B0086449YA|5.0|For those that have followed Mark Knopfler since his early days, this is yet another masterpiece.  It does not &#34;rock&#34; like Sultans of Swing.... but reflects the maturing soul of the greatest musician (my opinion).  I can listen to this 24/7.
0061992860|5.0|cool small book to read and learn some survial tips. dont just put in a camping bag or BOB. really read it
0007331819|5.0|The only fault I can find with this author is that he does not work fast enough to satisify the desire of his readers to finish the series.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I had fun killing time with this game. I was in a waiting room and this made time go quickly.
0765325950|4.0|Not exactly what I was expecting, but the story is done...or is it? I look toward to reading future works from Brandon Sanderson, including his Stormlight series.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|NOT only a great CD for my 2 daughters 4 & 6, but I like it as well. So far I haven't minded at all listening to it over & over in the car. Its nice too when we watch Austin & Ally, we recognize the songs now & it makes it more enjoyable.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I liked being able to buy just the Blu-Rays for a cheaper price than having to buy the DVD+BRay+Digtal copy set.

One of these days, trucks will stop showing up and lots of people who do not know how to garden and raise livestock and/or hunt/fish will starve. Indigenous people do NOT build damned dams!
B006RXPUR2|4.0|Good Movie, but a bit too different from the book for me.<br />In the books, Angie is a very independent and smart individual.. She seems more like eye candy in this film.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I got this as the free app of the day.  It is a an enjoyable game that is challenging,but not too hard.  It is appallingly different twist on the hidden picture genre of apps.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's not bad, just really slow. Also I was hoping it would be like the computer, whoever its set up more like a mobile app.<br />Other than that it works great.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|If you love this movie... do yourself a favor and get the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />More special features that aren't on the DVD (atleast not on mine!) and they are things that they SHOULD HAVE left in the movie and seeing them explains so much more to me!<br /><br /> I've always loved this movie but not the ending with young Allie and Noah. It's their story and it feels so unfinished! (I always say it should be like the &#34;Sweet Home Alabama&#34; ending with the Polaroids and other pictures at the ending credits...  it tells the next part of the story. I know they used the older actors of Allie and Noah's character pictures... but that's not Ryan & Rachel... whom you are attached to as Allie and Noah.)<br /><br /> Other than that... I loved having this as a better quality movie and it's just an awesome movie! Get it if you have a blu-ray and love this movie or movies like it!
B0030ZOYHC|1.0|Despite what the pictures show, you will NOT receive the item as it is displayed. It does NOT come in the nice and shiny cardboard packaging, instead coming in a very flimsy &#34;environmentally friendly&#34; case, and does NOT include the 20 page guide book that is even advertised on the case. Buy from somewhere else!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is my second sharpener from Smith's Abrasives and I will tell anyone who will listen to buy one.  I use it for my EDC knives and my kitchen knives, too.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This show is absolutely addictive!  It is, without a doubt, the very best drama I have watched on TV in decades... it is worth every penny and every moment of your time.  Maggie Smith is brilliant beyond words... could not watch them back-to-back as the characters are so richly drawn, I needed a little recovery time.  I stretched out the enjoyment and watched them over a period of a few weeks!<br /><br />INCREDIBLE!!!!
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I'm quite content with the newly remastered [[ASIN:B00AJER3SE The Terminator (Remastered) [Blu-ray]]].  Right away I noticed the superior quality in regards to the picture & audio.  Fine detail in closeups is very apparent, yet, the film grain is intact.  I definitely recommend this new edition compared to the sub-par original T1 blu-ray release from a few years ago.
B0063IH60K|4.0|For a free game, this solitaire is a good one. I enjoy the finish you can do or choose the game to do it itself.

B009JCL58G|5.0|It's music. You like it or you don't. The 30 second samples are representative. A good mix of themes from the movie, some better than others, but all better than random radio noise.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was slow in some parts, but overall a good read. If you liked the first two book in this series, it's a must read!
0307278255|3.0|Cut to the Chase:<br />This is a well-written, thoughtful collection of stories focusing on Bengali men and women, largely in the beginning of middle age, who are reflecting on their Indian parents, understanding the responsibilities of parenthood, as well as the full implications of immigration and separation, now that they are becoming parents, and adults, themselves. The tension of culture — generational misunderstandings, the choice to marry an American or adhere to tradition — is a delightfully constant backdrop.  Further, Lahiri has a compelling command over the English language, and every description feels precise and artful.  Yet these stories are ultimately not as compelling or memorable as those in other Lahiri works.  The collection is a quick and enjoyable read, but ultimately, I can’t help feeling that this collection should be celebrated as a technical accomplishment in writing rather than a truly artistic expression of plot and character.<br /><br />Greater Detail:<br />There are eight stories in total, though it feels in many ways like far fewer.  For one thing, the last three stories are connected and really function almost like a novella, detailing the adolescence and eventual relationship between Hema and Kaushik. Beyond that though, all of the characters in these stories have far more in common than not — they are similar in age and situation (though one takes place in Seattle and one is traveling, mostly they’re based in and around Boston), most of our main characters are Indian, beginning to have children, and have PhD (one dropped out of medical school, and one has two master’s instead of a PhD).  MIT, Harvard, Mass Ave are fairly common landmarks in most of the stories, and there are sprinklings of details that help immerse us into the Bengali world — spices and saris and of course, various cultural and familial expectations.  A few synopses:<br /><br />1. Unaccustomed Earth — a widowed father visits his daughter at her new home in Seattle.  Though she had been struggling with whether she should ask him to move in, so that she can take care of him, he has been relishing his freedom: retirement, traveling, and even a new companion.<br /><br />2. A Choice of Accommodations — a man and his wife leave their daughters with the in-laws in order to enjoy a romantic weekend getaway, all while attending the wedding of one of his old crushes.<br /><br />3. Hell-Heaven — probably my favorite in the collection, a now-grown woman reflecting on her family’s friendship with a Bengali man whose decisions to stay in America, marry an American, and chart his own course had unexpected, and previously undiscovered, effects on those around him (especially the narrator’s mother).<br /><br />Lahiri is a strong writer, her attention to detail and symbolism (a Van Eyck painting, safety pins attached to a sari, a lost bangle) and her carefully developed plots are to be applauded, and these are stories that will draw you in and make for a very pleasant afternoon.  Yet ultimately, I couldn’t help but feel that they were almost a little too similar, and the pacing made me feel, at times, almost lethargic.  It’s a strong collection from a talented writer, and there’s little that’s actually wrong with it — it just didn’t resonate with me as a reader, the way her works so often do.<br /><br />Other Things to Know:<br />This is Lahiri’s third work – her debut short story collection, The Interpreter of Maladies, is almost a force of a nature, and would be my top Lahiri recommendation, hands down.  If you’re going to read another, I would pick this collection, followed by her novel, The Namesake, which though it’s been adapted into a film and started promisingly, isn’t nearly as polished.me in Seattle.

B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Look Down and Stars were the best two visual pieces in the film, and those songs are hear to help you re-view them. Sasha Baron Cohen (innkeeper) wasn't as good as the Broadway versions I've heard.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I always read the reviews before purchasing an app.  They didn't steer me wrong.  I give Cubistry 5 Stars because I think it's the best match game out there.  It's unique feature is that you can swipe it and turn the cube in any direction.  This gives Cubistry a new spin above other games.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|There are plenty shows that I love and are completely brilliant, and I can't say I spend all my time around GOT. However, GOT is the best show I have ever seen. The level of quality this show maintains is spectacular.<br /><br />The writing and story: Inspired by George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Fire and Ice series,\\" GOT revolves around a very creative and captivating world. I have yet to read the series, so I can't speak directly for its staying true to the series. Although, from what I have heard, it stays true. I also know that the author is active in the show and has even written some of the episodes. My point being, its a creative bombshell of a show. But beyond creativity, the writing, the dialog itself is fantastic. The most disappointing thing a great creative show can do is have poor dialog. It needs to be compelling yet realistic, and this show does not fail at either. Creativity and good dialogue, that is one of the most important characteristic to a great show.<br /><br />And of course the acting: For a creative and well written script to be successfully it needs good casting and talented actors and actresses. The cast is fantastic. There are some known faces and some unknown. However, even the smallest of parts do their characters justice. And there are those that excel even more than most.<br /><br />Lastly, a show has to be visually stimulating. A good show needs good special effects and directing. GOT is filmed in various locations in Europe; I don't know exactly where. The locations engulf you into the world of GOT, and leave you begging for more.<br /><br />Now this is the second season, so I suppose I should talk about how has progressed. I thought it was just as good as the first season. In fact, I thought it was better, but that is mostly because I like the direction it is going becoming more magical. Of course its more than that. Its the politics mixed with a creative world of wonder that never ceases to amaze.<br /><br />Oh, and a quick word about the packaging. Naturally, the amazon packaging was efficient enough. The Blu-ray package is beautiful. The cardboard cover has an image of the iconic golden crown. It evens includes a level of texture to the embroidery of the crown, which is nice touch. I also think the image is a better representation of what the show is about than that of the first season. Of course that's just my opinion.<br /><br />SPOILER-SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST SEASON--The first season showed Eddard Stark. He was a major character, but I figured being represented on the cover made him pretty damn important therefore safe. Well, imagine my denial and shock upon his death. Of course, that just speaks to the shows compelling writing.<br /><br />Anyways, the crown shows the main conflict that this show revolves around.<br /><br />Now, as for the rest of the packaging, it was clean and seemed to be secure. The Blu-ray cardboard case did have a line along the spine like it was folded before it had even been opened. It was caused by the pocket where slips of info were stored which caused it to deform. It wasn't major but noticeable. Still not worth more than half a star on a 5 star scale.<br /><br />I also want to add how great a value this is. With a DVD, digital, and Ultraviolet copies in addition to the Blu-ray. At $30, its even cheaper than the DVD copy. it<br /><br />And here is a TIP to amazon buyers:<br />when you go to the website to get the digital copy, select amazon. It will then produce a code (different from slip provided) to which you go to Amazon and redeem it. Upon redemption, it does not give you the copy, it gives you the money value credit--the value of the HD Copy season. It can only be applied to GOT2, so go ahead and redeem it by just clicking the one click button. Now, Go back to the site that you got the Amazon code with and backspace back a few sites and select the iTunes option. It will send you to iTunes and prompt you for the code which isthe one on the original slip of paper. At which point it will process the entire digital season in HD.

It takes something as simple as retrieving rss feed info and obfuscates the process considerably.  Suggestion 1) if 80% of the options in your app's menu are beta features, just gather them and release a beta version, but leave a simple and clear to use app.  Suggestion 2) just load my feed topics when i open a feed.  This sync/download option never successfully completed for me.  Function more like Google Reader and you'd have more of my vote; simple and easy to use.

B004ZJZQ7O|5.0|A true story that at times is hard to watch (violence and killing ), but than the ugly truth of gangs, guns, drugs and power usually is. It's in the love it category like Goodfellas is. Good against Bad, Right against Wrong, and struggling with what to do; what is Right and Just or what is Wrong but so Profitable it can be hard for the best of men to stray.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's the best book I've read yet I'm trying to get into books like this but still best book ever
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The whole family loves this game. My 6 yo and I are competing against eachother, and now my 4 yo is also joining in on the fun :) Play it alone or with the kids, either way it is great fun. Enjoy! :)
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I have had an msn.com account since I got my first PC, I feel safe here so two thumbs up to outlook.com
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing<br />Simply a good book<br />Has an abrupt ending though<br />Needs another book in the series<br />Putin dies D:<br />One of the best books I've ever read
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great acting, great story , a pleasure. Received DVDs when promised . Ordered season 3 from here too.  Can't wait to be able to get season 4
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I think a lot about the stuff I buy, and that was the case with the new CPU of my new build. I read a lot of reviews, both for AMD and Intel and then I had to decide between a 2500k and a 3570k.<br />Ultimately, a choose this one, and I'm more than happy with my decision. This is an amazing processor, I should note however, that my old computer had an old Athlon X2 4000+, so you can understand why I see so much difference.<br />This was my first build ever, so I also read about memory compatibility, OC, chipsets, temperatures, benchmarks. Learnt a lot. I'm not overclocking at all so I choose the 3570k, even when according to what I read, it does no have the same overcloking capabilities as the 2500k. In fact I would have chosen the 3570, but it was like 10 bucks more expensive, and you never know when you're going to change your mind.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'm very happy with my purchase, everything works great. For example, with my old computer, the old processor and a Gygabyte Radeon Hd 5670 1gb, I played Bad Company 2 on low settings at abou 25 frames per second, at 1440x900,<br />now, using the same card, I get about 45 oh high settings, excluding hbao, which lowers about 10 fps. So a nice processor can help a lot in games. Starcraft 2 runs on medium settings at about 65 on campaing. Video encoding runs nocticeable much faster however I can' give exact numbers. For gaming though I can assure is excelent.<br /><br />However, it does run a little hot, hotter than for example the 2500k, no too much tough. Of course you gotta make sure is properly installed. The stock fan comes with an easy to install mechanism, but the installation manual is useless, so you can make a mistake if you're new at this, like me. The black pins of the stock fan have to be completely in, in fact you have to hear a click sound and check the back of the mobo to be sure is ok. Look for images.<br />I din't install it properly, it was a little lose, so I was getting temperatures of about 85º C on full load, with some reading I realized this was simply too much for a non-overclocked CPU, so I checked the installation, fixed the issue and staring getting temps of about 70º C on full loads. However I was using a old, cheap generic case, with only one side fan on exhaust (though it was the same on intake). So I bought a Cooler Master 430 Black Elite, and just by using a front intake and a rear exhaust I get about 61º C on full load.<br /><br />Just read a little if you're new, to make sure you do everything ok, although it's not hard.<br /><br />Setup:<br />CPU: Core i5 3570k<br />Mobo: ASUS P8H77-M/CSM (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007QXLVQ6)<br />RAM: Kingston HyperX 8 GB (2x4 GB Modules) (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037TO5C0)<br />Video Card: GIGABYTE ATI Radeon HD5670 1 GB<br />Case: Cooler Master 430 Black Elite<br />HDD: Old Western Digital of 160gb, XD gotta replace it.<br />PSU: 800 wats.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This has got to be the worst hidden object game. Its starts out fun. But eventually you hate the fact that one room you visit, becomes unavailable till you spend money to get rid of these stupid ghosts or whatever.  Than eventually your friends list starts to say bad connection,  you cant send or receive. never download unless you have money,  or patience!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Such a great story!  There was a point I thought there would be the classic Disney ending, but thankfully it was a &#34;new&#34; Disney ending (happily ever after) I am so glad I purchased this and have already watched it numerous times!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book because there is adventure,romance,drama, and finally death. I hate that it ends fast because I want to read the next book I am dying to read it. It is just like the movie but the movie has more detail than the book. My friend recommended this book to me and I loved it VERY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMJG|5.0|A very bittersweet movie.  Quirky, for sure.  Not positive its a great date movie, it may be a little too sad for that.  Very relateable story and worth watching.
B0041KVX1A|5.0|As i told you in my \\"Please Please Me\\" review, \\"A Hard Days Night\\" sounds very good, the back cover is great!, very clear pics, and the sound is wonderful, i have a very very good turntable , amplifier, and oil speakers and when i started to listen the first accord!!!, it blows my mind!!!, my fav definitely is \\"IF I FELL\\", the guitars sound so clear, the voices, drums, bass, very good to me...<br /><br />I dont know why some copies have errors, mistakes, pops and other things.<br /><br />Still lucky :)
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|After reading the books, and veiwing the Danish movies, I wanted to make sure I had this DVD in my collection as well.  I have watched it several times already, and am sure I will watch it again.
B00004W510|3.0|The whole is truly greater than the sum of the parts; there is no one element that rises to greatness.  But these guys made music that still resonates with a place in my past, and that makes me glad I own the album.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great clock/alarm for my Kindle Fire. It is very appealing to the eye, simple to use, and wakes me up in a snap. Long gone are the days of using my cell phone as my alarm.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My ten year old son (5th grade) read this book and LOVED it!  &#34;It's 5 stars because it was funny, entertaining, and very well written.  The author's descriptive writing was really good, and the story was really awesome.  I loved it.&#34;  There you go!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this game was great to keep me wanting to play till it was over and not want to put it down. I feel it was well worth the minimal fee to get the full version. loved it
B0066WJLU6|4.0|fun to be able to pick the Color.  has auto-off option so you don't waste the battery. works great on my kindle fire.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I was never able to find all three movies on TV to watch them all the way though. This collection was perfect for that. I took a weekend and watched all three films. Loved them all.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Fun and interesting read.<br /><br />The memory techniques used are well discribed and are embedded in an fun story, that makes you want to read further.
B009186JYI|5.0|This is a terrific documentary for RS fans.<br />I watched it with my 24 year old daughter and she loved it too.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Why Nations Fail is an excellent read. Not only gives he a good account of present and past civilisations and peoples, but also provokes thought about where our own wealth originates from and why it might be endangered.<br /><br />Daron Acemoglu analyzes why certain civilizations prosper and other don't. He makes the differentiation between inclusive societies and extractive ones.<br />Extractive societies are ruled by a small elite, that extract wealth from the rest. Even though those societies might bring economic growth for a while, it is never sustainable, because the elite has no incentives for innovation an creative destruction.<br /><br />Sustainable economic growth can only be generated by inclusive societies, that have reliable legal institutions, enforce propety rights and ensure upward mobility. A trait western cultures had since the industrial revolution until today.<br /><br />Acemoglu has countless examples of societies, where inclusive instituions were the groundwork for rapid economic growth, but were later undone by elites to reconstruct extractive societies instead.<br /><br />This read makes me savor the civil rights and freedoms we enjoy today, but also raises awarenes for their fragility.
B000Z66RSS|5.0|good cd to workout to. i like 10 of the 15 songs<br />so that is pretty good for a cd
1454901276|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I did not know what to expect when I started reading this, other than that the jacket description looked interesting.  I am so glad it did.  The mystery itself was awesome, but the back story was superlative.  And, unlike in alot of other otherwise top notch books I have read recently, the ending was excellent as well.  Needless to say I was thrilled when I heard that this was the first of a trilogy, and saw that the other two are in fact available (already purchased them and can't wait for delivery).  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, then prepare to be absolutely enthralled.
B00338QENI|5.0|I find this book to be very well written and researched. It is factual yet it reads like an exciting mystery. The author presents the information objectively but has compassion and understanding.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This game has a lot of fetures that you would expect in games made only a few years ago! Even though they are in the twelves or fourteens, it is an amazing game with O.K. graphics that allows you to see one of the first games of the final fantasy series, on your Kindle Fire, Kindle fire HD, and some of your android devices! I won't give out spoilers though!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Mojang still hasn't made 7.2 on kindle!! It's been about a month since it came out on ops and Google play please put on kindle. If any of you knew about this update, it is final beta version for realms which means you will be able to play on realms. Please just make 7.2 already... I'm tired of waiting!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I haven't gotten this app but by the looks of it it looks like it copied temple run. ill still get this app but please answer my question

B0083Z614S|5.0|This is the most beautiful book I've ever read! I recently read Heart of Darkness, and this is the exact opposite. So uplifting!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is great and really people, it's not that much space only 810 MB. It is kind of laggy and should be fixed. It should also have multiplayer like GTA. Other than that it is a very good game I recommend it!
B009VB97EY|4.0|The movie was ok.but the fine ass men in it made up for it!!!!!!! Channing tatum is sexy as helll
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|It is awesome and you should read all the books which are awesome I have all the books and I read them all get this book
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|i love sPartacus.and the  &#34;Man sceanery&#34; is  very nice! It is a great series. Im gonna be so sad when its over :(
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is an easy read and a bit redundant. The e-mail correspondence was entertaining at first and cute.  I put it down for a week or 2 and then finished the book. Did not hold my interest enough to finish reading in a few days.. I would look for this book at the flea market in the future and save the $10.<br /><br />I like using KINDLE and the book was visually easy on the eyes. My eyes did not tire from reading, a good thing. I am sure I will continue to purchase more books and videos in the future.
145210655X|5.0|My 3 year old and I love Star Wars! So I bought this book to spend more time together. It is indeed fun to read! My boy loves the cartoons and I like the jokes.<br />My coworkers loved it too, I would say it makes a great addition to anyone l
0765325950|5.0|Just what was expected of the final book of the greatest fantasy saga.<br />A great ending for an awesome series of books.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great app. I use it every morning to wake me up. This app can set multiple alarms. I recommend usage.
B003UYUP58|5.0|We all have been affected by cancer. Whether from a family member or a friend, every time we hear about someone affected by the illness, many question follow. This book have clear answers and explain the complex illness in simple terms.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|When I first looked at the screen shots I thought the game looked too easy, and yet for some reason I was intrigued.  So when I could get it free I downloaded it.  I love this game!  It's simple enough to be relaxing and difficult enough to be fun.  Thank you so much!
0061537934|5.0|Everyone loves this book. Suspend your view of reality for a bit, believe that a book can be written from a dog's point of view.  Then let yourself be taken in by the lovely Enzo. He tells the story no one else could have told.
B0099114WO|5.0|make a bowl of popcorn, snuggle up with your sweetie, and enjoy a great movie night -<br /><br />you will not be sorry!
0425263916|5.0|At times I tired of the back and forth between gorgeous beautiful love and passionate fighting between Eva and Gideon, but I couldn't put it down.  Hot and steamy, but deeply tragic, I love this series and can't wait for the conclusion.  Bravo!
B000E1JOSE|5.0|this was a purchase for my partner, to replace a damaged cd.<br /><br />this is one of his favorites, and a great selection.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I have been wanting to get a few of my favorites on DVD so I can enjoy them whenever I want.  This was a great purchase and shipped very fast.  Pleasent experience.
B0041KVZ18|4.0|These reissues are great but I found a little problem with this one. Sound is somewhat lacking but overall still a great product.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Another amazing book in this series! I can't wait to start the next one! I kept saying, \\"I can't believe this is happening,\\" this is a real page turner.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I gave it to my niece who is headed to Africa and needs good entertainment! She was very happy to get it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome and super addictive<br />Lol play it all the time<br />Get this!!<br />Plus it's free so get it
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Try it you will like it. My daughters made me try this game. You must plan where to put the coins so you can get the more coins and prizes and eventually go up in levels. Even though you do the same things over and over again you never want to stop.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I read this book once every few years. A very rare book that reads like a perfect seven course meal. When you are done it was in all a wonderful feast and your heart, like the star's, is perfectly content.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Very personal sound and melodies, I bought this album after having discovered the XX with their second album. Both are excellent as each other: it sounds like 2 opus of one master piece.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Ellie Goulding has a wonderful voice. Her lyrics are also very good. I love almost every song on her mp3 collection. she is really that amazing. My husband even likes her music too, and he and i do not always see eye to eye on music.But her voice is just so sultry. I recommend to just download one of her songs, then you will probably know if she is right for you or not, but i bet you will be sold. She's just frosting on the chocolate cake, she is just that groovy.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Very happy with purchse.  Album is amazing as expected and then some.  Adore thier cover of The Boxer - voices of angels!!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Some people seem to forget that the whole series is based on a silly premise-- it is greatly entertaining if don't worry about plot or dialogue.  Why would you worry about plot for a movie like this?  Just kick back and enjoy watching the special effects, and the stunts, and Milla.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Good story. Maybe geared for a little younger than my age group, but good. Reminds us that some people just &#34;click&#34; the right way... that there is someone out there made for just you!
B00BECZPI0|5.0|the suspense is amazing in this show it makes you wonder and get chills... i will watch every episode that comes out. my favorite show EVER!!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Almost didn't't continue the series after reading the first book but glad I did as liked this one much better than the first book!  Unusual since it is typically the opposite when I read a series...nice job to the authors!
B0000DZEE3|5.0|The best of the RHCP! Beautiful energetic outdoor concert concert. Once you put the Dvd on you can't take your eyes off it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|wasting time is so much fun. Now that this game is on my kindle there is no escape. Have fun!
B000002JSN|5.0|This cd is the best of Led Zeppelin. Really enjoyable. If you are into Led Zeppelin you will love this one!
B000002UWF|5.0|lots of songs including a few great live tracks that showcase how great his band really was.  Nearly every song swing hard as hell but you can also get an example of the interplay between Louis and Keely Smith during a live show that is great fun to listen to and image your in Vegas during the mob years.
1401307450|5.0|Once you pick this book up you won't be able to put it down. Very interesting sincere factual book. An easy read.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Shrieks just John Bhutto high high has here high high here here high has has high cuff video can can contact can cream charged vCard gmail vCard cheese can free
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Swiftkey 4 is now live but amazon once  again doesn't update it. Why be an app store if your not gonna update your apps
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is great.  At first it feels very slow, but then you get sucked into these people's lives.  We found ourselves not getting anything done because we just had to watch the next one!!  I highly recommend it and have spread the word.  I hope they continue it.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Such a feeling to be finished reading it but want more. I wish I could pull more thoughts from her.
B0055OK2T0|3.0|Spoiler Alert<br />I had no idea that the movie had a &#34;spiritual&#34; leaning.  I dont usually choose movies that contradict Bible teaching.  I chose to view this as fantasy rather that possibility.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be.  I would honestly like it to continue as a weekly tv series.  It is a good movie.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Sometimes a movie with older actors will not attract younger viewers.  This movie was fun, regardless of a persons age.  If you love foreign films and movies with a nice story line, you will love this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like subway surfers I started playing it a few months ago and now I'm playing it during my free time its a fun game that kids and adults can play
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I think you have to have been married for a while to completely appreciate this movie.  But you do not have to be near the age of the actors.  My husband and I loved this movie equally.  Definately watch it!
031606792X|5.0|My daughter Loved the Twilight Series and read them all after the movies came out and sometimes before depending on the timing- Amazon usually has the best prices and shipping options
1439190275|5.0|As I said about the Atkins Shopping Guide, I also am saying about The New Atkins For A New You.  My family Doctor highly recommened this book. I'm a work in progress, so wish me luck.
0547884591|5.0|I doubt if I will buy it for myself BUT its a GREAT Read! I like the part about how to skin a deer or a rabbit on a spit...and survival stuff that may come in handy someday...and how to cook with up front instructions and helpful hints that most people have to 'learn the hard way' because their instructors didn't bother to 'mention' how or why
0446573019|5.0|Enjoyed David Baldacci's new character; reads well; looking forward to more in this series; good price value through Amazon.com and affiliates.
1594744769|5.0|We like the WIERD - and this might be it for a twisted tale using old photos of children and family members
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is one of the best book I've read in a very long time!! I wish this author would write many more!
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|Not a guy flick, but funny enough.  You'll enjoy a few laughs relating to pregnancy and the jokes they use.
B0088X7YMS|1.0|I did not realize this DVD was an animation. I don’t like real life cartoons because I have a hard time taking them seriously.
B007N8RULO|4.0|IT'S WINTER.  STOP CABIN FEVER AND KEEP YOUR SANITY.  PLAY THIS VERSION OF SPIDER SOLITARE.  KEEPS YOU ENTERTAINED FOR HOURS. A PROCRASTINATORS PARADISE!
B000FIMG68|5.0|I first watched Lost from the very beginning, when it first aired on ABC. I was hooked, especially as the show went farther and the second season is just as good as the first. I fell away from watching Lost as it progressed into the third season, it gets confusing if you miss an episode or two or just don't pay attention. But about a year ago, with all the seasons on DVD, I was finally able to re-watch what I had already seen and discover the rest. I'm so glad I did, I had forgotten how good this show really is, I will always be a \\"Lostie.\\"
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Recommended by a few friends;  first episode or two started slowly (in retrospect, like many good books).  But once the characters were developed, it took off!  I'm so glad that I discovered Downton just recently, because I access all the old series NOW via Amazon Prime.  I recently read that soon, Amazon Prime will be the sole resource for Downton Abbey episodes after they air on PBS.  Can't remember when I enjoyed TV so much!
0007466064|5.0|There is really no words that need to be added in praise of George R.R. Martin  series Game of Thrones, it should be read and enjoyed and this seller was awesome~
B006BG7RI0|5.0|One of my all time favorite films. This film has it all, drama, melodrama, comedy, political intrigue and even a few musical numbers. Bogart and Bergman have incredible chemistry and their performances draw you into the story like few other actors can. Casablanca has one of the greatest love stories ever told. Sometimes loving someone so much means having to let go.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this one. LOVE Colleen Hoover and was not disappointed with Hopeless. I like it when a book keeps me on my toes and was not disappointed...for once I didn't see a few of the twists and turns coming.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|As a 25-year-old who occasionally dabbles in reading YA for exceptional novels such as [[ASIN:B00877R85I The Hunger Games]] or Harry Potter ([[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]]) books, and who loves anything Cinderella, especially [[ASIN:0060558865 Ella Enchanted]], I was definitely hooked from the beginning.<br /><br />The plot moved pretty quickly and was a bit obvious, and yet I wanted to see what happened and I definitely wanted Cinder and her prince to get together. I felt that I wasn't as attached to some of the characters as I should have been, and when something bad happened I wasn't nearly as upset as I should have been. As soon as I finished Cinder, I picked up the sequel, Scarlet, and promptly devoured it. I am devastated that we have to wait until 2014 for the next book.<br /><br />Follow up on what other books I love at [...]
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Its wonderful to hear someone putting a great beat to actual issues that people face in life. Not hearing them complain about things that most people will ever reach or face is sure uplifting
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|At first I kind of hated the main character, Margaret Lea, because she was quiet and mousy and just sat around and read books, but I think you're supposed to. Margaret works at her father's bookstore, mostly reading, until she gets chosen by the reclusive, best selling author Vida Winters to pen her biography.<br /><br />Vida Winters is known not only for her incredible novels, but for her eccentric interviews where she blatantly lies, using passed-over characters and subplots in lieu of the truth.<br /><br />The real story is, of course, the biography, which at times becomes so fantastical you wonder if its fiction after all. What begins as a slow, quiet novel about a shy, quiet girl morphs into an enticing mystery.<br /><br />What happened to the other twin? The answer is so delicious you forget how bored you were for the first few chapters.
B0080SE0UA|4.0|not a bad showing from the cult. these songs mean something. have been into them since the southern death cult days. some of these songs are great! all are strong and show just what a solid album should be. they have spent allot of years refining their sound and it shows. they rock just as hard as always. very impressive in this day of &#34;phoning it in&#34; ( Performing an act in a perfunctory, uncommitted fashion) then letting the producer &#34;massage it&#34; in the studio and let's take this puppy out on the road and see just how bad we can suck music scene.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|For a very 'cute' movie, this may seem a bit shallow.  But it is actually very interesting.  Penelope was born with a curse.  People think she looks completely hideous.  On film, she doesn't look bad.  But they portray society's reaction to her in a very clever way.  A fun movie with an opportunity to learn a few things about those who may appear different to some undefined standard of a rather fickle society.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The most fun you will have. I saw one of my friends playing it. Sh.e let me tried the. I was hooked. In Addison its free
B002ZG97EC|5.0|We absolutely love Despicable Me and enjoy watching it as a family over and over.  It's even reached the 'quote' status in our home.  Innovative and hilarious!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|cute! my 6 yr old daughter and I play it together. hasn't been glitchy or anything either. great for girls.
B001B6PBBK|5.0|If you lo d Brittany Murphy you will adore her once again in this movie that will make it to the top of your &#34;go to, lets watch it again cuz I love it so much movie list.&#34;
B000JML7EC|5.0|I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie. Besides a good classic is hard to pass up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again. Great story. Funny and serious at times but still a love story. Can't wait to see it in the theatre.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie. Besides a good classic is hard to pass up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow I have no words that can thoroughly express the amazing, and mind blowing emotional and  mental ride I just experienced. This book is great for anyone who loves, love and life stories.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie. Besides a good classic is hard to pass up.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|This is good game to just sit and waste time with.  Not a brain user but fun it is fun to play
B002RKS81O|5.0|I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie. Besides a good classic is hard to pass up.
B0055SWM08|2.0|If you enjoy simple easy games to play then this is good for you.  I enjoy games that make me use my brain and this isn't one of those to me.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Its hard to believe a mission of this complexity in a hostile environment could have been organized and carried out in such a short time, but the movie convinces you it happened. I liked the straight forward role played by Afflect without the insertion of some superhuman exploits in the process. To me, that gave the story more creditability.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Being a Vet from OIF, I related to his thoughts and experiences to some degree. This book explains the challenges for a military family during a war. Mr. Kyle explain all his thoughts and experiences from day one to give you an experience like you were him going through this.
B00846F1YW|2.0|This game is really nice but I got stuck on chapter nine, I was not able to uncover the last object.  I am very disappointed.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I play several times in a row and still can't get enough of it.  I like games that are different than the many variations of angry birds and bejeweled and this is a great one.
0316017930|3.0|I honestly have not finished this book. I just could not get into it. The concepts are interesting enough but if you are looking for a read with some sort of story line this definitely is not the book. When I have more time on my hands i will give it another go. however, there is no rush to do so.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A fun game about horses and you get to feed them and take care if them like a real live horse
B003DT19F0|5.0|He makes the characters so adorable.  The artwork as is always fantastic.  I am glad they made these movies for little girls.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It very informational for all immigrants who starting to learn English.<br />When I first came to America I was very nervous I didn't know English then one day I found a dictionary that dictionary was Oxford Dictionary of English.
034580404X|5.0|Came within a couple days quicker than I expected.<br />They're in excellent condition, I love them. That's why I rated it a 5 star.<br />Good deal for all three books as well.<br /><br />Thanks!.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|Wrong casting, bad acting and just trash. Do not spend the time or money on it! My biggest mistake ever to buy this blu-ray!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I found this book very moving and thought provoking. The different views on euthanesia and how it touches the lives of all people, not just the person suffering. Loved it.
0671449028|3.0|Bought this book for my three year old hoping it had a creative way to get my son off to bed! In that sense the book did not serve my purpose, it did not make it &#34;fun&#34; to go to bed.  However, it is a well illustrated book, simple to read and short.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Yes, this crippled and disabled man hires a sex surrogate therapist to help him experience feelings he has never been able to have before due to physical limitations, but this is not dirty at all, in spite of some nudity and very frank talk about positions and organs.  This is really a very sweet story of a woman who helps a man who is in great need.  Hawkes and Hunt do a fantastic job; Hawkes should have been nominated.
B003X73QA8|5.0|Almost everyone song is really good. I might say this is the best arcade fire album yet, but each one is good and has its own flavor
B004VD3YIM|2.0|A year ago, this app was great. Worked on Android phones and Kindle Fires alike. Loved the controls, features, and performance of it. You can backup your data, share it, and even send screenshots from the camera. Really cool stuff.<br /><br />At some point in the last year, however, an update came out that rendered the app useless on the Kindle Fire. It opens, loads live view, then proceeds to freeze - and when I say freeze - the whole device locks up, requiring a hard reset.<br /><br />I've now tried this on 2 Fires - one which is rooted and running a fresh Jelly Bean ROM - so its not the Kindle OS. Something with this app does not jive with the hardware, and now I'm out $4. Very, very irritating.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Some people make jokes about this album sounding just like their previous album and maybe that's true in some ways. I happen to disagree, but when you craft an unique sound its easy for people to think your songs sound similar. They can only compare them to each other. My only beef with Mumford and Sons is their sometimes ambiguous lyrics. Sometimes they are so ambiguous they lose power and meaning. Other than that I think there are enough solid songs on this album to give it five stars. I Will Wait, Babel, Lover's Eyes, are my favorite. Also I really like the song boxer that is included in the deluxe edition. Check the album out, its worth your money.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|Like all Child's books, another fantastic story which keeps you guessing! I am always amazed that each story is so different from the last.
0470901071|5.0|I scored a 907 today passing my exam.<br /><br />I have taken CCNA 1-4 at school about 2 years ago so this was more just to collect my thoughts. May or may not have been quite as easy but this book will really prepare you to take it minus maybe just a few very fine details. Only thing I didn't like was WAN chapter. Other than that, perfect. I Don't really find Cisco material that hard to begin with either as side note. I did really master the material as well to the point where I could probably teach this stuff as I took very detailed notes every chapter of book<br /><br />P.S. Todd, I think Sybex has a CCNP guide published, but you should author 3 books for the CCNP R&S tests and maybe CCNA Security/Voice (I saw you had these certs). I would buy them in a heartbeat as this book really prepared me for my 802 exam. Thanks Again
0307352153|5.0|I like empirical data, so one of my favorite parts of \\"Quiet\\" is the insights researchers and analysts provided that can help introverts take advantage of their unique traits and characteristics.<br /><br />As an introvert with an extrovert's job I know that there are times when I am jealous of my charismatic woo-filled colleagues.<br /><br />On the other hand, \\"Quiet\\" helps remind people like me that we can thrive on our own terms, in our own way, in an extrovert-affirming world.<br /><br />Can helps her readers to appreciate that attributes common to introverts (and extroverts) are assets in different settings. Cain advises introverts to recognize and embrace our own \\"sweet spot.\\"<br /><br />I appreciated how Susan Cain, like Brene Brown, helped make research engaging.<br />- Bios brought energy and insight<br />- Significant research was brought to light<br /><br />From the start - the self-quiz which helps readers identify their own degree of introversion or extroversion - to the finish - practical advice on how introverts can comfortably act more like extroverts when they need to; and how parents and teachers can relate to introverted children and help them feel safe, cared for, and understood in an extrovert world - this is an interesting book.<br /><br />I have two minor complaints about the book:<br /><br />First, too often Cain refers to introverts as \\"quiet\\":<br />- I express my opinion in public and private settings<br />- I actively participate in group discussions<br />- And, public speaking is a significant part of my job<br /><br />And second, while this is a well-research and thorough book, I found myself skimming parts when she seemed to repeat herself.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I wasn't certain what to think when I chose to read \\"Quiet\\". It sounded like a dry and boring subject. On the other hand, Susan Cain has written a fascinating, well-researched, and well-written book that introverts and extroverts will both benefit from reading \\"Quiet\\".<br /><br />Introverts - Read it to appreciate yourself more.<br />Extroverts - Read it to understand people who you haven't been able to figure out yet.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from WaterBrook Multnomah as part of their book review bloggers program.

B00AE2IJIE|4.0|My kids didn't want to see it at first. 4 boys between the ages of 4-13. However, we all enjoyed it!
B00999DFP0|5.0|I laugh until my sides hurt!  Big Bang Thoery is like no other show I've seen.  Would recommend this to everyone
B0052MMGFI|5.0|Although, listening to the original LP, with the scratches surrounding your head feels like a million bucks, CD sounds very good, I expected a better mixing but I guess the original studio recording wasn't the best. If you love camel I don't think any ones opinion really matter.
1451648537|5.0|I love this book, it was a great read and amazing insight on the man.  Plus it had many stories not known before this book was published.
B00B10CT7A|5.0|We loved this movie! The story is very entertaining and emotionally touching. The camera work was fantastic as well. Worth purchasing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best since pizza was made. Everyone loves it, justly some people get mad (AKA the people who rated this one star) because this game rocks to much for them to intake. It is cool, I just prefer PC more, but it still rocks.
B006S01GH2|5.0|I have seen this too many times. It is so cute and funny. Amelie is an intriguing character that draws you into her world and leaves you wanting more.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'd love more from Christian's side but I loved the story in book 3 for sure.  Please keep writing this series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|would you make the same mistakes? would you better the world? I found this story to be a great read as well as thought provoking. Not the horror you may be used to from King, but that makes the story better
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm lucky if I can just squeak by with enough points to go to the next level.  It is a fun and addictive game, though.
B006QPX7UI|5.0|Amazing movie very inspirational, a little bit too long. Was confused with who was who during the movie had to view it twice.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire has been around for ages.  The electronic version is good and I do recommend it.  Of course, it doesn't provide many thrills, but then, it's not designed for that anyway.  :)
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I bought this following Ed Dale's recommendation and their interview. As a magazine publisher I won't have exactly the same high finance situations but this will benefit me in my interactions with writers, advertisers and subscribers. Human interaction follows these important patterns. Oren is onto something here.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Aah, teenage rebellion - I remember it well.  Should I reveal that Mom turns into a bear?  Oops.  Interesting concept.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Great spectrum of groove and sound. Highly entertaining and energetic. Turn this one up and get everyone dancing.  A tremendous gathering of talented musicians. Thank you Mr. White!
0143119680|5.0|I loved this book.  What a great talent the author has of telling a story!  I look forward to reading more of the story.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|Everyone should have this man's work in their collection. I highly recommend this for your listening pleasure. Order it now!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Movie itself was almost OK but streaming was terrible. It kept stopping and stating from the beginning. Download it if you can first
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this, as I've never been in to RPGs, but I found myself completely captivated by the book.<br /><br />The characters, especially Wade, are so wonderfully drawn and realized. The story is paced at lightening speed and full of things that made me smile.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Who needs a dedicated e-reader when you can read the same thing on your tablet. I don't think you lose any features at all
B005LAJ16I|5.0|So glad I got this.  I just pre-ordered season 2 and can't wait to get it!  My husband and I loved this!
B009LS4KM6|5.0|Watched on a movie night with the 5yr old and she loved it!! She was initially not into this because of a bad perception of the &#34;Lorax&#34; movie.<br /><br />This is a great movie with modern graphics and is completely watchable for people of all ages.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Great story, great music.  I'm so glad that this movie was recommended to me.  Such an uplifting story about a talented and humble muscian.
B000LPI68W|5.0|Awesome movie.. a bit old but entertaining and exhilarating for its time. I watched this with my girlfriend and she didn't fall asleep so that's a good sign :)
B000ICM5IK|5.0|plan to give as gift for doggie's birthday, sorry for the delay, I've been in transition, will probably purchase one more
B008K8U13K|5.0|Got this for my Kindle and its easy to use, fun and replicates the original Sonic the Hedgehog well!<br /><br />I'd give it a try
B0095VPBM2|4.0|I ran this dual-core processor in a test system (overall cost for the system was $155) This APU has the integrated GPU and both the CPU and GPU work splendidly. Currently I have thrown Mount and Blade: Fire and Sword, Borderlands, Minecraft and Unreal Tournament 3 at the system and it can run each without too much hesitation and issues. I plan on using a quad-core version for a future build.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I've bought several copies of it for distribution.  True to the text, shows the humanness of a great man who did much for the Lord and for suffering people.
0307463745|5.0|Great book for entrepreneurs who think they have to go the conventional way. Helps you to get to launch. Very much needed book.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Have bought multiple copies of this movie through the years, and given it away at times.  GREAT movie.  I recommend it to anyone.  Shows what one man can do if He gives himself to God and wants to help people.
6305128952|5.0|Robert Redford at his best,love the setting of this beautiful horse and owner movie,has funny,sad,and adventurous action,with a little romance added in,love adding this one to my collection
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for clean cut, moral movies...Very much worth the purchase...good for fathers who are trying to do right.
B0002IQAMW|5.0|This is a ***Hybrid*** SACD. IT sounds alot differnt than a TRUE \\"SACD CD\\" PLAYER to me, which LITES UP BOTH LIGHTS on my<br />ADCOM SACD player. To me IT really sounds like a 1970's 'BACK IN THE DAY' Bootleg recording:D, THIS CD ONLY LIT UP ONE OF THE RED LIGHTS~ ~THE DIGITAL LOCK LITE ONLY~ AND NOT THE SECOND \\"SACD LITE\\". THAT IS BECAUSE,, THAT IS HOW IT IS~ WITH A ***HYBRID*** SADC PLAYER.<br />GREAT ALBUM!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I Believe I own all the books by Ferris, and it has changed how I approach things in the world.<br /><br />This book changed a lot for me as well. I have been wanting to eat healthier for awhile, this was a good kickstart and show what I need. I have made all the beginning recipes. To give you an idea how great it is for me, I'm a single male that never made much more than spaghetti, now I have made 20+ variations of scrambled eggs to eat in the morning. Half my Christmas gifts were Cooking supplies.<br /><br />All that to say, I'm a fan.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|A combination of a CSI Show style with good old Sherlock Holmes story. Makes for an enjoyable and intriguing story for any Holmes fan.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Unlike most games this 1 has a pretty unique premise. You expel mass to move and gain or lose mass depending on whether you contact a larger or smaller sphere. Larger ones absorb you, small ones you absorb. Some of them are repelled by you and some actively dodge you. It gets very challenging .
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I saw the movie in the theatre because I read all the John Carter books when I was young.  I thought the movie did a good job, and only made changes that were necessary for Hollywood.  It is disappointing that it lost money at the box office, but that is only because it was so expensive to make.  It would be great if they made sequels, but that probably won't happen because of the cost.
B000A7DVR2|3.0|I loved the laid backness but not the f word. Of course Jeff is one of my favorite actors anyway. Reminds me of bowling when a kid.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I find the game to be fun and addictive, my wife complained that I played it too much. I just keep trying to get a better score. Who needs sleep?
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Item arrived in great shape and didn't have any noticeable flaws that others complained of. A sound investment for sure.
B009ANP48G|1.0|I'm located in Japan but I can't use digital copy as it require only US located buyer. I don't feel good not able to get what I have paid for.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I LOVE this book so much. I seriously will read it  over and over and over again. A lot of my favorite characters died, but whatever.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book! I can't wait to see the movie, I hope it will be as great as the book is & how awesome Notebook is. Fast read because you don't want to put the book down. I have recommended this book to several others it was that good!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I adore The Hunger Games with a burning passion. This book is by far the best of the three, and I just sit and re-read this book when I'm bored. It's just so ughhhh hng I can't even explain how good it is
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Bought the book on accident then couldn't put it down! Extremely well-written. Great characters and unpredictable story line. Can't wait to read the rest of the series
1416955070|3.0|I went into this book expecting it to be awesome and just great overall because of all the hype it has been getting, but unfortunately it did not live up to all the great things I had heard about it. Don't get me wrong it was a good, interesting read, but I think that my expectations were too high. Anyways great book, it had some suspense and it has me wondering what is going to happen next, but I'm not going to rush out and buy the next book right away. Like I said, and interesting and fast read, and it is good enough that I'm not just going to give up on the first book. Let's hope it reels me in some more with the next books in the series.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Bought this because it was advertised as &#34;new&#34;.  I'm sure it's new...but I'm not sure it's an original Disney product.
1451624468|5.0|Many who believe in the after life , may find this book very disturbing. While you many not agree with the author's logic, it is an excellent read for a different perspective of what may or may not exist after we pass away.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|Yes, this game is free but as other reviewers have noted, it costs money to get anywhere with it.  My wife had this on her Kindle - obviously without reading reviews - and I suddenly started getting bills for credits for this game.  Her niece was playing the game and didn't realize it but was purchasing credits with my money.<br />I feel like this game is dishonest because obviously it's designed for children and for it to cost money within the game, many children aren't going to ask permission to purchase credits while others won't have any concept that they are spending &#34;real&#34; money.  Something that should be fun like this shouldn't have to be monitored by an adult to make sure that purchases aren't accidentally made.
B003SHYVO8|5.0|I love having my movie nights, and the Step Up movies are a great choice. I love the dancing, though the drama part of the story tends to be cliche. But who watches dance movies for the drama?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really good game with horses and very time killer and very fun with feeding grooming and riding
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Can't have a Step Up movie night without the final Revolution. I'd have to say that this one is my favorite of the Step Up movies. I love the idea of the flash mob, and the stunts are amazing. Twitch is a hip-hop god, and everyones gotta love Moose at the end. It was also good to see some of the other faces that lasted through most of the movies.
B000FC10WU|4.0|As usual, Agatha Christie is great in her telling of the story and the suspense of finding out who-done-it!  I love all her novels.
B004EK91LQ|5.0|Love the Step Up movies. And there is no way you can go wrong with Twitch. Or Moose. Great dancers.
B006O6F932|5.0|great item ... as described ... no complaints ... love it ...just what  daughter wanted ...I feel that this product was what I was looking for...came as described...good condition/new...packaging was done very well...would buy again from this seller..K
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Great movie, hands down one of the funnies movies for grown ups. You can not bet Ted unless they make Ted II
0679805273|5.0|Who doesn't love Dr. Seuss? We love all of these books and this one just tops off our collection. I highly recommend ALL the Dr. Seuss books.
B008MF3OEY|4.0|It's very classy looking and my Kindle fits tightly. It doesn't move at all. I only wish the spine was a bit stiffer as the front of the cover tends to hang when open.
0811870413|5.0|This book saved me so much money.  The bread I make for pennies is better than any bread I'll buy anywhere in the city.  In fact, I never think I'll buy bread again; what I make with very little effort is so much better and costs me next to nothing.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|THIS CHIMNEY STARTER IS EXTREMELY WELL MADE AND WITH MINIMUM CARE IT SHOULD LAST FOR MANY YEARS. ANYTHING MADE BY WEBER IS USUALLY FIRST CLASS.  I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF WEBER GRILLS AND ACCESORIES OVER THE YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH ANYTHING. YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON WEBER PRODUCTS.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|How could you not read this every Christmas?  This is a personal tradition of mine, I highly recommend that everyone tune into the Christmas spirit with this short classic.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Little can be said about \\"Cabaret\\" as a movie that has not already been said. It transcended the musical genre and changed it forever. It is moving, profoundly human, socially and politically aware, and also a terrific piece of entertainment that can be enjoyed over and over. I was sort of worried about the HD restoration and transfer for this blu-ray edition. It had been talked about and postponed for some 3 years now, and, knowing that it was shot with a completely intended soft look, I was afraid that it was digitally over-treated (yes, I had \\"Out of Africa\\", \\"Gladiator\\" and other Universal disasters in mind). Well, nothing of that sort, on the very contrary; the restoration and the transfer are flawless, totally respecting the soft colors, low contrast, even hue and darkness. Its understated, timeless look is all there. Everything is seen as it was originally intended to be seen, incluing the beautiful celulloid grain (yes, it is there, thanks WB). No signs of DNR or artificial compression at all, so all the small details in the negative are there; the colors are not artificially oversaturated, the contrast is not boosted, and the sound is expanded without being overdone either. A perfect restoration and transfer that totally respect the view of the director and cinematographer. It is so fresh that it feels like seeing the movie for the first time. Can't be better, honestly. I do intend to enjoy this blu ray many times in the future. Unmissable, especially if you like the movie. And if you don't..it's about time you give it another chance.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was great.  I am sad that the author doesn't have more novels out there.  I devoured this book.  The ending was so perfect that it didn't have you hanging for more...except another story as good.  Certainly the best work of fiction I read this year.
B008F9T76Q|5.0|I bought these books as a present for my 12 years old nephew who loves reading and really wanted to get The Maze Runner. The price for the three was good. He loved it by the way!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It was fun but I have played many other hidden object games that were far better. Did not like the quick ending of the game.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I was disapointed at first . Bane's story line was changed . But , wow , it works beautifully .
B003L77GGU|5.0|Our family loves this series. We haven't finished this season yet, but we're working on it. I didn't enjoy the first couple of episodes but it got much better, and thankfully, the story explained why the first shows were weird.
B008476HBM|5.0|Loved this book,also the characters.a few of them worked my nerves,but I still love how well written they are.<br />Elizabeth is my favorite because she is headstrong,independent and outspoken<br />With so many intricate lives and plot lines interwoven,it kept me completely engrossed and it made wanting to know the fate of each character!!<br />I loved her Austin's writing style,this book not only observes the social hierarchy of the times in which it was written,but also human natures and personalities that are eternal.I recommend this book for everyone of every time and place.
B002JVWRAY|5.0|Bought this for my son so we could finish up the series with a bang. We love it! Great stories, great effects, and great conversation topics when the episodes are done. :)
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Everyone's been raving about the series so I got it. I'm not sorry I did. The scenery is great and so are the costumes!
B008M721MS|5.0|I have no problems with this app. It works great. I am able to play a game while talking to a friend. I love it so much. I recommend you to bye it. I got the kindle fire hd for this reason and i am proud I got it. If i had to pay for it it i would gladly.
B001JRB16U|5.0|This is one of the best movie Hollywood has ever put out. Children and adults will always want to watch this positive story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it s like temple run but cooler. The big deal with this thing is that you have to use your smarts.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is one of the best movie Hollywood has ever put out. Children and adults will always want to watch this positive story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great. It helps pass the time. But mine froze and I had to delete it and download it again. But otherwise it is awesome

0792839749|5.0|This is a really good movie, and it worth the money that you pay for it and it really is good.
B001USHRCK|5.0|My son is a lego freak and just loves this. There are a lot of details in this kit that are really neat like the black smith shop has a working bellows.
140123769X|5.0|I have not read this yet but am looking forward to it.  I have enjoyed all of Willingham's other boods.  The book made it to my house in good shape and on time.
B000O76T8Q|4.0|The Abyss is a great movie and it's special effects and story line were years ahead of other films.  This DVD package looks good and has the extended cut version as well as the theatrical release.  If you are watching on an HD TV you'll be wondering about all the black space surrounding the picture.  The sound is awesome but the overall experience would be greatly improved with an updated release.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|It's a movie that you have to watch to enjoy. No Blue-screen, no chases, no explosions, just good acting and an unusual twist (cliffhanger?) at the end.<br />The characters are well drawn with a depth to them.<br />Marianne Sagebrecht hasn't much to say in the way of dialogue but her body language is superb.<br />If you are expecting a sugar-coated story, forget it! The sheer vastness of the open spaces of old Rte 66 and the ramshackle Bagdad Cafe compliment each other and provide a perfect setting for this story.
B004BSFC46|5.0|I purchased this item for my grandson.  I was looking for items that would get the attention of an infant who was interested in lights and sounds.  I found this item to be what I was looking for.  The items were packed securely and quickly arrived.  I would purchase from this vendor again.  Thank you for working with Amazon.com
B005NJU8PA|2.0|I read about halfway through it and quit! Too much of the author telling about his achievements and very little about learning to cook like a por. IMHO I wasted my money!

B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I still like the TV series far better than the books. Books are good but too long, TV series is more focused and concise but thats just my taste.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I know the graphics are great but when the game is then you have a champion on your hands.  You will love it and there is always something new to learn give it a try it is very fun.  Oh by the way the graphics are good to.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Once again Clancy nails one out of the park with the Jack Ryan Jr books. Never really a slow moment however the battle at the end seemed rushed.

B000FC10MU|3.0|The imaginative and thought provoking novel had me wondering where a talented writer comes up with their ideas.  Caiman made me turn pages just to know what he would throw at me next.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game works much better on my phone than on my Kindle Fire, it is much smoother.  I have been playing it EVERYWHERE!
B002VECM6S|4.0|This was a very good movie.  It shows what a little love can do for someone who has had a rought time in life.
B007N8RULO|5.0|love it.  cant put it down.  accurate.  works great on my kindle fire.  hints are easy to find.  free game,
B008HT4FUW|5.0|After hearing everyone rave about the pbs series, I had to get in on the action.  Loved the series, and seeing it in HD and the original version was wonderful.  Can hardly wait to get my season 3
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|What a great movie. This is where Bill Murray started for me. A must see for any fan of his!
B002FQOI0A|3.0|I have read more than half the Newbery books and this is not one of my favorite favorites. Seems to drag and does not have a obvious plot.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I'm not just saying it was amazing because I'm a huge Justin fan, I seriously mean it. For people who don't care for Justin should see who he really is. A boy I know saw his documentary (it was the only kid appropriate movie in the theaters) and he said he liked it. This really tells more of his celebrity life (sequel to \\"First Step 2 Forever: My Story\\") and what he has to do know to \\"be normal\\".  I really liked it!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used SwiftKey for a few years now and haven't looked ball to the stock keyboards or Skype since. Now with Flow, it's even better!
B0076DELIG|5.0|The story delivered all I have come to expect great story line great insights into very believable characters and an edge of the seat read.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you like 50 shades you will love this book! I can't wait to read the next one. Sylvia Day is an excellent writer a and I can't wait to read her other novels.
B008220BLG|5.0|I haven't watched it yet but I'm dying to watch it . It looks so cute and romantic. Hope my review helped
B00867GHS8|5.0|Still as funny as the very first day..<br />and now in full HD and 3D!<br />the digital copy is a a hassle.. other than that it is good purchase
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This short collection of poems and photos is absolutely adorable yet incredibly astute when it comes to the inner workings of the feline train of thought. Or stream of consciousness, which is extremely apt as well. The poems are short enough to be succinct in conveying just what your fuzzy companion is REALLY thinking when you've been wondering if there was anything really going on behind that seemingly blank stare. Each poem is now a favorite and I shall read this often to remind me just how my kitty's brain was buzzing when he was still with me. Perfect for current owners, former owners, and those prospective owners still awkwardly sitting on the fence, pensively unsure if cat ownership is truly for them. This will get you off the fence and trying unsuccessfully to cat-proof your house and get you merrily on your way to know the joys (and trials) of sharing their - I mean YOUR home with them.
030746363X|5.0|This is the first workout or diet book I have ever picked up (due to so many recommendations). Read the sections on weight loss during a flight. started immediately, and now feel in control of the 20 pounds that had always been the hardest to control. That was 4 months ago, now I am looking to the book for workout:)<br />Thank You!
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is enjoyable but a bit repetitive as other players have mentioned. But overall, it is one that I go back and forth with so I have no issues waiting for my energy to refill.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I rented this to watch with my family on a Saturday evening. It was hilarious and we all enjoyed it, even my husband, even though this isn't his normal kind of movie. My 12 year old daughter had told me several times that it is now her favorite movie ever.(Warning to other parents, despite the PG-13 rating, there were some scenes and dialog that were pretty risque.)
B004JMZPJG|4.0|I recent got my first ever SLR. I needed a case. Having previously used case logic cases, this was a natural choice.<br />I am happy with the choice It is nice and padded, safe enough for my camera. It is quite handy unlike the bulky bags that are around. But if you are a serious photographer with a collection of lenses and other accessories this cannot be your only case. But for people like me with one body and lens, this is perfect
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I really had hoped for something exciting and different. this novel is just abasic he hits me and I ran. then bam I fall in love and then surprise he finds me. ok afternoon read but nothing to get to excited about.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|Initially, I purchased this album knowing only two of the songs and taking a risk that I would enjoy the others as well. This album exceeded my expectations. I suspect if you like the hits &#34;Home&#34; or &#34;40 Day Dream&#34; it is well worth your time and money purchasing and listen to the full album.<br /><br />It is expected from musicians within the industry to output albums that have a few hits and several filler songs. This album in stark contrast. Not a single song seems to be a flower among the weeds. The more popular songs are there, but are encased in an album that flows and transitions beautify. In fact I'm so pleased with this album I have considered purchasing additional albums by this artist.
0307943232|5.0|This was the second best John Grisham book for me.  I love his writing and I always love a &#34;bad/good hero.&#34;
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|12345 stars it is a very good game with good sound effects. IT' s my favorite go to game. Tip of the hat to ya.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Plays all the songs in the first season and some extra ones.. My daughter loves the show/(channel) so i bought her the soundtrack and she can listen to that thing on repeat everyday. it plays the songs just like the shows too- no weird versions.
0930073193|2.0|If you want a balanced outlook in how economics work, you should look elsewhere. This is pure Libertarian propaganda, that may appeal to those who are intoxicated with the Austrian School of Economics kool-aid and the \\"ethical selfishness\\" philosophy.<br /><br />As for the guy who said 500 jobs in the government sector would kill jobs in the private sector, that is simply not true. More money in people's pockets are not equal to more jobs in the private sector. A company would usually exploit workers in order to maximize \\"efficiency\\" and avoid recruitment, and you don't know where that extra money (if those taxes weren't implemented)from people would be invested into. That means, new jobs are not guaranteed by \\"low taxes\\".  Likewise, an increase in taxes won't necessarily mean the private sector would lay off people in every case. It depends of what kind of industry it is, it's size, it's needs, etc.<br /><br />Lay offs are inevitable in a market economy, and they will happen no matter what. It doesn't matter if we're talking about a fantasy minarchist or anarchist system, or if we're talking about a \\"big statist\\" one. This is not an apologetic for Keynesian economics, but rather a criticism and an advice for those who want to buy the book.<br /><br />My recomendation: Go and buy books of diverse economic philosophies, compare them and reach your own conclusions. Or much better, go and read proposals to get rid of these non-sensical system we call capitalism. This is all screwed up. The system is a failure, it doesn't work for everybody no matter how you slice or dice it, and is based on a false assumption of scarcity, and a very dangerous premise of \\"freedom\\" that has too many philosophical loopholes.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game, but it can get kinds boring sometimes. The graphics are great and so are the mini-games.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am addicted to this series, but...I HATE the ending of Season 3.  It will be a loooooong wait for Season 4.
1426209584|5.0|I've read about the book in Nat Geo magazine and from the first minute I knew I definitely want it..
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The movie was a bit long and to be honest I cant remeber much of it. Need four more words.
B002SRQ214|5.0|It is definitely impressive as far as an AM3 CPU goes responds well to any mobo that is compatible and runs fairly cool.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I didn't like this free app at all. I thought it was difficult to maneuver mr. pac man. If you can't live without your pac-man, pay a little money for a nice app! :)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great way to keep in touch with family and friends.. love being able to use this app on my phone and kindle
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is very relatable on many aspects. Very detailed when it game to Charlie's emotions. I love the honesty and true image in this book. I would recommend it to high school and college students, especially if you feel like you are different then most people.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love love love pinterest!!! It gives you so many ideas and is so helpful in more ways than one.. thank you pinterest!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Awesome game. Very addictive and enjoyable. Only thing i dont like is waiting for energy to build back up. When an app is advertised as free, it should be free. But otherwise one of my favoritw games and wish i would have found it sooner.
B00000DHTF|5.0|If you don't like Wrecking Ball, you will love this. It is his earlier Jersey shore/fund style + stuff that is not like him but totally cool. Enjoy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a book. It's a romantic book. A must read for anybody looking for a book.  I could read it over and over.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|Of course the allies fooled the Germans! Other than the predictable outcome, the book was a very good read. Held my attention from start to finish. My first Follett, and not my last.
B008R5OJXE|5.0|This is a wonderful recording of a well-loved opera.  The voices are beautiful and the technical aspects of the recording, superb.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a great game to play. I would recommend this to all of my friends.<br />I could play it all day, if I could.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|I am a huge collector when it comes to movies.  The must have dust covers, all disc, and what not.  Im usually worried about buying from amazon when it comes to movies cause I like to see what it is I am buying and and I want to make sure it has everything.  This item was exactly what I was looking for and now I can feel safe in knowing when I buy the rest of the Harry Potter series from this seller, it will be exactly what is displayed.
1250007208|5.0|I picked up this book from my regular spot, A Good Book in downtown Sumner, for reasons unrelated to the story, I must admit. One, I like to support a local business. Two, I've met author Marissa Meyer on two occasions (at the Pacific Northwest Writer's Conference and at Tacoma's NaNoWriMo kick-off party), and being an author myself, I enjoy supporting local authors. For the most part, I was convinced that it would be more like most fairy tale knock-offs that start out with great ideas, but lack in substance. Boy, was I wrong. I finished in less than a week.<br /> Ms. Meyer's ability to fuse the complex plots of an iconic tale along with elements of destopyanism, totalitarianism, and cyberpunk were both genius and refreashing. I could see plenty of \\"Firefly\\" influence woven into the scenery (I brused up on both the series and film before reading the book).<br />I absolutly loved the title character, who's blend of sarcasim, heart and mechanical ability was very different from the Cinderella we grew up with.<br />I especially enjoyed this after I read the interview where Ms. Meyer details her own lack of talent in the latter category. I sympathize.<br />Some reviewers on this site thought the romance between her and Prince Kai was shallow. I respectfully disagree. I thought it was appropriate, given the circumstances, and leaves just enough wiggle room to potentially blossum into something more. The tried subplot, \\"I just met you, but I will love you forever\\" was completely inappropriate in this case.<br />Some also thought the \\"lost princess\\" subplot was dorky and anticlamactic. That was actually my favorite part. Sure, the revelation in the end isn't too much of a surprise, but once again, there is plenty of room for more.<br />Fans of \\"The Hunger Games,\\" \\"Firefly,\\" cyberpunk, science fiction, or folks who just want a good story that takes them away for an hour or two will not be disappointed.
B005XLN97M|4.0|Yes, I know it may sound odd, but the Barbie 2-Story Beach House also makes a great teaching device.<br /><br />How?<br /><br />Think of all the 'things' packed into this house...kitchen, refrigerator, sink, cabinet, living room, television, window, shower, bed, rug, stairs, chairs, etc.  While many children see and name these items by age 3 or 4, many educationally challenged students struggle with these words visually and conceptually.  Comparably sized doll houses are much more expensive, and this is a great alternative for budget conscious educators.<br /><br />Does the girl factor have to be toned down a bit?  Sure, but hey....who doesn't enjoy a little redecorating?
B004KKXMSI|5.0|awesome quality on picture & sound....and accommodating price :) The first film has such an impact on the industry and set the standard for special effects
B0076DELIG|4.0|That is actually 4.5 stars.  It is hard to truly rank any work as perfect, so the slight reduction, but the Michael Connelly fans and Harry Bosch fans will understand:  this is one of the greats.  One of many.  A well developed story and a well told story.  I didn't want to put it down, and I can't wait for the next one.<br /><br />JTP Virginia
B008TMA1LY|3.0|the only reason i am  giving this game a 3 is because yes, the game is free but in order to play the game and do well in it you have to spend money to buy extra characters to help you in the game. i dislike that because its sneaky. however the game is really fun!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|THERE ARE JUST A HAND FULL OF MOVIES THAT I NEED TO SEE EVERY YEAR.  THIS IS ONE OF THEM.  I BUY VERY FEW MOVIES.  THIS ONE IS A WINNER.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so awesome! At first I thought it was a cheap version of minecraft so I bought it.It rocks!
159514188X|5.0|I can say, with much confidence, that at any point from now and in the future, if anyone ever asks me what my favorite book is I will say &#34;Thirteen Reasons Why&#34; by Jay Asher.<br /><br />I've had books touch me before but nothing could have prepared me for something like this. Not because I can relate to the topic matter. Well, I guess in a very miniscule sense I can, but in a much more removed way. I've only had someone who means something to me, have someone who meant something to them, take their life. But you don't have to have suicide touch your life in any way to fully appreciate this book.<br /><br />Jay Asher is brilliant and he tells a story so beautifully that you feel like you're there, right along side Clay, listening to the tapes and working his way through town as Hannah tells the story of how thirteen different people helped to pull her into a downward spiral from which she saw no hope of ever coming back up. It's like that game Jenga. You pull out one block and it's really not that big of a deal. But the more you remove, the less stable the structure becomes, until finally...it falls.<br /><br />Such an amazing book. I'll probably catch hell for saying this, but I think a lot of teens would benefit from reading this story. One could hope that reading it and seeing how their actions, even the smallest ones, can really affect someone. I realize there's always going to be bullies out there, people who can't be happy unless they tear others down and a story like this won't touch everyone as much as it did me, but like I said, one could hope.<br /><br />It's a very realistic story and because of that it's very emotional but I cannot say this enough...you must read this book. And then after you do... do something nice for someone, say something nice to someone or even start with smiling at a stranger. You never know what a difference a smile can make :)
0596805527|5.0|I mean, as the book says, it's a definitive guide. DEFINITELY! It covers the subject comprehensively with detailed examples. What more do you want...
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I read Grisham in the beginning, A Time to Kill and The Firm, then stopped because his books started to feel the same to me. Flawed hero in a huge, impossible situation, out thinking the rest of the characters and coming out on top. I saw this as an e-book library loan and took a chance. I was entertained. Fast-moving, clever, nice twists (albeit so nicely wrapped up yet again). He writes a good vacation book.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|Carmine Gallo does for Jobs's presentation skills what Walter Isaacson did for Jobs's business and life skills.  But, Gallo did it years before.  This book is an excellent resource for anyone looking to tap into what made Steve Jobs an exceptional presenter.  It is realistic about the level of preparation and rehearsal that goes into making a presentation look effortless. It also provides a number of tips on a broad range of speaking skills.<br /><br />A couple of reviewers have complained about the fact that the book explores some of the same examples multiple times.  While that is true, I actually appreciated this since it allowed me to examine a given presentation from different angles - design, language, delivery.  This approach gives you a richness that you could not get any other way.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I am forever a bigtime LOST fan period! I never get tired of watching these videos! I have 2 more to get!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Wahlberg is such a terrific actor -- he can do roles ranging from football players (Invincible) to a wacky hilarious guy (Ted) to the rough veteran mountain man in Shooter.  He carries so many of his movies on his shoulders and this one is no exception.  Fast moving, exciting to watch -- and yet, in all of his movies, we see an inner man who is extraordinary.  Would recommend this in Widescreen to everyone wanting some great fun.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I am a big LOST fan and love every one of the videos! I still have 2 more to get!
B007REV4YI|1.0|Anyone reviewing this movie and rated it positive is no Bond fan.  This movie was an insult to the legacy.  A washed up weak bond with a pitiful story line full of inept villains and some of the worst PC recreation of classic bond characters in history.  Just an example without giving away the pitiful plot, a scene where a helicopter is approaching a house at dusk, then 2 minutes later its pitch black and then 10 minutes later its dawn.  Sloppy sloppy sloppy.<br /><br />This new approach of humanizing bond giving him next to no gadgets to play with insults the legacy and character of Bond.  This is a superhero character larger than life.<br /><br />They should rename this one EMOBond
1594200106|4.0|had to read for book club.  little too long.  Very descriptive.<br />Me personally did not like the book.  My book club loved it.
B00B5HQL50|1.0|I downloaded the HD version on amazon.  It's 704x396.  That's not even HD.  Very disappointed. Quite insulting.  I figured it would be 1080p, but I was hoping 720p at the least.  I can't believe they did this.
B002UJIY70|5.0|This movie was well written and the actors chosen for the characters they portrayed only enhanced the overall picture.<br />The script kept you wondering who the real villians were, each time you became confident of who was who, another event came into play. I would recomend this to any individual who enjoys thrillers and &#34;who done its.&#34;
B000VX041Q|5.0|The shoes are tremendous. They are comfortable and surefooted, as well as appearing to be well constructed. I tried other brands, but they don't measure up, with the possible exception of Rockports. I wish they offered an insulated version.
1400049628|5.0|This is different from normal zombie books because the read comes off as if this is truly happening and is going on. It gives detailed step by step instructions on how to survive a zombie apocalypse. It can be boring in some places of the book but all in all this would help prepare you for any survival situation(within reason). Get prepared!!
1567184855|5.0|I am very grateful for this book. A scientific approach to discovering what may happen between lifetimes? Yes please, and thank you. As a Vedic Astrologer, I study the impact of past lives on a daily basis, so this book is a new cut at a topic I'm already steeped in. It gives possible explanations for how the slice of karma we're given in this lifetime is selected for us, or by us. I've had visions that are similar to what the subjects describe, and the book really resonates for me.  It has given me deep peace and relaxation around my own inevitable death and the deaths of those around me. On top of that, it is a page turner, and written in a very engaging way. Highly recommended.
1567184855|3.0|Something to read over a period of time by someone interested in near-death experiences.<br />Two people I know enjoyed this book.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|This book is poorly written, boring and takes way too long to get to the point of the story. Just read the last few chapters for it. Spoiler alert: the denouement doesn't include any of the crowd-pleasing moments I was hoping to read. I'm still waiting to see some of the photos that would prove Bin Laden's death. My government's word is not good enough for me.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I knew this movie was good when i ordered it, couldnt wait to add this to my movie collection... glad I could find it!
B004I9CXHW|1.0|Car came with ipod/iphone cable and that works fine. Bought this to use with Kingston 16gb usb and car didn't recognize anything was plugged into MDI.  Yes, I did make sure it was formatted FAT32 as required.  Huge disappointment!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Got this fast, great shape and ya know what? Its a great movie too. But I really liked how fast it got to us and it was carefully sent too.
B006VP1OYO|1.0|All the subtlety of the originals is gone. Yeah, it'll sound louder on headphones and in your car but if you listen on any system that's considered even slightly audiophile you'll notice a huge difference. The lows are over-compressed and the highs are clipped. Search out the originals for the true, widescreen shoegazing experience without the pain.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and then my daughter and granddaughter were reading it before the movie came out, so I thought that I had possibly missed reading one of Mr.Sparks books so I downloaded it and started 're-reading it and discovered that I had in fact read it before. The amazing thing is that I couldn't put it down again!!!!!  I would recommend this book and I would like to thank Mr. Sparks for once again keeping me reading until the wee hours of the morning!!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although I could write about this book forever, I'll keep it short. This book is incredible. Beautiful. Heart wrenching. And shows how things don't always go as expected, but love is love through thick and thin. I bawled my eyes out and have recommended this book to everyone I can. I DEFINITELY would say this is in my top 3 favorite books ever. John Green is brilliant and this book sticks to you for days after you read it. It's a beautiful story, and I think everyone should read it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is perfect for occupying your mind without needing your full attention. Anyone can play it and they get progressively more difficult so you won't lose interest.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|I became familiar with Mavericks when I moved to the Bay Area in 2005. After watching the movie I was a little surprised to find out that it was based on a true story. I don't know much about the &#34;professional&#34; surfing world other than Kelly Slater, but this movie was well done.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great family show my teenage daughters love it. I would highly recommend it to any one who is tired of the mindless shows on tv today.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I bought these for my boyfriend for his bday and he says his gameplay improved big time due to the quality and precise sound.  He loves these and hopes they are compatible with yet another new PS system.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because I thought it was a great book. I liked how the book had romance, adventure, action and much more. I recommend it to anyone because I know that they'll love it.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|it's hot fuzz if you haven't seen it....see it hell for the price buy it ..if it's not for you there's always craigslist or friends who will enjoy it
0525953728|5.0|All the controversy aside, this was a very easy and enjoyable read.  It gives the reader a specific perspective on what these men go through in order to do an important job most are unwilling to do.

0515142247|5.0|Lee Child continues to make Jack Reacher the serious hottie detective!  Always reluctant, but always honorable, Reacher is constantly righting the wrongs around him!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We had been hearing lots of people talk about this series and finally we broke down and started watching it. It is not anything that we would normally watch. An English period piece just isn't our thing but there's something about this series and the characters that really drew us in. We found we either love the characters or hated them but we weren't neutral about them. Excellent work
0515153656|5.0|Reacher at the top of his game!  Lee Child keeps you on the edge until the end!  Always surprising with twists, turns and humor!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|We like action films but we didn't like this because there's no value of life in it. It also deals with the fact that if you could go back in time And kill Hitler or someone like him as a child would you do it?
B00631VJIC|4.0|I love the sons but was a little disappointed in the sound track. I still like the music, was just hoping for some songs i guess didn't make the cut.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a fun game. I love killing monkeys and the power-ups are a nice addition to this ad free game
B003NHRGSQ|3.0|The book is incredibly well written, the author has a way of really making it come alive before you. However, the actual content and story left me dissatisfied and bored. And a little weirded out.
B009738XXM|5.0|I really do like &#34;Call Me Maybe&#34; and &#34;Good Time&#34; and had purchased those songs individually.  Kiss went on sale at Amazon so I decided to try the whole album.  I'm was pleasantly surprised.  I really like every song that comes on.  They have a pop feel, fun lyrics, variety sung by a great voice.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Poop tastes pretty good. You should try it. And oh yeah, I guess Mockingjay was pretty good.  Peace out homies.
1449410243|4.0|This was a present for my brother and his family that just got a new kitten.  I think the concept is hilarious and enjoyed reading some parts of it.  It is mostly illustrations, but they are funny.
B0076DELIG|5.0|After reading the last book, I was thinking that this series was hitting a wall, but this is another in a few recent examples of an author revitalizing a series by going back to the character's past. While the book started slower than I expected, the end was compelling.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|You will be frustrated as the levels get harder but it is lots of fun for hours of enjoyment.  Enjoy
B001GM28HO|5.0|My review was it is a terrific CD and I truly enjoy listening to my CD. I choose this rating because it deserves it. I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants originality and is a fan of Lady Gaga.<br /><br />A Amazon.com Customer Tammy
1609611543|5.0|this book will really make you think twice about what you put into your mouth from here on out. this book was part of our nutritional book readers club and some of the discussions really turned your head and say holy crap i had no idea how many people were really affected by gluten and other carbohydrate chains
B005LAJ16I|5.0|They didn't get this on their TV.  My sister and I watched it while I was visiting her.  So wanted to share the excitement of this with my friends. Always fun talking over episodes-do we or don't we like Brody?  So plan on getting them the second season.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Great Quality, amazing movie. Honestly one of the greatest movies of all time that I personally think everyone should have. What more could I ask for?

B000002NJM|5.0|Great CD!  Awesome music...the disc came broken so I was worried that it had scratched the CD but it turned out fine. Not worth sending back though
B007WFR0QS|3.0|It is an OK CD. I thought listening to it more would change my mind.... nope didn't happen. The only song that really resonates and can be listened to over and over is &#34;Next to me&#34;. If I find it as a CD single with multiple remixed versions it will be in my collection.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A riveting book from beginning to end. It played mind games with me. Definitely an exploration of the evil in all of us.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|I saw a lot of negative review toward LND about bad stage design and story. But such things don't even a thing to consider when you listen to the CD. Most of the the music is still beautiful and heartbreaking. The performance of Ramin and Sierra Boggess is just awesome. Ramin delivered every piece of emotion of Phantom——sorry, Erik—— throughly and detailly. Christine's death almost made me cry. The implement of rock and roll remains on acceptable level.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is such a great book.  while I am a woman in my late 30s; this book kept my interest.  The story, the characters, the findings, THE HIDDEN MEMORIES; this whole book was amazing.. This was just an excellent book; I recommended it to all my friends.  Download it now; you won't regret it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome.me and the whole family love it. And it is all ages appropriate . I would recommend to anyone.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Left me wanting more! I just finished reading Beautiful Darkness and I'm going to buy the next book in the series right now! I can't say more for fear of ruining it for others.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|not as good as the 1st one.Though obsticales and difficulty level are more challenging. Over all good game if not compaired to the first one.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is horrible! It only loads about 10 news feeds. It is constantly freezing up and saying there's not a network connection. What's the point of having this if it does not work properly$?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|usually have to luck for hours for my regular calculator but since I'm always on my kindle I decided screw it lets just get this app
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|BARRY LYNDON moves at a natural pace in telling the life story of a clever, charming Irish rogue who is brilliantly played by Ryan O'Neal. The story captures 18th-century Europe in elegant yet realistic fashion and is gripping from start to finish, incorporating both tense action and well-earned emotional impact. I've noticed a consensus among many critics that this film is overly long and ponderous in places; granted, there's three hours of it, but otherwise, I just don't know where these folks are coming from. While BARRY LYNDON is not one of Thackeray's better novels, the film version is one of those rare instances where Hollywood beats a classic author at his own game. This film feeds its audience a huge slice of human comedy/tragedy without ever being preachy or forced in any way.<br /><br />BARRY LYNDON was my official \\"favorite film\\" for many years before I stopped playing the \\"favorite\\" game, and to this day, I can think of few works that match it in terms of simple fineness.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|There is not a lewd comment, reference or inuendo. Nice show to watch with the family.<br />Excellent show for a family night.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|wish i could get season 5.  I need to dvr season 6 because that is when 5 will come out :(
B003UYV08E|5.0|Awesome movie!! Love Robert Downey Jr! Can't wait for the 3rd one to come out!!! Great story line in both
B005PTYOTE|4.0|Though I've seen all three movies quiet a few times before, I purchased it for collection. Blu-ray technology brings more life, excitment, clarity, both in video and sound, especially if you're viewing on large screen and sound comes through your AV Reciever makes it a good movie collection.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Real life.  If you have ever had, or loved someone with cancer or a critical illness, this book will bring all those challenges, heartbreaks, strength, and hope right back into your soul.
B007REV4T8|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed Skyfall.  Hard to beat a James Bond movie.  The only thing that seemed missing was the usual high tech gadgetry and of course, old man Q, God bless his soul.  Still, I would buy it all over again without hesitation.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|This app is fun; but it refreshed , took my money, the supply i bought, and all the food i paid for and made.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Takes me awhile to pass some of these but it is alot of fun and can get your temper up sometimes. They are alot of fun!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|best book on the subject i've ever read.  very clear and fascinating=  very informative.  i would recommend it to anyone.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I love these guys . They can be so frustrating but I just can't get enough of thes crazy things!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Phenomenal book. One of the best on WWII ever written  I could not put it down very touching and complete range of emotions
B002NT3B52|5.0|Fun read about why dogs act they way they do.  Not every dog tendency can be explained by wolves and pack rules.
159420411X|3.0|A somewhat interesting book.  The author discusses the problems with various approaches or analysis methods.  While it's worth reading I think it's some what over hyped.  A good book, but not great.  Maybe it should be 4 stars.  No way 5.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I 'purchased' this game since it was free and was looking for something to do on my Android phone, the game is (obviously) a nod to Super Mario Bros on the NES (easily noticeable in the first level where the beginning is just like Mario Bros). The game runs smoothly and has not lag issues.<br /><br />However, this is a game that I think would play much better on a tablet or larger device, the screen size was too small for me, maybe it's the way I hold my phone or something. My phones screen is roughly 5in (according to the Best Buy website it is 4.7in) so if you had a larger screen (preferably 7in) you'd likely have no problems with it.<br /><br />Like I said though, well made game, smooth graphics but all in all, little challenge for those who've played Mario Bros.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|excellent movie at a great price. I paid $5 and was worth every penny. Love Dr. Seuss. My daughter watches this over and over.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is a fun and cutesy game (normally I don't like cutesy). As go on, the levels get tough to master, so if you don't like thinking, move on.
1439102813|5.0|This is about early onset which is far different from my experience when Alzheimer's came later in life. This story like others gives different insights into the behaver that a caregiver might encounter.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Glad I downloaded this app. Helps a lot!!! WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIER KINDLE battery life.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The second season is just as good as the first, if not better. The drama deepens as the family faces more scandal and difficulty. The original UK version of the show is so much better than the shortened PBS version. The episodes are definitely worth the low price, but hopefully they will be on Netflix soon.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love to work a good jigsaw puzzle and this app makes it even more fun. It's all the enjoyment of putting together a jigsaw puzzle without the big card table in the middle of the room. I really like the different stages of difficulty so anyone can play at their own pace. There are many categories and puzzles to choose from and many are free. This game is very relaxing and I would recommend to everyone who enjoys working jigsaw puzzles.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is nothing like what I imagined it to be, naively judging by the commercials. And I think that's exactly what this book is best for, beating your expectations, going against the natural resolve of typical love stories and showing a beautiful truth in perseverance and faith. Highly suggest this book to anyone who is remotely a sports fan, enjoys deep satirical materials or just looking for a fun night of reading. Beautiful
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great picture quality is easy to understand and quickly fall into. I would recommend my horse to all animal lovers
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Uh let's you play your own music that y poo u have on your own device. You can set it for anytime and you can even change the snooze timing.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Need I say more?  Matthew McConaughey!  Why is he so great when he plays the role of a lawyer?  There were many other great actors in this movie as well.  The lawyer role seems to fit Matthew perfectly.  It's like he doesn't even have to try.  Thank goodness for us ladies that he decided to be an actor instead of a lawyer.  This has a great plot, and story line.  I bought this movie after watching it a few times on Netflix because I wanted to own it.  I love having it on my computer so I can pull it up whenever I want and wherever I go without having to tote around DVDs.  This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time, wondering who did what, who is lying, who is telling the truth, and what is going to happen next.  The music in the movie is pretty nice too.  It is different than what you would think but it is very fitting.  So sit back, relax and enjoy.  You are going to be very happy with this movie.  Matthew never disappoints (except in Magic Mike)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very good , true Gresham  would  tell my friends and family to read it  I think I have read all his books.<br /><br />garis
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|My 8 year old niece was begging me to rent this.  I really didn't want her watching it but I would rather her watch it with me than any of her other family members.  Thankfully there were some jokes that went over her head, and even mine too.  But it was a decent and kind of cute movie.  I would watch it again.  I probably wouldn't pay to watch it again, but I would watch it again.  Beware of the profanity.  If you do not like profanity or have children in the room while you are watching this, be prepared to use the mute button often.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I like this app. Does everyone w/ crash/freezing/etc issues routinely go to Preferences and clear the cache? U should.  ALSO... backing out of a streaming vid doesn't take 20sec for me...I hit the bck arrow, pull bck arrow up again and tap it a 2ND TIME and VOILA..vid closes.<br />  Having to sign in after every cache clearing is frustrating but hey, the vids dwnload...I cant find a single app that does so anymore on my android phone. I'm just happy to have this on my kindle.
B004FP1WX0|1.0|Although there are similarities with what I have been through in life, I did not like this movie.  I like Catfish the TV Show, and I had seen quite a few episodes before I decided to watch this movie.  I had a weird feeling from the beginning of this movie.  It was just extremely creepy.  Nev running around without a shirt on most of the movie and being extremely hairy was not very easy on the eyes either.  I could have definitely done without those parts.  I became physically ill for 3 days, beginning immediately during a certain part of the movie, that I do not think I can disclose in the review.  This movie was just too creepy.  I will stick to the TV Show, I believe it is better for educational purposes.  The movie was like a horror movie for me and my 8 year old niece.  We both had nightmares after watching this movie.  I still have nightmares about it and they continuously show this movie on MTV.  Thanks, just another channel that has nothing on because they keep replaying this  movie.  Take my advice:  DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY TO BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE.  IT IS NOT WORTH IT.  Just wait and catch it on MTV.  It's on at least every 3 days.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I would recommend this book wholeheartedly.  It has the ability to effect change in the way we see ourselves.  I know it did with me.  Anita's sharing of her experience and the clarity she gained is a gift for those of us who put undue and unrealistic pressure on ourselves everyday without realizing how it is affecting our lives.  Thank you Anita, for sharing your life and near death experience with us.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I am absolutely thrilled with the way this book panned out...I am so excited to read the next book in this series....I love the story line in this series...totally unexpected...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is everything that you want in a basic calculator. I would recommend this for someone who wants or needs a simple calculator. This is also a great app for any type if tablet or kindle. I would definitely recommend this app for anyone.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is the most best book I ever read<br />This book is rated 10for one reason because it is awsome
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Need to update! Google play has swiftkey 4 now with the new flow feature! Come on! Great app, just waiting on amazon since i  bought it here!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Reading this book from the start was sending, and the starting of the climax caught my attention. The ending was surprising and leaving me wondering what's going to happen next.<br /><br />This book was amazing and intense. Very dramatic and thrilling.<br />I liked the climax of the book, and how it was organized into a love story. I didn't like how it made the characters fall apart at the ending, and the love fading surprisingly quick.
0385333846|4.0|Be aware that it might not be the exact look of the book that is pictured. But regardless its Slaughter-house
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne your are the most AWESOME author EVER and let me say I am 10 years old and I can be picky about books but the hunger games was the BEST book EVER! I can't wait to read catching fire!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This movie is great I rented it and watched it through Instant Amazon Player and I suggest that you watch this with good internet connection otherwise it lags and the picture isn't clear.
B0000AEKCG|3.0|Note: The three star rating is for the CD pressing itself and not the performance which is five star all the way.<br />I ordered this used from a UK seller and thought I was getting either a Dojo (I didn't know it was sourced from vinyl until later) or a Griffin. What I (over) paid for was a Rock Fever. As has been mentioned is that the Rock Fever is taken from vinyl. It is... Acceptable, but only just. I'm wondering what they used to transfer. It sounds like a slightly worn copy on a Technics table with an entry level Audio Technica, Ortofon or Grado cart mounted to it. All I can really say is... That's the best you could do?? I could do (and have done) better than that. To add insult to injury they used the Dave Brock version of \\"Motorhead\\" for the bonus instead of looking for a 45 that has the original Lemmy version. This has all the hallmarks of a second rate pirate copy. How this got licensed is beyond me. For those wondering why EMI never remastered \\"Warrior...\\" I can only speculate on three things: a) Legal issues (not very likely) b) Missing master tapes (very likely) c) Master tapes deteriorated from sticky shed syndrome (just as likely). Why no one else (besides Griffin) used the second gen Atco tapes is beyond me. Anyhow...  Buyer beware.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|My wife loves this movie and it was a nice gift for her. Watching it with her I found I liked it too due to the quick and witty dialect throughout.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|it was a free online electronic book im not going to complain at all. it was a fast a free download
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Kids loved this and so did I. Seemed to be for kids, but heavy topic. Fast paced and fun throughout.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|it was a free online electronic book im not going to complain at all. it was a fast a free download
B000XUBC5E|4.0|Once I picked it up, it was hard to put down. Harlem Coven knows how to pull you in and keep you there until the very end.
B000I9W08I|5.0|I had never seen this movie before so I was thoroughly entertained.  I love Streisands voice and singing and also happen to think she is funny.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Downloaded  to my tablet for use when traveling and not online.  Standard game very easy to move around and works smoothly.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Loved this movie because the star did not take the easy way out in the end and showed the value of telling the truth.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|This movie should have had a better disclaimer attached at the outset, as in, LOOSELY based on H.G. Wells’ book of the same name.  The amount of tampering done here definitely requires an explanation of intent.  Obviously, they had no intention of being faithful to the novel or the 1960 film adaptation of it.  Besides the changing of names and places, not to mention an entire race of beings, they altered the outcome of the story, making one wonder why they even bothered to keep the title and its association with Wells.  (They can mention from now until doomsday that the great-grandson of Wells’ directed this movie, sacrilege is still sacrilege whether done by a stranger or a family member.)<br />Taken as is, we have a renamed hero (Guy Pearce) given to rants about men in bowler hats when he isn’t playing at being the quintessential absent-minded professor.  He lives in a palatial home (on a professor’s salary?) packed with too many unnecessary props that have absolutely no bearing on the story at hand.  His trip into the future borders on lazy, especially considering he has speed dials at his disposal.  When he finally settles in the future, the greatest departure from the book and subsequent film takes place.  A madhouse action sequence comes down to a matter of fisticuffs, hardly the cerebral exercise the book dealt with.  Let’s just say this movie version steampunked the book to death and let it go at that.<br /><br />I will say I loved the design of the time machine.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Though i love this series, i do wish that some aspects had more details. So aspects about Christians live would have been nicer if they had been developed more.
B00130VLZ4|2.0|I found this case not very practice when you are using for sightseeing. I bought an unofficial one to replace it.
1449415881|5.0|He asks for a new Dilbert Calendar every single year. Love the antics of Wally and Dilbert. Printing quality is always superb.
B00884GR0W|3.0|I don't really understand this game and how to play it well. I am not sure how to go about getting help.  I have never played anything similar so that may be my first problem.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Good<br />definition but inconvenient to find specific  definitions. Should have a  more easy approach towards finding words and definitely should have a highlighting setting
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this novel. Hard to put it down. Most definitely one of Sparks best books yet. Can't wait to go see the film.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The last CPU cooling fan I bought sounded like a freaking airplane taking off. This is nice and quiet. The instructions were a little weird, and might have been easier to understand for someone who has more experience putting together computers.
1451695195|4.0|Interesting premise! Probably without his &#34;out of body&#34; experience we cannot really be sure if this is reality or a really life like dream. I'm  hedging my bet that his experience is real - that makes the uncertain future into an expectant desire!
B006TVQTHW|4.0|Good case, plenty of space, easy to open, nice cord control, power supply on the bottom for cooling purposes. Only problem was that I didn't have the proper connections for USB3 on the motherboard that I bought, so the front jacks don't work.
B007SGM084|5.0|Good read,  smutty but very witty writing.  Couldn't put it down while sitting at poolside. Enjoyed it. Will definitely read again.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|i like the fact that you can make multiple notebooks for different subjects. It makes it easier than carrying around alot of multiple paper notebooks. The only thing i wish it had was a better way thant he small paint app to take math figures for math notes. Otherwise, its a good product.
0316077046|5.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal and I am not a teenager. The storyline is classic, forbidden love but with a twist and vampires and wolves are not involved.
B007N85POS|4.0|it is as fun as the originals. Yet it still shows originality in the theme that is close to the movies. I have only started the challenges are not too easy and not too hard. My neice and nephew take over whenever they come over. Definelty family friendly and a good way to burn time.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|The more I read about the Holocaust the more I am amazed at the strength of oppressed peoples. The book is well written, the story strong and compelling and the life lessons incredible. Heart wrenching and informative, it provides a real look at the suffering endured during that period as well as the weaknesses of those untouched by the tragedy.
B0086700CM|5.0|this  is the best app ever i have never seen a better app.i love tis app considering the other stupid games that i have downloaded
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you can get beyond the overuse of sex and sexuality, the book does have substance. If you read between the line, you begin to feel that the real point here is not kinky sex but love.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is a wonderful game. Great graphics and fun. I got it free as an app of the day but it's well worth the 99 cents! Now just need more levels please :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this app! But if its for young kids why is the person runing from the cops? But its fun.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|RELLY great book one of the best books I have read<br />Hope the auther makes more wonder books!!! The book is funny to!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I enjoyed the game somewhat.  It was rather short, and the ending was not satisfactory.  I wish that the ending didn't end quite so abruptly without completing the story. It left off on a cliffhanger.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great. I said &quot;THIS IS AN INTERESTING,FUN,AND AWESOME. WAY BETTER THEN Slenderman CHAPTER ONE: ALONE<br />GET IT! IT SAVES UNLIKE THE LIGHT EDITION.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a brilliant game there is a lot to play if you have Facebook log in then you get 5000 coins which really helps. Good graphics and a really addictive game
B0076DELIG|4.0|Great story, easy read.  Michael Connelly does it again.  I hope the Harry Bosch stories never end.  Can't wait for the next one.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I read the reviews before reading this book and was worried that I'd be a sobbing mess throughout. I'll admit, I teared up in the beginning and towards the end the tears were flowing pretty good. At least I had a warning though.<br /><br />This story captured my attention from the beginning and held it throughout. I love how Gayle Forman would do flashbacks to give us history of Mia, Adam, the family, etc. without actually doing flashbacks per se.<br /><br />Mia adores her family!! I respect this so much because I am the same way; now. When I was seventeen I don't know that I would have preferred go on a 'journey' with their family (little brother included) on a snowday rather than sleeping! I like Mia is independent, but she recognizes that its ok to lean on loved ones for support.<br /><br />Adam is just... everything you'd want in a boyfriend. He's sweet, but not overly so. He's honest even though its not always what someone wants to hear. The way he expresses his love; swoon!<br /><br />Mia and Adam's relationship isn't perfect and I love when an author writes that way because its reality... but they worked out their problems; they didn't run away. Well, except that one time...<br /><br />Kim is the definition of BFF! She can hold her own, that's for sure.<br /><br />I loved this story regardless of how heartwrenching it was!
B008H08XW2|4.0|Love the digital download feature!  This cd is now on both my iphone and my ipad.  Its my first Maroon 5 cd and I will build this part of my collection.
B0043VDIAG|3.0|For a book that started out as a very slow and evidently straightforward love story, it picked up pace and action and suspense in the second half to such a degree that I relented and gave it three stars.  The main characters in the first half of the book were dull and lifeless - Alex and \\"Katie\\" but as the plot developed we got introduced to more of the \\"townsfolk\\" and the book became less of a task to read.  The second half shone (by comparison) as we met the main antagonist but even though many bestsellers have been published along similar lines (even the great Stephen King wrote ROSE MADDER with a scene so brilliantly gruesome I still haven't forgotten it after fifteen years) I must confess I did not see the end to this one coming.  On a positive, emotions run high at various points throughout the book and I even had to turn away from my kindle a couple of times to regain my composure.<br /><br />So a three star rating for this one.  As i stated earlier; I could not see what all the fuss was about in the first half but keep faith in the book and you will be rewarded.  A little.<br /><br />Greggorio (LR)
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I have the original Kindle Fire.  Amazon notes said would not be compatible, but it WORKS GREAT.<br />Using \\"in house\\", so don't need the $ add on for away use.<br /><br />Think of it more as a really good remote, while \\"couch surfing\\"
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I don't know how anyone who claims to enjoy the song of ice and fire saga could not love this book. Pure genius. Martin has created an entire realm of people and places, that makes me wish the series would never end, the characters have such stirring personification that they have become part of my world, invoking feelings for the characters. I love this book, although a slow start recapping the previous portion of the story, I love every sentence of this series. This is a must read for any fantasy reader!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a really fun game, with good graphics. Kind of reminds me of Clue, which I like. It's definitely  a game that'll keep you entertained.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a fantastic creative game, but it pales in comparison to it's PC counterpart.  It seems there are a number of items and play modes that are not available in the PE; it makes the game seem incomplete.  Still, it's great fun and will keep you entertained for hours.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love your pinning items that interest me to find that others are following my interest also.  An excellent means of storing recipes, places to go or even the latest fashion (in living color).  Would highly recomment &#34;Pinterest&#34; app to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I watched the movie with my two youngest daughters, and we talked about how great we all thought it was, my girls said, Dad you should read the books. So my literary journey  begins with book one. I have truly enjoyed it. The pacing and character development are wonderful. And I thoroughly enjoy listening to Katniss' thoughts rather than guessing during the movie. Bravo Suzanne! You've helped a 54 year old dad connect with his daughters through literature.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This the best app I ever played really challenging and etc if you are looking for something challenging but still simple get this
B005LAII1C|5.0|This was something my son wanted for Christmas, and with him being 20, I don't know what to get him. At least he told me he wanted this
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this game takes up a lot of time so if you are bored one day just sit down and the time will pass so quickly you might look at the clock and realize it's bedtime already
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome addicting game!!! Lets you play with facenook friends. It will keep you entertained for hours. And with new challenges every day, you wont get bored!
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I have all his CDs and this was just another amazing addition to my Josh Groban collection. I really enjoyed it, didn't expect anything less I hope e will be doing a tour of it soo.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I had been hoping to discover a new (for me) author. Most of the ones where I could read anything they wrote and be sure I'd like it were no longer with us. This and red shirts lead me to happily feel I can settle in with lots of books to lose myself in. Sci if with just enough tech to make it feel sci fi but nothing that lost me or made me confused. And touches of humor to break up the battles.  Week written and a definitely compelling story. You will feel connected to the characters and care about them!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you haven't seen this, but you have seen the movie Gosford Park and liked it, it's a good indication that you will like this series. This series focuses more on the ongoing relationships between characters than Gosford Park did, but the feel is very similar and there's even some shared actors between the two movies.
B003XURDAY|5.0|Well, what can be said about *Blade Runner* that hasn't been said already?  I know: Bryant tells Deckard the same information about the replicants twice.  Why?  I suspect this reflects script changes.  But it doesn't matter: this film is glorious.  I saw it in the theater in 1982, amazed the theater wasn't full.  I read the book first.  What an experience.  The movie is even better today, thanks to this version, the first ever completely decided by its director.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a good story. The violence is hard to watch at times. I look forward to watching the sequel.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|There is so much time wasted going back and forth in this game I got dizzy.<br />The detective is a loony tune not picking up the things she should be able to pick up along the way... but no! You have to go back and forth to get the items.<br /><br />I guess that is to make the game last longer but it just irritated me having to click the back arrow over and over and over again.<br /><br />Also on my Kindle Fire HD it was hard getting into the barn, I had to tap a bunch of times every time the game took me there.<br /><br />If you like to repeat steps over and over again and click the back arrow hundreds of times you'll like this game.<br /><br />3/4 ths  or more of this game is just going in circles.
B005SFS4ZU|2.0|Well, mayabe I am Phantom-ed Out.<br />VEry pretty and of course, beautifully done, but for those of us who discovered the one and only original...anything is a little bit of a let down.
1419705849|5.0|My son and daughter shared this (probably the only thing they have ever shared!) and they both had it read within a week.  Very few books illicit that kind of a response and reading enthusiasm in my kids - therefore this is definitely a 5 star book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Now i cant wait to see the movie.  Hope it can stand up to the book.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I didn't think it could be any better than Beautiful Creatures !  I couldn't put it down AGAIN!  The writing is so vivid I could see it happening in my minds eye. Can't wait for this movie.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Totally awesome, wish it had different types of puzzles though, the rotation of the cube is awesome and being able to pair two  from any side is very creative...now more levels or different types of cubes would be awesome!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|2nd season is every bit as good as the first season.<br />Great story line, great actors, great costumes and scenery
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This second book didn't keep you on the edge as much<br />as the first.<br />You started to realize that it was for pure entertainment.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I am all for smut, and I am ALL for BDSM. But this book is poorly written, unrealistic, and just.... ew.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Shades one was a real &#34;shocker&#34; to me.<br />Not knowing what to expect it surprised me.<br />I think for only adults......this book was<br />interesting and surprising.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is good. The kids like building up points to get new games, and I like that you have to earn more games instead of getting everything up front. Some of the games are challenging even for adults and a few have controls so hard we can't win.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This third book of Shades was a little<br />bit more down to earth.<br />I enjoyed these books for i take them for what i<br />think they are meant to be.  Pure entertainment.
B000A2UBN4|3.0|This is a movie I would not ordinarily watch; however, I had to watch it before showing it to my granddaughter, 20 yrs. old.  She can handle it, since I prepared her for the gore she might see.  It is definitely for older teens.  Yet, we are Christians, and are careful about the films we watch.  Caution is advised!  The acting is superb.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Have always like Nicholas Sparks novels.<br />This one did not disappoint me.<br />It keeps you interested and has a good<br />action ending.
1475143389|4.0|I just started the plan in the book and its going great so far. I'll try to come back and update my review a ways into the plan.<br />I read the book in a night! A lot of this stuff you can find elsewhere but its really nice to have it all summarized in this book. Definitely a few things I had never heard about before though. And for such a great price for my kindle app! Highly Recommended.<br /><br />The only downside to this book is lack of citations for certain information. I've been reading Mike's responses to a lot of people though and it seems like he's working on that and he'll be able to update the book (easy for those with kindle!) soon. I would give it 5 stars hands down if there was more references and sources.
193413712X|5.0|I loved this book and have recommended it to many friends.  Well written.  Heart warming.  Particularly loved the father... and his relationship with time.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This is a great movie for your dvd collection! We are happy that we purchased this, just to have during the holidays!
B0035G1K7S|4.0|After having my DVD copy confiscated by my kid brother, I decided to order the Blu-ray copy. The feature is solid, fun to watch, artsy, and shines a little more light on the dynamic between Jack and Meg behind the curtain. Although there are a few performances throughout, this is not a live show film. If you're looking for something like that, check out 'Under Black Pool Lights.'<br /><br />My only complaint is that the audio levels frustrate me a bit. Jack and Meg are very quiet people, which makes me turn up the volume quite a bit, but when the film cuts to a live performance, things can get a little too loud and I find myself adjusting the volume throughout the film. Pick it up anyways though! Very good! A+! Check it out!
B002U0KHMY|4.0|I received my package in a reasonable amount of time.  There were no problems with the discs themselves.  The case has a few issues with the discs staying inside without some jiggling the case.  As far as the show, it is amazing!  I am happy that I can watch the episodes many times.
1616550414|5.0|I've been a huge Zelda fan since I was five years old and my parents bought me A Link to the Past on a whim, and I've been waiting for something like this book to come along for what ages. It's finally here and I'm not the least bit disappointed. When it comes to entertainment, like video games, movies, books, TV shows, music, I tend to want to know everything that I'm interested in. I buy movies strictly so I can watch the special features over and over again, and now Zelda has something just like that.<br /><br />While the first third of the book is filled with the production history of Skyward Sword, the remaining two thirds cover the other entries in the series pretty well. Character development artwork is accompanied by development notes. The best part is seeing how characters evolved, there's even a little Tim Burton-esque Midna character design in the Twilight Princess section.<br /><br />It's very heavy, and the hardcover feel extremely solid. The design on the cover is a metallic shiny gold, which is very cool. If you're a Zelda fan, this will go great with your collection. If you're a video game fan in general, you might take an interest to just see how things were developed. All in all, I highly recommend.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|I got this item I purchased in great time, barely a week from the purchase date.  However, when I opened the shipping packaging I found my several problems.  1 was the sticker residue on the DVD sleeve.  Personally, I like the artwork and packaging on a DVD as much as the DVD itself, and I'm sure I'm not alone on this.  2, one of the two clasps on the actual case was broken so the case does not close properly, making it rather difficult to put back into the sleeve without destroying the edges and just overall a pain in the butt because the case should snap shut and it does not.  3, when I opened the case, one of the discs was actually out of it's holder.  That can probably be dismissed to shipping, but still it's annoying because I don't know if that happened to damage the disc in any way.  The disc does play excellent but the packaging was unacceptable.  The seller informed everyone the item was in \\"awesome condition\\".  This is not the case.  This DVD is in \\"average\\" condition at best.
0765317389|5.0|Perfect condition and fast shipping. I purchased it for my boyfriend for Valentines Day and he really enjoyed having a hardcover of one of his favorite books.

0784011176|5.0|Anyone who loves Anna Paquin, this movie is a must see!<br />This was Anna's first roll as an actor.  I highly recommend this<br />movie, but adult supervision is to be taken into consideration<br />because of adult love scenes and one bloody violance scene.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|I can not remember whether we bought this on Amazon new or used, but what we got had no flaws.
B000J103PC|5.0|I originally bought this movie because Meryl Streep is in it. I also like the fact that Anne Hathaway was in it. I think the storyline is excellent and anyone would love this movie.
1400067820|1.0|There is no erudition in this book. The jumbled ideas are simply result of ill formed thoughts and idea of references. Consider this: antifragility. A normal person would simply call this unscrupulous. The recurring mafia motif is obviously from a Simpson's cartoon episode. The author rails against frauds while being the biggest one himself. Other delusions of grandeur can be seen through ret-conning his childhood history (reading 60+ classics per week), subtle promotion of racism (one must refer to the past glories of Ersatz Lebanon, amusingly overseas Lebanese population exceed existing ones by several factors).<br />The health and biology advice is the worst kind of &#34;broscience&#34; frequently spouted by internet steroid users forums.<br />I admire the chutzpah of the author accusing others of been frauds while trying to appear not to be one himself.<br />Word of advice: Please stick to your own bailiwick of options and Black-Scholes, the peons are not that dumb.<br /><br />--by nootropics user
B000AP04NI|5.0|This has memorable music including the song with the words &#34;The corn is as high as an elephants thigh...&#34;. Based in Oklahoma farmland, it centers around a young man and his girl friend with the complication of another fellow trying to take the pretty young lady away for his own.
B009O2XY12|5.0|My favorite feature of this game is the &#34;5 lives&#34; feature. Once you've failed 5 times you have to wait for your lives to recharge (30 minutes per life). This ensured that I never played the game for a guilt inducing length of time. I That's a great feature as far as I'm concerned.<br />Of course you can purchase more lives - I realize this feature is a money making scheme, but it obviously didn't work on me.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Wow! A wonderful return to the musicals of my younger years. It is full of appropriate music for the particular scene, including one musical score in varied tempo with different words for two different situations. Yes, it is also a love story.
0425263916|5.0|I know I love a book when I can't wait to get back to it, and I read it fast.  This was the case!  Hot Sex. Great love story.  Twists and turns.  Just loved it. Can't wait for her third installment of the series in June 2013.  This is a must read.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|My oh my is this great! There's zip lines and railroad carts. It is so much fun! You can collect gems to save your life when you die. Once you get an objective you get so determined to get it. I loved the first temple run but this one is so much cooler. I can't even play the first one because this one is so good. Get this app because you will love it.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|The movie was in perfect condition. Exactly as advertised.  The cast really surprised me.  I didn't realize so many A list actors were in it.  It kept my 10 and 12 interested as well as adults.
0060012234|3.0|I have been meaning to read this book for years, but somehow never got around to it. Perhaps my as yet undiscovered sixth sense knew I was going to find it preachy and kind of depressing. Which I did.<br /><br />Geography Club is one of the classics of the GLBTQI YA genre. For a reason, all the issues raised in the book are very valid, and they are still valid now, 10 years after its release. I will admit, I don't much care for the other \\"classics\\" either.<br /><br />Which is not to say I didn't like it. I did, for the most part. I just don't like to be made to feel all the feels, okay? This book is kind of heartbreaking. It's about find friendship in unlikely places, about being yourself, about not judging a book by its cover, and about the pain of having your delusions stripped away.<br /><br />Russel Middlebrook has never told anyone that he's gay. Until he enters a gay chatroom and finds someone from his very own school. He's not alone! Not only that, the other person is the super hot baseball star whose crotch Russel tries not to stare at in the locker-room.<br /><br />Soon he discovers that there are even more gay kids at Goodkind High School than he ever imagined. Hell, one of his best friends, Min, is bisexual and has been secretly dating a girl for three years.<br /><br />The gay kids band together and start the Geography Club, a place where they can be themselves for a few hours a week. Only, there is another student at the school who has the same idea, and that sets off nasty rumors about who the gay kid may be. And of course, when no evidence can be found, all fingers point to the sad, loner kid no one likes anyway. Insert copious amounts of bullying.<br /><br />Overall, I liked most of the characters. Russel was engaging. Brian the sad, loner kid was unexpectedly amazing and wise beyond his years. Min was badass and kind of awesome.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. I didn't want to stop reading but I also did not want to finish it. The characters were written as if you knew them. I hope this author writes another book soon.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Absolutely adore this game. It is so addicting and a great way to kill some time. Whoever created this game is a genius.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Great love story, couldn't put it down!  Fairytale perfect, with a few fun twists here and there kept it interesting!
B009NYF2ES|4.0|Outstanding blu ray of this classic film! If you are a lover Dorothy and her friends you must have this in your collection!
B008476HBM|5.0|These are not my type of books. But I loved it anyway! The whole concept of 'I hate you so much' turned 'I love you so much(even though I don't want to)', is my favorite. I can't get enough of their bickering and denial of their feelings and everything. I may not usually read this sort of thing or pay attention to the author, but I love this particular story!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Action packed, great visuals and all my favorite Avengers in one film!  Of course I will show my age and state that Emma Peel is still my favorite &#34; Avenger &#34; and if you have to ask &#34; who is Emma Peel&#34; you are too young!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husbands favorite! These episodes don't come on TV very often<br />so when I saw this I had to have it!
B00846REIS|3.0|Hmm ... This wasn't too bad. It was definitely better than that other book which shall not be named.<br /><br />While it is said that this book is a \\"knock off\\" of that other book, I beg to differ. It does deal with the same themes but it doesn't cross the lines that the other book did. It didn't go above and beyond and annoy the s*** out of me, it didn't piss me off - much - and it didn't come off as blah and uninteresting. It also lacked that a Hero who treated the heroine as if she was his property and without a mind of her own. It didn't come off as degrading or forceful. The heroine in this story was woman enough to make her own decisions even if - in my opinion - they weren't always the best, but at least she got to make a choice in the matter.<br /><br />Eve wasn't a virgin, she wasn't the same age as that other girl but she was not old either. She was a privileged 20-something year old who had an education and wasn't clumsy/ditzy/insecure/stupid. She wasn't blown away by everything that Gideon was/is. She was taken by his very good looks and the aura that surrounded him, but she wasn't a doormat who did everything he said either.<br /><br />I will admit that Gideon, too had his issues but he wasn't \\"grateful\\" for what happened to him when he was younger, he was not glad that it made him the man he was, and essentially thank the person caused him this pain. No, he was angry - the normal reaction.<br /><br />Also, the writing was loads better, the editing was superb, and the entire flow of the story was a million times better. In the end, though, the reason why I didn't give it more than 3-stars is because I just liked it. That's all - it didn't blow me away and make me go, \\"Oh wow!\\" It just... was what it was.<br /><br />I'll just say that I most likely will be reading the next book in the series because Bared to You left me with questions that need to be answered and it also ended a little too abruptly for me. I was reading along very good then I realized that it was coming to an end and nothing was resolved! I'm so very tired of unnecessary cliffhangers.as resolved! I'm so very tired of unnecessary cliffhangers.

B003UESJH4|3.0|I felt this product worked just fine. the only complaint I have is that it was listed as the edited version, but the dvd that was shipped was not edited.  Didn't work for a family situation.

B00A3XWAU2|5.0|Snakecharmer is an excellent album by any measure. The songs snap to attention, Chris Ousey sings his ass off, guitarists Mick Moody and Laurie Wisefield sound even better than you'd guess, you suddenly realize how much of Whitesnake's signature sound came from Neil Murray's bass, Adam Wakeman sounds much closer to the Lord than his pop, and Harry James hits the traps with a commanding, cozy beat. In fact, this record is going to turn tons of heads and put plenty asses into seats when the band hits the road.<br /><br />The band's veteran players have great resumes - Mick Moody and Neil Murray were at the creation of one of hard rock's finest ever moments, the original Whitesnake. Chosen by David Coverdale while the singer was still twirling the mic stand for Deep Purple, the pair with them brought enough blues rock bluster to keep comparisons to Coverdale's purple past to a minimum and allowed Whitesnake to be its own band. Neil Murray - upon listening to this record, you will know just how much he meant to the overall sound of Whitesnake, and why he has been the 'go to' guy for guitarslingers the likes of John Sykes, Tony Iommi, Gary Moore and my old boss and friend, Michael Schenker. Harry James is best known as Thunder's thunder, but he's beat the tubs for Terraplane, Magnum, Ian Gillan, Graham Bonnet, and many others - he's as close as we have to the distinctive, slamming backbeat of Cozy Powell, and he is just exemplary on this outing. I don't exactly know how Laurie Wisefield has remained one of rock's greatest unknown guitarists, but that's a relative supposition - after his time in Wishbone Ash, he was Tina Turner's axe man, he's played with a literal who's who of rock greats such as Joe Cocker, Roger Daltrey, and Meat Loaf before settling down in this millenium as a permanent member of the hugely successful Queen musical, We Will Rock You, which has been seen by over 2.5 million satisfied fans. Like I said, unknown is a relative term. Adam Wakeman is getting to be as well known as his Yes-man father, Rick. His time with Yes, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, The Strawbs, and his own excellent band Headspace tells you much about his talents.<br /><br />Chris Ousey may be the least known of this charming bunch, but it's largely due to his well weathered vocal chops that makes this record much more than a coattail follower. The last thing I wanted to hear here was a Coverdale clone, and while Ousey approaches nodding his hat to the past, this may be a matter of singing and writing songs with Moody and Murray more than any obvious attempt at giving the king snake his due. If, by chance, you heard the singer's 2011 solo debut, Rhyme & Reason, you'll know that he's his own man, and a fine, fine singer and songwriter. If forced to compare him to anyone, I'd say and earthier, edgier version of Mr. Big's Eric Martin, but that's only if forced. It takes a helluva voice to be heard over this glorious din, and Ousey makes himself a star with this outing.<br /><br />Naming the band Snakecharmer is absolutely the only bone I have to pick with this outfit, as my fear is that the \\"Snake\\" connotation may cause some to not take them as seriously as they should be taken, but I'm guessing the quality of this record will soon have this notion rendered moot. I accept that Moody and Murray were a part of that puzzle which is huge - one listen and you'll see - while these tracks are obviously 'Snake oriented, how could they not, as Moody wrote such hits as Slow an' Easy, Fool For Your Loving, and many others with Coverdale. This record can stand beside any Whitesnake record, and stand proud.<br /><br />Wisely avoiding any sense of cliche, the band is born with a nicely jangling, strummed acoustic and an unadorned vocal for its first verse, before the band jumps in and thickens things up. My Angel is a great introduction, and when you get to the bridge, you're going to be sold - what sounds like a rollicking hit single suddenly turns east and a beautiful and huge slab of synth sits wonderfully under Ousey's switch to a minor modality and it's over too soon, but not sadly, as it is replaced with one of the most majestic pieces of slide guitar I've heard in ages, only to melt into a sexy harmony duet between Moody and Wisefield before resolving into a snarling return to the final verse. An auspicious beginning, indeed.<br /><br />Accident Prone is up next, and it's closer to the band's musical past, especially when you hear Neil Murray's pumping bass line - his bass marries a drum kit as well as any, and perhaps this was as much the key to Whitesnake's signature sound as the vocals and guitars. Ousey is given more to melody than the blues, and his voice is so distinct that again any comparisons are fairly senseless. The band produced this disc themselves, and the decades of experience are obvious - it's rich, organic, and I can't imagine that this is pretty near what the band will sound like on tour. The arrangements keep moving and never sound stale - the guitar solo is straight out of the early days of Bad Company (think Can't Get Enough), and will have you smiling from ear to ear. They haven't reinvented the wheel, but they've produced a damned fine one, and it rolls quite fabulously.<br /><br />Great intros are a wonderful thing, and the first 30 seconds of To The Rescue serves as a reminder that Moody also wrote Slow and Easy - mind you, this is a bird of another feather, but the lineage is clear. The thump of the bass, the slide guitars gently sweeping the song back to the firm beat, and this is mid-tempo bliss. Wakeman's organ work is masterful - he's got chops galore, but he knows how and when to pick his spots. Here, he's providing the underpinning and it's perfect. I'll tell you now, every solo slot on this record is nigh on perfect - tasty, tuneful, and melodic in the extreme. These guys aren't just veterans, they're playing like they have something to prove, and are full of proper piss & vinegar.<br /><br />Falling Leaves is a classic piece of British hard rock balladry - the background vocals harken back to the days of Mott The Hoople, a bit of Queen, and this ends up being a pretty good road map to the pop majesty of the best of Def Leppard. My litmus test for records that harken back to the '70s and '80s is to through it on a shuffle with a couple of albums from that esteemed era, and I must say I did that, and Snakecharmer would have done quite well in any era. Oh yeah, and more sweet guitar solos.<br /><br />Slow simmering is a specialty with the 'Charmers, and A Little Rock and Roll is a cool percolator. Bluesy melodic British rock - if you dig it, you'll dig it. The acoustic guitars make another appearance, prefacing a wobbly bit of Leslie-fied laid back picking that is taken over by a nice piece of wah-wah work. The ending gets expansive with huge keyboards, epic drumming, and more sumptuous guitars. They lay it on pretty thick, but that's how we like it.<br /><br />Turn Of The Screw is a barrel house rocker - sounding a bit like Aerosmith when they still meant something. This may have fit well on Get Your Wings as the piano and guitars slip and slide underneath Ousey's wailing. Before things get to familiar some clever songwriting turns things around for a cool twist, and then there's more great guitaring - Wisefield and Moody sound like they have a blast playing together, and I'll take all they can deliver.<br /><br />The Ghost of Whitesnake raises its head on Smoking Gun perhaps more than anywhere on the record. It's very Coverdale-esque, but not in the sense that it apes anything in particular - it was bound to happen, and actually it's not a bit painful, as the band throws in so many cool riffs, fills, stops and starts that I can't really be mad.<br /><br />As melodic AOR goes, this is some stellar magic. You can tell with every beat, with every note that this bunch was there at the beginning. Stand Up is a classy number that makes me remember Foreigner's glory days, and Murray's heavily chorused fretless bass solo sections are great ear candy - this is another one that will come across great live. It is my hope these fellows find a way to make it onto a lot of stages in 2013, as this stuff all sounds like it was written for the stage.<br /><br />Guilty As Charged - the riff sounds familiar, the organ provides the perfect perch, and they're off and running. One of the band's finest qualities is in knowing when to push, and when to pull - there's no ball hogging, and it's teamwork all the way. Ousey is excellent again, and while this may be the record's weakest cut, it still sits well in the rotation.<br /><br />The band turns it up for Nothing To Lose, a rolling thunder piece that steams from beginning to end with classic British brawn. the guitarists toss phrases back and forth quite nimbly, Ousey is still shouting his lungs out, and this is as fine as any album cut from their hallowed past.<br /><br />Cover Me In You is a standout track with which to wrap up the proceedings, and after an intro that will have you thinking Lizzy, but with a solid backbeat instead of Brian Downey's Irish swing, this covers a lot of familiar territory in the best sense - again, Snakecharmer is not Shakespeare but what they are is a charming and exuberant bunch of rock vets who know exactly what they are doing it.<br /><br />Snakecharmer is a charmer - a much better album than I had even hoped for, and I hope this is just the beginning. This bunch appears to supply rock solid material in a very smooth and easy fashion, and I can only see them improving with experience and age, which is a hell of a thing to be saying about a band with well over a hundred years of combined experience under their belts, but I'm saying it. Everyone here is at the very tops of their games, and I hope this is only the beginning of a long engagement.<br /><br />Join me at Rock Guitar Daily - Tony Conley
B005LAII80|5.0|I'm going to start &#34;There&#34; so get over it.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone made an excellent Judge Dredd -For the first maybe, ten minutes he was on screen.  He was large, imposing and although his appearance was a little comical (as in over the top) it was okay.  Judge Dredd is a comic and is also dressed kind of funny.  But after he sentences Rob Schneider to prison, the movie quickly nose dives brought up only by Armand Assante's 'Rico.'  Who I loved to watch.  That was as good as that movie got.<br /><br />Dredd with Karl Urban in the titular role is miles ahead better than the Stallone version.  It's violent, Dredd is a violent comic.  Over the top.  Again, the comic is at times.  And awesome, again, the comic...<br /><br />This version of Dredd takes a different approach to this type of movie, where the earlier film version took Dredd and put him in a larger universe, quest, where he was out to save the world (Mega-City One) this version locks him in a building with a recruit and basically throws only one scenario at him, where if anything it's just a fight to survive, or to reach the bad guy and eliminate one threat whose disaperance isn't likely to change the world all that much.<br /><br />This version was more compelling, more interesting, and without Rob Schneider more tasteful.  This movie deserves a sequel, Karl Urban needs to make more money.  If I was a billionaire I would fund three more of these movies.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is THE best reading app ever. I love the look of the pages and the fact that I can turn my pages using my volume buttons. Keep up the great work Amazon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so better than before I love it could not get any better.  my aunt even loves it. cant put it down
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|This is THE best brand of wall stickers ever. My princess loves it and it matches her Disney Princess bed perfectly. The decals are big, The jewel stickers sparkle on the wall... and you get a lot for the money.
0374214913|5.0|My sister-in-law bought this for me as a Christmas present (off my Kindle wishlist), and it was a great selection on her part. My summary is that it crosses Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon and Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, but with a much lighter touch. We have high-tech (Google, Ruby, Erlang, Hadoop), as well as a secrete gnostic society with its own book of secrets (encrypted, of course).<br /><br />The plot weaves all these together to produce a fun, engaging read that doesn't disappoint. I highly recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I haven't powered through a book like this in years! Cool that a security guard on the new Hawaii Five-0 was reading it last night.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a great weather app. It's week designed and offers fairly accurate weather information. Features on the current version's map make it easy to pinpoint weather conditions at or near your actual location. THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.<br />  Update just posted on another android market is dreadful. it now dedicates the vast majority of screen space to advertising. Actual weather information on new Android app is very hard to see or access. Some features, particularly on maps, are gone. iOS USERS SHOULD NOT UPDATE UNTIL THEY HAVE CHECKED REVIEWS HERE OF NEW VERSION to make sure that they won't be replacing a great weather app with a miserable ad-delivery app.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|If you are using one camera, this bag is sufficient. Plenty of room and compartments will hold 2-3 extra lenses..Quality is very good. Price is right. If you need room for more than one camera and/or lots of lenses, get a bigger bag.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I couldn't finish this book just because the chapters all seemed disjointed. We begin with the main character living in an orphanage, then move to him as a professional kidnapper, then as a sailor, then on a trip to the USA as a hero etc etc etc. I never got to care for him, and the crazy stories that happen to him seemed too over-the-top and unbelievable. I eventually got bored and moved on to another book.<br /><br />I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:<br /><br />Books I love or at at least really, really like:<br /><br />The Round House<br />The Last Policeman<br />We Need to Talk about Kevin.<br />Tell the Wolves I'm Home<br />When the Emperor Was Divine<br />The History of History<br />The Remains of the Day<br />We Have Always Lived in the Castle<br />The Night Circus<br />Water for Elephants<br />The Sisters Brothers<br />The Poisonwood Bible<br /><br />Books I REALLY hated:<br /><br />The Bear in a Muddy Tutu<br />1Q84<br />The Buddha of Suburbia<br />A Visit from the Goon Squad<br />Sun Storm<br />A Long Way Down<br />When We Were Orphans<br />The Haunting of Hill House<br />The Fault in Our Stars<br />The Orphan Master's Son.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Great movie... the characters are really funny. I love the songs and acapella. Definitely a must see movie if you like musicals and GLEE.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great addicting game for wide range of ages and skill levels. Only complaint is game reset once reached 30 multiplier.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I think this is one of their best album's yet I love Maroon5 and their songs make you really think and appreciate life it's just riveting
B009AP2G26|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best show on TV today. Love the characters and the musical numbers. Especially the old Broadway tunes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very cool nice take should be easier to earn jewels though. for cat dog meow ruff at a just nose hair.
1452101248|4.0|Great pictures, great recipes. This book makes a great gift for anyone looking for innovative ways to create vegetarian dishes.
0345349571|5.0|I'm a big fan of Barbara Tuchman and all that she has written.  I have read about 2/3rds of the books she's written.  I believe my pleasure with reading &#34;A Distant Mirror&#34; has to do with my lack of knowledge of that period of not only European history but also French history.  I highly recommend this book.  I place it high in the my top-10 of history books.
0273710516|5.0|The framework for writing and communicating clearly and effectively is something everyone should learn as part of any high school curriculum, if not earlier.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|As many other are, I'm a big fan of Paris and I liked how Woody Allen used Paris to tell this wonderful little story.  My wife thinks I'm a bit crazy with my attraction to Midnight in Paris.  It just works for me.  On a recent trip to Paris I was able to take my wife to a few of the sights depicted in the movie.  This movie made me laugh and touched my heart and made me long to be back in Paris.
B00992CF6W|5.0|please add lava bucket and water buckets please also amake it so you can change from creative to survivel or the other way around.
0525953728|3.0|I was looking for more from this book.  However, what it had was informative.  I read it quickly and have shared it with two other office friends.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This a suspenseful story,with many twists. Unfortunately, I hated the ending, hence 4 stars!  I would recommend it to friend's still.
B0051BVQFG|4.0|I liked the movie, and the actors they chosed. Scientists have concluded recently that whomever esterrestrial we meet, it could very well be hostile. And, that it is already too late because we launched Voyager with hellos and a map to get to where we are.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Enjoyed the humor and the story behind two lovers we struggle with cancer. Remember to keep the tissues handy when reading
B0063IH60K|5.0|Totally addictive, once you start playing it you can't stop!. Very easy to play great to play while waiting for a train or bus.
B002BJGYU8|4.0|I've missed this show so much, and its still just as good the second time around.<br />The set arrived on time and all the discs work great. I took of one star because the actual plastic DVD holder doesn't snap shut, so i have to put it back in the paper cover to keep it together, but other then that it is great :)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Ok..Ok - Apologies to McGuyver. But simpily you are an astronaut suddenly standed on Mars and you have to survive.  Although I have no examined all of the facts behind this story it certainly is intriging  with all of the little tips and techinques the hero uses to survive.<br />You may think that a day by day log would be boring too - but each day brings a new challange, a new idea, and a lot of humor.<br />Please -give this book a read - it is well worth it.<br />Marc
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A mind blowing book and very eye opening to new experiences! A great book to share with others. Read it!!!
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|Sinister follows author Ellison (Ethan Hawke) as he moves his unsuspecting family into a new house, the home of a notorious crime, to write his new novel. Ellison eventually finds a set of  disturbing snuff films and abnormal events begin to occur. Sinister is a disturbing and unsettling ride of psychological horror.<br /><br />The story in this film creepy and haunting and the horror is balanced very well; it uses elements like eerie sounds and ghostly imagery to create an unsettling atmosphere and high tension, and uses realistic violence and effective jump-scares to shock. I really enjoy the variety and balance of the horror it has, since most modern horror films rely solely on one type (usually jump-scares or gorefest); it keeps you on your feet. The film also uses found-footage like sequences when Ellison watches the snuff films; these are very disturbing and shocking, and one of these holds a jump-scare that has already jumped to the top of my favorites (I won't spoil it, though). The ending of the film was also twisted and great. The story moves at a consistent pace, usually on the slower side but I felt like it added to the suspense. Ethan Hawke gives an amazing performance, one you wouldn't expect in a horror film but one that should be expected from a great actor like Hawke. The film has a unique and superb soundtrack, as well, that positively added to the haunting atmosphere of the film; this is truly a standout OST worth listening to outside of the film.<br /><br />Overall, Sinister is an exceptional horror film; it effectively uses all of the best elements of horror in a well balanced manner; and it's supported by a great lead performance, a consistent story, and an excellent soundtrack. I highly recommend a purchase for fans of the genre, a rental if you're still on the edge. Also, if you're watching for it's shocking jump-scares, avoid the trailer.<br /><br />Sinister has very strong violence and blood.
B00632HWOG|5.0|How great that I can easily check email on my kindle!  love love the ease of this application.  It has definitely made my life easier for sure.
B005IQZB14|4.0|A bit hard to get into at first. Stick with it and it becomes an inspirational read. I admire her decision. Possibly driven by something not fully understood.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|It's an Ok product. I believe there are better ones but obviously those will cost a bit more than this one. would recommend it to someone needed an amplifier on a budget.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book showcases the skill of Stephen King in creating characters.  When you add historical fiction with Stephen Kings characters and ability to create a unique story you get this masterpiece.  Who doesn't wonder what the world would have been like had Kennedy survived?
B000TEPED0|5.0|Sinners like me is a great album, and Eric Church is a great artist. I will be listening to this for a long time.
0440246024|3.0|Of the 3 Grisham novels i have read, this one seems totally out of Sync. Theres no fast paced city law firms but instead the slow relaxing pace of Deep South. Although the pace of the book will make it difficult for many readers to read \\"just one more chapter\\" before bed, the book still has its place.<br /><br />The deep and detailed characterisation allowed me to bond with the William and those he was closest to, which unwittingly had me rooting for a happy ending. Grisham, details every facet of being part of a small community so that by the time the ending comes the reader feels like they are part of it.<br /><br />The book starts from an outsiders point of view and over each page i became engrossed in the simple lives of those involved in the towns small drama's, and was able to see things through the eyes of William as he tries to blend in.<br /><br />An interesting read, with a bitter sweet conclusion!
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|Got corralled midway through Season 3 and have now purchased Seasons 1-3.  WOW! What an intriguing series, and Julian Fellowes & Cast have painted an Awesome canvas.  We were breathless at Matthew's early & untimely demise, but I would be obliged to be the \\"Midwest Cowboy\\" Lord Grantham had previously suggested Lady Mary should find. Waiting on Season 4 will be like settin' on a powder keg with a short fuse.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is addictive. Enjoy communicating with other users. Wish the kindle version offered more options like the trading post and spell book.
1423101499|5.0|I highly recommend this series.  My kids beg for me to read it to them.  We've learned so much about Greek mythology because of their interest from just reading these books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put it down..exciting, suspenseful, romantic. Really pulls at your heartstrings. Awesome book can't wait for the next one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|best tv show since lost!!!! great writing-great characters-i am hooked every week wish I could watch more often. watch this show
B004AFFZNI|1.0|I decided to go to GoPro's website and check out their store. Little did I know I would find this item for 29 dollars instead of 39 that they are asking.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This book was definitely captivating, as it had tragedy after tragedy (after tragedy, after tragedy - like this sentence, it got a little redundant for me). Some people talked about how graphic it was, but I didn't find it that bad - definitely sad and disturbing, but I didn't have to put the book down and take a break or anything. I wouldn't re-read this book, but it was worth a read the first time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Such a great book....I would recommend these book  to anyone!!!! Nonce I picked the book up and started to read them it was hard for me to put it down!!!! They keep you wanting more!!!! This is such an amazing book!!!!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a Must See Christmas Story in our home. Great for all ages and is a get in the spirti of the holidays Must see!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|3D games, action packed and adventure games will come and go but solitaire is the game that stands the test of time.
B0082Z1CVQ|1.0|Very long and boring never read this book you will regret it with all your life trust me and my friends we all read this and we all hate it!!!!&
144234900X|5.0|I couldn't wait to get back in the car to find out where this was going!  I usually pick up on the plot pretty quickly and lose interest when I figure out what's going on but this one just wasn't that obvious.  Really enjoyed it...so much that I ordered 4 more of her audio books.  Should have known....I love Bones!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|In the first time since I've got to get the same thing as well as a book that I am
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a good book. Predictable? Yes! But also a good story!! The writing style and perspective was unique and kept my attention :)
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Absolutely amazing! The most graphic n disturbing movie of it's time....possibly of all time where genre n rating is concerned. Forget Saw, Hostel or any of the other famous horror movies...they dont match-up. This is not a date movie...guys, dont expect your girl to snuggle up n give a few cute screams...most women wouldnt be able to watch n may even be offended n even angry you had the nerve to think they wanted to actually see this movie. You make get a smack or be worse....as punishment say goodbye to sex after she gets a glimpse of this one! Lol. Only a mature woman with strong character could take this one, when in fact some men would even turn from this movie.<br /><br />This movie will take you on a psychological, emotional n for many, even a physical journey....it may even test your very humanity n the soul of an individual for this movie is truly humanity at its most depraved outside of war. If you can get through this movie without wincing, turning your head, closing your eyes or even contemplating turning off the movie at times....you need to question yourself, your character, your own humanity.<br /><br />If this movie had to go up against the American film rating system.....forget it, the producers wouldnt have bothered because it would never get released in theaters or even get an R rating for that matter. Its not the gore that makes this movie stand alone, its the plot, acting, directing n most of all the subject matter. The story is truly humanity at its worst.<br /><br />If your overly sensative or have had a traumatic experience involving abuse I do not recommend this movie. I am a horror, true crime n thriller buff n this movie is in a class all its own.<br /><br />A must see for the true horror fan...it will be something you will talk about.
B00821OX98|4.0|I love the story and they did good on the picture of the area and the people with the spikes
B008MM9630|4.0|Nice not have to depend on neighbors, not so good with buying gems but it is understandable. I have fun.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|not like most james bond fans in the past. i was very dissapointed, it was almost like they just copied a bunch of different films, one of the worst bond films in my book
B00AJLHUYO|2.0|There was a lot of hype about this film being very scary and keeping you at the edge of your seat! Sorry, it just wasn't that intense enough to put you there! I was always waiting for something really exciting or eerie to happen, and this film simply did not deliver! To be honest, Insidious is a far superior film in all respects! It definitely had the scare/creepy factor. I would highly recommend you rent it at Red Box before considering to purchase it. Thank goodness, I did!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|this game is beast. its is a great game that I enjoy playing often. I like the warrior guy the best due to his strength and power and damage.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Wow!!  I love this battery app because it helps me keep track of when I need to charge my kindle. it is very easy to use and understand.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Finally read the whole trilogy. Very good books. I almost want to read them again to see if I missed anything. Lol
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this because a friend recommended it and I am impressed. I am not much of a minecraft player either. I think it is great. Mining diamonds, killing creepers, swinging your diamond sword, this game is great. The only thing that some minecraft (Pc) players might not like is that there aren't mods.
B007RD4KQ8|2.0|Outside of Dick Pimple, this CD was not to my taste. I was blindly optimiistic that this CD would have some cool stuff reflecting Balck Sabbath or Deep Purple - It wasn't there.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Temple run was a great game that everyone was talking about all the time. So when there is a great game, there is usually a sequal, one with new stuff, but usually with other things wrong or missing. That's what I felt with this game. I love the new map and ziplines, but I feel it lacks the fast pace that temple run had. Also the controls seem to be delayed from the game. A good time waster but not something I would play all the time.
B003S897U0|5.0|Loved it! I thought of the Crowes in there 90's glory before listening to this CD and now I long for their new stuff, I don't know the Crowes well enouogh but it seems like this is a mix of remade old tunes and a lot of new material. The old tunes were good, but the new stuff is great. A distinct direction from their 90's music - loved it
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This thing is great, especially for the price you pay.<br />This is going overseas this coming deployment. Perfect for my needs.
B0049A9BSY|4.0|I have every sex and the city cd and this just completed  my collection, I love this movie it made up for my dissapointment in movie number one. I got this fast and not dissapointed at all. Thanks.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|This album is a classic for the ages at an unbelievable price. Just another reason to love Amazon. Unlike other retailers who will sell an album for $5 and there will only be 2 or 3 favorite songs on it, Amazon sells true #1 albums for $2.99!!
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|For many artists, the sophomore album is a risky pitfall on the way to bigger success.  For Mika, his second effort perfects the blend of sounds and concepts that he only hinted at with his first album.  Loaded with catchy hooks and choruses, what sets it apart is his ability to communicate genuine feeling.  Simply listen to &#34;Underwater&#34; and you will understand.  Highly recommended!
B005FUTBWS|1.0|got it as a gift, so I don't have the return info,  it was the second time I got a RED STATE that didn't work in my DVD player
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was so good at first, couldn't put it down.......and then the worst ending ever happens and i wanted to say why did i bother.  He story doesn't match the ending. It's almost like the author couldn't come up with an ending and just stopped writing. So disappointed!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love love love this.I am sad to know that the guy who plays spartacus died in real life.I will be ordering the rest of them .Thank you again..
1449410243|5.0|The Oatmeal is one of my favorite webcomics, and this book offered the perfect opportunity to support the Oatmeal while still getting something in return. I found myself chuckling throughout at the various jokes and stereotypes that Inman pokes fun at, ALL ABOUT CATS.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I just finished escorting Chris Kyle's funeral procession from his home town of Midlothian, Tx to his final resting place at the Texas State Cemetary in Austin, Tx. I was one of the many motorcycle 's of former veterans who pay homage to former but now deceased veterans and their families. We find honor in honoring those who have sacrifice so much for their country. Inspired by the ceremony, I read his book. It not only takes you through his experience and sacrifice in combat but also the trials and difficulties of family life while serving his country and ends with the spiritual awareness of who he has become. It is almost as if he was writing a farewell and sumation of his life in preparation for his departure from this world. So few have the chance to do that and do it so well. Chris Kyle did it very well. Salute with 5 Stars....Allen R. Wammack
0525423656|4.0|My 11 year old granddaughter loved this book and will buy future Ally Condie books for her as a result of the joy this book brought her.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I got this game for my 8 yr old.  She just loves it, it just like the old fashioned mario games that I grew up loving. This is a game we can play together and makes mom look like she knows what she is doing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love it to prices tales you what the batter level is and more worth downloading gives you tips on how to save battery
B0087DFIYA|5.0|Enjoyed the story trememdously, had some twists, turns and nice elements too.  Action where needed, story throughout.  Still would not personally want to select his movie 'life style' but that's why we watch these things, right?!?!  Escapism!!!  Fair price for item, came well packaged, arrived within time frame stated from shipper.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have been wanting to see the film  but having the opportunity to read the novel first makes me want to see it more. Great book
1416550550|5.0|Busy working mom of three, in a book club but rarely able to read the book in time.  This one was a gem.  Read the book in only a few days (turns out I do have time?).  I'm looking forward to forgetting it so I can read it all over again.
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|Great Sound, best track and amazing price love it.  I was worried when it said remastered but it is still the greats that they have
B00846REIS|5.0|Love the series by Slvia Day.  I'm looking forward to book three when it is released.  I would recommend this book to my friends.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I had previously rented this movie & loved it, so I decided to buy it. I love the songs--so much fun. Alec Baldwin & Tom Cruise were great& surprisingly good singers. Julianne Hough is very talented & beautiful.
0810983915|5.0|If you have a little person that is not that into ready, especially boy then try given them on of these wonderful books. my son is now his 3rd book.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I love it!!  The pictures are great!  I really love the projects in this book.  It is easy to follow instructions!
0375851569|5.0|how can you go wrong? Its Dr. Seuss! Books were in excellent condition. Its one childhood thing that needs to be passed down forever.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|the plot was unique and the characters were fun. i have read the first two books in the Brothers Sinister and am looking forward to the next book. i was very impressed and i read a lot.
1401937519|5.0|This book is a gift to everyone who gets the opportunity to read it.  This journey in life is often conflicted by so many paths, which I have always felt lead to the same source.  What a beautifully written account of how life is all interconnected and the afterlife is so magnificent!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A very fast read. Interesting, believable  characters that are, in most cases, well developed and multifaceted. Can be predictable as to plot in that when &#34;it&#34; happens you are not all that surprised that &#34;it&#34; did, but rather how &#34;it&#34; happened. The historical content is very good, if it didn't really happen, it could have. I have read Book 2 of the trilogy, Winter of the World, and found it a worthy follow-up to Fall of Giants. Recommended
0143123173|3.0|The plot of this book was good and the characters were also good but did not like the bad language
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Heard about this forever and then watched it on TV & was hooked. Will watch it every time it is on and then when my husband isn't home will turn the volume up to shake the rooftop. Have the CD and love to walk to the songs. So Great!!
B005F8CL1S|4.0|I'm not a loquacious reviewer. This box set sounds awesome. I've only listened to 4 disks so far, fyi. And if you really want a full exposure to Mr.Cohen's body of studio recorded work, you can't beat this one.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This is a really good sci fi show.  I like how it has (so far) stayed truly science fiction and not occult, which I don't like.  Sometimes it is a bit graphic, but mostly is okay.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a great game. The controls are easy. It isstill fun even after.objectives get harder and harder. I would recommend it to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game but needs more turns and more upgrades to make it better but it is a really good game
0446693804|5.0|This is the first book I read by Nicholas Sparks.  I was immediately drawn in by Landon's folksy, slightly humorous narrative, and although the ending was fairly predictable from the start, the simply eloquence of Landon's slow evolution throughout the story kept me reading every word.  I finished the book in one sitting, grateful I had tissue on hand at the end.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|My son has no interest in pacifiers.  When he first started getting some teething pain, he liked to chew on things, but couldn't manipulate a teether toy.  We got this for him and he really likes it.  He chews on the pacifier part, the hands, the feet, the tail, evereything.  He can easily manipulate it and it's now one of the only things that keeps him from fussing in the car.  My only concern is that the pacifier used in this toy is for newborn - 6 months.  My son may still want this when he's a  little older.  I wish they also made them with the 6 month + pacifiers.
0061726834|5.0|This book captivated me. I loved reading this, and cannot wait to start the second book! This is one of my top favorite books I would have to say. I don't want to give away to much, but the end left me so upset, in a good way, if you like to feel your heart crumbling out of your chest.
B00684J49U|5.0|I had no problems at all  with this product  nothing was damaged everything is good  i m happy with it !!
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I really enjoyed this easy read. Although the writing style is simplistic and the message somewhat repetitive throughout, I think it was an inspiring message and I know it had a very positive effect on me. I feel confident I will re-read this book through the years to keep myself on track. I also bought a copy as a gift.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Works on my Kindle fire, My Mac, My PC, My laptop, connects to many other apps--can save drawings the kids make or Pictures  or Lecture notes, web clippings, articles, you name it!... Awesome.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play this game for 7 hours straight you neeeeeeeed to get this game click it now or you could get all the boring games instead
B009D5VPTI|4.0|Props for an awesome female role model, and for addressing the rift between mother's and daughters.  All characters are pretty awesome, actually. Funny as hell, and I don;t mind my kids want to keep watching it over and over!<br /><br />&#34;You'll get dreadful Colly-wobbles&#34; &#60;---but what does that mean??
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I was never required to read this in school. But I would not have enjoyed it as I have now  at 60. I almost, almost wished I had read it. I loved the adventure as if I had been Tom or Huck.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|I mean, should one assume that the user is LOOKING for a wifi connection?  So disabling it on Kindle fire without a connection is a major design flaw, and frankly asinine.  But when it works it is cool.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story was riveting. I think I read it in 2 days. The ending totally caught me off guard .
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was really exceptional as I knew it would be. Mitch Albom tells a story like no other author. This is a must read. I recommend it so much that you must run not walk to get your copy.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Presents a new twist on retirees needing to stretch their limited income and the need to adopt a new culture not just live in an enclave surrounded by familiar but boring experiences.

0765325950|5.0|I've been reading this series for 12 years. Been disappointed with a few of Robert's efforts. But not with Brandon's I think it's very tough to come in and have to finish a huge series like this. When I first heard about Robert's death I figured that was it. No one could really finish this story. But I was wrong. I would also like to point out that I think it's wrong that many people gave this book one star because it was not released on a kindle version. Grow up this is suppose to be a review about the book not about your opinion on how it should have been released. I'm not going to get into anything about the story read it and decided for yourself. But I will say a lot of the book is about the Battle. Which I loved. This is suppose to be about the last battle and Mr Sanderson did not disappoint. Some of characters did not get much time in the last book. But all of the main characters did get plenty of the story. When I finished the book I thought the ending was weak. But held off writing the review to give myself time to think about it. The more I thought about it, I realized with a story that is this large how should it end? How would I have liked it to end? I mean it has to end some way. The more I thought about the more I realized it was a good ending. Brandon Sanderson took a impossible job and did it. He did a great job of finishing this story. I don't know what some people wanted for a ending but I thought he came through. I have given it 5 stars it was close could have went with 4 stars but did not

B00368PSN2|4.0|My wife and I consider Outlander to be one of our favorites. We already had the DVD but got the blu-ray for the better picture. Everything about the movie is better than expected: the special effects, the acting, the story. It's a fun popcorn movie that has layers of Beowolf for those who want some literary spice. There's no nudity but there is a considerable amount of gore so keep that in mind if you have kids.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Bought this for my daughter, she is a super die hard fan, she play this CD all day and now anytime we are in the car, she wants to play it and her other 1D CD's. Highly recommend.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so outrageously wonderful. I just could not put it down! I read ALL night because it was to good to stop reading.  I loved this book so much, that I intend to read it again. The twist, and turn kept you so intrigued until I couldn't get enough! The love story between Sky (Hope) and Dean was the icing cake.  I laughed,and cried with Sky. I was so angry with the sexual abuse especially with a six year old. Eventhou, her father caused so much harm, love still prevailed. Excellent Story Colleen Hoover!!!! I look forward to reading more from you.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book was really good. I was a little disappointed with the fate of some of the characters but overall it was a good ending for the series.

0811879542|5.0|We love books- we try to find them at thrift stores and wherever we can, because we read them so quickly and have to push our budget's boundaries to get our favorites. This book is a steal at twice the price. First and foremost- the construction of the book is phenomenal. The construction of the book makes it fully worth twice the price (which I've seen fluctuate between $8 and $10 in the two months since I've ordered it not only for our family, but for two of our friends' families as well!) It is designed to be handled by young, destructive kids who want to taste, touch, throw, flip, open, close, hang, drag, and oh...read!! the book! So that gave it an immediate 4 stars.<br /><br />The title and colors are welcoming and invite the reader to explore and open the book, to see what adventure awaits. We love to pile up together on the couch and read this book, over and over. My two children take turns completing the tasks on each page, and squeal with delight at each turn of the page! In the two months we have had the book, my 22-month old has learned the three primary colors to a certain extent, and he can count to five and beyond. I attribute this to many things, including his normal development, but especially because we count the dots and say the colors each time we read the book. And we read it almost every day, several times in a row!<br /><br />I'm looking at which of the author's books to order next- they all seem to have great reviews!
1781164266|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo7LC4XDEW7U5D]]The Art of Dead Space is a wonderful concept art book for the chilling game series. It has 192 pages and a hardcover with a nice matte surface going on.<br /><br />The book collects art from all the three games so far. Squeezing three games into 192 pages means that some artworks could not be included. So at times, I was thinking,\\"Shouldn't there be a bit more of this and that?\\" Having said that, this artbook is as good as it can get. It's great actually.<br /><br />All pages are filled with huge detailed concept art of the characters, creatures, vehicles, spacecrafts and environments. The content covers Isaac, Ishimura, Machinery (all the hardware and stuff), Marker, Necromorphs, The Sprawl, New Horizons Colony, Tau Volantis.<br /><br />The painted art are gorgeous. Creature designs are awesome. You can feel the grit of the world and the chilling sensation from the grotesque creatures. There are many what-the-hell-happened-here interior art, dying space stations and haunting locations. The art direction really nailed down the look and feel of this intriguing yet horrific world.<br /><br />This is fantastic video game artbook for fans of the Dead Space, sci-fi art and creature design. Highly recommended.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B00008PX8P|5.0|I have possessed this DVD set for at least three years now. I return to it again and again. In fact, I've even re-referred to it for some how-to in Jimmy's technique, as I am a guitar player. For those that are not completely satisfied with some of the footage, and the camera angles, you have to understand that Led Zeppelin had gone out of their way to avoid the press. In the book \\"Hammer of the Gods\\", it was even commonplace for Peter Grant, and other Led Zepp's crew to mercilessly beat those that attempted to create bootleg copies of their shows.<br /><br />This set is FANTASTIC! Seriously, if you like Zeppelin a 'little bit', it is a must have. I particularly enjoy the Knebworth Footage. Of course, everything from \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", (the Madison Square Garden Footage of '73), is all there.<br /><br />Disc one is a little slower, and they focus more on some of their acoustic sets, but it should be recalled that Led Zeppelin was also very much acoustic and \\"Joan Baez\\" oriented. It very accurately depicts each of their major UK/US Tours. Of course, not every song from every tour is included, just the greatest take from the bunch. Also, it is crucial to recall that this footage was personally assembled by Jimmy Page and a visual/audio team, whom pieced together portions of the film that ultimately came from various camera angles, as well as from many negatives of old 8mm footage.<br /><br />How they pieced all of these wonderful songs together with such seamless precision, is beyond me. If these discs ever become damaged, I would not HESITATE to make another purchase.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|My daughter loves this game.  It's easy for her to use, she's 3 so I had to set the parental controls.  Sometimes it freezes, and doesn't load up right away.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|I for one was sorta \\"anti-cd\\", in this day and age, and was much more interested in the DVD itself. I have to say that I've used these CD's as much, or more than the DVD. Now, mark my words, the quality of the DVD, the angles, the lighting, etc, are absolutely fantastic! Jason Bonham performs wonderfully. Jimmy, well, not too much more you can say about such an iconic axe player, simply fantastic. It was refreshing to see John Paul Jones on the set, especially with the inclusion of \\"No Quarter\\". This particular track will give you goosebumps, that's for sure.<br /><br />I was really into the Black Crowes/ Jimmy Page collaboration, (of which they never made a DVD for), UNTIL I heard that this project was being released in the Fall of '12. I was one of those that waited until that week, and pre-ordered it.<br /><br />Can't say enough about it. It was great to see Robert Plant there again, belting out that huge range of notes he is capable of summoning. I have no idea how these guys are so on their game after all these years, especially for Plant and Jones either playing on and off with Page, or in the case of Bonham, not at all.<br /><br />Just an unbelievable performance. This solidified my intention to pay ALMOST whatever it will cost if and when there is a Led Zeppelin Reunion Tour with Jason Bonham. Stones Tix are a bit ridiculous, but for Zeppelin, I would really have to seriously look at my finances and MAKE that happen. That's what this particular disc did for me.
B006TJXZ30|2.0|It's alright.  I can check my mail, but I haven't figured out a way to check my previously saved emails.
B000FC130E|3.0|I really enjoyed the theme and plot of this book, but it had the same flaw many books in the genre share. The magic system had no bounds. Every predicament could be overcome by using magic, either magic that was already introduced or new magic that the reader didn't know existed in this universe.<br /><br />All in all a decent read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game.  My daughter plays it with my supervision and the only problem I have with this game is you have to conncet to a social network in order to receive hearts and gems.
B00012QM8G|5.0|one of the best I have seen, so glad I was able to get it from you. cleared up lots for me about that time in history
0385736002|3.0|So, I judge books by their cover. That is the whole point of a cover design, to allow a buyer to get a feel for the book before they pick it up and spend their hard earned money on it.<br />This cover eluded to a world of beautiful mystery and colorful plots and characters and a memorable journey. I had high expectations for it.<br /><br />What I found was a mediocre plot and characters that did not stand out in many ways. The dialogue was simple. The plot was trite. The character development was forced. At times, to show how a character felt, the author just told us: He was angry. He did not trust that man. And things like that. I was force fed emotions when I would rather see them slowly develop and come out in ways that is true to the character. That is hard to do when characters do not feel textured enough.<br />The author also repeated the same descriptions throughout the book.<br /><br />After I fought the urge to just put the book down and stop reading, I found I enjoyed the story even though it was not as creative as I originally thought it was going to be. The plot really surged forward and never stopped, and we went along with the characters in a moment by moment type of style that one normally finds in action or detective. This is a combination of action and fantasy (not the action like people fighting wars, but the action where the main character must keep moving constantly).<br /><br />I did enjoy the mix of modern and mythology.<br />To sum up, it was like a children's version of American Gods by Neil Gaiman without the sex and violence.<br /><br />Good read, but not the best.<br />This is not a kid's book that adults would really enjoy reading.
B0036OS3EW|5.0|These are great snow boots. They fit like most Crocs, roomy and comfortable with good support. They are not too heavy, in fact they are quiet light. Would recommend highly.

B008TMA1LY|5.0|It is so fun! I absolutely love this game! &lt;3 My baby cousin would love this game,too.  I just know it.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|38 minutes. In a normal day, that amount of time doesn't seem long at all. In the case of one Navy SEAL unit, those few minutes felt like years during May 2nd, 2011. Was it another boring debriefing session? Maybe a typical morning exercise drill? A game of Truth or Dare? How about taking part in Operation Neptune Spear, a.k.a. the last remaining minutes of Osama bin Laden? I'll give you a hint: military personnel usually don't play Truth or Dare, at least not during the weekdays. If you've ever wanted to know how it went down, how it felt, and what had to be done to get there, Zero Dark Thirty is as close as you'll ever get to the real thing.<br /><br />Seemingly countless films have been based on, related, or dedicated to the 9/11 attacks and the controversial decisions made afterwards; most of them had their own political agenda, either delivered subtlety (The Messengers), or not at all (Lions for Lambs). So how do you make your film stand out from the endless flood? It's simple. You simply tell it like it is, and let the audience think for themselves. Like Kathryn Bigelow's previous effort, The Hurt Locker, she pulls no punches in Zero; It is blunt in its presentation, and it shows a harsh reality of what goes on behind closed doors just to get the job done. To the general public, it may be too harsh of a dose to swallow, but sometimes it's a pill that needs to be taken.<br /><br />Some may see this as a mere cash-in of a critical event in U.S. history, however this film was in the works well before the assassination of bin Laden, and actually had to go through a major re-write at the last minute. That any director or writer could come up with a conclusive ending at the last minute and still deliver what is easily one of the most intense, heart-pounding moments in cinematic history is impressive to say the least. There aren't many \\"cash-in\\" films that could be described in that regard. Whether Zero Dark Thirty should be considered a \\"modern classic\\" is highly debatable, but one thing is not: Like it's predecessor, it is essential viewing, a piece of history sown into the fabric of modern filmmaking that delivers more than you could want from any war film. And like countless films before it, Zero tells us that no matter how you describe, present, or portray it, war is hell, and it always will be.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A humorous, exciting, and fast read. Highly recommended for fans of sci- fi or survival books in general. Would make a great movie. Definitely worth the $.99.
B008CJ0KI8|1.0|Frank Ocean is the member of the vastly popular Odd Future group, a rap ensemble hyped as the next big thing for the music industry. When you reach a level of publicity that reaches that high, there's bound to be disappointment awaiting in the dark waters below. Channel ocean is one of those letdowns. This comes as no surprise, as previous releases from TOF have been touted as \\"classic\\" and \\"groundbreaking\\" by the press, yet there is nothing about TOF that makes them different from anybody else. Channel orange is said to be \\"the biggest thing to happen to r&b\\", when it's just more of the same sounds, ideas, and formulas. Sappy ballads, predictable lyrics; the most damning thing about Channel orange is that it's unbelievably boring. People say this as an extract of hyperbole, but I literally started to fall asleep halfway through the album. There's nothing groundbreaking about this album, nothing that sets it apart from the crowd. It is merely another cog in the hype machine using overenthusiastic praise from the press as fuel to disguise a formulaic product like this as something amazing and unique. It isn't.
B0027UY8B8|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first, but this is truly a region-free set. It played fine in my player, no hiccups of any kind. Someone was kind enough to load up the pictures here on Amazon so I could see what this box had to offer. It's a very nice box, and includes a great booklet that gives a brief description of each episode and on which disc it is located. It also lists the bonuses for each disc. I haven't had a chance to watch everything yet, but so far it seems that the extras are the ones that are on the regular DVDs of the show, i.e. David Eick's Blogs, deleted scenes, etc.<br /><br />There has been some talk about the picture looking grainy, but the fact is that's how they shot the show. There's actually a little intro thing from Ronald D. Moore in which he explains that this is 'the way it was meant to be seen'. Hokey cliche aside, this is absolutely stunning in picture and sound.<br /><br />If I had anything to 'complain' about it would be:<br /><br />1. The first season has no haunting female vocal over the opening credits, it's the alternate military sounding one. The rest of the seasons have the vocal.<br />2. They didn't put 'The Plan' in here. That would be truly the entirety of BSG<br />3. The booklet that comes with this has great pictures of the key characters and various info on them. However, this gives away info on who the Cylons are! If this were a gift for someone who'd never seen the show, there be spoilers in there!<br /><br />None of these are not dealbreakers in any way. I am in love with this set, and I will be able to enjoy one of my fave shows in all its glory! Frakkin' A!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|50 years. That's half of a century of womanizing, spying, blowing up cars, using the latest gadgets technology can provide, and spouting one-liners. Or, in James Bond's' case, just another day at work. Indeed, 007 turns fifty this year, and what better way to celebrate an incoming mid-life crisis than to deliver unto us the best Bond film in decades? Actually, how about being one of the best films altogether in a long time? I think that is a more appropriate tagline. That, and it has a nicer ring to it. This wasn't the case with Bond's last film, unfortunately. It has been nearly four years since Quantum of Solace, and it left us with the feeling of empty satisfaction and expectations drastically unfulfilled; a vicious bark with no bite, if you will. But where there was a drought that Solace had left behind, Skyfall brings in a tsunami to raise the mark once again. This time, Skyfall is the espionage film we've all wanted to see long after Jason Bourne left the stage...well, the good Jason Bourne, anyway.<br /><br />The first thing that immediately comes across after a few minutes into the film is that this isn't your dad's Bond. The elements are there; the suit and tie, beautiful women, (mostly) memorable villains; the ingredients remain intact. It's the recipe, the overall theme, that bears a stark contrast to the lightheartedness(?) of the previous films. It is a dark, gritty, grim foreshadowing of Bond's weaknesses, fears, and the series of catastrophic events and decisions woven into a paradigm that spells out one simple, devastating question: Does an evil exist that can dismantle MI6 and eliminate Bond permanently, from the inside? Well, it wouldn't be a film, much less a Bond film, worth watching if there wasn't, especially when it clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes.<br /><br />What is so rare about a film like Skyfall is that it puts so much effort into all the basic aspects of creating an engaging and enjoyable movie, and yet it doesn't give any indicationthat it's trying to impress its audience; it just does it naturally. Hardly anything feels forced, ham-fisted, or too self-referential, nor does it try to reinvent anything in the filmmaking arena. It simply does what Bond does best: entertain and impress.<br /><br />In an age where technology is advancing at a blistering pace and trends are constantly shifting, Skyfall manages to keep up with the times while also managing to stay close to what made it unique when Bond first emerged on the scene in 1962. I guess the only thing Bond has to worry about at age 50 is someone poisoning his Metamucil.
0316069434|2.0|A clever read but does not have the depth, emotion and grit that earlier Connelly novels contained.  Airplane reading but not a page turner.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|They say that truth is stranger than fiction, which is difficult to believe, as fiction is meant to be an escape from reality to enter into a new world altogether. For instance, what if I told you that a CIA agent disguised himself as a Hollywood movie producer to rescue a group of Americans from a mob of bloodthirsty Iranian citizens, and succeeded? What if I also said that it was something that actually happened? My guess is that you'd probably slap me in the face and call for the men in white suits. As a matter of fact, President Clinton officially declassified the operation, codenamed \\"Argo\\", in 1999. Now, ironically, this critical event in American history has been adapted for the screen and directed by, of all people, Ben Affleck.<br /><br />  Now, take a step back and examine this scenario. Ben Affleck, an actor who has starred in a seemingly endless amount of unbelievably awful films (Gigli, Daredevil, and Surviving Christmas to name a few),is not only starring in a film with serious undertones, but is also directing it at the same time. If you hadn't paid attention to Affleck for the past 5 years, you'd most likely dismiss the entire movie at face value. Fortunately for him (and us), he's actually a pretty competent director, doling out the excellent Gone Baby Gone in 2007, and the decent 2010 film, The Town. The bi-polarity in both of his talents is almost incomprehensible in this day and age, but if he keeps this up, he might actually be taken seriously for once.<br /><br />  The premise of the film is already hard to believe as it is, but not only does Affleck have to weave enough tension, emotion, horror, and some dry humor to convince to audience, he also has to ask us a troubling question: Can conflicts or crises be fought without weapons and violence? When a film has to add this many ingredients into one pot, the result is usually  a pretentious mess of a film that suffers from the \\"too many cooks spoil the broth\\" syndrome, yet Affleck somehow manages to balance out these ideas and themes, as well as the pacing, almost to perfection. Nothing seems unnecessary or out of place, the length of the film never comes to mind; everything fits as it should. Not many films accomplish this feat, so it's all the more surprising coming from an actor that was the rear end of every joke in Hollywood.<br /><br />  So the more important question is: Does this film have any relevance in our current generation? Throughout the decades, the general public has seen an increase of corruption and injustice resulting in unwanted violence, and this film seeks to speak out to those who've had enough and seen enough. More importantly, the film unabashedly states that no matter how desperate or hostile a certain situation is, the pen is always mightier than the sword. You know what they say, truth is stranger than fiction....

FROM:  [...]    <<Company is located in Tsinghua Science Park Haidian District, Beijing.>>    I am still researching whether the U.S. Department of Homeland Security considers EStrongs.com a potential cyber threat.    Attempting to install Adobe Flash Player on a new Kindle Fire HD 8.9, I discovered several Kindle Fire help forum posts that included ES FILE EXPLORER in the instructions. I successfully installed:    1. ES FILE EXPLORER  2. DOLPHIN BROWSER HD  3. ADOBE FLASH PLAYER Ver. 11.1.    Out of curiosity, I \\"tapped\\" over to the \\"About us\\" menu selection within ES FILE EXPLORER.  It displayed a link to:  [...]  Tapping on the link took me to their home page.  Tapping on the [Company] button displayed:  [...]    <<EStrongs Inc.

There is no certainty that it does not include a Trojan Horse virus or spyware.  With that in mind, I have removed it from my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read the first two books of the Hunger Games series before diving into this one. While this book does answer some questions and kept me reading pretty steadily, I just don't think this book is quite as good as the other two. Still worth your time, though.
1405034963|4.0|I would recommend this puzzle book despite a couple things There are 6 puzzles that each have a clear sheath around them. The sheaths have not survived the taking off and putting on.  My 2 and 3 year olds are able to do the puzzles, but because the cardboard is so thin, some of the pieces have ripped. They do love the idea of puzzles in a book that can also be read.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This was an absolutely great season.  The ending was spectacular.  Left me in shock, dying to see season 5.  The trinity killer is great.  A must see season.  Unbelievable....
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Amazon's Mobile app came pre-installed on my smartphone. When I got my wife her tablet, one of the first apps I got for it was Amazon Mobile, so she can browse and shop as easily from the couch as we do from the computer. It's very well designed and, while not exactly the same experience as from a true computer, is optimized well for mobile use. No complaints.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Wow.. hard to imagine that the writers can actually think up all these things.  This was such a fun episode to watch. Found it really exciting and just had to laugh at times.. Unbelievable the things they do.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Kindle for Android isn't meant to be a full-on replacement for a Kindle, and it obviously isn't. But it's an okay stopgap if you've got a smartphone or another tablet already and don't want to lay out the additional coin for a Kindle.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is a funnie movie. We watched it and it keeps you entertained and makes you laugh. What more can you ask for in a movie?
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great predictive typing saves me a lot of keystrokes. New Flow feature does swiping better than Swype. Learns the words you use most often from your own messages.
030758660X|5.0|Very good patterns. Professional looking results. Had to get a second copy cause my first copy had duplicate pages and missing pages. The company was very good about replacing it with a perfect copy.
B004DH76LW|5.0|This is a great story of courage.  We will not always be understood by others.  It is most important that we understand ourselves.  In doing so, we will be better able to understand and love others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Bleak but filled with humanity, loaded with ideas yet as concrete as the walls of the silo, this is just plain great reading.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book is always better than the movie. These books will soon become movies. So read them while u can
0062502182|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. It was beautifully written and gave me insight into my life
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game and I play almost every day except there are a couple of problems. I believe that the items in the store should be a little cheaper and your probability of getting rare items from mystery boxes should be higher. Other than that I LOVE the game and look forward to keep on surfing!
B0063GORYU|1.0|Then kept freezing up. Tried removing and downloading again, but encountered same problem. I wish it would work, because I enjoyed playing while it lasted.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an amazing book that made me cry. I really like the way is was written.  I loved this book!
B00846F1YW|1.0|When you are in a room and you have zoomed in, if you touch the screen it thinks you are selecting something.  you can't move around the room or anything cause if you simply touch it to move the screen it gives you the red &quot;x&quot; for wrong guess.  serious annoyance and I wish it would get fixed.  this issue is in all of their games.  this can really hurt you if you are in countdown mode.  I will not play due to this bug.  there are better hidden object games out there!
B007SGM084|5.0|You'll want to buy all three at once,once ur done with one you'll want to read the next one right away!!!!!
B004LROMX4|4.0|noah wylie shows talent beyond ER. Post invasion survival and rebellion theme has been done a lot but this one seems to be done with a little more style than the usual &#34;b&#34; movie.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Helps me fall asleep so quickly!  I sleep so well now.  There is a nice variety of sounds to fall asleep to.  Love it!
1442359315|4.0|Not a child, not  someone you can argue with. The author is schooled and beyond.  He understands the inner workings of the mind and body in a way most of us will never know. If he believes it, skeptics beware.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|First it is kid friendly which is hard to find in a lot of movies now a days. The story line is not just the same old thing redone for the 10th time. The music is great, the story line is great, the animation is great, and it all comes to gather nicely.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has good graphics and has a good generally idea of carding for a horse. Well except for doing the acutally work. I would probaly give this a 4.5
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Whether you love the sound of country rock, country, or pop, there's a song(s) for you on this CD! These are songs that have lyrics everyone can relate to and that have no age boundaries. When I'm having a difficult day, I find myself singing the lyrics from &#34;Little Victories&#34; or the next time rockin' to &#34;Feelin' Brave.&#34;  As a long time fan of Kenny Loggins, I was completely blown away the first time I heard his voice blend so effortlessly in harmony with Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr live at The Rutledge in 2011! I enjoyed the show so much that I've seen them twice a year since. The combo of great lyrics, music, and voices are so refreshing. My favorite song changes from day to day depending upon what I need from the music.<br /><br />I was so happy to finally be able to get all these great collaborations in one CD. You know the music is good when you hear one of the songs playing in your head all day long. The catchy hooks and great music keeps me wanting to hear this CD over & over again.<br /><br />I say &#34;Just Say Yes&#34; to buying this for yourself and/or for a gift, as I did both recently. I just LOVE it!
B008Y6WPXC|3.0|action squences pretty good.this another of the lets give the old gang. some screen time. the only thing this needed was stallone in his rambo outfit, schwartzenager in aconan breech cloth, and strathom driving everybody in a mercedes!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game and I can't stop playing it in cube attack mode!  Makes it even more awesome that it was free :)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Very exciting to get this through the Post! The dvd arrived safely in the care package. Very pleased with my purchase.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|A very fun and enjoyable read. I also learned a lot about what goes on in a restaurant kitchen. It's also great that I got it as a special offer for my Kindle.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|Great play mat. My daughter loved it and still enjoyed playing with it when she was walking. She would sit on it and read or play with her toys. Now I use it for my twin girls and they love it as well. The mat washes up nicely in the machine and the colors have not faded.
B000F2C87Q|4.0|I first checked this out at the library, and was hooked. Overall, it has a darker tone than, say, the Brothers album, but I love how the guitars and voices are equally balanced in carrying melody and meaning, not one seeming to be merely accompaniment to the other. These guys pull that off with almost every song.
0679805273|5.0|Love it, can't wait to give to my son who received an internship with a major airline and has flying perks! Yeah!
B008HK3XOU|4.0|y only desire to make this better would be a fiction to allow the kindle to stand both horizontally and vertically. Seems to be well made and holds kindle snugly and securely.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|I had been warned that this film is terrible, and still found it to be amazingly disappointing. The nicest thing that can be said about &#34;Prometheus&#34; is that it is better than Aliens III or IV.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app.  I think it's better than weather channel.  I like how it predict<br />snowfall amounts, and does a 15 day forecast.
B00APUQJLO|4.0|&#34;Cosmopolis&#34; is strange and entertaining, as are all Cronenburg films. I liked it better than some and less than others.
B00992CF6W|1.0|it dleted all my progress and wont let me get rid of any worlds. one of the worst apps ever
1592537251|2.0|I was expecting a book with sketches as well as instructions and tips on drawing techniques for urban landscapes. The book is basically all artwork.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Let's face it, if you have read the other books in the series you know that these books are long, complicated and dependent on your having read the prior books. That being said, this book is one of the better ones in my opinion. The time it takes to read it is rewarded with good stories, some moderate closure, and as is the writers style, fantastic cliffhangers.<br /><br />You are not going to just decide to jump into the last book in the series, but for anyone on the fence, it is worth the time.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|After seeing the Total Recall remake I was skeptical. However the team on Dredd did a fine job of reviving this character, removing the cheese factor from the Stallone version.<br /><br />The movie does a much better job at outlining the dystopian, dying civilization of human-kind and the place of the Judges in it. Rookie judge Cassandra Anderson is given a second chance at becoming a judge through an in-the-field evaluation. Who better than the Dredd. Their first mission out and things turn horribly south.<br /><br />I especially appreciated how the bad guys made (for the most part) sensible decisions instead of cliche moves and lines. I didn't have a single moment where I was put off by the characters making bad common sense choices. The director doesn't try to make Dredd into an emotional human, but rather a force of the law - which since they never take off his helmet, this is even easier to do.
B000JIHP88|1.0|After using for just one month, the rotating part stopped working. Just the music box alone is working. Called the service center people but was not helpful. Waste of money.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|This book is really fun and creative! Great character development, storyline, etc.!<br />If you like Fantasy and have a good imagination,you want to read this book.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Unusual and entertaining. As it is set predominantly in Melbourne there was a sense of familiarity.<br />Terrific entertainment. I want more!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is a great movie, shared this little gem with my little ones they love it to. Wife and I both enjoyed it so much once we saw it on sale here we scooped it up quickly. It's full of laughs and one more flick that tames down the monsters are scary and mean bit, like monsters inc and monsters vs aliens.
B005H9B44A|1.0|Thor follows the same guideline as most comic superhero movies: it tries to tell the origin of the hero and it forgets to get a good plot for the story. There are plenty of good comics with excellent plots out there. Why not make a movie out of a good story? Isn't that what they choose to put books in the big screen?
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|While I haven't watched the entire series and can't speak of discs not working, etc - I can't for the life of me understand the negative reviews. This collection is phenomenal. I'e been an OST fan since I was a little girl in the 60's and it is just awesome seeing the series brought back in all it's glory. The colors and the details so crisp and bright! The planets! The galaxies!  WOW!!!!!!!  I also think the sound (also digitally remastered) is breathtaking (my 7.1 surround system really makes it shine..)  And for the die hard fans like myself, the commentary is - fascinating, simply fascinating.  I don't regret this purchase at all. In fact it's made be happier than I've been with such a purchase in a LONG time. I suppose I should try and find something I was not 1000% satisfied with lest my review come under scrutiny. I was somewhat disappointed with the packaging of the third season, as it didn't match the other two. But I quickly forgot about this slight aesthetic faux pas as I lost myself in the series. I seriously can't imagine any die hard Trek fan NOT buying this set.
