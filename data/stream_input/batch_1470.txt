B0073LWEXK|4.0|I really liked this game, but I'm a novice & it didn't take very long before I was going around in circles & couldn't get any farther in the game. I still like it, I just wish I could get a hint when I need it.
030771652X|4.0|This book captivated me from the very beginning. Having a sibling disappear is probably a very scary thing but finding out that the sibling is dead has to be devastating. This book kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happened.  Some real life issues were addressed in drug trials and how they can affect our lives and the lives of our offspring.  In all, this was definitely an author that will keep me coming back for more.  Plot twists and turns were awesome.
1441870008|2.0|I received my Hounded audio book today and was upset when I opened it to see that is was not new and was covered with finger marks and smudges on both sides.  I guess you can't always believe the ratings and details that giving on Amazon.
B000UE29SW|5.0|I actually work at a Women's Prison and an inmate suggested this book.  I had read 'Heaven is for Real' and she thought I would really like this one written by an adult...I am so glad I did...I am so amazed at the amount of information that Betty, the Author was able to obtain while she was in Heaven...actually speaking with Angels, Monks, & even Jesus.  They allowed her to ask questions and answered alot of them by showing her the answers.  I think everyone should read it, especially those who have lost a loved one.  I have always thought how dreadful the day would be that I lose my Mother...but after reading this book I do believe I will have a much easier time accepting her passing, knowing that she is in Eternal Paradise.
1609613937|5.0|I love the book. A lot of serious information to take into consideration. We need respectable practical clinic results to back nutritional advice and Dr McDougall's experience is to be considered as such. He blends his results at his clinic with his findings in serious medical studies published in medical and scientific journals to provide medical advice in this book to improve health, minimizing the use of drugs. I strongly recommend this book.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception is indeed a mind-bending thriller. A group of specialists initiate sleep just so they can get into one's subconscious many levels deep, including sleep within sleep. The story can be confusing at times but there are \\"breadcrumbs\\" to help the viewer follow along. The resolution is satisfying. The acting was mixed but the story quite interesting. Recommended.
B005LAIHKY|5.0|Johnny was gorgeous, as usual. (Much better looking than Robert Pattinson!)They didn't try to gross us out. There was no kiddie sex/love. I, for one am tired of 100 year old vampires interested in 17 year olds. What could they possibly have in common? Barnabas was locked in a box, so , in effect would have been in stasus!<br />I love the kitsch, and particularly the macreme room!<br />Can't wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray! Going to see it again!<br />When does the sequel come out!
B007L96VCY|5.0|I really think a lot of people missed the point of this album when it was released 40 years ago. And hindsight has not helped many others.<br /><br />Ram marked an important step in McCartney's post-Beatles-divorce rehab. If the McCartney solo album marked Paul's first tentative steps back into the studio, Ram marked an important step forward. McCartney retreated, Linda in tow, to hippy life on the farm - \\"lookin' for life in the country\\" -  and re-discovered the simple joys of living outside the bubble.  Life  revolved around family. You see it in the well-know accompanying photographs (some not as well known). This was Paul & Linda's album. While Linda's contributions to Paul's music may still be debatable (god rest her soul) there is no denying that her voice is as deeply embedded in our aural memories of this album as Paul's. Her singing in Admiral Halsey is nothing if not iconic at this point. In Ram, Paul discovered the joys of loosening up, not worrying about perfection, and frankly, not giving a damn what anyone else thoughts about his songs.<br /><br />He also re-discovered his own roots: 3 chord 50s doo-wop based music. We hear this in songs like 3 Legs, Eat At Home, and Smile Away - pure 1950's fluff. It was as far from psychedelic Pepperland as he could get.<br /><br />The songs were, and remain, thrilling pop. Too Many People, explains McCartney's reasons for his return to the farm, as well as the simplicity of the album. It was - and remains - a stunning album opener. Arena crowds were thrilled to hear it live during the 2009(?) tour. (Interestingly, Paul introduced it during the tour as being \\"...for all you Wings fans out there\\". Which was rather odd, as Wings hadn't yet formed.<br /><br />UA/AH remains as timeless, and catchy - impossible to get out of your head really - as it did when it first dominated the AM/FM airwaves. I still see kids - my grandkids - dancing and laughing to the refrain. I mean really - who can resist smiling upon hearing Linda's \\"hands across the water\\"? Monkberry Moon Delight is, well delightful; a raucous, rocking ode to home brew. McCartney takes it a bit over the top at the end, but, that's McCartney. (And just humor me for a moment: imagine, if you will, in your mind's ear - Dylan singing Monkberry Moon Delight with the Travelling Wilburies!)<br /><br />Dear Boy is one of those beautiful seamless melodies that McCartney seems able to lift out of the air. The \\"ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba\\" Serendipity Singers pseudo baroque background singing remains perfect. Backseat Of My Car continues to have a simple majesty that is inexplicably timeless, given the simple sentiment expressed in the song. What is ukelele based Ram On, if not the rhythmic precursor to the mandolin based Dance Tonight? And don't even get me started on Smile Away. I'm biased. My early garage band used it to warm up and sound check. Many fond memories there. (\\"A-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai - - \\"). Crank up Smile Away; just listen to the texture in that fuzz bass!<br /><br />The remastering is brilliant; Paul's bass is not nearly as prominent as the Beatles remasters, and that's all for the good. The sound is more cohesive. The bonus disc (which seems to be garnering more than its fair share of attention from those desiring more or less or different, is 34 minutes of Paulie pleasure. I have always been a huge fan of the original Another Day/Woman, Oh Why single and it was great to hear the latter again. Just listen to the flexibility of McCartney's voice - both in WWOW, as well as the opening of Two Many People.<br /><br />Ram continues to delight. It was a brilliant step up from \\"McCartney\\" (excepting Every Night and Maybe I'm Amazed), light ears away from the debacle of Wings' Wild Life, and a hook-laden foundation for McCartney's true shot of redemption - Band On The Run. As a snapshot of the artist during a very transitional period of his life, Ram has nothing to apologize for. It was, in Paul Simon's words, \\"a time of innocence/a time of consequences\\".<br /><br />Indeed. Preserve your memories - they're all that's left you. (And memory's almost full).<br /><br />Godspeed, Sir Paul! (from the guy who met you and Nancy on line for popcorn at the Zeigfeld Theater at the opening weekend of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull)cence/a time of consequences\\".<br /><br />Indeed.

B0018RC7QE|5.0|I accidently watched this movie and fell in love with it.  I have watched it a million times and have given it as gifts for my female friends.  I watch it every Christmas.  I even went to the Rizzoli book store to show my nieces when we went to New York.  I think the characters are human.  DeNiro and Streep were like any person, not looking for love but finding it anyway.  I liked that they did not sleep together but let things take their natural course.  Sometimes the looks on DeNiro broke my heart like when he drove to Streeps house and just sat in the driveway.  I knew someone who did that same thing because he fell in love with a woman unexpectadly and did not know what to do.  Now I am buying the movie for my two friends from Ireland.  Love New York and love this film.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|I like this game a lot but I have the same problem someone else mentioned. It stopped Working. It is just a black screen now.
B00756GKBA|1.0|I only liked the first song (Girls Gone Wild) on this MDNA CD. The rest of the songs are so-so and the lyrics to some of them are just silly. I wasted my money buying this CD.
B001F0WXY0|3.0|The fact that this edition cost twice what the print edition does should mean someone at the publishing house took the time to edit and spell-check it. This is not the case and this is sadly a widespread practice with Kindle books. Get it together publishers! I'm willing to pay extra for the e-book format but I don't appreciate the lack of consideration for quality here. That said Dune is boss and totally worth reading more than once.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|All,<br />Don't waste your time with this book, did not get past chapter 3 as the writing is poorly executed. Feel like reading a Dick and Jane grammar school book. How this made the best seller list for this kind of drivel prose is beyond me. Try one of the classics, better written and a much better erotic read.<br /><br />Ron
B000R4SMCW|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  It is thrilling, but not in the sense of Raiders of the Lost Ark, but more like the movie Jagged Edge.  But then again, in Jagged Edge you were left wondering, througout almost the entire movie, who committed the murder.  In Fracture you know who committed the murder from the beginning - Anthony Hopkins!<br /><br />The excitement is watching Anthony Hopkins as he reveals his amazing and calculated plan to go free, even though Ryan Gosling has him dead to rights.<br /><br />Why is the movie called Fracture?  Well, you'll have to watch the movie to learn that.  *smile*
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so<br />fun and exciting
B007MAETA8|5.0|It is pretty difficult to rate art, especially music. That said, I pride myself in avoiding modern \\"pop,\\" as most lacks talent. Born and Raised definitely does not fall into this category. Although a new style, Born and Raised exposes the typical word crafting and guitar exhibitions that have become expected from John Mayer. The album has more of a 60-70s country vibe than the previous blues feel. In my opinion, this is not a negative, just the latest chapter in his continually evolving musical development. Most appreciated, it seems that in this album John Mayer was very honest and true to himself and who he has become. For me, this album is very enjoyable and will be my dedicated listen on my morning commute for at least the next several months.
0307949435|4.0|First of all, I think it is important to mention that it is NOT a diet book, it basically gives you base principles and explanations to lead you to a low carb diet but I think that the way Taubes explains things just perfectly helps you to be in the right mindset for starting your diet.  I tried several things in order to loose the 40 pounds I gained 4 years ago and always had the suspicion that none of it would would ever work.  The arguments raised by Taubes were just making sense for my logical mind and decided to give it a shot, and so far it seems to work, way more efficient than the $1,600 I once threw out for 50 hours with a personal trainer (result : 1 pond lost).  I started my low carb diet one week before a long business trip in Las Vegas (lots of restaurants with clients, drinks and unhealthy snacks) and managed to lose 3 ponds that week (all my colleagues who were with me gained between 2 and 4 ponds that week).  The hardest is to get rid of my sweet cravings (I am a Belgian and have a lot of Belgian chocolate brought by my family during their last stay in the US).  I did read some negative reviews but none of them seemed to have actually try a low carb diet.  As far as I am concerned, I want to try a bit more and see how much I can lose that way, while I still enjoy eating (only no sweets and desserts) and make it compatible with an active professional life style...<br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it lacks a bit of practical advice.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've grown accustomed to hating Amazon's free apps.  It seems like half the time the apps are just pure crap and the other half they are trying to spam permissions on you.  Still, one of the first things I do when I wake up is check the Appstore just in case.<br /><br />Well, this app surprised me.  I downloaded it, read the instructions and jumped right in.  With the brain still not functioning as I'm laying in bed, it took me a few minutes to get the gist of the puzzle.  However, it is a very interesting concept, reminding me a little of Sudoku.<br /><br />This app pertains to puzzles called nonograms.  Each nonogram has a square board with surrounding numbers.  The objective of the puzzle is to determine which cells in a grid have to be colored or left blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.  You may think you have the puzzle solved based on one set of numbers, but if you don't take the other numbers into consideration, you won't solve it.  It becomes increasingly difficult rather quickly.  Once I made it to the sixth puzzle, I had to put the game down because it was making my head hurt.  That and I'm at work now and productivity was non-existent.<br /><br />One complaint about the game is that as the game becomes more complex, the board gets much smaller to accommodate the extra tiles and I am continuously tapping the wrong tiles and having to redo it.  You can zoom in, but it is still annoying.  It could be my phone, (Droid Bionic) but I doubt it. Lastly, the other complaints I have is that there is no hint button or statistics.  The hint button could really help out on the more difficult puzzles and without I, I'm afraid I will get too frustrated all too quickly.  And with statistics being so ever prevalent in games now-a-days, I would like to see how quickly I can solve a puzzle.  Minor complaints, but the game itself is very fun.  Not a perfect app, but an entertaining one.  Now to wait another two months before Amazon provides another decent app...
B007JM4CWY|4.0|If you like LogicPic then you will like this game.  Remember when Sudoku became the big rage?  I had been playing that for years and it was called Number Place in the Dell Crosswords books.  Someone slapped a Japanese name on it and all of the sudden it was popular.  This is an addictive puzzle and has a variety of levels for how much you want to be challenged.  If you are a LogicPic fan you will like it but at this early point in using it I like LogicPic better.  It doesn't let you sweep your finger across a group of cells to fill them in.  And an X appears when you tap to erase what you chose which is confusing.
B007TVANDM|5.0|I am so happy I bought this book.  The pictures are great.  The flow of the words have such a beat.  I work in the children's department of a library and can't wait to read this book and all the Pete books in my story time.

B006WWP5KA|5.0|You really need to watch the first two seasons to really love season 3. I give the whole show a 5 star rating.
B007Z9QS5K|4.0|If you like romance movies, I would definitely recommend watching. with that said, I don't think this movie has much appeal to a male audience.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|This remake was ok but not as scary as the original movie. Didn't show enough of the ghost. Acting was good but many scenes were too dark to enjoy the scary intent.
B004H7QICG|5.0|This case is fantastic. I have had it for numerous years and it is great for quiet computing. Great for airflow. That being said, the design is a bit dated. Look at the newer antec p cases, which are cheaper and fit current systems better.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Really wanted to see this one work.  Was dissapointed with the difficulty figuring out how  to use it.  For example... the only way Ive found to exit it is to completely shut down my Kindle.  Hope it gets improved. Love the concept and would love to give it another download and try.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. I had a constant love/hate relationship with this story. In the end it didn't leave me disappointed.
145551389X|5.0|Hard copy of the most amazing book !<br /><br />Any GaGa fan, really should order it. The book itself is really expensive, I believe 50$ for hardcopy elsewhere, but the price on amazon cannot be beat !!<br /><br />Its 110% worth the price, wouldnt buy it anywhere else other than Amazon.<br /><br />High quality and resolution of the pictures, and thankfully the hardcover comes with a lamented paper cover to protect the hardcopy image of the book.<br /><br />A must have :)
B007JM4CWY|1.0|greetings fellow amazonians I just downloaded crossme while I take the bus to my job as a manure excavator at a local farm and boy does it hurt my head. I now know why the japanese are so smart because this game hurt my head. it was throbbing so bad that I went up to farmer rick, he's my new boss, and I puked on his shoes. since they were already covered with pig crap he didn't care all that much, but it still didn't make me feel better. for the rest of the day I had dizzy spells and hot flashes I swear that this game has turned me into a fifty year old woman. so beware before you play that this game could hurt your health. use with caution
B007V2UGPE|5.0|beat it in under a week. fun game but it needs more levels and make it harder. and quit being so stingy wiyh the gold drops.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I really recommend u guys getting this. I play this game every single day. if u hats this game then I have nothing to say to u.
B000VSBX34|5.0|This is a wonderful movie starring The Beatles. It's a little bit different style of a movie than The Beatles first movie \\"A Hard Days Night\\" which was kind of more of a documentry style film. This movie is more plot driven, with people trying to steal one of Ringo's rings. It's a lot of fun to watch. This movie also shows how \\"The Monkees\\" TV show was influenced.
B004IWF64Q|3.0|The quality of this movie was very good.  However, the story and music just don't stack up to the first Pocahontas movie.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've been wanting a mobile picross ever since I polished off the few games on the Nintendo DS. This game is very polished for a picross game. I especially like the fact that they have large puzzles.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|fun game. few glitches but mostly fun. has crashed only two times. I would recommend. this game to others as it is free.
B0081KTHEQ|2.0|I gave it an extra star because you have to admit, the storyline and the ending is good. But the overall graphics and display reminded me of the TERRIBLE graphics in a cheap B rated horror movie where you get drunk and laugh at it with your friends. This movie had so much potential, but it was definitely a let down. I wish the director and producers made more of an effort of effects, props, and graphics; this is the 21st century. Usually, even with movies done to display such a time period, still has good effects, props, and graphics. Movie fans...don't waste your time.
B004XZ99LO|5.0|\\"Journey of Man\\" is the quintessential Cirque du Soleil production. This is the definitive Cirque containing all of the elements that make every Cirque show brilliant: stunning gymnastics and acrobatics, vivid colors, emotive music and the simple message of life from birth to beyond. A \\"must-see\\".
B005LAIGP0|2.0|I have looked forward to seeing this movie since I first saw previews when it was in the theater and I REALLY wanted and expected to like it.  But I was sorely disappointed.  About 30 minutes into it, I was wondering WHEN in the heck it was going to end.  It was one of the most boring movies I've seen in quite a while and the entire story could have been told in a 15 minute short film.  The atmosphere was creepy as was the old mansion....that's about it....
B004SOR4H6|5.0|twitter oz amazing I totally think everyone should get it it is not like face book but close to it it short of abounds like its a stalked app but it is really not I say that because you follow peolple and yeah

0345803485|1.0|Like everyone else, I wondered about the fuss. CNN was dubbing this as 'mommy porn' so I was a bit curious.<br /><br />Dear God, what did I even read? It's like the 'author', if we can even call her that, grabbed her list of qualities she would find in her 'Dream Man' and attempted to write a character around the adjectives, rich, mysterious, sexual, and rich. I understand that it was based off of her Twilight fanfiction and this is a review for 'Fifty Shades' so I'm not going to go into Twilight. Though I have read Twilight and there are definitely extreme similarities between the two couples. Anastasia's constant lip biting and losing her appetite after one whiff of food and then not eating for three days.<br /><br />I sincerely hate how female authors always describe the perfect man of being obscenely wealthy. Of course, we would all love to just sit back in our mansions and have 'chocolate hot fudge brownie sex' but this is reality. At times, I felt like she was dating Zoolander. Another random tidbit about Anastasia, she's supposed to be incredibly intelligent. You know, showing that a woman can be empowering. However, the only detail we get towards this supposed quality is that she reads a lot of British literature, has a high gpa, and drinks very weak tea. Incredible, I almost got lost in her intelligent conversation starters like, \\"I don't remember reading about nipple clamps in the Bible.\\"<br /><br />The book is very basic. There aren't any layers or hidden meanings in anything. Very straightforward. If you really want to read this, borrow it from someone or get it from the library. Please don't pay for this book or you'll encourage other people to write novels out of their fanfictions.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I was late to the Downton Abbey party.  lol  I netflixed it about a month ago, and even my husband got sucked in.  We watched both seasons in about 2 weeks.  Now we are experiencing withdrawls.  Ha!  The writers are outstanding and the characters are multidimensional.  There isn't a bad actor in this show.  The costumes and sets are spectacular.  You are drawn in from the very first episode in season 1.  I bought both seasons (definitely buy the UK versions so they aren't edited and you get the Christmas episode as well) for my mother in law for Mother's Day, but now I'm wishing I had kept them for myself.  My birthday is next month, so I guess I'll just have to get them.  Woe is me.  ;) Can't wait for season 3 to start.  It reminds me a lot of the pbs miniseries Manor House where they did a social experiment, but this is fictional.
B006YGC7KK|5.0|Just fantastic. Easily Five Stars...... I just started watching this at a day I was tired after work and were bored to go out... at the end I got so hooked into it. Recently I purchased it from Amazon, even I have finished watching the whole First Season on Netfilx. I meant the season One... and now I just per-ordered the second season of it too. It is going to be in my Blu-ray Collection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All I have to say is this book was so much better than the first. So good that I am filled with glee and feel like dancing.  As the sypnosis states, Ana has recently broen off her relationship with Christian.  Heartbroken, she can't eat, can't sleep.  In fact she cries her self to sleep every night.  She even loses weight because she is that sick about what shleaving Christian.  Anyway she starts her job at SIP as Jack's assisstant.  On the night of her friend Jose's show, Christain picks Ana up from work and gives her a lift thto the show.  But Christian can't contain himself.  He missed her so much, he grabs her and shows her how much he missed her.  So once again they begin a relationship.  But this one is so much better.  We will finally find out if Christian can truly face his past and move on to the future. And we find out if he can truly learn to love Ana as muc as she loves him.  Ana and Christian face their ups and downs, but through this there is  extremely hot sex scenes even better than before.  Not just f***ing, but making love. I was filled with so much glee during this book.  And it has a great ending I think everyone will enjoy.  Can't wait to read book 3!
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|The movie was ok.  Interesting story, Brad Pitt acting was only marginally average.  This movie is more of a renter than a buyer.
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|This movie was not for me.  I do not have an issue watching violent movies, but this one was too much for me.  I didn't think that was possible.  It is very slow moving for the first 45 minutes or so, and then it vamps up.  I've heard that the books are great, but I'm afraid this movie made it where I don't want to read them no matter how good they are.  The actors were great, and the story was interesting, but like I said, it was just way too much for me.  Even my husband didn't like it, which is odd.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|OK - I'm a Train fan. Pretty much love everything they do. Thought the last album - Save Me San Francisco - was really good and would be hard to top, but absolutely loving this new album. Drive By is the current radio hit, but I think I like Bruises and 50 Ways even more.
B007FRA8Z8|5.0|Electra Heart is a great album, the lyrics have deep meaning, and the music is phenomenal. This is a very well produced album and I really hope the US welcomes it with open arms. Marina can actually sing and has major talent. This is a must buy!
1401235417|5.0|Of the new Batman series started in DC 52, this one started a bit slow.  When the \\"Detective Comics\\" started with a bang with Batman vs Joker, Scott Snyder started this with a typical mystery theme.  However from the second month, the story propelled into a different orbit.  The Talon and the way Bruce trying to figure out their origin are all like a classic thriller.  The best part was when Batman got trapped in the maze.  It really shows how the super hero is nothing but a human.  Nice psychological thriller.  While the rest of the Batman series in the new 52 fizzled out, Scott's story telling was getting stronger and stronger and still going well.  Tell you honestly, after this arc is over it will be tough for us (and for Scott too) to expect the next villain to beat the court of Owls.<br /><br />The violence is bit over the top in some places but for the pain the Court of Owls inflicted on Batman, his anger is understandable.<br /><br />Highly recommended Batman series out of all the new 52.
0061148512|4.0|\\"It was a queer and sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs.......that's all there was to read about in the papers--goggle eyed headlines staring up at me from every street corner.  I couldn't help wondering what it would be like being burned alive all along your nerves.\\"<br /><br />And so begins this novel, documenting the life of one young Esther Greenwood as she starts off working as an intern at one of NYC's more prestigious magazine firms, and ends up in the nuthouse.<br /><br />The way Esther documents (she and a friend) getting picked up by some DJ on the street in NYC is hilarious, but this, unfortunately, is perhaps the last bright spot in the book and we have barely turned the cover. The book then takes us on a manic roller coaster journey in and out of mental institutions that would come to be synonymous with Plath's life, on which this novel is based.  The rest, alas, is history.<br /><br />But Esther, or Sylvia Plath, was not simply crazy.  She was highly rational, in my mind anyhow.  Knowing how much to tip, however, was one thing that caused the young Esther much consternation.  She documents getting stalked by a taxi driver after exiting the cab after not having left a substantial enough gratuity.  And as for her reflections on room service, this is what she writes: \\"I could have called down and asked for breakfast in my room, I guess, but I would have to tip the person who brought it and I never know how much to tip.  I'd had some very unsettling experiences trying to tip people in New York.\\"<br /><br />Critics call this book self-absorbed, but we are all self-absorbed in our own ways, are we not?  I see Ms. Plath, or the young Esther Greenwood, as a sensitive woman who was simply overwhelmed by the contradictions, intricacies, cruelties and vagaries of life.  And, of course, there may have been, and probably was, a chemical imbalance somewhere in that mind of hers.  Those less sensitive of us would simply call her a \\"paranoid nutcase,\\" but as one person noted, \\"Sylvia Plath had a way with darkness..........\\"  She sure did.<br /><br />Read this book at the risk of getting severely depressed but at the same time learning that you aren't crazy--you are simply a lone fish in a crazy world.<br /><br />Rick gives it four stars.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I hardly ever write reviews but then again I never read a book then immediatly start from the beginning to read it again.  I just finished reading this for the second time in 4 days!  It is a roller coaster ride of a book and I will read it again.  Download the free sample and you will be hooked!!  To the author:  I would love to read this in Travis's point of view also or maybe a sequel.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|it was so much hype over nothing. no interest in reading the other books. it's very predictable what will happen.
B007O3QC8K|5.0|Bruckner struggled to complete this work.  He was working on the orchestration on the last day of his life.  While he lived to complete the draft of the finale, souvenir hunters walked off with pages of the score, including the all important coda.  Starting in the 1970s William Carragan and (in this recording) Samale, Phillips, Cohrs & Mazzuca have worked on completions of performing versions of the surviving sketches.  Many have failed to be convinced of the finale's greatness.  I believe that this is due to its rarely being played.  This stunning performance of the 2012 revision (a vast improvement of their previous revision)should help matters along.  Rattle beats Schaller (who performs Carragan's version - my favorite).  This is the best performance of the four movement version  - so far.<br /><br />Of course Rattle can't compare with Furtwangler or Klemperer in the three movement version.  Nobody expects him to.  I don't have much to say about this.  I would just be repeating the other reviewers.  Bruckner was right.  I've always known that and was privileged to attend the world premiere of the completion (by Carragan) on Jan. 8, 1984.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely couldn't put it down!  I loved having it on my Kindle Fire so I could take it anywhere & read the next book the second I finished the last. It was also a very good price!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is soooooooooo much fun. This game is fun because you can choice a girl or boy and you have a daughter and a son they teach you fishing and you get to have your townsfolk and you get them(your townsfolk)you also get to expand your town and get new stuff but don't just waste your money oh and there's this little simile face that tells you if your townsfolk are happy or sad or angry
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the most outstanding book I have ever read that was a true story. The bravery of our military is beyond words! I could not put the book down and I intend to read it again. You will not be disappointed. I was on the edge of my seat almost all the time I was reading. I would really love to meet Marcus Luttrell face to face and tell him \\"Thank you\\" and how proud I am of him and all our other military for all that they do!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|look its super awesome but something about aren't that good I like it a lot but its not the best
B005LAIGNC|2.0|Action sequences were fantastic BUT........the storyline and acting was just god awful! 10 minutes into the dialogue almost<br />put me into a coma. I found myself not caring about any of these characters. Want to see a great film along the same lines?<br />Do yourself a favor and see GLORY with Denzel Washington. Now THAT'S a great movie! The writers of Red Tails should take lessons<br />on what makes a great character driven story.
B00785P2QC|4.0|nice sim game, i think g5 did a good job on this one you can do alot of stuff on here. i recommend it.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Once again an extremely well put together movie being criticized by those that have racism built within!  You know who you are!  Mostly the same type of folks that can't stand to admit that it existed and still exists.  So these lowlife bigots get on amazon and trash movies like Red Tails and Miracle at St. Anna because they can't face up to the harsh realities!  Anyway, kudos to George Lucas for making such a great film and exposing the world to these unknown heroes!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the graphic are great and you get a ton of money ( not real of course) tor the smallest thing I could not put this game down and I played it all night

B0052VUNHC|5.0|NO SPOILERS here! I was not too sure about this book when I read some of the reviews but finally decided to buy it. From the title you can imagine this book could have a good or bad ending. At the beginning I was a little unsure about what Abby's back-story was and a little disappointed that more was not shared. But once I started it, I could NOT put the book down! And I'm glad that they let you find out about her past as the rest of the characters do. And the back and forth between Abby and Travis really sucks you into their world. The other characters in the book were well placed as well. I have the kindle version so sometimes its hard to tell when you're coming to the end of a book. Just when I was beginning to wonder if I was almost at the end of this one, something crazy happens and leaves you wondering what could happen next! I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really lkke this game but you always run out of money so fast... at least i do! otherwise its a great game (:
0470474874|5.0|This book has made it easy to brush up on things I knew I could do in Excel, but just couldn't remember how. It's also been a lifesaver in getting up to speed on the changes from Excel 2007 to Excel 2010. I consider myself an intermediate to advanced user (vlookups, pivots, etc.) and this book is helping me up my nerd credibility by giving me access to the new enhancements available in Excel 2010. The table of contents and index are both laid out well, so it's easy to get to specific items quickly. It also has a lot of tutorials and well-written explanations of why certain things work they way they do in Excel. I highly recommend this book as a desk reference - it also comes with a free ebook, which is great if you travel and don't want to lug the paper copy around.
B003DO13O2|5.0|Could it really be true? The original 1974 Vinyl Release Mix of Hergest Ridge has finally been remastered for CD? This is a long-awaited and amazing event. While lesser known than Tubular Bells, this album deserves at least equal grandeur and status. Indeed, I would give Hergest Ridge it`s rightful place as the most beautiful, and pastoral, of progressive art-rock albums!  Around the time of the LP`s release I recall reading how Mike Oldfield defended the music against one reviewer criticizing it for repetition. Comments like that were very untrue and hurtful. There was a different, this time, brilliant, reviewer who said, &#34;...an excess of repetition is not present in this composition, in fact, it would be welcome, in the face of such melodious beauty!&#34; It`s true, I do find myself longing for more, and these are truly melodies richly deserving of what little repetition Mike Oldfield composed for them. I can hear the melodic evolution taking place in changes both subtle and great, and of course the listener is greatly rewarded with an unparalleled onslaught of aural astonishment, and pleasure.  The sad thing for me was thinking that Mike Oldfield had taken this insane criticism to heart, and actually remixed the album for CD release! Of the two CD versions that I have heard, both had been altered by delaying the introduction of melodic themes at the beginning of side 1. This would reduce the amount of times these worthiest of gorgeous, mysterious, and sublime melodies would be realized, and it never made sense, compositionally, when compared to the 1974 Original Mix. I was just reading other reviews that mentioned different reasons for the early CD mixes. I`m so glad to see the effort is being made to get it right! I know that nothing will ever compare with the Original Master Analog Tape Mix of Herest Ridge, as presented on the 1974 Vinyl release. I know now that I can buy this in the confidence that now the Original Master Analog Tape of Hergest Ridge has finally been successfully transfered to CD.  Thankyou, your friend - Jim.

0307716546|4.0|After falling in love with Rosemund Lupton's first book, Sister.  I was eagerly awaiting her sophomore novel.  She did not disappoint.  Similar to Sister, Afterwards is about mystery and family.  It is also written in the first person from the point of view of the central character Grace.<br /><br />While attending an outside school event for her 8 year old son, fire breaks out in the school.  Grace rushes into the burning building to save her 17 year old daughter that is inside.  Terrible injured, Grace and her daughter Jenny are both in a coma.  However, Grace and Jenny can leave their bodies to interact with one another and watch their loved ones as this family disaster unfolds.  It is soon learned that the fire is no accident; someone is trying to kill Jenny.  How can Grace save her daughter when she cannot communicate with the living.<br /><br />Lupton does an excellent job creating the twists and turns in this mystery.  But this book was much deeper than that.  Lupton is able to create a story that comes very close to the reader being able to experience what it is like to be a mother.  You can feel the love that Grace has for her daughter.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It keeps you interested from beginning to end. Love the story and how and why everything happened the way it did. Couldn't put it down.
0545265355|3.0|I got a sample of the first book and I was totally hooked. It was amazing, so I went ahead and just bought the trilogy. The first book was on of the best books I've ever read. I loved the storyline, the romance, the characters, the Capitol lifestyle vs the districts everything was totally enthralling. The second book was good as well, and I loved the twists and the romance love triangle. However when I got the the third book....um....horrid comes to mind.So 3 stars for that.
0307951529|5.0|This book was absolutely superb. I only wish i could go back in time and pat myself on the back for deciding to buy it. At first I was skeptical about paying $23, after all, if I started a business I would only have $77 left. I decided that since his last book was so eye opening, I would try one more. Lo and behold it was just as eye opening. You know I liked playing with electronics in college. So I after years of daydreaming about playing around I've finally started at home. I don't know if I'm going to start a business out of it, but I sure am proud of myself for following my passion.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I haven't played this type of game before but I do enjoy puzzle games. It's refreshing to play a puzzle game that isn't word based.  I played this game for about 15 minutes and got the hang of it.  The easy puzzles are just that, easy, which helps you learn how to play which is nice.  I'm looking forward to playing the more difficult puzzles.  The graphics look nice and the game sounds good too.  The game is easy to use, though the squares are small and the game sometimes marks a square you didn't want.  The developer is smart though because you can zoom in and out on the puzzle board.  Overall a great game.  HTC Thunderbolt stock rooted.

145470246X|5.0|As the husband of a passoinate avid beader focusing on elegant bead and crystal necklaces, braclets, and earings, my wife says that to date, this is by far the best bead book she have ever seen. Loaded with intermediate and advanced colorized, technical instructions, the format is strikingly clear and fresh. As she turns each page I keep hearing \\"wow, oh wow, that is wonderful.\\" I haven't seen my wife this excited about her hobby in quite a long time. She can't wait to start on the many unique jewelry designs contained within this marvelous text.
B001N4Q4MA|5.0|\\"A person is a person, no matter how small\\"... Such is the central message of the movie, which, teaches how a person should be treated like a person because he is a person as such, and not for any other reason. The movie is also very enjoyable.

There are multiple uses for this puzzle, besides being a great thinking and logic game!
B000021Y77|5.0|I was so excited to find that Amazon had this film for sale. I saw it when it first came out in theaters in the US. It's my very favorite foreign film and I love having it as part of my movie collection. This film was hard for me to find and I was so thrilled when Amazon had it. The music in this film is amazing and I also purchased the music cd from Amazon, which was very difficult to find elsewhere.<br />Thanks again Amazon!
0143120581|4.0|First off, the delivery of this book was speedy and arrived at the estimated time of delivery. Secondly, this story by Amy Chua was phenomenal.

I highly recommend this book to others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was nervous at first buying this trilogy because everyone's reviews are about how the font changes in size all the time, turning pages some of the pages are missing.  I bought the trilogy set anyways and couldn't be more happy!  Yes it did have minor flaws but you can reset the font size and as for the pages, flip back a page and flip forward again and it appears so it's not the end of the world.<br /><br />As for the books themselves, AMAZING!! I absolutely loved these books and I'm sad I'm done with them already!

I know the Christmas songs are not out of place, they just have no interest for me.<br /><br />But those two are well worth the price of the CD so I'm glad I sprang for it, admittedly the cover photo of Sting with dog is the main reason I bought it. A happy find...
B007K3JCAE|1.0|The film is excellent, but I find it extraordinarily irritating that UltraViolet continues to be adopted.

067144901X|5.0|This is my 15 month old's favorite book by far and has been for months now.  I honestly have to hide it from her or we would read it constantly.  And while it's cute, there is no book that I want to read 100 times in a row.  She's not old enough to where she participates verbally with \\"reading\\" the book but she does love to shake her head no at the pigs singing.  So cute!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Another hit from Nicholas Sparks. Could not put it down!! Great plot and character development. Loved this one : )  Can't wait to see the movie, hope they did the book justice!
0345803485|3.0|If you are looking for stellar writing then this is not the book for you. If however you want a hot, harmless bit of fun then you have hit the jackpot.  The writer thankfully purchased a thesaurus but seems to use it rather seldom.  Everyone in the book clambered into every type of vehicle, I stopped counting at twenty!  But I did not buy it for the vocabulary, this was like a really good cheeseburger, very satisfying, extremely bad for you and very enjoyable!  Anna being a virgin even to the point of never masturbating in this day and age is akin to a virginal birth minus the ass and angels. Her instant ahem skill at oral pleasure is to be envied!  She is obviously an oral savant.  The speed of the relationship was a tad unrealistic but why should realism be a deterrent to the progression of the book? Overall I do not think it was believable but who cares, it was bloody hot! My one complaint about the sex was that it was from Ana's point of view, I feel it should have been from Christian's.  Having read the original fan fiction which gave it from his point of view ican only say it would have garnered the book another star!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love all of these puzzles and would absolutely buy more like these,fun, addicting and I would highly recommend them to people who like jigsaw puzzles.

B0053O89Z6|2.0|I'm a huge fan of HIMYM. The first four seasons are excellent. Season 5 disappointed me with its poor handling of the Robin/Barney relationship, and then a bunch of fillerish episodes. Season 6 redeemed itself right away, setting up a new mystery with the wedding where Ted will meet the mother. The season contained small hints at whose wedding it might be, but there were also a lot of strong arcs involving Marshall and his father, and Barney and his father. There was also Ted, who spent the majority of that season in a relationship with the antagonistic Zoey. The finale revealed to us that one of the people getting married at that wedding \\"a little ways down the road\\" was none other than Barney!<br /><br />Season 7 starts off strong with \\"The Best Man,\\" but quickly falters from there. Much of the first third of the season are lackluster episodes, as we follow Barney pursuing a relationship with Nora, Robin pining after Barney and then presumably giving up in favor of her therapist-turned-boyfriend, Kevin. Ted ties up some loose ends with Victoria, and Marshall and Lily try to figure out where they want to raise their child. The action picks up a bit in 7.9, \\"Disaster Averted,\\" which is another standout episode in the season, which takes the tension between Barney and Robin up a notch by having them hook up again. That plotline continues in 7.10, where despite having a discussion which may lead to their getting back together, Robin mercilessly rejects Barney in favor of Kevin. 7.11 is nothing special with a very misleading cliffhanger, and 7.12 is a tearjerker of an episode with a very cruel twist.<br /><br />And from there the season completely sputters. Despite all the build-up between Barney and Robin, long stretches of episodes go by without them addressing anything that's happened. Instead we get a lot of lackluster filler episodes, like \\"Tailgate,\\" \\"The Burning Beekeeper,\\" and \\"46 Minutes.\\" Barney gets a new love interest just as Robin and Kevin split, and Tedtakes the breakup as an opportunity to once AGAIN tell Robin he loves and and wants to be with her. Mercifully she doesn't reciprocate his feelings, and ends up moving out of the apartment, but that doesn't stop Ted from moping about her for practically the rest of the season. (Hadn't these two already made peace with their past relationship? Like...many times before??) The season ends with the bride reveal, which while not surprising in the least is a step in the right direction, and Ted taking off with Victoria, who has skipped out on her wedding.<br /><br />There were so many issues with this season. Lack of a real plot for Ted, who spends the majority of the season either playing odd third wheel to Lily and Marshall's pregnancy, or pining after Robin again. He does have a few moments, such as with Victoria and the Slutty Pumpkin, where we remember what the show is actually about, but those are few and far between. Marshall and Lily spend so much time deciding to move out to Long Island ... and then move back a couple episodes later. Talk about going in circles. And Robin's character takes a nosedive into the absurd when she's stripped of just about every quality we ever liked about her. She breaks Barney's heart, accepts a marriage proposal from a man she's only dated a few months, is mopey and whiny and insecure. Not to mention, I'm not sure what was up with the wardrobe this season, but she looked awful. (Which is ridiuclous, since the actress is quite pretty!) Barney breaks a record by having two serious outside love interests in one season.<br /><br />Overall, this season was extremely disappointing. Here's hoping S8 can pick up the pieces and get back to telling the stories we love about the characters we love. I'll probably be buying this for completions sake, but aside from a couple of standouts, this one is definitely a season to catch on Netflix or in reruns.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|A new age twist to and age old problem.  Refreshing book that leads one along a seemingly normal pathway that travels a road of rebirth, frolicking, anguish and hope.  Thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love building games.  My only complaint is that I don't like games where they want you to use real money to buy stuff.  I have better things to do with my money than buying extras for games.  Other than that,  I love this game.
B007UR1OHO|4.0|I enjoy seeing Rachel McAdams act, and while I have to admit this is the first time I've ever seen Channing Tatum act I thought he did a great job with his role.  If you're looking for a nice romantic movie, this won't disappoint.  However, after I read about the real-life couple whose story inspired this one, I was a bit disappointed in how Hollywood depicted this couple.  I think it could have been so much better if certain elements had not been removed from the story, while others were added.  Some characters could have been left out entirely, and I think the movie would have been a lot better (example, the old boyfriend).  In short, while I think this is a good entertaining movie, I think it could have been so much better if the story line had followed the true story of the couple who endured so much difficulty to stay committed to one another and their marriage - now that would have made for a great movie!
0307719219|3.0|One of the big questions in economics is why some nations are rich and some are poor.  This is beyond a mere theoretical question because the answers generated effect how we try to provide aid and resources to lift these nations out of poverty.  A current model is that nations are poor because their leaders lack enough information to make sound economical decisions for their country.  If we just give them resources, they will make better decisions and their nations will begin to prosper.  Of course, we've been trying this for decades so if that is the correct answer we should have solved the world's prosperity problems by now. In this book, the author's propose the theory that the type of government a nation has is the primary reason why a nation will either prosper of fail.  If the government is extractive (it exists to extract from its people so that a small group can prosper) the nation will fail.  If the people have the power and the government exists to serve the will of the people, an inclusive government, the nation is much more likely to prosper. Thus, supplying an extractive government with aid and resources will never result in prosperity because the ruling elite will siphon the money/resources off for their own means and ends.<br /><br />There is a great deal of truth that seems inherent to this argument.  However, the authors try to argue that other factors such as geography or culture matter little when it comes to whether a nation will prosper and fail. The authors argue that, contrary to the thesis of Jared Diamond's Gun's Germs and Steel, it is government, not geography that determines a nation's prosperity.  Well, what determines government?  Diamond's thesis argued that geography was critical to government and that the geographical constraints of Europe were critical for the type of culture that arose which gave rise to the type of government that followed.  If it is only government and not other factors such as geography, why is there such a difference in prosperity between places with the same government but where the geography is vastly different?  The Ozarks are rural, mountainous, and lack good soil for crops and the region is very poor.  Yet this is in the US so this should be a prosperous region because its people have access to the same government systems as those in St. Louis, a much more prosperous region which is just over a hundred miles away. Clearly, there is a role for geography in determining prosperity.<br /><br />The authors make interesting arguments but they bend and cherry pick arguments to solely fit their thesis.  The problem with the real world is that the answers are never this easy.  Nations are poor for a variety of reasons, government being only one (although a major one). This was an interesting read but lacks from nuance.  Also, it would have benefited from an editor who could have cut out some of the repetitious sections.rence in prosperity between places with the same government but where the geography is vastly different?

B0079KGAOY|4.0|Richard Donner's long-running LETHAL WEAPON series may have run its course by the time its fourth installment was released in 1998, but for action fans, they remain personal favorites -- the pinnacle of the Joel Silver-produced, stylized \\"buddy pictures\\" that became a permanent part of our movie-going culture during the 1980s and 90s.<br /><br />Of course, it helped that Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, as a pair of mismatched L.A. cops, had splendid chemistry together on-screen, and also that Donner, who seemed to find his niche as an action filmmaker with the series, handled each picture with plenty of energy and distinction. Go ahead, say that two, maybe even three films in the series was enough -- but you won't find a lot of viewers who weren't at least mildly entertained by either the first or second entries in the series at least, while parts 3 and 4 made box-office chum of its counterparts financially if nothing else (though with the star profit participation and salaries, I'm not sure the studio made a whole lot of money in the process).<br /><br />After a lengthy delay (the European versions of this set have been available for well over a year), Warner has rolled out a 5-disc LETHAL WEAPON COLLECTION on Blu-Ray, offering improved 1080p transfers of the first two films (previously available only in awful-looking, standalone Blu-Ray platters), the debut of the later sequels, and a bonus documentary. Each film is presented in its original theatrical version with the deleted scenes offered as extras.<br /><br />All the transfers here are quite good, and if you previously owned the old Blu-Ray or HD-DVD editions of the first two films, you'll notice an appreciable improvement in those transfers here, with stronger detail and bolder colors. The third and fourth films fare even better, with DTS MA soundtracks on-hand for each picture.<br /><br />Extra features aren't overwhelming - the main draw are the copious deleted scenes, some of which had been added to prior, director-unapproved \\"Extended Cuts.\\" Donner contributes commentary tracks that are, unfortunately, not all that interesting, dominated by long gaps of silence and with the director having to be prompted by an off-mike moderator at certain points. Music videos are also on-hand throughout the four movie platters, with the fifth disc reserved for a four-part, almost two-hour new documentary. I say \\"new,\\" even though this retrospective talk with the principal players (Donner, Gibson, Glover, etc.) was shot in the spring of 2010. It's an engaging and fun look back at the series' production, showing that the chemistry between the stars and director was, unsurprisingly, as strong off-camera as it was on the screen.<br /><br />Even if the supplements are a bit light, this is still a recommended purchase for \\"Lethal Weapon\\" fans, though the international, region-free box-set release is considerably less expensive (and has the exact same content on it).
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Much has been written about this series in the past year and I only have to add that the dramatic tension was sorely lacking for me, especially in the last few books. I only finished them to find out if the author would finally give a satisfactory and happy ending. Alas, this was not to be so. They were okay, not exactly master works of art, but decent candy reading. Even then, I felt that the author could have done more.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Looked forward to my reading sessions with this book.  Laugh out loud funny and a feel good story.  It picked up my mood every time I read it.  Because chapters were short, it was good reading while waiting in doctor's office or waiting for my daughter to finish gym classes. Easy to follow, clear, and succinct were qualities that made this book easy to read.  Anyone can identify with her because she presents her story with feelings everyone encounters in everyday life.  If she wrote another book, I would definitely read it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is so well written and planned that I nearly believed a zombie war actually happened. He took the old zombie genre and made it real.
B005I3PAUO|1.0|Why would an acclaimed author like David Baldacci need to copy his John Puller character from Lee Child's Jack Reacher?  Improbable as both these characters are, Reacher is far superior to Puller.

B007R41E8O|3.0|Nice graphics and almost a good storyline. Almost good because they failed to deliver any story conclusions that made sense. *warning semi spoiler* I would have been nice to know what the heck was up with that pregnant lady walled up and her handyman who got shot among many other things! Poor storyline and bad ending!

0375842209|5.0|How dramatically can reading change you?<br /><br />The Bible - yes. That's what it's meant to do after all.<br /><br />But then came the unexpected.<br /><br />It is now about 5 years since I first read The Book Thief by Markus Zuzak.<br /><br />I laughed and I cried - and I held my breath often at the absolute beauty of the writing.<br /><br />Dramatic I know but the truth. After reading this beautiful book every other book I picked up seemed somehow empty, boring and silly. The Book Thief lifted my heart, educated me, and made me long to find some more books that could become true treasures in my bookshelf.<br /><br />I'm still looking for one as emotionally fulfilling.<br /><br />I don't want to tell you about the contents - I want you to experience it for yourself.<br /><br />Thank you Markus for the joy you have given to so many.
B007L96SI6|5.0|I don't write \\"reviews\\", because really who gives a care on what people think. I'm just a music listener. I'm also not an American Idol fan. But I am a fan of this young woman's voice and the direction she is going with her sound. I must say that this is an amazing album debut. There is not one track on 'Listen Up' that I dislike. I actually love them all. I can't help but get lost in her melodies. The throwback sound and style is truly refreshing. I can hear the likes of Lilly Allen, Adele, Amy Winehouse, and The Supremes to name just a few. But all in all I hear Haley. This will be an album for the summer and for every other season. ;) Please don't take my words for it. Fans of music from any genre and decade give it a listen! You won't regret it.
0439023513|1.0|This trilogy started off good but the last book, meh.  The ending felt rushed and the \\"love\\" triangle between her and Gale and Peeta was not done well at all.  It felt like the author reached a work count quota and decided to finish it as quickly as possible.  Very disappointing ending to what was a good start.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I used to play this game all the time on my Nintendo DS (Picross), totally stoked to see this as the FAOTD! Great brain teaser!
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|The fight scenes alone makes this movie worth watching.  In real life the main character is an actual MMA fighter and does all of the stunts.  My husband didn't want to see it, but I had heard positive reviews on it, that I had to see it.  He actually liked it more than I did.  Youtube has some great videos on her training for the movie- look at the fighting scenes and here the actors talk about the bruises they all received.  The movie is believable, unlike some of the other more prominent movies with an 80 pound actresses able to bring down a Russian...

B0042J6VUS|5.0|There's really nothing bad about this product.  It came like it was supposed to and works fine.  (Although the springs on the adjuster part are a bit tight.  It falls over if you don't spread the legs out, but I suppose any tripod would...The only problem is that it's so small that I can carry it around with me everywhere, but it's not particularly useful.  I bought it so that if I was out with friends at dinner or something we could take pictures and my cell phone would be steady, but it's kind of cumbersome to pull out and set up for that purpose.  So it works, but I just don't use mine.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just enough detail to keep you reading for the \\"sexy\\" aspect but not over the top.  Loved the series. I read all three books in less than a week.  It definitely gets you thinking.  The details make you picture the characters like you are there. A great escape from reality.
B007FH9GT2|3.0|Pretty good movie, good story line. There are some scenes that were pretty bad so just fast forwarded through them. I did like the acting so all in all I would give it 3 stars.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Finally a worthy free download on the Amazon Appstore. I almost gave up hope on here because quality of the apps they have on here are usually mediocre to poor. a few occasions they have great apps and games, like this one. This Nonogram puzzler (might know it as Picross on the Gameboy and Nintendo DS counterparts), is a wonderful puzzle game for Picross addicts like myself. The controls are responsive and aren't difficult to master. The zoom feature is really nice too. I've been a fan of Picross since I've encountered Mario's Picross on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, and since have bought its newer versions of it, Picross DS and Picross 3D, I can never get tired of these kind of puzzles. Think of it as sudoku combined with crossword to make a picture according to the placement of numbers. If you're puzzle fiend who wants to explore outside if crosswords and sudoku, or want to poke certain unused parts of your brain, or if you love Picross as much as I do, this game is for you!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my first book review ever!  I loved this book; I couldn't put it down!  I can't wait for the next installments, and in the mean time am looking forward to reading more of Hugh Howey's books!

B003Y5H5HY|4.0|Rooney Mara does a fantastic job as Lisabeth.  If you get the Blu Ray version check out the special features to get an insightful view of the characters and making the movie.  Watch the movie first.  If you have an opportunity read the books also.
1846555248|5.0|Spectacular book from start to finish.  I agree that the timeline-jumping threw me off a couple of times -- perhaps the publisher will consider including a table of contents (chapter titles and dates) in future editions -- but that's a minor quibble.  The atmosphere of the book is wonderful, and the author's writing style is smooth and enjoyable.  Really a magical book, and I look forward to seeing more from Erin M.
B007JM4CWY|1.0|My uncle builds cars in Asia and says this game is an intentional rip off of minesweeper, designed by the red commies in Vietnam. He says it was made for girls, meant to brainwash them into only wanting to have a boy when it is time to fulfill their one kid quota. This app is bad news! Only download if you support communism, socialism, obamunism, or the binding of oriental's feet in an attempt to limit their reproductive desires to have more than one kid.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|The movie is the usual action thriller but what makes this movie stand out is the original part of SALT was for a male actor.  There was a great transition to making the part for a female.  I think the biggest difference of this movie is the alternate ending which involves watching the Alternative movie that has a different ending. It's not just a pasted alternative ending.  It's an ending that changes scenes and parts of the movie that results in the ending.  I personally like the Alternative movie.
1609613937|5.0|I have been a \\"McDougaller\\" for a long time now. Within the last year I was diagnosed both with chronic kidney disease and autoimmune disease. Long story short: I must, in the main, avoid sodium and potassium. That means no vegetable starch (potatoes, yams, legumes) and no tomatoes. This is oversimplified. I now eat nonfat low-potassium whole grains (rice, corn, oatmeal, barley -- cutting way back on wheat) and nonfat vegetables, avoiding too much of the dark green leafy type (while they are loaded with nutrients, they are also loaded with potassium -- so I have to be careful). No bananas, oranges, or cantaloupes -- too much potassium. It's tough, but still possible. For anyone without these problems however, I would say that \\"The Starch Solution\\" and \\"The China Study\\" become the best two-book library you could have on state-of-the-art vegan nutrition. The one is the application of the other.<br /><br />[UPDATE 2/11/15: I have totally re-evaluated what I said about high-potassium foods, because I devised a way to track the potassium content and the protein content of my daily food intake. I have also retained a really good dietician who is teaching me how to read the numbers on my medical bloodwork and lab work and adjust my food choices accordingly. When you know the safe limits, you can eat anything. Basically I use a really good online site (SELFNutritionData) to track what I eat to the ounce in terms of calories, potassium and protein content. I made a chart. I weigh my foods. [[ASIN:B00FJFJDGS Smart Weigh PL11B Professional Digital Kitchen and Postal Scale with Tempered Glass Platform, Silver]] It sounds like tedium, but I can protect my kidneys now, by keeping protein and potassium in safe daily limits. And this changes as the results in my bloodwork change. I can eat what I like as long as I keep things under control according to what the bloodwork indicates.]
B002RKSV2U|5.0|Darwin started us down a very important and powerful path over 100 years ago.  He influenced so many great thinkers and scientists, that his legacy is incalculable.  Yes, it is written in a dated style, but I believe that this helps the reader understand the context of what Darwin is saying.  He is throwing off centuries of burdensome superstition, and assuming nothing.  In this way he not only hits the mark, but predicts a future science that we have since discovered.  Darwin did all this without knowledge of DNA, or the X and Y chromosomes.  Amazing!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Everyone told me, \\"Oh you have to read this book!\\"  I thought it was going to be a good book since it was on the Best Sellers List but was I disappointed.  I have to admit the writing was pretty good and the description was point on, but you can only go in that room one or two times and I got bores after the fourth sex scene.  I mean really, how many different ways can you do it?  I would have liked to have seen the other characters expanded more.  I would have liked to have seen Christian and Ana go out in public more...like to his social event and Jose's opening.  And the ending was SOOO disappointing.  My two star rating was actually a gift.[[ASIN:B007J4T2G8 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B008578H9G|5.0|I wont spoil it but lets just say this really is a very emotionally powerful episode and really ties the whole series together and really the outlook on the series as a whole is really in part because of this episode. Highly recommended best part is you can see \\"Swan Song\\" for Free!<br /><br />To be honest the quality of the last two episodes were so good (actually the last four episodes were very great) It really kinda puts a little downer on the 8th season as some of the episodes i felt wernt quite up to par with some of the better ones in the past.  But I think the last two episodes makes up for it and brings back the best...and worse of House and it also proves that this is a show where you cant entirely predict was is going to happen next, which i think is a good thing.  I am happy in how they did the final episode i think done any other way would not have been as great.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was skeptical at first. I read reviews that were no so great. Curious about all the hype I bought the book. I have not put it down. It draws u in from the first few pages. I love it.  Half way through book number two and it does not disappoint.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have found this app to be outstanding in many ways.  I always have multiple plans going, and I start every day with reading my plans and prayer. I was going to suggest adding a bible dictionary - but it appears the Glo-bible option contains that type of information. I use a different platform than is available at this time; but according to the Glo site - my platform will be available this fall.  Using the YouVersion app I have always been able to find references to what I need outside of the plans.  For example: I searched for divorce in the whole Bible. I was given multiple references that contained the word PLUS multiple references that didn't use the word but used the concept.  Much more than one would expect with a search.  I recommend this app for anyone that wants to understand the Word of God.  The multiple versions help when looking at a verse that seems unclear.  You can change versions on the fly without losing your original place that you started from.

0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay was dark enough that I flagged a bit in the middle reading it, but the ending was a surprise and brilliant.  Especially in that it didn't explain her final decision.  I'm not talking about choosing the boy she decided to marry.  That made sense, too; but her choice in the final spectacle was sudden [for the reader] and unexpected, and right.  She chose the way that would end the Games, and not start the cycle all over again. And we the readers did not have to have this spelled out for us.  Other reviews seem to consider Peeta the most sympathetic character vs Katniss, but I don't.  In Mockingjay he undergoes a transformation suitably daunting to Katniss, and she sustains a great personal loss as well; but always she is her own person, who reacts in an individual way to the role imposed on her by the rebels. Apart from the repetition in the second book of having to go through the games a second time--which admittedly was the worse thing that could happen to Katniss and Peeta--the series worked well for me. I normally do not read Young Adult books, except for those of a friend who is highly successful in the field; but I am seeing more fresh ideas and creativity in Young Adult fiction today than in adult fiction.  Kudos to Collings, who deserves her success.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|I had been thinking about this movie for a long time, finally found it.<br />Came still wrapped in original plastic, sales price tag was scratched off.<br />Watched it twice the first night.  Now I must get the tv series.

B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Firefly is one of the few TV shows (and movie!) that I always keep coming back to. The characters are just so memorable, and the story very unique. While it is a Sci-fi show, the story behind River and Simon's escape, along with Mal's (the captain) military history gives this show a western, frontier settlement edge to it. The main characters aren't some badass all powerful supersoldiers set out to find or kill galactic aliens or robots, but are a simple ragtag group of people who have found each other and are just trying to scratch by a living with any job they can get. Some legal, others not so much. Give the show a shot, the first episode is set to introduce you to all of the characters and provide as much information as it can (hence its 1.5 hrs), but it's well worth it.<br /><br />Oh, and Fox, you guys suck for cancelling the show.<br /><br />I'll be in my bunk.

B004EPYZXK|2.0|Although Apollo 18 is fairly okay as a science-fiction/horror film, anyone with a little common sense will not believe in its authenticity. For one, it contains the classic alien spider that is in some other science fiction movies. For another, they never tell how the so-called found footage made it from the moon back to earth. And telling of all, why would so-called authentic footage contain four different alternate endings? if something happens in real life, one can not say, \\"I don't like the way this went. I think I'll make a different ending.I may have given it more than two stars if they had come up with some sort of original alien. The movie is okay if you like those type. But it's not the kind of film I would go out of my way to watch again.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|One of the few albums in my collection that I enjoy from the first to last track.  As a Garbage album, it stands as one of their strongest.  Those that did not appreciate their more experimental times will enjoy the return to their roots, while fans of the latter-albums will not be disappointed in their ability to keep a 20-year-old sound fresh.<br /><br />In my first time listening to Not Your Kind of People, I was busy working on another project.  But several times over the course of the album I was stopped in my tracks and forced to sit, listen and focus on some of the more powerful or beautiful songs on the album.
B0068860WK|1.0|I've never been a big fan of war series, but my multimedia instructor made me watch this gruesome tale. This has a great depiction of the first half of WWII and I have to admit from time to time the scenes will hold me suspended, but for some reason I never enjoyed the series. I expected there'd be a lot more blood, but all I saw was shooting, nighttime, profanity, name mix-ups, and quite some confusion pertaining to what was happening and why did it happen.
B007H9B6KA|5.0|Fierce, tender and as unique as ever.  Garbage hasn't suffered any loss of swagger in their 7 year hiatus.  Old fans will be pleased, while those new to Garbage's work might be shocked to hear a piece of real music for the first time in a long time.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|Like many reviewers before me, I purchases this book based on all the positive hype.  I am a person who knows nothing of the legal system, so as to the legal misrepresentations stated by other reviewers, I have no opinion.  But I am an avid reader and love to lose myself in a story and characters.  None of the characters in this book were very captivating.  You knew all along that the \\"big reveal\\" was coming.  It was quite obvious throughout the book that the author was trying (too hard) to surprise you. It was anticlimatic to me.  I am not convinced at all that the story would have played out this way in real life.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This is a ghost story, pure and simple, with a haunted house, a curse, a vengeful spirit, all that good stuff.  Daniel Radcliffe elicits sympathy as an investigator who uncovers a secret about the former occupants of the house in question.  Creepy effects and production design add to the film's strengths.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm not offended by the content of this book so much as I am the quality (or lack thereof)of the writing. How does stuff like this get published? Very poor--redundant, lame plot, and I'm a little concerned about the idea of glorifying the sexual control of women. I will not read any more of them.
B0053KWDES|3.0|I had an E5 that I used constantly, and loved that little thing. After buying some really good headphones and earbuds I thought I'd upgrade my amplifier too and stepped up to the E11. I was very happy with the sound quality of this product, and quickly got over the somewhat large size of it (I typically use it with an iPod Classic.) Then one day, when it was about 4 months old, the 'In' jack started acting up. At first I thought it was the cable, so swapped cables, but the problem remained. Any slight touch to the cable would drop one channel, as if the cable were broken or the connection dirty. I've done what I can to troubleshoot the issue (cleaning the jack, checking with different cables, etc) to no avail. It's past the return window here at Amazon now, and it doesn't appear as though there's any help from the Fiio website regarding customer service.

B007URCTOG|2.0|At the end of the day, this movie is what it is. If you are expecting romantic greatness then you've come to the wrong place, because most of \\"The Vow\\" is very love story paint-by-numbers. But if you are looking for a fluff-piece to get you though Valentine's Day, because your significant other forgot to plan a nice dinner, then \\"The Vow\\" may be what you are looking for. In a nutshell, the main reason why \\"The Vow\\" is a subpar romantic movie is simpler than just \\"the acting was bad\\" or \\"the dialogue was poorly written\\". In a nutshell, \\"The Vow\\" doesn't work simply because not for one minute was I invested in any of the characters on-screen. And that is the kiss of death for any romantic film.

1932735410|4.0|Let me also start by saying that I did pass my PMP exam two days ago.<br />While I agree with some parts in the more negative reviewer's comments, I thought that overall this book, taken with a grain of salt - just like anything else in life - can be of tremendous help to pass your PMP exam.<br /><br />Some things I found while using this book:<br /><br />- Several of the chapter overview sections, that don't have any \\"Trick\\" or \\"Memorize\\" indicators and seem just 2-3 pages of plain text are often important to read because they contain several points that are potential exam questions.<br />- Since this book is full of page references to the PMBOK Guide, having an electronic copy of the PMBOK Guide is a must, so that you can easily reference that. When you apply for the exam, if you become a PMI member, you can download an electronic copy of the PMBOK Guide. I did feel I needed to use both together to get the whole picture.<br />- And I have to admit I did not use her process chart much (although I tried hard a few times) but memorized the one in the PMBOK.<br /><br />This book, the PMBOK Guide (mostly for reference and easy view of the Inputs/Tools & Techniques/Outputs) and a few good online test prep exams got me well prepared for my PMP exam.

The APIL President, Amanda Stevens, described the first edition of the `Guide to RTA Liability' as `an absolute gem'.  And she is quite right!<br /><br />Probably, for many practitioners in the county courts, it's the book of first choice when you need to check on any of the finer points of road traffic liability law. The statement of RTA law is brilliantly presented in a very clear and user friendly format and the step-by-step tips on the practicalities of litigation very well explained for the novice and the experienced advocate.<br /><br />The book has 25 chapters, each focusing on specific aspects of RTA liability. In addition, there are useful materials and precedents which we find invaluable in this area of law, especially at county court level where the bulk of the actions are heard.<br /><br />For the second edition, Andrew Ritchie QC has thoroughly updated his work and included coverage of developments in some of these areas of interest to the practitioner:<br /><br />* Claims made in the UK arising from foreign accidents<br />* New EC directive consolidating all old RTA Directives<br />* Pedestrians run down when drunk<br />* Failure to wear a seat belt<br />* What is a motor vehicle? Trail bikes and electric trikes<br />* A new section on draft model pleadings<br /><br />As Amanda Stephens says, when she expected the first edition `to be good'... it was, and the second edition is something we cannot be without when conducting RTA trials and advising in this contentious area of litigation!

1846613116|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2AWBYJ8C82FNN]]<br /><br />SOME WELL SETTLED PRINCIPLES TO THE FACTS FOUND<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Christopher Goddard has produced an excellent new edition of his work on occupational illness claims published by Jordan and the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL) who are the leading association of claimant PI lawyers dedicated to protecting the rights of injured people.<br /><br />APIL was formed in 1990 to promote full and just compensation for all types of personal injury and represents around 5,000 solicitors, barristers, academics and students.<br /><br />The second edition of Goddard's Guide meets the APIL criteria brilliantly as an authoritative information source for PI work on occupational illness which can be a tricky area to advise claimants on especially when pursuing wider redress in the legal system.<br /><br />Baroness Hale said in Gregg -v- Scott [2005] that \\"the vast majority of personal injury cases are not difficult.  The evidence may be complicated, witnesses may be confused or unreliable and the expert opinions may be contradictory or incomprehensible... Usually it is a matter of applying some well settled principles to the facts found.\\"  And how right she is! This statement does neatly describe the theme of the work.<br /><br />Goddard has addressed the principles by a consideration of the main five occupational illnesses.  He has the hope that the principles will be seen not only by application to the five areas but to other occupational illnesses and cites examples such as the technical and evidential differences between a dermatitis case and a Legionnaire's Disease case to cite one instance, and he describes the principles as being the `beacons which guide the preparation for the case and help to control the evidence and keep the case focused'.<br /><br />We liked, particularly, Goddard's application of the principles by taking the words of the Red Queen to Alice: \\"Now, here you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.  If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\\" (From: `Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There').<br /><br />It certainly does give a new dimension to this area of specialist personal injury litigation and we are very grateful to have this one-stop source of reference in a new edition. Thank you!of the Red Queen to Alice: \\"Now, here you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.

0345803485|5.0|I've been a self proclaimed 'non reader'' for my entire life. The few books I've read and finished have all been romance novels of some sort. So when I heard the buzz about this book I decided I'd give it a shot. I must confess that I read all 3 books in a weeks time.<br /><br />I will admit I started reading out of curiosity of the \\"kinky f***ery\\" I'd been hearing about. I'm not a bored house wife by any means, or in a marriage that lacks spice. I'm a very busy business owner, mother and wife... With that being said the book I was reading for kink
B007JM4CWY|4.0|The game is really good but for some reason when I close out the try to go back all that is there is a blank screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and still the same thing! I have never had this problem with anything on the kindle fire before.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm rating this one 4.5 of 5 Stars<br />So, after all they hype and seeing this book everywhere, I knew I had to pick it up and give it a read. I am very happy I did, 50 Shades of Grey is a really good book, the relationship between Anastasia and Christian is complex and compelling, and the sex is hot. However, I would not say that 50 Shades of Grey is exactly a favorite book, I didn't buy it 100% and for that reason I can't give it the full 5 stars.<br /><br />From the get-go, the story is interesting, Anastasia is off to interview the elusive, powerful mega-rich and powerful Christian Grey. The interview is unexpected and from the start Anastasia and Christian have a spark. As Anastasia goes on to finish college and get ready to move to Seattle, Christian pursues her and at the same time warns her off. He is a contradictory, curious, and powerful character. Their relationship progresses really fast, their connection is deep from the beginning and they both have to learn how to accommodate the other person. It's not an easy task because of Christians background and his proclivities. They have a long road ahead of them.<br /><br />My main hang-up with 50 Shades is the unlikelyhood of Anastasia being so innocent. 50 Shades of Grey portrays Anastasia as a VERY innocent 21 year old woman, finishing college. She is so innocent, that she claims to never have been good and kissed, or curious enough to try anything sexually related. I'm sorry, but I don't buy that. A beautiful girl doesn't get through college, especially a non-private college, without even a kiss. I rolled my eyes and this issue I have bugs me. Now, not everyone will agree with this thought, but I just don't buy it, and that's my opinion.<br /><br />I believe the appeal to 50 Shades of Grey is the contradictions of Christian, he has continually changing mood swings and ups and downs. You never know what he will do next or how he will react. He had a terrible childhood, and it affects his behaviors as an adult. He is a dominant male, and that translates to the bedroom. This is where people start calling the book a BDSM book. However, I would not classify the book as such. While there are some bondage/submissive sex, that is not the biggest point of the book. That is an issue that the couple have to work out. In essence, the BDSM type sex makes it hotter to read, but it is not a true dominant/submissive relationship.<br /><br />50 Shades of Grey is a powerful book about a deep, complex relationship. It ends on kind of a cliffhanger that had me reeling and dying to pick up book 2. After 1 book, I am attached to the characters and I have to see how their story plays out, I am hooked. However, since I did not fully believe everything in the book, I rate it *almost* 5 stars.ult. He is a dominant male, and that translates to the bedroom.

0307387178|5.0|This is a story about McCandless, true, but it is also about all those dreamers all over the world that share(d) his thoughts if not determination. It is also about us - because through all that reflection about McCandless and his short-lived dream, it is simply unavoidable to have some thoughts about ourselves, about our priorities and our dreams.<br />It doesn't really matter what we think of McCandless - was he really an awesome man you would like to have known personally, or some self-absorbed, overconfident boy whose limitless stubborness costed him at last dearly - because, as Krakauer says from his own experience, he is just one of those boys who tried to literally pursue their dreams, but just didn't have enough luck to outlive them. What really matters is -- I believe -- what are we going to learn from McCandless's (and Krakauer's) life and experience.

B007HJ84ZK|1.0|The show is great- some of the best TV I have ever seen- but I have had nothing but trouble with streaming the video.  It works on one laptop, but not the other- why not?  It is a mystery.  I spent a long time chatting with a super helpful Amazon employee, but we still couldn't figure out what was wrong.  and if my internet is down- too bad, no video.  Buy the dvds instead.
B007SGM084|4.0|Buy the books individually.  Think about it.  It's actually two cents cheaper to get them one at a time and then you can loan them out to your friends one at a time instead of making your friends try to read all three in two weeks.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about the books.  The author deserves five stars.  You'll start reading book one for the salacious sex.  The next two you'll read because you care about the characters.  Dig in and have fun.

B007SGM084|3.0|The series should be banned because the female character is too stupid to live, and she has no sense of honor.  I won't go into the male character because he was abused as a child and trying to function as an adult.  Ana didn't have that excuse.  She never seemed to eat - how could a young, active adult exist on no food?  She had less knowledge about her body than a 14 year old.  The silly mind characters didn't seem to fit with the serious subject matter.  She was unable to keep track of appointments or her own body.  Ana would not have lasted a whole week in the real business world.  By the third book, Ana surpassed her previous stupidity over and over.  Ana did not have the concept of keeping her word, and that was the worst part of the book.  She would either forget the promise within the first hour, or \\"change her mind\\".  How convenient to just change your mind every time you promised to do something that you had no intention of doing.  Ana had a passive aggressive personality, and was not a person to trust - sad to think Christian had to be attracted to that.  He mentioned Ana giving mixed signals - that was an understatement.  There were passages of \\"You can't buy me this car - buy me a bigger car\\".  \\"Don't touch me like that - why aren't you touching me like that?\\".  \\"You can't give me this money - here let me give it away.\\"  I try to keep up with books that are in the news, so I downloaded all three books.  The book was an odd combination of romantic fluff, erotica with a sick twist, and stupid woman.  I can handle the romantic fluff and erotica, but the stupid woman part is never enjoyable.  Ana came across less than an innocent and more like a fool.

055380684X|4.0|Daniel Coyle is a good writer.  He's able to present information in a lively and vivid manner, and he brings in a lot of interesting examples to back up his argument.  But I'm not sure about the way he frames his argument.  He argues that for a culture of talent can be created, and the essential ingredients are:  deep practice, ignition, and master coaching.  He argues that \\"deep practice\\" isn't just deliberate practice, but I think that's only because he doesn't understand what deliberate practice really means.<br /><br />And I'm not at all convinced about the ignition part.  He says that we're motivated to do things for a variety of reasons, and that's an obvious point.  The problem is that it's hard to figure out what truly motivates certain people -- we're better off by focusing on diversity, and on providing as many educational opportunities to as many people as possible.

B000UX6THK|5.0|This TWIN PEAKS box set has nearly everything you could ask for.  The complete series (yes, including the Log-Lady introductions) is complemented by a great feature-length making-of documentary, deleted scenes, post cards, and yes, the recipe for the fabled cherry pie from the Double-R Diner.  As a fan of the series, it's hard to be disappointed with all the extras this collection has.<br /><br />TWIN PEAKS focuses on a small town's reaction to the grisly murder of the high-school's homecoming queen.  The chain of events that this sets into motion are strange, humorous, horrifying, and dreamy.  Fans of the X-FILES, THE KILLING, and LOST will find that this show's influences are wide and far reaching.  I'm not quite sure this show is for everyone though; there are times when the story grinds to a halt, melodramatic and self-aware romances feel like soap operas, and things just don't make logical sense.  These elements will probably annoy people, but for others, it's what gives TWIN PEAKS its quirky unique charm.  This Gold Box Edition is recommended for both newbies to the TWIN PEAKS world and to veterans of the show who weathered through the season 1 and 2 DVDs.  The updates here are definitely worth the price of admission to justify repurchasing this content.<br /><br />My chief complaint with this set is that although the picture quality has been improved over the original Season 1 and Season 2 DVDs, it's still not quite great.  As of this review, Netflix Instant has this series available to stream in its entirety.  The quality in this streaming option is noticeably improved over what is contained here.  I'm hopeful that a Blu-ray edition of this will come along to give it the restoration it deserves, but being that this Gold Box Edition is \\"definitive,\\" we might not get a chance to see that.
B007Q2N0HA|3.0|What I liked:<br /><br />GOOD WRITING: I've read Sylvia Day in the past, and her writing flows. There are no annoying typos, actually I found one, but the novel is not typo-ridden, which seems to be a common thing with Kindle books. There was some repetition but the author's vocabulary is wide enough that you don't feel like you're reading the same thing over and over again.<br /><br />FAST-PACED PLOT: The story moved along nicely. Something was always happening to move the story forward, but wasn't always sure which direction the story was heading in.<br /><br />SETTING: Lots of modern references and brands mentioned, but not overdone. There's no doubt that we are in the high-flying world of upper class New York.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />CHARACTERS: Everyone in this book is too perfect, at least on the outside. Can't remember how many times Gideon was referred to as the hottest, sexiest, fittest, most eligible, gorgeous [insert Adonis quality here] man in the city. And the heroine was physically attractive too, as was her roommate, and her gym instructor, her mother, the receptionist etc etc. It was a pity that everyone was model material and there were no ugly Smeagols anywhere, not even as interesting side characters.<br /><br />SEX SCENES: It's hot, until it's not. There have got to be at least 20 sex scenes in the novel, double the number of orgasms, triple the number of references to Gideon's constant erections (was he on Viagra?) and an untold number of times that the characters moan each other's names. It gets a bit old. I began skipping the sex scenes, which became banal and to be honest, a bit of a turn OFF. Sometimes less really is more.<br /><br />EMOTION: Or lack thereof. Gideon isn't subtle at all. He's like a two-year old who wants something and won't stop pouting until he gets it. He has a lot of pretty words and flashy gestures of love, but as he himself put it, romance isn't in his repertoire. If you're looking for a love story, Bared toYou is not that. You won't find characters that come to the realisation of their feelings for each other through some intense emotional conflict. What you will find are two horny good-looking people intent on banging each other senseless who somehow, from the get go, have an urgent, desperate and unhealthy need for each other. How? Why? I'm still not sure.<br /><br />OBSESSIVE POSSESSIVE STALKERISH BEHAVIOUR: As another reviewer mentioned, the cringe factor is pretty high in this book. If someone did what these characters do in real life, they would probably have restraining orders against them. For example, *** SPOILERS AHEAD - STOP READING HERE IF YOU HAVEN\\"T READ THE BOOK AND INTEND TO *** After Eva runs off from him the umpteenth time, he leaves Eva 21 messages in the space of about 30 minutes. 21. That's a lot of calls. Before that, he seems to have amassed all the information he can about her, from who she's living with (and his sexual orientation) through to whether or not her gym instructor is married. But Eva's no better because she signs up for Google alerts on his name. Like really? People do that? Later, Eva sends Gideon three, count them, THREE separate lots of flowers with messages in one day and then hand delivers him a gift. I mean, really? You don't think that's a tad bit much for just ONE day? I guess it isn't when your lover takes a photo of you sleeping in your own bedroom, then has your WHOLE bedroom recreated in his own home...to the detail. And that's just so when you need space, you can run off your to 'own' room without leaving his house. Eww. Eva's mother traces her cellphone, Gideon traces Eva's credit card - I mean, billionaires stalking people when they could be out yachting, travelling to exotic places, flying to the moon or whatever it is billionaires do?<br /><br />Then there's the jealousy. Gideon is suspicious of any unfamiliar male that he hasn't got a file on and Eva is suspicious of every female in Gideon's life, even his mother(!!). Both characters are so insecure, their actions become laughable. [\\"Hello,\\" he purred, his icy gaze on Martin. \\"Introduce us.\\"] Sexy and possessive? Or just plain rude?<br /><br />At the end of the day, I liked this book, but I didn't. Sylvia Day has made a good business decision to capitalise on 50 shades (which I haven't read because I didn't care for the kindle sample I received) and I still like her writing skills. She creates vivid scenes and has great command of language. But I'm not crazy about some aspects of 'Bared' so I probably won't read the rest of the series. I don't give a toss about Gideon's inner demons, and Eva seems to have it together (she's a likeable heroine). There were so many declarations of LOVE(from Eva) and NEED(from Gideon) that its already clear from this first instalment that the two will be sticking with each other through thick and thin while copulating fast and furiously. Glad I read part one, but not holding my breath for part II.
B004L3AQFG|4.0|The story of Danny Boyle's 127 HOURS is no secret -- it's a true account of a lone hiker who finds himself trapped for days.  This movie has a simple premise, and its not a pleasant one.  Luckily for the audience, the execution here is top notch.  The claustrophobic setting here is conveyed well without ever feeling clunky or confusing.  Danny Boyle, who is known for his highly kinetic shooting and editing, paces this film extraordinarily well.  It's never boring, sluggish, or jarring.  The audience may be trapped with James Franco (who gives the best performance of his career) in this ravine, but the audience is never abused or mistreated.  Additionally, Franco never feels like he is being championed as a hero.  The film gives his character a pretty objective and critical eye; he made mistakes that could have (and should have) been prevented.<br /><br />127 HOURS speaks well of the human condition.  We may look at these circumstances and claim that we could never go to the lengths that Franco goes through to free himself.  The truth is, we would.  The truth is, we need people.  We need to be connected.  The beginning and ending of this film work together extraordinarily well.  In the beginning, society looks crowded, loud, and obtrusive.  By the end, we long for that crowded, loud, and obtrusive society that we thought we wanted to flee from.<br /><br />I'd recommend watching this; it's not easy, but it's rewarding.  Unfortunately, repeat viewings are not sufficiently rewarded, and there isn't much to gain from the Blu-ray version of this either.  For these reasons, I'd suggesting renting this one off Amazon instead of buying it.

B003EYVXUU|5.0|Many people loved the Swedish LET THE RIGHT ONE IN when it founds its ways to the United States.  Like any successful foreign film, Hollywood had to create an American one to capitalize on this success.  Luckily, the American remake, LET ME IN, is just as good as its predecessor and in some regards better.  Matt Reeves (of CLOVERFIELD) does a fantastic job of understanding what made the original great and putting his own stamp on it.  The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery is rich with detail, and the pacing (while some may find it a bit slow) felt spot on.  The child actors (Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee) are terrific.<br /><br />LET ME IN is not really all that scary, but it is both interesting and thrilling.  I'd recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a slow burning, spooky thriller.  Fans of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATOO, or THE ROAD, will find plenty to enjoy here.  The Blu-ray version of this film is beautiful, and there's just enough bonus content to make it a better deal than the DVD release.

B006FE83UE|5.0|The 50th Anniversary Edition of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a fantastic 2-disc set that gives this American classic the treatment it deserves.  The film itself is crystal clear, the sound (and score) are magnificent, and the bonus features included in this package alone are worth the price of admission.  The making-of documentary, Fearful Symmetry, is particularly well done.<br /><br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD chronicles a small town rocked by a racially-charged court case as seen through the eyes of an innocent young girl.  This movie is superbly written and acted, there doesn't appear to be a wasted frame in the entire running time.  The story here (much like its source material) is heartwarming, heartbreaking, tear-jerking, and laugh-out-loud funny.  This movie has received a lot of attention and hype over its year, and it is all well-earned.  I'm glad to say that this film has stood the test of time.<br /><br />If you have not seen TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD before, this is definitely worth a purchase.  If you have seen this movie before, but outside of this 50th Anniversary Edition, it's still worth a buy for the fantastic quality and bonus features.

A stylus would be an awesome tool. Have 2 in the other room but not yet ready to get out of bed lol. Bet it would be lot more fun on my way larger Transformer screen. I played a few grids. Dont see anything wrong with the ap. Seems awesome, brain exercising challenging, and fun. Not something I would have paid for, specially since it was $5! Great faotd!

0345803485|3.0|This first book was the best out of the three. The story really sweeps you up, despite the simple writing. The next books are a little poisonous for the mind.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I have only gotten a mere four percent into this book on my kindle and I have to say I'm quite irritated already. There are far too many Mrs./Mr. Gray's and mine,yes yours. What used to be scandalous and sexy is now just a tired beaten dead horse. I'm sad that I paid for this book. I really enjoyed the first two but its like the author took everything that makes honeymooners irritating and turned it up to eleven. I'm having a really difficult time getting into this book. Ive always felt like if I have to skip parts of a book, then somebody messed up, be it the author the editor or the publisher. Someone should have said \\"uh, hey guys, that part in the middle there, its really terrible. Someone should take a look at that.\\" Please be aware that I haven't actually managed to make it all the way through this book yet despite having downloaded it about a month and a half ago so my review is somewhat incomplete.

B007N3A2F0|3.0|Like any Sonata Arctica fan, I was simply ecstatic when I got an e-mail about the impending release of Stones Grow Her Name. I loved Unia and The Days of Grays to the point where I almost got sick of them but thankfully stopped a little short of reaching such a point. However, in my bliss had almost forgotten an important lesson, a lesson that Unia taught me years earlier.<br /><br />See, when Unia was released I was eager as any fan. I couldn't wait to hear some new Sonata Arctica tunes. But, like some others, I wasn't really looking to hear a *new* Sonata Arctica. So as hasty as it sounds I quickly wrote the album off and went along my way. A year or so later - for reasons I'm not so sure of - I decided to give it another listen and was, quite literally, hit upside the head by what I had been missing. I'm not exactly sure what changed in that year but after that point an odd thing started to happen - a really odd thing. Unlike most people who have no problem getting into an album the first time they hear it my ability to do that ceased to exist. The first thing I hear when listening to a new album now is a mindless mass of instrumentation. It's only after listening to it a couple dozen times that everything comes together and actually works.<br /><br />So what does this have to do with Sonata Arctica? Well everything because when The Days of Grays came around I was wiser and a lot more patient. I pretty much expected the album to sound like a mess and I was right. Only after I really listened to it did everything make sense and finally click. Well, long story short the Stones Grow Her Name falls into the exact same category and well, it seems that Kakko's going to make me work for it. Maybe the feeling will disappear with time but this album is an odd creature to say the least. Odd as it may be, I'm not sure if I can detect the prize underneath the facade but there are some moments that are immediately accessible. The opening number will make one feel more than welcome and \\"I Have a Right\\" works (and is a lot less corny) than the lyrics would have you believe.<br /><br />However, there are a few things that crop up that are a bit troubling. The first, which may sound a little silly, is the over-dependence of song titles in the songs themselves. This really stands out because in previous albums Kakko really shied away from this and would only quote the title once or twice throughout the entire song. Using the title over and over in certain songs (\\"Losing My Insanity\\") takes away from the complexity of the lyrics which Kakko is a known master at. In all seriousness, \\"The Dead Skin\\" on The Days of Grays proves that alone. The other problem is what Kakko turns the Wildfire series into - pro earth propaganda. I'll be the first to admit I'm not really a \\"save the earth\\" kind of guy but I had enough patience for and even liked \\"Respect the Wilderness\\" and \\"Wrecking the Sphere\\" (and I even liked how they tastefully dabbled in politics and war with \\"Zeros\\") but this is really pushing it. Did the original Wildfire on Reckoning Night have anything to do with the environment? I thought it was more about a man scorned.<br /><br />So anyway take the three stars with a gain of salt - in a week this could be my favorite album. Still, I have a feeling that there is something unseen that will prohibit from reaching the heights Unia and the Days of Grays have obtained in my personally hierarchy. That aside, perhaps the greatest thing I can say about Stones Grow her name is it is another in a long list of albums that challenges the listener and you can't put a price on that.

B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I love to see a chick kick ass!! Gina Carano was awesome!!  She was scene stealing, ass kicking, and looking hot while doing it all.  I dont like the way the movie jumped around in time, but all in all a pretty decent action movie.
0718157834|5.0|This was much more than your typical romantic comedy. Luckily the main charecter doesn't work in London and goes man hunting every weekend with his friends as always: It is a believeable story with normal people so it's very easy to feel identified with most of the characters. It treats very serious and current issues in a very diplomatic, realistic and responsible way.<br />I was unable top put it down once I started, it only took me 2 days to read and I may even suggest that this book is not neccesarly for women only! I've adviced my boyfriend to give it a go and based on the ethic story he's up for it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book in the Hunger Games Trilogy was very good. It had a lot of suspense. There where moments in the plot that I did not know where it was headed. But the best book to me of the Trilogy was the third book. Constant suspense. Not at all predictable.
0345529057|4.0|Ever since I became interested in the series from watching the series on HBO, Martin delivers. The book is very well written and captures my imagination completely. While there is nothing special about the bundle of books, it does come at a great price and as always amazon delivered quickly and I was reading in no time.
0345803485|5.0|After all the hype about this book, I had to read it! I was instantly addicted and I couldn't put the book down. I fell in love with the obvious chemistry between Christian and Ana..and when I reached the end of the book, it left me wanting to know what was going to happen next. So, I bought Darker..:-)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The book is very well written. But the story is just awful! I hated it. Over and over, I found myself thinking how unbelievable it all was. The pace felt more like a screenplay than a work of literature. The sex scenes are fabulous but after so much of it, one wonders what the story was actually about. In the end, I thought it was extremely contrived, tedious and shallow.
B007L96VCY|5.0|I have been listening to this album since it came out, and thought that I knew it. But after sitting down and listening to this remastered version, I now know that I was only hearing the half of it. This remastered version is crisp, clean and truly revelatory. I am hearing instruments and licks I had never heard before, and that is incredible, because as a kid I would sit on my bed and listen to this album for hours.<br /><br />On Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey, there is a vibraphone that I had never noticed before. Beautiful. Also, the thunder cracking and rolling from left to right is so lifelike you'd swear it was raining outside.  Dear Boy really comes alive, and the clarity adds to the sadness of an opportunity lost. Finally, The Back Seat of My Car, with its lush orchestration, is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Paul vocals are so emotional that this song comes across as autobiography.<br /><br />Well done to the remastering team, and I will definitely purchase all the others releases in this reissue campaign.

B0081X40HW|5.0|Haley is a smart, talented girl blessed with a unique voice. We're blessed because she also has the desire to create \\"good\\" music.<br /><br />Her parents have been working musicians for more than three decades so she grew up in a home where a variety of music was played, discussed and explored. During her run on Idol, this was evident in that she more than capably performed music from a variety of genres and time periods (from Adele to Zep).<br /><br />Until she did a stunning duet on the show, no one knew her true love was Jazz. It's easy to understand its allure to her. Jazz is dynamic musically and values improvisation, which makes it the best genre for someone with an instrument as versatile as Haley's (she did an impromptu performance at Irvin Mayfield's Jazz club in New Orleans and he was so impressed he invited her to perform with him at Carnegie Hall this October).<br /><br />\\"Listen up!\\" is not a Jazz album but it incorporates Jazz elements. There's a dynamic element to most of the songs as she vocally plays with different words and lines. Those lines include some wonderful lyrics that Haley had a hand in writing.<br /><br />When Haley was first signed, she stated in an interview she would likely have to \\"fight her way in\\" and make it clear the type of album she wanted to make and that she wanted to be hands on in its creation. Turns out they were more than willing to work with her and the album turned out great as a result.<br /><br />In the words of the New York Times... \\"these songs hark back to the 1960s and '70s, when Motown girl groups were ceding ground to soul-driven rock. It's singers' territory that shows off both the smooth power of Ms. Reinhart's voice and its engine-revving churn...In contemporary pop terms, this is territory staked out by the likes of Bruno Mars, and the long shadow of Amy Winehouse hangs over the more wrenching soul numbers...On \\"Hit the Ground Runnin',\\" Ms. Reinhart easily channels the Supremes, blending melody and sass...It's unfashionable and a bit out of touch, and what a smart thing that turns out to be.\\"
B00846WWVM|5.0|I've seen &#34;Sprinkle&#34; compared to &#34;Angry Birds,&#34; but it reminded me more of &#34;Where's My Water,&#34; since it requires directing a quantity of water to certain locations, although beyond that, there's not much in common. With Sprinkle, you're using an adjustable, aim-able water cannon to put out fires before they burn down the villagers' houses.<br /><br />Sprinkle is a fast-paced game, and you have to be quick. On each level, the action begins immediately. For me, it's a two-handed game, with my right thumb pushing the water button, and my left thumb controlling the height and direction of the water cannon. For some levels, you can hose down the fires directly, but on most levels, you'll have to use different strategies; for example, spraying a rock to roll it into position to act as a dam.<br /><br />The game is very challenging, and it's going to take me many hours to beat every level. At least if you're stuck on a level, you can move on to the next level and come back later. Your score depends on how much water you have to use to put out all the fires. That makes the replay value of Sprinkle very high, since you always have the challenge of improving your score.<br /><br />My only (slightly) negative comment is about the way you aim the water cannon. You'll have to experiment a bit to coordinate moving the water cannon up and down and to aim it. It's tricky until you get the hang of it.<br /><br />I'm playing Sprinkle on a Kindle Fire. The cartoon-like graphics are excellent, and the game plays smoothly with no hesitations. It's a good game for anyone who wants a real challenge.
1455518999|4.0|SETUP:  Army CID John Puller is assigned to look into the death of an army officer in a West Virginia coal mining town.  He is assisted by local police sargeant Samantha Cole.  Of course, a romatic relationship develops.<br /><br />EVALUATION:  \\"Zero Day\\" is a well told fast-paced story, containing engaging characters.  It is similar to earlier Baldacci novels (such as the early Maxwell & King and early Camel Club).  The build up to the \\"mystery\\" was terrific.  The \\"discovery\\" was disappointing---Puller was just informed, and even that seem a bit far-fetched.  After that point the plot rambled rather aimlessly.  The climax was bogus---real bombs do not have clock displays nor tricky booby traps, and no-one is going to roll 55-gallon drums of uranium (which would weigh maybe 10 tons each) into a mine shaft.  Besides there is absolutely no reason for a shaft to exist within the building.  Nothing after Samantha's death really added anything to the story.  Readers and reviewers would have howled if the story had been cut off there, but doing so might have been the better choice. The ending, more of an \\"afterward\\" was very disappointing---maybe I just lost interest.  The unnecessarily complex, poorly told, backstory of how the bad guys are and their motivations is garbled, farfetched, and presented without an inadequate foundation.  If after reading the last page, you scratched your head and said \\"Huh?\\"---it's Baldacci's fault, not yours. Even so, I was hooked before the plot begins to deteriorate, and willing to grant Baldacci as much \\"suspension of disbelief\\" as he needed.  Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable read. Not a terrific read, but a good one.<br /><br />INACCURACIES:  As a published natural resources historian, with relatives who live in one of those West Virginia coal towns, whom I visit every year, I was dismayed by Baldacci's inaccuracies.<br /><br />Mining:  This is the second novel Baldacci has partly set in a mine, and he still doesn't know the meaning of the word \\"shaft\\".  Not to meantion that there are relatively few shafts in West Virginia---most underground coal mines are entered by \\"drifts\\".  There are problems associated with coal mining.  The environmental problems are pretty much the same as would be associated with any large scale construction, such as building a highway, suburb or an airport.  (And indeed there are far more acres of land \\"disturbed\\" by airport construction in the US than disturbed by mining).  Yes, water tables are often disrupted (by highway building, construction, or mining) and natural gas can sometimes leak into aquifers.  So?  Build a water treatment plant and install water lines---that's what's done elsewhere.  The sewage from outhouses or septic tanks does more real damage to the water supply than mining.  The health risks are mostly limited to underground miners, but are substantial.  But as Baldacci points out, most mining is now from much safer open cut methods, which is no more dangerous than highway or building construction.  I know of no increases in cancer in WV coal mining areas.  Little coal dust gets into the air (even in surface mines, the dirt is sprayed with water to keep dust down).  Acid rain used to happen where you burn coal, NOT where you mine it.  With current technology very little sulfur gets into the air even from coal-fired electrical power plants.<br /><br />Social Problems:  There ARE social problems in WV coal mining towns, but not those portrayed by Baldacci.  The main problems are slougth and ignorance.  The main cause is actually the \\"free money\\"---the relatively enormous salaries paid to coal miners for relatively unskilled labor.  Why bother going to High-School when you can earn $50,000 a year as an apprentice in a coal mine?  Okay, the work (underground mining) is backbreaking and dangerous---try telling that to a 16 year-old-kid with a pregnant girlfriend.  Taxes and insurance are virtually non-existant compared to urban America.  Housing is ridiculously inexpensive.  The only utilities most rural West Virginians pay for are electricity and cable TV.  $50,000 in rural WV is the equivalent of $100,000 per year in an average size American city, $200,000 in SF, LA, or NYC. With minimal skill (e.g., an electrician's license) the salary for underground work is upward of $100,000.  Or, you can work one year and then permanently \\"retire\\" with a \\"bad back\\" on various government benefits and programs which add up to more than $50,000/yr.  Although undermotivated, most small town West Virginians are true salt-of-the-earth people---good solid Americans who try to live decent lives.  These are NOT the despirately poor with no options.<br /><br />Finally, while I have no doubt that the US Government is capable of simply abandoning and forgetting hazzardous facilities, even the United States Government is not stupid enough to build a nuclear enrichment reactor in a coal mining area in West Virginia.  Probably not.  Maybe not.  Well, maybe.<br /><br />COMPARISON TO LEE CHILDS:  Every voracious reader and writer (I am both) knows that there is alot of cross-over between authors, which is less than plagerism.  Very often an author doesn't know where he gets his ideas from.  I haven't read the Jack Reacher novels, but now I plan to.  Caveat, I found Child's \\"Deep Storm\\" and \\"Terminal Freeze\\" to be maybe B-; good action, but with serious flaws.<br /><br />COMPARISON TO \\"THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER\\":  I was actually immediately reminded of Nelson Demille's \\"The General's Daughter\\".  The main characters (Paul Brenner and Cynthia Sunhill) are very similar (even their names are similar) to John Puller and Symantha Cole.  Both Breener and Puller are CID Warrant Officers.  Albeit, I must admit that \\"The General's Daughter\\" was MUCH better---gripping to the very last page.  I guess that dates me as a geezer---since no other reviews mention the similarity of characters.sly inexpensive.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I grew up reading Grimm's, Anderson's and all those classic fairy tales.  When I heard they were making a TV series based on them, I thought it was a terrible idea.  Snow White?  Really?  This show proved me wrong.  \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is clever, creative and fun.  The writers have managed to update the classic stories, with lots of unexpected twists and surprises  -- and original backstories for classic storybook characters.  My favorite is the re-telling of the Hansel & Gretel story.  The cast is fabulous; the sets, costumes, and effects are excellent; and the writing is top-notch.  I'm looking forward to watching it all again when the DVD comes out.
B006MVJ2L4|3.0|I am a HUGE Adam fan....think his talent is beyond phenomenal, yet this techno music does it absolutely no justice whatsoever.  I will of course listen to it because I just love voice...I sure hope he realizes he can go so much farther with a \\"real band, with real instruments\\" accenting his voice instead of drowning it out!!
B007MJKOY4|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie.  It was not as good as I thought it could be.  It was EXTREMELY slow in parts and I had a bit of an issue keeping track of certain characters.  Of course I expected it to be a little confounding, but not blatantly opaque.

B007L96VCY|4.0|RAM was originally released in May 1971, and it really needs to be put into context to understand the critical reaction. The Beatles had broken up a little over a year prior, and since Paul broke the news to the world, most people considered the breakup his fault. On top of that, his first solo album, MCCARTNEY, was a pleasant listen but was a very homemade affair. He recorded it all by himself, with a little help from Linda on some backing vocals, and most of the songs are nice acoustic ditties which sound as if they're not quite finished. Coming off of the Beatles' polished masterpiece ABBEY ROAD, it was more than a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />So Paul decided to do his next record up right. He auditioned a number of respected session players before selecting the talented Denny Seiwell on drums and David Spinozza on guitar. They recorded over several months in New York and L.A., with the New York Philharmonic providing orchestration on several tracks. Spinozza played on several songs, but was then fired since he didn't want to be at McCartney's beck and call, and Hugh McCracken replaced him. (Spinozza went on to play guitar for Yoko Ono after she threw John out, and McCracken ended up playing on DOUBLE FANTASY.)<br /><br />\\"Another Day\\", backed with \\"Oh Woman Oh Why\\", was the advance single, which didn't end up on the album. At the time, it was slammed for being a lightweight version of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", with its story about a secretary and her drab and lonely life. I didn't hear the song until years later, when I bought WINGS GREATEST, and I mistook it for a Wings song for years. Either way, it's a beautiful ballad with lovely harmonies and some truly gorgeous slide guitar from Spinozza. I think the song was meant to convey a feeling, which the beginning of the chorus sums up quite well:<br /><br />So sad, so sad.<br />Sometimes she feels so sad.<br /><br />\\"Oh Woman Oh Why\\" is completely different and even better, a ripping rocker in which Paul unleashes his best screaming vocals. It's hard to understand many of the vocals, but that's what Google is for. I found them rather intriguing and strangely kinky. So no idea what Paul was thinking, but it's a keeper of a song.<br /><br />RAM itself has a sound unlike any record Paul's done since, and that sound is epic pop. Sonically, the record has a lot of depth, with echo on some of the vocals and instruments, but with a clarity and preciseness that keeps it from being mushy. Paul has never sung better than on this record; he handles slow ballads and all-out rockers with equal ease. The arrangements are simply gorgeous, with Linda's harmonies, for the most part, meshing with Paul's own to create some luscious backing vocals. It's obvious to me that Eric Carmen and his band, the Raspberries, took a great deal of inspiration from RAM.<br /><br />Still, the critics hated RAM just as much, if not more, than MCCARTNEY. Jon Landau, the Rolling Stone reviewer, called it \\"the nadir in the decomposition of Sixties rock thus far.\\" (Rolling Stone has more recently revised its opinion upward.) Robert Christgau was equally unkind, and British reviewers Roy Carr and Tony Tyler called it \\"stay-prest, ready-to-wear music, the kind to be listened to in the living room with ducks on the wall.\\" Sheesh. Why all the vitrol for a record with pop as gorgeous as this?<br /><br />A big part of the reason was that it *was* pop, rather than rock music. John Lennon had just come out with a Serious Rock Record (which is excellent), PLASTIC ONO BAND. George Harrison had wowed critics and fans with his Phil Spector-produced Serious Masterpiece, ALL THINGS MUST PASS. RAM, in comparison, seemed trivial. Lightweight. Unimportant. That factor of \\"Paul-broke-up-the-Beatles\\" also came into play, as did many of the lyrical references. More on that in a minute.<br /><br />For myself, I came to RAM in 1978 or '79, long after the critics had moved on. I knew their opinions, and I knew that I loved the single fromthe album, \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\". So I hoped for some music as great as the single, and for the most part, I got it. Those lyrics, though....<br /><br />Let's go through RAM song by song, so you get an idea of how it just misses perfection with those silly words.<br /><br />\\"Too Many People\\"--A nice, midpaced rocker with gruff vocals from Paul and Linda's harmonies at key points. It slows down in the chorus to give the song a pensive feel, and the riffs from McCracken are fantastic. There's that echo on the voice and guitar. Nice drumming, too. But when Paul goes on about \\"too many people preaching practices\\" and \\"That was your first mistake...You took your lucky break and broke it in two/Now what can be done for you?/You broke it in two.\\", the impression that he's singing about John Lennon cannot be escaped, even now. (Paul admitted later that yes, he was.) That starts things off on an uncomfortable note. It just gets worse.<br /><br />\\"3 Legs\\"--Great bluesy acoustic guitar picking and nice vocals, although Linda sounds rather nasal. But here we are with \\"My dog he got three legs/but he can't run...When I thought you was my friend/But you let me down, put my heart around the bend.\\" 3 Legs. Three ex-Beatles. Get it? Maybe just coincidence, but that same mean-spiritedness even if so. (Spinozza takes lead here and on \\"Eat At Home\\"; otherwise, the rest of the album is McCracken.)<br /><br />\\"Ram On\\"--A fragment of a ditty on ukelele, with sweet singing from Paul. No lyrical allusions here (except that \\"Ram On\\" is Paul's code for \\"Ramone\\" which was his pseudonym back when the Beatles were starting out [and the Ramones got their name from that]), and some gorgeous backing oohs. Whistling and random piano chords and studio talk. Very cute, although yeah, lightweight.<br /><br />\\"Dear Boy\\"--Lovely, tuneful pop song, with those gorgeous oohs and ahs from Linda (Paul helped her a lot). But here we are again. \\"Hope you never know, dear boy, how much you missed\\"? John thought that was about him. In actual fact, it was about Linda's ex-husband, which makes more sense, but I can see how John thought it was aimed in his direction. Again, lots of little digs at people. I think Paul was feeling defensive around then.<br /><br />\\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\"--I thought this was the Beatles when I first heard it. I could have sworn it was. It's like son of \\"Penny Lane\\" or \\"Hello Goodbye\\". Absolutely lovely production, with McCracken's riffs sounding just like George Harrison. Changes musical direction four or five times. Excellent. Still, \\"We're so sorry if we caused you any pain?\\" Maybe aimed at the other three. Maybe. I personally always wondered if Paul was inspired by the Uncle Albert in MARY POPPINS, who came down from the ceiling when he cried. Who knows.<br /><br />\\"Smile Away\\"--What a neat rocker. Even with Linda's annoying \\"Don't know how to do that\\" nasally going on over and over, it still moves right along. More screaming from Paul. I gotta believe this is aimed at the other three, though, what with \\"I met a friend of mine and he did say/Man, I can smell your feet a mile away/Smile away!\\" All this lyrical attacking, whether it be Beatles or folks in general, really gets old.<br /><br />Now we're onto Side Two, back in the good old vinyl days. Here we start on the \\"home, family, love\\" songs.<br /><br />\\"Heart of the Country\\"--Super acoustic guitar picking, and a nice vocal. But anyone singing \\"I want a horse, I want a sheep\\" better be prepared to be laughed at. I didn't like the scat singing on the guitar breaks, either, but I appreciate it more now.<br /><br />\\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\"--The song that annoys me most. It's a super piano-based rocker, with absolutely tonsil-shredding singing from Paul, a la \\"Helter Skelter\\". Fantastic. But those words make absolutely *no sense at all*. \\"So I sat in the attic, a piano up my nose\\"? \\"Catch up, soup and puree, don't get left behind\\"? \\"When I leave my pajamas to Billy Budapest\\"? Thisisn't even good pseudo-Dylan. It's random phrases that don't add up to anything coherent. It's not even funny, just dumb. Apparently it's Paul's ode to getting high. Well, *duh*. Wish he'd tried harder and came up with a real classic. Oh, and I don't much care for Linda's vocals here. In the early days, she sang *everything* through her nose.<br /><br />\\"Eat At Home\\"--I had no clue what this song was really about until I heard it discussed on a Beatles podcast. Add it to the list of great McCartney double-entendre lyrics. At any rate, it's a wonderful Buddy Holly-style rocker, especially on the middle eight. The joys of home cooking.<br /><br />\\"Long Haired Lady\\"--An ode to the lovely Linda. Beautiful orchestration, and it really takes off when it gets to the \\"Ah, love is long, love is long\\" part of the song. Again, I don't like the nasalness of Linda's contribution: \\"Or is this the only thing you want me *for*...\\" (shudder) You've still got that lovely echoing guitar, though, with great riffs and super drumming. It fades into a reprise of \\"Ram On\\", which ends with a cute bit of the future song \\"Big Barn Bed\\", which showed up on the next album. Nice of Paul to give us a teaser.<br /><br />\\"Back Seat of My Car\\"--The Brian Wilson production number, complete with car-as-place-to-have-sex metaphor. It's great. This must have been the inspiration for the Raspberries' \\"Go All The Way\\". Strings and harmonies and horns and glory, and wonder of wonders, no mean-spiritedness or celebrations of domestic bliss. Just \\"We believe that we can't be wrong.\\" Ends the album on a high note.<br /><br />I still love RAM. I think it's a fantastic record, just as it is. But I can never listen to it without wanting on some level to slap Paul for all the lyrical digs and fatuousness. So while it's a favorite album, it's not one of his best. Well worth a listen, though.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget the cutesy-pie collage of photos of Paul & Linda on the inside and the photo of the beetle screwing another beetle on the back. Yeah, no secret reference there.<br /><br />The bonus tracks aren't bad, although they're mostly session jams and instrumentals. \\"Little Woman Love\\" is fantastic, with Henry McCullough overdubbing guitar; it was originally the B-side of \\"Mary Had A Little Lamb\\", which will probably show up on WILD LIFE. \\"A Love For You\\" is not a bad tune, and has a great tonsil-shredding vocal from Paul. \\"Hey Diddle\\" is a sweet little acoustic duet between Paul & Linda. Still don't like her voice, but to be fair, she improved greatly over the years as a backing vocalist.<br /><br />As far as the packaging: The glue on my copy has come loose from Disc 1's side, so it's having a hard time staying in. The bonus photos are sweet, and it's nice to have the lyrics at long last, as witness to Linda's backing vocal on \\"Smile Away\\". [I never knew that was what she was singing until I read the lyric sheet.] Wish that they'd identified the original musicians on each track, though.<br /><br />Final thought: When I first bought RAM, I considered it underrated, since most people didn't like it. Nowadays I consider it overrated.thought that was about him. In actual fact, it was about Linda's ex-husband, which makes more sense, but I can see how John thought it was aimed in his direction. Again, lots of little digs at people. I think Paul was feeling defensive around then.<br /><br />\\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\"--I thought this was the Beatles when I first heard it. I could have sworn it was. It's like son of \\"Penny Lane\\" or \\"Hello Goodbye\\". Absolutely lovely production, with McCracken's riffs sounding just like George Harrison. Changes musical direction four or five times. Excellent. Still, \\"We're so sorry if we caused you any pain?\\" Maybe aimed at the other three. Maybe. I personally always wondered if Paul was inspired by the Uncle Albert in MARY POPPINS, who came down from the ceiling when he cried. Who knows.<br /><br />\\"Smile Away\\"--What a neat rocker. Even with Linda's annoying \\"Don't know how to do that\\" nasally going on over and over, it still moves right along. More screaming from Paul. I gotta believe this is aimed at the other three, though, what with \\"I met a friend of mine and he did say/Man, I can smell your feet a mile away/Smile away!\\" All this lyrical attacking, whether it be Beatles or folks in general, really gets old.<br /><br />Now we're onto Side Two, back in the good old vinyl days. Here we start on the \\"home, family, love\\" songs.<br /><br />\\"Heart of the Country\\"--Super acoustic guitar picking, and a nice vocal. But anyone singing \\"I want a horse, I want a sheep\\" better be prepared to be laughed at. I didn't like the scat singing on the guitar breaks, either, but I appreciate it more now.<br /><br />\\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\"--The song that annoys me most.

B004J4WQ46|2.0|I found this album difficult to listen to. I love Julian Casablancas' voice, and I love old Strokes, but I found something missing in this album. There seemed to be a lack of harmony between the vocals and instrumentals, and just something of a missed connection. It seemed as if the vocals were drowned out by either post-production effects or conflict with the band's sound. I was unable to get into any of the songs, in part because the lack of clarity and the whole sound and also not drawing anything out of Julian's voice besides a steady whine.<br />I expect better things from the Strokes, but I won't be one to give up yet!
B005KA188S|5.0|I very much enjoyed Fright Night. A little campy and full of nasty blood and body parts. It was fun to watch and reminded me of Disturbia if it had vampires and gore. A good film to see once but probably won't buy it.
B005F6NA56|5.0|The first time I listened to this album, I was using my standard laptop speakers (which claim to be virtual-surround-sound but is essentially a speaker bar on my computer) and was pretty disappointed by the quality of the album. However, once I gave it a go in a proper left/right speaker configuration (ie, my car, out of my stereo receiver, desktop, headphones) I found how marvelous this album really was. If you find it a bit lacking at first, give it a chance on something that does justice to the complexity of the sound!<br /><br />Feist succeeds in projecting hard, meaningful emotions and drawing the listener in. I've been listening to this album in my car nonstop, and it'll be a permanent addition to my long-drive music. I can't help beating my palm on the side of the steering wheel when \\"The Bad in Each Other\\" starts.<br />A must-buy!
B004HO6I2O|3.0|A lot of the humor in this film is potty humor like ass, farts and poo. I can see why some jokes were offensive but I still laughed. Nothing really special here.
0345803485|1.0|If only i could award NO stars. This book is so bad it has prompted my first ever book review. The story line is so implausible (ok i get thats its romantic fiction but you should at least believe in the characters) The writing is appalling, it reads like a script where every action is described and nothing is left for the reader to interpret, has this lady ever heard of nuance. The language is repetitive and limited, as if the protagonist is a 12 year old girl in her bedroom writing a diary with a fluffy bendy pen, not a college graduate in Literature , oh the irony. I can not even begin to articulate my frustration with the 'inner goddess' thread running throughout, it is silly, ludicrous and made me want to throw the book across the room, unlike her 'sub conscious' which made me swear and actually throw the book across the room . E L james would benefit from a rudimentary introduction into psychology, it is not her sub conscious she is hearing its her 'conscience', The sub conscious or unconscious mind are not directly accessible to ordinary introspection, I am at a loss as to how either Anna and Christian manage to have a conversation since they 'murmur' or 'whisper' everything, I am not even going to grace the sexual or BDSM element of the book with a response other than to say it actually made me shudder and NOT want to have sex, the thought of being told what to eat, wear, say and do by a man for his pleasure not matter how 'hot' or 'troubled' he his ( and yes we are constantly and tediously reminded of this in almost every encounter they have in the first 200 pages, as if we have an attention deficient disorder or early onset alzheimers) does not arouse me.<br /><br />The fact that this book has become a publishing and cultural phenomenon saddens me, when I consider the wealth of talent and ability out there . EL james owes a huge debt( I would argue both monetarily and metaphorically) to Stephanie Meyers( another appalling writer) and her obsessive fans, IfEL james had not published this as fan fiction and monopolised on their desire to sexualise the Bella/Edward relationship and more disturbingly their personal lust for Robert Pattinson, this book would not have had the meteoric rise to fame it has had and DOES NOT DESERVE<br /><br />please please please I implore you not to listen to the hype and read a few pages of this book in the store before purchasing, you might like me quickly realise it is complete and utter rubbish and not worth spending your precious time  and money on.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I gave the four stars because I, personally, was put off by the graphic sadism. Maybe this is common in suspense novels - I'm a fan of nonfiction. But, despite my trepidation, I had to keep reading to find out the resolution. An AMAZING amount of plot lines, eventually resolved in one way or the other. Even a non-suspense novel junkie (such as myself) was trying to figure out the outcome. A great story - but please be aware, there are scenes that will inspire nightmares. I won't be reading the sequels.
B007MAETA8|4.0|The great (and at times, confusing for many) thing about John Mayer is that you can't simply pinpoint his genre. An acoustic love ballad pop artist? I invite you to listen to Heavier Things, a swinging, melodic mashup of contemporary rock and emotional prowess. Or perhaps Continuum (my personal favorite) a flowing complication of influences from his idols into a unique, contemporary and thought invoking blues paragon. His last album, Battle Studies, dove into a cheery blend of acousto-pop and rock. Now, we see this evolution continue in his newest studio release, Born And Raised. Highly influenced and intended to be of a country-esque vibe, perhaps, even portrayed as music written by nomadic cowboys under the stars. (The previous is based off statements made by John Mayer himself.) As far as lyrics go, this is honest, down-to-earth, perhaps even personal reflections. This is honestly as revealing as an artist can get without revealing the gritty details. A self-preservation of life through their eyes in a Hemingway type of Iceberg theory. Listen to the lyrics, and connect the dots, and see how it plays out. The lyrics, while sappy at times, can be very conjuring of thoughts: Take for example the song \\"Love is a Verb.\\" A personal showing on relationships and the need for action on both ends, and the anti-movement of simply flaunting a thing such as love as a mere material possession. In the historically based \\"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967,\\" we are narrated a story of Mr. Walt Grace and his aspirations to deep sea exploration despite the objection of those who doubt him. It lends to a sense of need of self belief and struggles with confidence and grooming oneself into what they desire. The same vibe can be induced through ballads of \\"Born and Raised\\" and \\"Born and Raised (Reprise.)\\" A sense of self struggle and perseverance in the song \\"Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey.\\" The lyrics, are at times, somewhat sappy, but never on the verge of full-out \\"cliche'\\" and forsure the most honest of Mr. Mayer's discography. His vocals maintain that unique raspy characteristic and are followed by background echoes from other singers for accentuation and many simultaneous melodic aspects throughout the entire album, signifying the very hometown feel. Musically, we see a John Mayer that is fairly familiar, utilizing many Acoustic finger techniques and arpeggios (noted with \\"If I Ever Get Around to Living\\") However, there are a multitude of songs that accompany John's signature Stratocaster sound (which receives raves constantly from the guitar playing community.) However, it is not the clean, warm, deep sounds of Continuum, which acted as a staple for the album. Instead, it is actually very layered, and at times drowned in reverb and other effects, but never truly sounds overproduced or artificial in such cases. The tone works, and the tone is good. Overall, this phase of John Mayer's musical career may have come rather unexpected, but in all honesty, a move of such drastic degree was predicted by many, but in what direction was subjective. This feel good country influenced sound is a breath of fresh air in any department, and it works, outstandingly well. The lyrics can at times fall and sound corny, but it's honest... and you know what? It sounds good... real good. A 4.5/5 if I could, and I honestly believe it was one of his best albums. (Personal ranking: 1) Continuum 2)Born and Raised 3) Heavier Things)
0439023521|5.0|I may be kind of young to read this book. My mom read this book first. I just finished it. I can't wait to see the movie!<br />*SPOILER ALERT* This book is about a sixteen year old girl named Katniss Everdeen whose is from District 12. She has a twelve year old sister named Primrose (goes by Prim) and her mother. Her father died in a mine accident. She and her friend Gale hunt for their food even though it is illegal. The Hunger Games Drawing is about to begin. The Hunger Games send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen. The day of the drawing: Effie draws out Prim's name. Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place. Peetah gets picked. No one volunteers to take his place.<br />During the Hunger Games, Katniss gets hurt by tracker jacker stings to cuts. Peetah also gets hurt badly by another tribute. He got cut badly on his upper knee. Katniss has to heal Peetah. A rule was changed, two tributes could win if they were from the same district. SPOILER ALERT! Peetah and Katniss won! :)<br />Overall I think this was a great book, even if it takes some kids (like me) a long time to finish it. It is worth the time reading it. It is very addicting!
0345803485|1.0|I don't write reviews. Ever. Please understand I don't mean to be judgemental either. This book is not only horribly written, but in my opinion is a horrendous example to young women. Nevermind the erotica junk. Whatever, I'm no prude. But a self centered, egotistical, dominating, psychopath, and a women who lets him beat her is NOT sexy. Ever. And she constantly apologizes to the beast for not being good enough for her! What? This book made me sick. If you are sensitive to these issues, do not read. I don't care how much money, or good looking someone is, it is never ok to beat someone for pleasure. Sick. Just a caution from one mom who will NEVER let her daughter near trash like this.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good game. has some great progression to it and nice graphics. addicting but not completely mine melting.  getting enough coins for things can be a bit annoying hence their encouragement to buy the coins, but who has the money for that?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this is lots of fun!! I go on everyday; and about every 5 days I win ten free acorns!! I currently have more than 50!! Lol... I admit I had trouble getting out at first; but all you have to do is click on the options/settings button and then the bottom bar will appear and all you do is click on it then the home button. I'd recommend this for fun and something to do!! XD
B000002OCP|4.0|Bought this and Howling Wolf's new album (the one where he doesn't like his new electric guitar) at the same time. They may not have been well received at the time they were made but more than 35 (or 40?) years down the track they are a must have for anybody interested in the blues and when you think of what is done and what is categorised as blues these days they are quite relevant.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is one of the best games out their. The game is fun, addicting and a must have app. I am suprised it's free because this game is almost worth around two dollars! It has 8 worlds and more are under construction and every world is so creative you will enjoy it. There are 5 birds in the game that each one has a special ability to complete the part easier. If you're new to the kindle fire or you don't have this game which is ironic then get it!!!
0345803485|1.0|I thought it was just me so I had to read some of this book's reviews.  Whew.  It's not just me.  I've gotten only 13% into this poor excuse for a 'bestseller' and I can take no more.  The so-called story line is so nauseatingly juvenile, I thought my head was going to explode!  Perhaps (just perhaps) if I were a 15-year-old girl, sitting on my bed with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday night, I 'might' find this childish story intriguing; however, I am a mature woman, sitting on my bed struggling to get through this rubbish.  It's making me gag.  Sorry I wasted my Kindle battery on this ridiculousness.  Time to purchase a worthwhile book.  I do not recommend spending money on this one.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A bunch of sex scenes loosely held together by an unconvincing narrative. Sounds like it was written by an English man, chock full of irritating inconsistencies....I think I found it more believable that a college girl has zero sexual experience than that she didn't own a computer.  But, I doubt anyone is reading this for the story.
B006WAIUEK|5.0|Classic Welsh and such a joy again to get inside the minds of my favourite literary characters. Up there with all the lieth sagas he has done. If you love Welsh, you must read this!
B005LAIGTG|3.0|Okay so most romantic movies tend to be sappy and predictable.  I expected as much with The Vow but the previews made it look funny and endearing.  I liked the previews far more than I enjoyed the movie.  Often at times I felt as though the lead man should just give up -- move on and find someone else.  I get the situation (and maybe in book form it would be better to read) but the movie was lacking something -- perhaps it's called, charm.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very original and intriguing story - sucks you in and doesn't let go - can't wait for the sequels and new stories by Hugh Howey
0143121006|5.0|I found this book engaging not only for the true and shocking murder mystery that it was, but also for the penetrating look into a disintegrating way of life of foreign consuls, officials, staff, military guards, business people, their families, and some others such as author, Edgar Snow, who are sequestered in a small area of Peiking called the Legation Quarter. Tea parties, ice skating, and society life still continue in the Legation Quarter at the time of this story. It is bordered by the Badlands, a place of crime and degradation, the mysterious Fox Tower, as well as all of Peiking, rapidly increasing in population with those who are escaping from life elsewhere. Outside the Legation Quarter many are white Russians whose identity papers are meaningless.  For them this is the end of the line, not only because of useless documents but also destitution. Starving Russian men wander about in tattered Tartar uniforms, soliders from an army that no longer exists. Many of the unfortunate women end up as drug-addicted prostitutes.  Chinese are fleeing the war-torn country side in the north for the tenuous safety of Peiking.<br /><br />Fox Tower is abandoned at night because of a belief that Fox spirits inhabited the tower and would come out at night, dig up graves,and balance skulls on their heads.  If the skulls stayed on their heads when the Fox spirits bowed to the Goddess of the North Star, then they would live for 10 centuries and seek out innocent mortals to steal their energy life force.  That is the one part of the story that to me seemed preposterous although it appears to have been a belief among the Chinese. Who would believe such a ridiculous thing in the twentieth century?  Ghosts, even energy sucking ghosts I can understand, but fox spirits literally digging up graves and putting skulls on their heads?<br /><br />The photo in the book of Fox Tower today shows it as a well-maintained building, likely a tourist feature, while the 1930s photos in the book reveal a structure that looks much more formidable, it's unglazed windows dark openings into an uninviting place.  The ditch next to it has shallow water and muddy banks upon which stands a gaggle of geese. It separated the tower and the well-appointed Legation Quarter where the young victim and her father lived.<br /><br />As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the author spends quite a bit of text describing the layout of the area, its streets, and buildings.  Although at first I thought it was overdone, but as I continued reading the descriptions seemed to lend themselves to the unraveling of the mystery of Pamela Werner's murder.<br /><br />I admire Pamela's father who so tenaciously struggled to discover what happened to her that night and identify her murderer.  His efforts were actually helped by the disintegrating order in Peiking and the subsequent Japanese take-over.  He was able to hire his own investigators and find out far more than the chief British investigator, DCI Dennis, could.  The author explains in detail how DCI Dennis was limited through no fault of his own and most likely why.<br /><br />This book is a page turner and highly recommended.
B007SSEU9O|1.0|I was appalled by this movie.  It did not accentuate Lady Thatcher's enormous accomplishments.  Rather it emphasized her battle with Alzheimer's disease, portraying her as a lost soul. Very little time was give to show her indomitable spirit and patriotism.  Shame on the producers for trying to make a conservative political figure so pathetic!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|page turning excitement!! every college student should read this book! not a literary giant but hugely entertaining to say the least.Quick read because you cant put it down!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|read this book.  waited for the movie.  the book is always better so do yourself a favor and read this book before going to the movie...or just skip the movie!  a very easy, quick read that won't take any time to finish.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|your better off playing where's my water this fun but not addictive for me I want addictive games but that's just my thought
B004U52VPS|2.0|really thought this would be a huge hit at my house.  the game is so cheaply made and the birds are so small.  not sure why i thought it would be any better as you get what you pay for.  as of today this game sits in my closet.  nobody is interested....at all.  play the online game and forget this purchase.  it's a waste.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|DVD works great before and after the huge scratch. Too bad there is still a scene i have yet to see in the movie...... Good thing I paid less than $5 :-)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game a lot. I just can't do some of the games they are just to difficult for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Some authors have a great sense of place - the ability to describe an environment in not only physical terms, but in terms of psychological and emotional influences as well. Others have a great sense of character - the ability to create a cast of characters with distinct voices, points of view, and thought processes. Unfortunately, it seems to me that most authors excel at one or the other, but rarely at both. Which is why it's such a great treat to run into an unfamiliar author who combines both skills as successfully as does Hugh Howey with Wool.<br /><br />As an avid SF fan, I can not understand how I've not heard of Wool before now. I can't wait... I WON'T wait... to explore his other works.
B002BWP49M|5.0|It was better than the first 3 movies combined, in my opinion. Both actors seemed to have finally gotten a comfortable handled on their characters and have become much better acting-wise. The movie hit on almost everything important in the [first half of the] book. No real complaints, would just like to see more and more!<br /><br />The only thing annoying about the dvd doesn't actually have to do with the movie. It takes a long time just to load in the dvd player, then you have to patiently hit the skip-forward button through two movie trailers just to get to the main menu because you can't simply hit the \\"disc menu\\" button right away. Annoying. I wish dvd's wouldn't force you to watch trailers if you don't want to--it'd be nice if they went straight to the menu or (God forbid) just played the movie automatically.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It certianly keeps you occupied. Its worth a play and is great for long waits in the Doctor's office. Its boy complicated.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so much fun and very addictive. I lose track of time playing. I don't have any of the problems playing this game as others have said. Its pretty simple to follow and you only pay real money if you want to purchase more coins or acorns, but they're easy enough to get without paying.
B004YJMQCS|4.0|I hated the first two films. Both were too badly written. This one was so over the top that I loved it. Outragous death scenes plus in anaglyph. 3D-Blu ray was cancelled in our state a year ago so it no longer exists. Still some companies know how to put together an anaglyph dvd until Vizeo get's their new TV on the market. As far as an anaglyph release this one was perfect. The included glasses worked wonders and if you have an advanced pair of glasses then you know as well as I do that this film was released properly and the color isn't too washed out for anaglyph. Also the image does stick out in your face when your tv is properly adjusted. Enjoyed this dvd very much and have it in dvd and Blu Ray. Both work well with included glasses.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I would get it again because its a good game in all so in all I would give it a 4 and a half
0689865384|3.0|Let's just get this out of the way: I will read the rest of them.  That being said, the dialogue is horrible.  Westerfeld clearly does not know how real teenagers talk to one another.  And did anybody feel how weird it was for Tally to be so passionately kissing at that age?  The premise is genius.  If it were to be made into a movie, the screenwriter would have to create brand new dialogue, or heavily edit what he has to work with.  Dear Mr. Westerfeld, go visit a high school campus.  Mentor middle school writers.  Maybe you'll get a glimpse of how they speak and act.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire, the second book of the Hunger Games trilogy, is fast-moving and great, just like the first book.  At $5.99 to download it to my Kindle, I just couldn't wait for my turn at the library.  Good value for your dollar!
B0058U23XE|1.0|If you are the type of person who is ruining music nowadays, then this is for you.  It's prepackaged, mass produced garbage like this that will destroy society.  This isn't Rock and Roll, it's drivel for the tone deaf fans of Nickleback.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|why is every one saying it is good because it sucks the other person that said it sucks is 100% right.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|This was a charming film but not charming enough to give it more than 4 stars. In all aspects I found this picture just that little bit lacking compared to say a \\"Love Actually\\".<br />It was witty but not witty enough; the cast was good but didn't grab you enough; you cared for the characters but never really were very concerned about them. In my view this film could have been better with another director. Sometimes Woody can do too much!
030788743X|5.0|This book should be everyone's favorite book, if you are born between 1975-1980 and played a lot of computer games around the time you were 10. A book about old school computer games mixed with a hybrid of Facebook, WoW and VR in the future... I loved it! One of my favorite books ever!
1594202842|1.0|This book is full of hypocrisy. So many things Amy Chua says she is against ... but then she totally contradicts herself.<br /><br />For instance - she states in one part of the book how she is adamantly against using bribery with children, but then when put under pressure, or especially when her pride is at stake, she does just that. Little Lulu is interviewing for preschool and does not perform as she should. Embarrassed and looking for a quick fix, Amy takes her aside and quietly bribes her with a lollipop and a trip to the book store.  I was so sad to see Amy thanking God that they lived in America where no doubt because of the American Revolution rebelliousness is valued. Thanking God for rebellion being accepted?? That is pure wickedness. God is clear: rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. God has nothing to do with the rebellion of Americans.<br /><br />Another example - She states in chapter 3 that she does not believe in astrology (which no one should ... it's another form of witchcraft) and thinks that anyone who does has a serious problem. Yet all throughout the book she refers back to the Chinese Zodiac. She is admitting here that she has serious problems.<br /><br />There are many more examples of hypocrisy, but the main reason why I did not like this book is because her method of parenting is totally driven by pride and vanity.<br /><br />Pride, hypocrisy and vanity are NOT good character traits. You must be the person you want your children to be.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|To many little things just made so sense at all that they are all I remember of the movie =( It was an action flick and if you don't think about it too much like I did, you'll love the movie!
B005BDZQKU|5.0|Anyone who <3 this classic must get this bluray! It also comes with the dvd version, playbill from other countries (fascinating!) and a soundtrack that will be appreciated by any West Side Story fan.
B007L96SI6|5.0|Ah, American Idol debut albums. Dangerous territory. All too often, it seems like talented young singers get produced to death and wind up creating a product that feels neither authentic nor particularly interesting, as if the producers were trying way too hard to turn a singer into a commodity.<br /><br />It's not to say that Haley Reinhart's debut CD is under-produced, exactly... all one would have to do is listen to a few bars of \\"Oh My!\\" to realize that lack of production will not be an issue here. But what sets LISTEN UP! apart is that it feels like we're getting an authentic sense of who this singer is.<br /><br />Haley is a throwback. She sounds like she would have been in perfect company 40 years ago, and her nods to 60s girl groups and 70s Motown are just a lot of fun.<br /><br />Haley's smoky, raspy voice is in fine form throughout. If Randy Jackson hadn't hated her last season, he would have said she could \\"sing the phone book.\\" Of course, no one uses phone books anymore, but I digress. She sounds incredible, especially on \\"Undone\\" and \\"Now That You're Here,\\" which has a refrain that sounds like a jazzy take on a classic Michael Jackson hook.<br /><br />One thing that watchers of American Idol may not have known last season (I surely didn't) is that Ms. Reinhart is a strong songwriter. She co-wrote nine of the ten tracks here, and you'll find hooks galore and some really nice and memorable turns of phrase. \\"Liar\\" is an intriguing take on a relationship that is on the rocks because her man had the nerve to tell her the truth. I haven't heard that one before. Interesting. \\"Hit The Ground Running\\" is what we might have called \\"cheeky\\" back in the day. Haley's nobody's fool, and she lets you know it in that one, with lines like, \\"You better watch your mouth  boy/'cause I don't miss a beat.\\"<br /><br />There's really not a bad cut on this terrific CD. From the opening bars of \\"Oh My,\\" which sounds like a combination of a steamy August night in New Orleans andsomething pulled from a James Bond film from the 70s, to the gorgeous \\"Walking on Heaven,\\" which may be the best Mariah Carey song not sung my Miss Mariah, there is no filler here. Just one great melody after the next.<br /><br />\\"Oh My\\" features a rap by B.o.B. which fits the song well and is clearly Interscope's attempt to create some buzz for an artist who surely deserves it. To me, this is the song of the summer of 2012. It's an absolute blast to blare this as I drive down the highway.<br /><br />The lead single, \\"Free,\\" is a terrific mid-tempo track that showcases Haley's voice nicely. That said, it's also the only song she did not have a hand in writing, and it's the only track that lacks a strong hook, making it a peculiar choice for a first single. Better perhaps might have been \\"Wasted Tears\\" or \\"Hit the Ground Running,\\" which sound like updated takes on The Supremes, or \\"Undone,\\" a stunning ballad that is reminiscent of \\"Someone Like You\\" by Adele.<br /><br />If you like good pop music, you're going to love this CD. I promise. After about five listens, I have a feeling this will be in heavy rotation on my iPhone for months and months to come.
B00511ONPG|5.0|This book has truly taught me a lot.  I started my own business a few years ago and its just now starting to take off. I knew that social media was an important tool when trying to connect to customers but I just couldn't figure out how. So when I saw this book I knew it was a must read. Boy am I happy I read it! I've learned so much from it and it made me look at social media's, such as Facebook in a totally different way. This book taught me the importance of trying to always think like the consumer and put myself in their shoes. I've already recommended this book to numerous friends!  Its def a must read!<br /><br />Also after reading this book I sent the author an email and they actually wrote me back!  It wasn't a generic email either!  :D
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really don't know what's going on with the people who make all these claims about how terrible this app is.  It doesn't enormously accelerate draining the battery.  It works perfectly on weekends.  It's intuitive and easy to use.  It works perfectly for me.  I really have to suspect that many of the complaints about this app are coming from people who aren't very technologically adept.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very cool reminds me of the original mario.  could do with more lvls though. otherwise great job. I love it alot
B005LAIGN2|2.0|And not in a good way.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. After all, I'm a pilot; I love good flying movies; and the trailers for this flick looked like it would be right up my alley. Hey, c'mon! P-51s? I'm so there.<br /><br />But what was really amazing about this movie was that I'd never before in my life watched a movie that was such a complete collection of clich&eacute;s all put together in one place.<br /><br />Here are the source materials I recognized for this movie, in no particular order:<br /><br />Hart's War - A Soldier's Story - 12 O'Clock High - Top Gun - Stalag 17 - The Great Escape - Flyboys - The Blue Max - Command Decision - The Bridges at Toko-Ri -  Lucas's own Star Wars series for some of the flying maneuvers and camera angles - and there are probably a couple more that escape me at the moment.<br /><br />Gotta hand it to Lucas and Company: when they steal, they steal from the best. The problem is, just stringing together a bunch of scenes taken from a bunch of OTHER flicks does not an entertaining movie make.<br /><br />I will say, the actual flying scenes were pretty interesting. Interesting... not really EXCITING. But I did marvel at the CGI skills on display. As a pilot, it was among the best representations of the flight environment I can recall. That's what earned this the second star, because otherwise it was pretty hopeless. Unengaging, to say the least. Even at that, the flying scenes in Top Gun were better by orders of magnitude.<br /><br />Don't bother. Really. Unless you're a fan of old movies, and want to see some of their best scenes strung together and played by different actors or something.<br /><br />Or maybe you can make it a drinking game. \\"Name that scene!\\" The others who didn't spot it have to down one. Last guy standing's the winner. Something like that.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Now I wouldn't go as far as saying this was the best book I had ever read but it was a good story.  I do admit the authors writing style is quite different but enough so she kept me tuned to her story.  Okay okay so everyone is talking about the sex - really people there was a story there a love story no less.  The characters come alive on the pages and draws you to them both.  You want to hate Christian because he just a sadistic control freak with madd issues but you also feel for the poor guy all in the same breath.  You want to dislike Anastasia because you think she just stupid at first but the girl is actually smarter than you think and has a plan.  What makes the story so exciting is the great difference between the two - opposites really do attract I guess. . .  I also will say that book one was enough to make me buy book two and three because I want to know how it all ends - curiousity will keep you there every time.  For those of you who hold off reading because of what people are saying about the sex - well it really is not that bad heck Zane will give Mrs. James a run for her money let me tell you.  I think I did more talking to the book during those scenes than any thing - A simple \\"Oh no he didn't\\" - but that was about it.  I have been told the books get better with two and three and I am delighted to hear that because they are in my q to read next.  I won't spoil the book for you as you should read and form your own opinion.  Like I said I am a sucker for a good love story which this is despite all the repeated words in the book - i.e. Oh My and Murmur.  The only thing I have bad to say about the murmur thing was that Christian Grey did not appear to me to be a person who EVER murmur's!  Good book and I will continue with the story no matter how I dislike series.  I like to read a story and be done with it.  Entertaining read by an amataur writer - well done for a first go at it.  People can say what they want but Mrs. James made it to the best sellerlist for 63 straight weeks!  Go head girl!

0307730697|5.0|Waterbrook Press has published a great read in FEARLESS.    In this text, the curtain is pulled back & the reader will be enthralled within the pages of the life of Adam Brown. From Brown's rock-bottom valley of being arrested & put in jail, to his heroic efforts in combat & mission, this is quite a page-turner.    The life of Adam Brown has the core theme of redemption. The author digs deep into the life & personality of Brown, who falls to the lowest of lows, but it loved, supported, and redeemed by the love of Christ through his family & friends, therefore reaching the status of hero in the eyes of his family, friends and fellow soldiers and the next person who reads this book.    This story is exciting, thrilling, humbling, and honest. This is a story that will capture you from cover to cover. As a reader, you will find yourself emotionally bound to Adam Brown's life, as author Eric Blehm pulls back the curtain on a life lived for the love of God, Family, Country, and Others.    For a quick look at the premise of the story of Adam Brown - [...]    For a sample chapter of FEARLESS -[...]    What are others saying about FEARLESS? - [...]    About the author, Eric Blehm - [...]    If you are a book-lover and appreciate a good read, go here - [...]    I received this book for the purpose of review from Multnomah Publishers.
B005QUQP76|5.0|I heavily recommend this mouse to those with big manly hands. I have never had a mouse this comfortable and adjustable. I love the on the fly mouse sensitivity adjustments as it allows me to find that sweet spot for every situation. The quality of its construction completely justifies the price.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Highly recommend this book to people of all levels of fitness. Mike explains things logically and makes complex topics simple to understand. The programs are great and the information contained in the book is invaluable. To add to my thoughts on the book, I got an email from Mike and was given the chance to ask questions specifically about my training. I asked a couple of questions and got a response within a couple of hours. A brilliant service. Thanks Mike!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a futuristic tale that has an eery message about our current political environment and what can happen when we allow government to take our freedom. I couldn't put it down and then eagerly read the next 2 books as well.  I highly recommend it.  It is graphic and not for younger teenagers.
B005LAIGP0|1.0|The \\"thrills\\" in this film feel like you're going through the horror tunnel at your local fair, which is to say lots of loud sounds and things jumping out at you for no good reason other than to make you jump. This is neither creepy nor scary; it's just annoying.<br /><br />The plot of The Woman in Black is pretty weak to begin with, and the film does nothing to add substance to Susan Hill's shallow tale in which the weather is the most interesting character of all. Radcliffe is unimpressive, and while he is good enough to portray the one-dimensional Harry Potter, as Arthur Kipps he simply goes around moping the entire movie, failing to make us believe in the supposed heartache he is experiencing.<br /><br />On the production side, the film is well made; The cinematography sets a good atmosphere, and the house is perfectly creepy as the main location for the plot. In the end, however, The Woman in Black is a poorly acted dull-fest plagued by incessant formula horror cliches.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game :-) Very entertaining. Would, and have recommended it to friends and colleagues. Give it a try! You will be pleasantly surprised.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|Once you get past the NADSAT terminology, you are in for a treat, because A Clockwork Orange is a fantastic book.  This book was the first book I ever read with the \\"Anti-Hero\\" in the main role.  I think any book that throws up such an unlikeable character as Alexander LaStrange and still manages to capture its readers is a classic.  Obviously, most people will compare this book to the ever popular Stanley Kubrick movie of the same name.  Whereas, I enjoyed the movie (its acutally one I own) I felt that the book drove the main points a little deeper than the movie did.  Whether you think prisons are to lax or too strict, you will probably find something in this book to agree with.  I don't think Anthony Burgess' point was to make you feel any specific way about criminals or prisons, but just to experience them from all sides and perhaps make you realize that, as with most things in life, there are layers upon layers of factors that complicate any issue.  Nothing in life is straightforward as most people would have us believe.
0345803485|4.0|This was our book club selection. We wanted to see what all the buzz was about. I was pleasantly surprised. Enjoyed the story very much that I read the other two books. It's not for all...many haters out there but I'm not among them.

B000JQUMPI|4.0|It was interesting to read the Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication of Little Women many years after having read the revised edition we've all come to know and love. It's still the fiesty, independent Jo I admired, so I enjoyed reading this version. There were some formatting issues, such as many paragraphs being completely indented, but that's formatting, not content.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|This is the best album ever.  It is as fresh on the 1000th spin as it was on the first.  The quality of the composition, lyrics, creativity, musicianship, and vocals is unsurpassed and it should be spiritedly embraced in the same pantheon of music as The White Album, After The Gold Rush, Physical Graffiti, OK Computer, The Joshua Tree, Exodus, and Nevermind.  But it isn't and that is a darn shame and great loss for the public consciousness.  Everyone could relate to and benefit from this record, and I  grow more fond of it every day.  Please provide yourself with a great gift and buy this album, it is only $4 used a few places here on Amazon.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love nonograms, and I love this app. Always the trouble of putting one of these puzzles (like a crossword? really?) on a phone is getting the grid size large enough yet allowing big fingers to tap the right squares in them. By allowing the user to zoom in and out, this app does the job. Thanks for making this a Free App of the Day!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the best sleep depriving books I've read - kept me excellent company during a recent illness.  Probably cheaper to buy the Trilogy right away, instead of one at a time.  Once you've read the first few chapters of the first book, you will want them all.  All three books are equally good, quality is consistent and the story intrigue makes you want to learn speed reading.  The author is a genius at story-telling, excitement and keeping the reader in the story; her ending is superior to most books I've read.<br />Enjoy, this trilogy is a rare gem.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|I bought this along with a 1 foot HDMI cable for a connection that is right up against my wall. So far, I haven't had any problem with the adapter losing connection or anything.

I've owned this for a few months.<br /><br />For the price, this is a great adapter that if it does break, is easily replaced.

1606863622|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It's a typical Nicolas Sparks book in the sense that, if you're a fan, it won't disappoint. Good writing, interesting story line, and of course, a believable romance at the center that will probably leave you in tears. I've also seen the movie, by the way, but I preferred the book to it (as is often the case for me). I would definitely recommend this one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it has so many games. it has a very different variation of games. it is awesome!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has a terrific mix of emotions that range from anger of how Ana is being treated by Christian to tugging at the romantic heart strings to wanting to make love to your spouse/significant other.  It was a bit slow to get into, but once hooked, I finished all three books in a very short time frame.  Loved it!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are awesome plus they gibe you all of your interests and all the games that you could hope for
044042321X|5.0|I've only recently gotten into comic books and graphic novels.  This book was excellent at helping with the transition from traditional novels.  The scenes are gorgeous and amazingly detailed!  I wanted to (and did) sit and stare at some of the panels to try and absorb all of the little things going on in the background.  The artist interviews help point out some things I missed the first time around, which gave me a good excuse to re-read it immediately.  I've read all of the books so far, and this graphic novel kept almost everything exactly as it is originally written.  A few minor set details, I believe they used from the HBO series but nothing major, if you're a purist for that sort of thing.  If you haven't read the series and only watched the show, I would definitely recommend this to see a little more of the story.  It's spot on!<br /><br />I've already pre-ordered Volume Two.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Unless you play the game zoomed in all the way and thus have to pan constantly you will spend more time correcting inaccurate inputs than solving the puzzle. An immense amount of frustration could be avoided if they just had button select for whether you want to fill, x or erase a square instead of the slow multi tap select which makes fixing errors even worse. Oh yeah it's a lovely game otherwise if not a bit basic on features for the high price.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I admit it; I'm not very plugged into current movies.  My husband wanted me to watch the preview for this and I did, without paying much attention.  Then we had a day with nothing to do and I watched the preview again to see if maybe I could indulge him and the kids and go see it.  Superheroes aren't a big thing for me usually, so it didn't seem like my kind of movie.  The preview surprised me though - not just fighting and explosions, but some good, witty banter.  Then I saw that it was directed by Joss Whedon, and that decided me.  I am a HUGE fan.  The movie was really excellent.  The characters mattered, the interplay between them was fun.  I didn't realize until it was over and the credits were rolling that Joss had also written the screenplay.  When I saw that, it all made sense.  It really did have his signature all over it.  People who really enjoy superhero movies will love this one.  But I'm also evidence that you don't have to love superheroes to enjoy this movie.  I'll definitely pick this one up on Blu-ray when it comes out.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Great customization,  multiple calendars in one view.  Love it.  Very stable.  Use it every day.  Have used it for almost one year.

Amazing to find out what stores know about us that I don't feel they should, made me stop shopping at Target. I don't need anyone outside my family knowing that much of my personal business. Also made me more aware of how I purchase items. Scary

B000KCI8YI|5.0|BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. This may be director Ridley Scott's masterpiece. The entire production and the culmination of what the team of filmmakers do is just incredible The cast is powerful giving performances that are both moving, yet very realistic and convincing. Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Sam Shepard, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, William Fichtner, Jason Isaacs, Orlando Bloom, George Harris, Ewen Bremner are just some of the impressive cast members. The film focuses on the 1993 raid into Mogadishu by the U.S. military to capture Mohamed Farrah Aidid and the complications of this military operation and the incredible intense battle that followed.<br /><br />It often seems that moments of courage are a result of military expedience predilected by military ineffectiveness due to underestimated enemy strength and numbers and unexpected occurrences that put combatants face to face with overwhelming odds. How a general could ever let his men enter a maze-like city surrounded by thousands of hostile inhabitants is not entirely beyond comprehension. What you don't know or entirely understand or underestimate can hurt you. Sam Shepard as that general had to exceed the scope of the original mission and his command putting his men in harm's way in broad daylight. Simply, the initial mission as planned did not end up being cut and dry.<br /><br />Ridley Scott seems uniquely capable of ferreting out the military decisions that led to this debacle but places no blame. However, all the blame is up there on the screen if you choose to take note similar to the way Sam Shepard watches it on his TV monitor. Scott instead places the viewer into a 180-degree maelstrom of bullets, bombs, shrapnel, blood, sweat and tears. In 160 years of technology it is amazing how some of the images are reminiscent of the last stand at the Alamo. What has been learned in all those years? Every good war film needs a hero and Tom Sizemore gives the best performance as one hardened and dedicated officer. The most interesting shot in this film is where a tired and weary group of Americans finally emerge from the city covered in dirt, gunpowder, blood and grease and they are greeted by foreign United Nations troops wearing turbans. These UN fellows offer the Americans glasses of water served from silver trays with white linen napkins draped over their arms. So much for modern technology it would seem.<br /><br />This film is full of heroics of necessity and raw determination. It does not glorify war, but it does give dignity and recognition to those who go in harm's way to preserve our freedoms and ideals. A lot of the camera movement and Hans Zimmer's score emphasize this recognition to everyone involved at those right in the line of fire.

A lot of the camera movement and Hans Zimmer's score emphasize this recognition to everyone involved at those right in the line of fire. BLACK HAWK DOWN is just a very good film, powerful all around.

B0050DIWFC|1.0|As you may have gathered by now, Defending Jacob is a story of a 14-year-old son of a DA that is accused of murdering the boy bullying him, told from the point of view of the aforementioned father. An incredibly thought-provoking premise, horrendously and amateurishly executed.<br /><br />There are so many plot holes I can't even cover them all. NONE of the characters are likable, except perhaps characters that only get about three total pages worth of coverage. I suspect that's the only reason they remained likable. The \\"OMG HUGE PLOT TWIST!!!!\\" at the end? Predictable. Saw it coming. In fact, I saw the entire ending coming.<br /><br />I'm irritated not only that I read the whole thing, which was incredibly predictable and poorly-written, but also because it could've gone in a completely. different. direction. And that would've been awesome. The murder itself wasn't really explained or, in spite of the endless pages devoted to the \\"evidence\\", gone over at all. Why not take that tack, fill in that angle a bit? And while I understand that being accused of murder would probably make you something of a pariah, we're expected to believe that not ONE single person stood by this family, when the mother was supposedly the pillar of grace and strength for the community? Right.<br /><br />Quite frankly, this book was awful. If you rated it 5 Stars, you probably also found 50 Shades of Grey to be the BEST BOOK EV-AR. Take that as you will.

B0055B0MIO|5.0|The album shows a bit more diversity than is commonly seen in modern metal and manages to show a strong balance in memorability and aggression, both of which are in full force in tracks such as Black, Dusk Dismantled and the title track, In Waves. Trivium's pop sensibility is also displayed on tracks like Built To Fall, Caustic Are the Ties That Bind and, if you have the special edition, A Grey So Dark. The album contains a plethora of well-executed guitar solo's and catchy parts but generally stays within a moderate tempo  range, has mostly predictably song structures and vocalist Matt Heafy's Screams tend to be unintelligible at times. aside from those small issues the album spans from Pop-Punk to Black Metal while still kicking ass, In Waves is a killer effort and undoubtedly one i'll be listening to for a while.
0553386794|5.0|This book and the four that follow are brilliant.  Genius writing.  If you liked Ken Follet's Pillars of the Earth you will like (and maybe love) this series.  There is a fantasy aspect that Pillars of the Earth does not have but it does not detract from the exquisite writing and story lines. After all who doesn't love dragons?

B004RE29WW|4.0|It's time for another review where I review a movie from either 2002 or 1992. This is 20 years ago Alien 3. Now I know Alien 3 is 1  of the most hated sequels & if you hate it I don't hold it against anybody for this or any movie for that matter. There was a lot of problems between 1987-1991 dealing with the scripts development or whatever. I covered all that in my Alien 3 review last year when I reviewed all The Alien movies all The Predator movies last year on my old account. You'll have to back track a lot but you will find them. Alien 3 was directed by David Fincher he directed Seven, Panic Room & The Game. It stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, Charles S Dutton as Dillon, Charles Dance as Clemens, Brian Glover as Andrews, Ralph Brown as Aaron or 85, Lance Henriksen as Bishop & Michael Bishop &  Paul McGann as Golic. Story is sometime after Aliens a fire has broke out on The Sulacco somehow there was an egg on board that was 20th Century FOX's call not David Fincher's or Terry Rollins. Cause if you remeber in Aliens The Queen's egg sack was ripped off. The Face Hugger was trying to get into 1 of the cryo chambers & it ended up causing the fire. It sets them off in a EEV Ripley, Hicks, Newt & what's left of Bishop land on a planet Fury 161 a prison planet. Hicks is impled & died. Newt drowned in her cryo tube. Bishop is beyond repair. In the theatrical cut there found by a group of prisoners & a dog becomes the host for this new kind of Face Hugger called a Super Face Hugger. Now for anybody who blames David Fincher for killing off Hicks & Newt it was more of 20th Century FUXNSUX fault cause they passed on The William Gibson script & Sigourney Weaver cause she didn't fight for Hicks & Newt to live. In The special edition Ripley washes up on the beach she is found by The Doctor Clemens. The Superindentant Anderws wants her kept in the infirmery. Ripley eventually wakes up she finds out that Hicks & Newt are dead. She looks around the escape pods she sees wherethere is acid blood on Newt's pod. There is an autopsy done & there is nothing found. I was bummed they were killed off in that way & another problem I had other than Charles S Dutton & Charles Dance why should I care about this group of inmates. Depending on what cut you see The Alien either busts through a Dog or an Ox. I switch back & forth through the theactrical & assembly versions cause The Alien moves more like a Dog. They have a funeral where they throw the bodies of Hicks & Newt into the fire Charles S Dutton gives this beatiful monologe. Ripley shaves her head later on due to the lice problem. This 1 prisoner is killed when he was cleaning the vents by The Alien. Ripley & Clemens have some sort of realationship going on he has a prison bar code on the back of his neck she wants to know about it. Then you have Golic & these 2 other prisoners in these tunnels where those 2 other prisoners are killed Golic goes insane he is found in the lunch room covered in blood the deaths get pinned on him. Ripley goes to retrive Bishop you get an unwanted<br />r  a  p  e attempt  by some of the inmates Dillon saves her he tells her \\"I've got to edjucate some of the brothers.\\" Anyway she rigs Bishop up what's left of him he tells her that the fire was electrical & that there was an Alien on board & it was with us all the way. Golic is brought into the room he's yelling that the dragon did it. Ripley tells Superintendant Andrews about The Alien & of course he doesn't believe her she asks if they have any weapons he tells her no only carving knives & fire axes. Clemens tells Ripley about his past how he used to be a doctor on Earth he was drunk when he was performing surgery & killed a paitent  & was sent to prison after his sentance on Fury 161 he stayed as a Doctor. Then he was killed by The Dog Alien it goes up to Ripley but doesn't kill her. She runs to the mess hall tries to warn everybody The Alien grabs Superintendant Andrews & pulls him through the vents. 1 of the prisoners reactions is funny.  In the special edition version they trap The  Alien in this room. Ripley contacts her employer The Weyland Yutani she asks permission to kill Th Alien to see what there up to she is denied. Ripley has felt pains in her chest & stomach area she scans herself to find their is a Queen Alien Embryo in her. Golic escapes & lets The Alien loose & The Alien kills him in the theactrical edition there is no mention of what happend to Golic. Ripley wants Dillion to kill her he says only after we kill the creture. You have Ripley tell how in the 1st movie my crew was killed they were expendable. They sent in Marines they were expendable. So what makes you think that they care about a bunch of lifers that found G  o  d at the a  s  s end of space. Sigourney Weaver delivered that line better than I did. Charles S Dutton's line he has I ain't much for begging is just so well delivered. So then you have the inmates try to trap The Alien into the lead works so they can kill it. There is some pretty good kills some nice gore. Ripley & Dillon lead it into the foundry & Dillon is killed fighting off The Alien. 1 of the prisoners dumps hot lead on The Alien Ripley turns on the sprinklers & it shatters aprt. Michael Bishop from The Weyland Yutani arrives with some kind of scientist. He tries to convince her to come with them & she falls into the furnace to prevent the company from getting the last Alien or so we think. Not an in depth review if you want an in depth review I reviewed all The Alien & Predator movies & I went in depth. Sigourney Weaver, Charles S Dutton & Charles Dance are all great. Paul McGann is ok. Ralph Brown is ok. Lance Henriksen is good for the amount of time he had. This is my 2nd favorite of the series I know everyone won't agree cause in no way is it as good as Aliens which is my favorite & my favorite James Cameron movie. But for me it's an underrated sequel if you haven't seen The Assembly Cut & hate Alien 3 check that version outto fully make your mind up.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is awesome it have pretty cool games with easy to comprehend directions these games are royalty cool and addicting

B007MJKOY4|4.0|You must pay attention in this film, which is a feature I love. The plot is twisted and nicely done. The acting is great. Worth a watch (and maybe two).
0345803485|1.0|This is the first time that I've written a review on this Website but, as a writer, I just HAD to add my voice to the resounding chorus of fellow readers who have found these books to be ridiculous.<br /><br />I actually had a visceral reaction to the pedestrian plot and writing style - one which caught me completely off guard, too.<br /><br />Little questions began to insinuate themselves into my consciousness as I was reading - pretty much along the lines of, \\"Has our Western culture sunk so low? Have we dumbed ourselves down to such an extent?\\"<br /><br />Neither of these questions had anything to do with the constant barrage of overt, alternative sexual expression, but more with the writer's craft . . . or apparent lack thereof.<br /><br />As a retired educator, had a student submitted such a poorly executed assignment, it would have been \\"bleeding\\" red ink by the time I had wrestled my way through it . . . while trying to stay AWAKE in the process !<br /><br />But perhaps more significant is the fact that avoidance of reading this nonsense any further propelled me into the completion of an onerous task that I had been procrastinating for months.<br /><br />Quite the indictment, wouldn't you agree ? Let's just say that I would rather have stuck hot wires in my eyes than risk the predictable ennui of turning any more pages.<br /><br />I also find myself more than a bit concerned about the message that such \\"pap\\" is going to impart to younger women. The not-so-hidden innuendo is that love can be attained through servile submission, fluttering of mascara-laden eyelashes, and feigned vacuousness.<br /><br />As a woman who came of age during the politically-charged, turbulent years of advocacy for women's rights, part of me wonders if this is nothing more than a cynical backlash.
B007JM4CWY|2.0|I've played these before, not hardcore ones, but a few. I was perfectly fine until 1.6, there are contradictory numbers. I'm afraid these were just copied from somewhere else, had a few typos, and not double checked. Some of the other reviews are odd too, they're negative in content but 5 stars?
1594202842|3.0|So, first the fascinating and inspiring:  here's a peek inside what I'm sure just about anyone is at least a little curious about: what kind of parenting results in high achievers-- and, putting aside whatever truths or non-truths are in the stereotypes, why so many Asian students are in that category.  I like Chua's unapologetic and direct (just like her practice of Chinese parenting)recounting of her experience with her daughters.  It is quite brave to put this book to a culture that includes things Chua insists are not found in traditional Chinese parenting:  the helicopter parents, the parents who want to be \\"friends\\" with their kids. And it wouldn't hurt to set down whatever shock or insult one may have in reading this, and consider taking a page or two from her book.  Why not expect a little more from kids (and yourself?)  Why not shoot for excellence, for the A? Why not consider that there are many social problems in the West whose roots might be found in a cultural style that bleeds into parenting?<br /><br />Now the \\"eh.\\"  I don't think Chua gives fair acknowledgement to the drawbacks of her parenting style, and the value to be found in the \\"Western\\" style.  Chua regularly adopts a mocking tone toward the West that does not seem at all tongue-in-cheek.  She obviously has a sense of superiority and makes no apologies for it.  But you have to question why her parents would have come to the U.S. if not for what it had to offer them that they could not have had in China.  I do not expect Chua's book to be any homage to the U.S. But here is a  woman who has reaped so many advantages from it, yet she has not examined what it is about the U.S. that keeps her--with her daughters--in the U.S.  That is a pretty glaring contradiction that she does not attend to.  I'll give her that Western culture is far from perfect.  But she didn't write this book in China.  So maybe Western parents are doing something right.  Let's give some acknowledgement where it's due.  Otherwise, this is all just hubris.
0525476881|5.0|From quirky to entertaining to enlightening, there's nothing quite like a road trip with a former child prodigy and his content-to-do-nothing Muslim friend.  They wind up in Gutshot, Tennessee, and land a job recording the podunk's unlikely history. It's an intriguing tale about the value of connection and storytelling because as it turns out, we don't remember what happened. What we remember becomes what happened. And even if it's a dumb story, telling the story changes the people who hear it in much the same way living the story changes us.
0307956350|4.0|Wow! Reminded me, in ways, of \\"Await Your Reply\\" by Dan Chaon.<br />Never knew where this was going until very close to the ending. The author artfully supplied hints that all was not as the reader expected. He might have led us down the proper road, but it turned out that we were on the wrong side of the road.<br />This is all Kate's story of leaving a job she'd had for almost half of her life and moving with her husband and two children to Luxembourg for Dexter's new job. The skills that Kate developed in her old career do not just turn off. She worked for the CIA. Now her distrust and suspicion turn to, first, a couple they meet in Luxembourg and subsequently Dexter.<br />The pages turn themselves on this one.<br />My one complaint is one of the fonts used did not work well with my vision. (The story is told from a \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" position changing fonts with the timeframe.)<br />Otherwise, I'd read it again. Might be interesting to listen to it the second time around.

B0064NTZQ2|1.0|Because I don't wish to waste any more of my life on this movie, I will just add my 1 star to the growing pile of disgust this movie has rightfully generated.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the lovely and talented Carey Mulligan chose to participate in something this awful.  Aside from the fact that the story itself is preposterously bad, CM's role made virtually no use of her considerable acting talents.  As another reviewer noted, the majority of the interaction between the protagonists consists of long, silent, \\"meaningful\\" stares.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The brutality in this movie is graphic, the \\"aesthetic vision\\" is pretentious, and the attempt to portray the main character as a \\"moral killer\\" is beyond believability.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is hands-down the best Madonna album (which is saying something, because there are a lot of great ones) and my favorite album of all time. Madonna + William Orbit = Brilliance, simply put. I would encourage anyone who likes this CD to check out William Orbit's album \\"Pieces in a Modern Style 2\\", his ambient/trance versions of a bunch of classical pieces.<br /><br />\\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\" - A chilled-out work of excellence. Madonna's newly trained, expressive voice is well on display, and it works perfectly with Orbit's bubblingly ambient, underwater soundscape.<br /><br />\\"Swim\\" - Madonna turns into John Lennon and starts singing about healing the world. A groovy, breakbeat-fueled jam with a surprisingly catchy melody with some fascinating guitar work.<br /><br />\\"Ray of Light\\" - an ecstatic masterpiece. Orbit's electrifying track soars with Madonna's amazing voice. I don't think I need to say anymore, as this is one of Madonna's best-known and most-acclaimed singles.<br /><br />\\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" - plays a lot of similar notes to \\"Swim\\", but with a rather dark funk edge. A lot of blippy sound effects - you can sense Orbit kicking into a higher gear. Madonna gets sultrier and lower, to fantastic results.<br /><br />\\"Skin\\" - a tense and unsettling uptempo piece. You can almost see the city chase scene in some sci-fi action movie. Plus, there are bagpipes or some similar foreign instrument. A highly intriguing track.<br /><br />\\"Nothing Really Matters\\" - Longtime Madonna producer Patrick Leonard returns, and it shows. Sounds remarkably similar to Madonna's 80's work in terms of composition, except it has instrumentation and sensibilities akin to the rest of the album.<br /><br />\\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" - A fascinating uptempo track about prophets, scriptures, and simplistic proverbs. Engaging and interesting.<br /><br />\\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\" - The eastern influences on the album come out full-force. Sounds middle-eastern or Indian, and probably draws significant influence from the trance subgenres that originated there, particularly Goa Trance (if you like this track, I recommend a psychedelic trance act named Cosmosis). The language Madonna is singing in is Sanskrit.<br /><br />\\"Frozen\\" - a chilling orchestral piece. Madonna is just as expressive as the moving strings that support her voice as she explores her lower register. A beautiful and haunting single that only gets better as Orbit brings in the shifting drum track.<br /><br />\\"The Power of Good-Bye\\" - riding \\"Frozen\\"'s wave, this song creates a downtempo current that makes the listener want to sway. The combination of the beat and the pulsating synths gives the track an almost snake-charming vibe.<br /><br />\\"To Have and Not to Hold\\" - an interesting break in the action. This song has latin influences that seem absent on the rest of the album, but it works in this setting. Very organic and engaging.<br /><br />\\"Little Star\\" - a lullaby to Madonna's daughter, Lourdes, and also an ode to self-expression. Has a charming quality. Madonna sounds as if she's about to burst into tears - you can sense her pain at the thought of the unavoidably public life that may await her child as she lives her life in her mother's shadow.<br /><br />\\"Mer Girl\\" - Quirky and brilliant. Madonna's surreal narrative in which she seems to morph back and forth (even in the same line) between herself as a little girl and herself as a confident mother. Cryptic in some ways but obvious in others. As it continues it becomes more and more unsettling but more and more fascinating. Writing this song may have been one of the most lucid introspective moments Madonna will ever have.<br /><br />This album is brilliant. $11 is an absolute bargain for music that is timeless and that you will never, ever forget or want to stop listening to.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|There must be a thousand reviews of Intel's I7 processor. The speed is absolutely scalding.  I haven't tried any of the benchmarks but I haven't been able to slow it down much less stall it.  I know it's going to happen, but it's hard to believe that someday there will be faster processors.  Currently, you can not do better.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|The movie has a okay story line, the creepy and haunting music gets your heart pumping and the woman in the black dress is a poorly animated scary person, they could have done better. The story line is weak and goes by fast. The movie got two stars instead of three because of the ending. The ending is stupid and weak. What kind of ending was that? Could there be a part 2? Who knows, this movie wasted my time and my money.
0345803485|1.0|I cannot understand what all the hype is about regarding the book \\"50 Shades of Gray\\". It's corny...Very corny. It's about 10x's worse than the most awful bodice ripping Harlequin romance I've ever read. The dialog and main character's persona are like that of a 1950's teenager. The \\"hot\\" scenes are so weak and poorly written that they left me tepid and sometimes sleepy. Books written by what sounds like a pubescent teen with a vivid imagination and a penchant for Victorian romance novels just don't do it for me. It may add some spice to a repressed housewife's life but it makes me yawn and say to myself \\"Really?!?!?!?\\" as I roll my eyes and turn the page. No, I'm not into BDSM and don't know much about the lifestyle, but I'm sure that if a 20 something billionaire wanted a sub, he wouldn't have to stalk an average, awkward, clumsy, inexperienced 21 year old virgin to find one. I'm glad my local library offered this novel as a download for my Nook Color. If I had shelled out $12.99 for it, I'd have been a pissed that I wasted my money.<br /><br />A couple OVERUSED terms from the book, \\"Crap!\\" and \\"Double Crap!\\" are very befitting descriptions of this novel!!!!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I love playing that on the nintendo DS, I has no idea that what it really was. awesomeness! I am happy to the zoom feature
B004LWZW42|4.0|I was never all that into comic books as a kid so I don't know a lot of the details.  I've read and heard some objections from people who ought to know that the movie changed a ton of stuff so that's something to consider.  From what I know based on the cartoons etc. some of the character portrayals seemed really weird to me and some of the plot seemed half-baked.  My issues with the character development were muted by the fact that the pool of actors they got managed to put everything together well enough that the end result looked better than it probably should have.  The names won't necessarily mean anything to people that don't watch a lot of movies but there are a lot of big name or at least significantly successful actors playing even the smaller roles.  There wasn't a lot that I objected to but the elements I had problems with seemed important to the story in my mind.  You can probably see this movie without seeing the others first but I think it probably helps to know the original movies beforehand.  It's definitely worth watching if you like the sci-fi action type of movie, especially since it's on HBO and cable TV now, but I'm not sure it'll appeal to everybody.  It's worth buying too and I intend to buy it once they come out with a version that has more special features and hopefully a digital copy included.  I'd like to see some of that kind of stuff so I'm willing to wait.

B005PK1G76|5.0|This organizer is simple, affordable and extremely useful!  It doesn't get in the way of the folding of my Baby Jogger City Mini GT.  The fact that it is flexible and kind of swings from the handle ensures that nothing spills out on bumps.  It's easily removed if necessary (I've never found it to be necessary).  I'd certainly buy it again.
B005KELW26|4.0|I really like this cover for the kindle fire a lot.  The purple color is beautiful.  I really like the protective thickness of it also.  The magnetic closure works great.  I use the little pocket thingy for keeping my lens wipes in it to clean the screen with.  The only thing that would have made it better would be if it had a little loop thingy to keep a stylus in, other than that, it's perfect.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|The reason for this is because Paranormal Activity (parts 1 - 3) relies of jump scares while this relies on four things, suspense, creepiness, disturbing imagery and good pacing.... Seriously, it had brilliant pacing, to tell you the truth, I didn't feel like watching the movie right away, but it was a fun way to start off my morning, in fact I felt like turning it off on account of me being tired but another superb thing about this movie is that it gets into the story right away!<br /><br />Plot: Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliff) has already lost his wife and feels her presence everyday even when she is absent. 4 years after her death he is assigned to a house that is practically cut off from the remote town that sits next to it, in fear. There he will do some paper work and mumbo jumbo but, on his first day he soon realizes that something is wrong. It turns out that a spirit (a woman dressed in black) Is haunting the premises of the haunted house. Can Daniel Radcliff stop the terror or will he become another victim in the woman in black's scheme!<br /><br />Review: I never heard of the original until I saw the first trailer back in late 2011 and unfortunately I haven't had the time to watch it but I hear it is chilling and scary as all hell! This movie was intense, but I do wish we saw more of the woman in black but when we did, let me tell ya... she wasn't pretty. In fact I am so sick and tired of witches that are pretty, we need a movie with an ugly witch, but we aren't technically talking about a witch, we are talking about a woman, a woman in black that just so happens to be a ghost! This film was never tame and one thing that it did have that paranormal activity also had was that feeling to look in back of whom ever you should be focusing on but instead your attention is drawn to the background and I feel that it is hard to do, especially when it is not shot entirely on a hand held camera!<br /><br />Acting: It was just wonderful to see Daniel Radcliff in something besides an over-hyped wizard movie (and you know what I am talking about). His acting was pretty awesome but I just couldn't shake the feeling of him playing a father.... damnit, I've watched to much Harry Potter! The other actors were above average as well.... let's just say I was pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />Gore: Some blood coughing and blood on a sheet is all we get here and I do wish it had more atmosphere like the first trailer gave off, but what we got was good enough!<br /><br />Bottom Line: I believe that I have said everything that I wanted to about this movie. It was over decent but I still do adore insidious more because it is more of my taste!<br /><br />Warning This Film is Rated: Rated PG-13 for thematic material and violence/disturbing images<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 7<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 4
0345803485|1.0|Somehow this book is even worse than Twilight.  Unsurprising, when you discover that the book started as a Twilight fanfic.  This would also explain the setting and the fact that the characters are clearly Bella and Edward, only in an even more abusive relationship.  I can't help but be somewhat impressed.  I would imagine it takes great effort to write this badly and to manage to avoid including even a single plot point in a novel this long.
0345803485|5.0|Very good reading,sometimes hot view of a different life style. I purchased this book as well as the other two for my wife. She read it in a few days. Said it was so interesting it was hard to stop. When did you order the others !
B007L96SI6|3.0|As is often the case on American Idol, Haley Reinhart found herself on the wrong side of a momentum contest by the time the final three rolled around and she was voted off.  Regardless, throughout the competition, Reinhart garnered mixed reviews until finally things seemed to click and her full potential shined through.  That potential is tapped on the fine [[ASIN:B007L96SI6 Listen Up!]] which is nothing short of a surprise album materializing as a debut from an American Idol contestant.  That is not to say that Listen Up is the second coming (it's not), but it does find Haley opting in a more soulful, pop-soul direction, much like the soul she exhibited on her spirited take of \\"Bennie and The Jets\\" on the show.<br /><br />\\"Oh My,\\" featuring B.o.B opens Listen Up strongly with its old-school drum programming and vintage sounds. Thankfully, this production trend is one that graces the entirety of the album.  Reinhart's vocals are nuanced and incredibly soulful, layered in reverb much like classic soul. B.o.B's rap complements Reinhart's superb performance making \\"Oh My\\" that surprise, genuine Idol hit. \\"Free,\\" the promotional single, keeps things rolling and manages to contrast the retro-soul of \\"Oh My\\" with more of a classic-pop cut.  The live drums and the six-eight groove make \\"Free\\" a winner, not to mention Reinhart's commanding lead vocals and her lovely upper register.<br /><br />\\"Liar\\" has `big shoes to fill,' but presents yet another soulful cut that is not overt soul, but straddles pop and soul  Haley's lead vocals are as solid as ever and the background vocals again heighten the quality of the cut `up-a-notch.' \\"Liar\\" does, however, feel like it could use just `something' extra.  \\"Wasted Tears\\" is stronger, opening dramatic with a vintage-soul sound.  The harmonized background vocals continue to to dominate, supporting the quality lead of Reinhart.  The four-on-the-floor percussive groove truly channels retro soul, not to mention a fat bass line and horns.  The slight quibble might be that the ending seemed ever so slightly abrupt.  \\"Undone\\" shifts back from soul to pop, which is a smart move for the young pop starlet.  Minimal support by instruments at first allows Haley's voice to shine, adding more instruments to the refrain (predictably pop right?). Like many cuts on Listen Up, \\"Undone\\" is not without its flaws: the `big pop drums' fail to enter when you expect them to.  A little extra finesse would've put \\"Undone\\" over the top.<br /><br />\\"Now That You're Here\\" contrasts the balladry of \\"Undone\\" with a mid-tempo, four-on-the-floor soul-dance cut.  Intact are the dusty drums as well as a vintage-60s tambourine and EP.  \\"Wonderland\\" keeps the soulful, retro-soul stylings, though suffers a bit given the denseness of the cut.  At times, \\"Wonderland\\" feels a bit too cluttered with so many background vocals and a bit too much repetitiveness.<br /><br />\\"Keep Coming Back\\" restores any lost momentum, finding Reinhart achieving sound grit.  \\"Keep Coming Back\\" works better than most cuts on Listen Up because it straddles pop and soul without committing to either direction. The refrain is simple, but both catchy and effective.  \\"Hit The Ground Runnin'\\" keeps the momentum high, finding Reinhart among her most sassy.  The first verse is restrained allowing Haley to breathe, but by the refrain the production grows to full fruition sporting an assortment of instrumental timbres.  Busbee's production truly makes \\"Hit The Ground Runnin'\\" a strong cut for Haley.  Closing cut \\"Walking on Heaven\\" (also produced by busbee) features a nice funky groove and clean, clear production.  Reinhart's lead is commanding and the harmonic progressions nothing short of clever.  \\"Walking on Heaven\\" never reaches the top echelon, but closes a solid debut, well solidly.<br /><br />Overall [[ASIN:B007L96SI6 Listen Up!]] Is a well executed debut.  As stated, some finesse issues are to be found along the way with development of the song. That said, there is nothing that comes off as incredibly clumsy or filler material on this thin ten-track affair.re is nothing that comes off as incredibly clumsy or filler material on this thin ten-track affair.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was my first clue/puzzle game.  I really enjoyed it.  Couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Rocked my newborn and played for a couple hours one evening.  Now my 7 year old is playing it.  He's enjoying it with little hints from me from time to time.  Great game for $0.99!
0345803485|5.0|I hadn't heard anything about these books until my friend who isn't a reader told me about them.  I decided to check them out, I read all 3 books on top of a full time job in a week.  I love them!!!  I had only read one other erotica trilogy, and I completely fell in love with the characters...it is deffinately Must read!!!!
1439152799|3.0|I have to admit out of all Kate Morton's book (the three of them). I have to choose this as my favorite.. The Distant Hours did not play off of other books..movies..plays etc. This story seems to be original to the author imagination.  However it was incredibly wordy and led the reader to believe the characters of the castle to each be off their rockers.  I never felt a connections with any of them. And Ms. Mortons style of writing of bouncing back and forth between so many different dates and characters leaves me dizzy just like her other books.  I enjoy a good mystery.. but The Distant Hours disappoints because the author leaves no bread crumbs for us to follow, but rather omissions of the story. We are left wondering when she will get back to where she abandoned us on the street corner waitng for the remainder of the tale.  Thats how I felt.. she would began another part of the \\"mystery\\" then scamper off to another \\"mystery\\" just telling us enough to think we were learning something new.  I think the characters of the book to be sad all of them.. so much coldness and dispair and lies and betrayals.. It was very hard to like Meredith and Edith was never really formed in my mind.. and of course the three sisters Percy was most unlikeable and Saffy was such a weak person and Juniper..bless her heart only wanted to be normal and no one would let the poor dear.. Also as with the other two books of Morton's.. they drink alot of tea. ALOT of tea.. so many tea breaks.. really I am a southern gal and we like out cold ice tea..but I dont deem it necessary to decribe every pot..mug..tea bag.. whew.. it got annoying fast.. maybe the next novel should incorporate coffee.. or lemonade.. or perhaps a water.. Regardless I still enjoyed parts of the book and may read it again..

B007J4T2G8|3.0|After reading long and overly long passages that were little more than a copy of email exchanges, my patience with the writer's style began to wane. What was initially witty dialogue, quickly turned into boring insecurity, making me want to slap Anastasia.<br /><br />Arriving at yet another page seemingly filled with more inconsequential, redundent, questioning dialogue filled with self doubt about the characters latest decision, the book abruptly ends.<br /><br />Talk about a sucker punch! Fork over another chunk of change to get more of the same. I have not yet purchased book two and I'm not sure I will.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|The three main problems with this film and the rest of the series are 1. it is an awful adaption of Batman in which the people in charge of these films obviously did not like the comic books and it is highly doubtful that they actually read the comic books 2. live action comic book films do not work because human beings and physics cannot perform actions that are depicted in the comic books, and 3. the animated films being released by DC Universe Animated Original Movies company make this Batman series and other live action films look very boring.<br />  I do not understand the praise for Christopher Nolan because he is not that good of a director for this series. He does not film shots correctly. Two examples of poor filming are when Bruce's parents are killed in the first film and when Two Face would flip his coin. During the murder of Bruce's parents, filming should have made the robber appear to tower over Bruce and use an upward angle aimed at the robber. The scene should have ended with Bruce kneeling in-between his dead parents looking down at the street. As Two Face flips his coin, the camera should have done a close up shot of the coin flying through the air and landing on Two Face's palm. None of these techniques were done. Also, this Batman series and the rest of the live action films do not film enough shots that mimic comic book story panels and comic book angles. The closest live action film to have down this is the Matrix and that has been almost 15 years ago.<br />  The adaptation of these films are horrible because it focuses way too much on the mob as villains. This in turn has caused writers to strip down very important Batman villains and produce villains who are no longer what was portrayed in the comic books. The writers also give far too much background on Batman and give way too little background information on the villains and their motives. This happened with Scarecrow, it is going to happen with Bane, and it is clear it will occur with future villains this series brings forth. Scarecrow should not have been some whipping boy and he should have been the main villain in the first film. Bane should be Latino, buff, very smart, and he would require a trilogy where each film is close to 3 hrs with non-stop action. These facts are clear to anyone who has actually read Batman but it is clear that a majority of this series' viewers have not read Batman. They do not realize that this series is not really Batman, but an evil mob series with characters who have the same names of characters from Batman who sometimes show some sort of physical characteristics of Batman characters. But this series is not Batman.<br />  Since this film is live action, it dramatically falls short of Batman's full potential. Human beings and natural physics do not allow the proper display of the Batman world. It then requires way too much computer generation that is very easy to spot and the use of way too much talking that slows down the story and produces a film that is way too long. I do not understand why film makers do not just computer generate the whole film and make it look as life like as possible. Then the action scenes and film shots could properly display what is depicted in the comic books.<br />  The only films that are currently giving DC characters their proper justice are the PG-13 animated films that are being released directly to DVD by the film company: DC Universe Animated Original Movies.What makes DC Universe Animated Original Movies so good is the fact that they are being made by true fans of comic books. Those film makers obviously have read more than ten issues of the comic books, and so they adapt the films that correctly follow the mythology from the comic books. What is then produced is a PG-13, 90 min animated film, and that film is non-stop action voiced by amazing voice actors who bring to life comic book characters who are ripped straight from the pages of a comic book. If people really want to see good Batman films, they need watch the films being released by DC Universe Animated Original Movies.

B00005K3O4|5.0|Are you in the mood for a different kind of horror movie?  How about a horror comedy?  Killer Klowns From Outer Space (1988) fits this description.  The plot?  Alien killer clowns arrive on Earth from outer space in a spaceship resembling a circus big top tent with the intention of feeding on humans.  The weapons the clowns use are in the form of traditional clown and circus-related items, such as popcorn and pies.  They put their victims into cotton candy cocoons.  These are simple concepts, yet so effective.  This is imagination at its best.  This movie is a horror movie that's on the lighter side and funny.  These clowns manage to be scary and funny at the same time.  This movie is a cult classic that has a sequel coming out in 3D in 2013.<br /><br />One of the strengths of the movie is the characters.  Not just the clowns, but really all of the characters.  The movie is never dull.  The clown costumes and makeup were done very well.  The smiles on the clowns' faces are classic.<br /><br />If you're looking for a breath of fresh air, then give this cult classic a try.  This is one of those movies that can be described as \\"it's so bad, it's good.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0000047CW|5.0|While the Getz/Gilberto collaboration has garnered the lion's share of fans of Bossa Nova/Samba, it's the pairing of Getz and Byrd that I turn to first when I want that soothing and joyous fusion of jazz and samba.<br /><br />Getz's tone is, as always, wonderful, but so too is the rhythm of his playing and that is due in no small part to the masterful playing of Byrd. The interplay brought out great moments from both musicians.<br /><br />This is music that creates a mood that is both relaxing and fun: It's often the first CD I turn to whenI go on holidays, especially to the Islands.<br /><br />As for individual tracks, Desafinado is stellar but the strength of the CD is that there are no weak tracks and that each offers a subtle variation of Bossa Nova/Samba.

I've always enjoyed The Ramones and I remembered liking what I thought was Joey Ramones final album [[ASIN:B00005V62X Don't Worry About Me]]which seemed to be released near his death and featured a very touching version of \\"a Wonderful World\\".  As far as this new album...I enjoyed it first listen as I was putting it into my itunes and have listened now three times. Joey's voice is in fine form and the songs and production are to my ears first class and while it holds together well as an album features nice variety.  I'd recommend it to his fans without any reservations. I imagine some hard core fans might think this is too pop and not punk enough...but I like both sides of his history.

B004SIP98S|1.0|This was not a story about the queen.  It was a story about the death of Diana with a view toward how Tony Blair and the Royal Family may have behaved when Diana died.  The acting of the part of Tony Blair was disappointing,  the actor playing himself, not Tony Blair, with a repeat performance of his personality as Frost in Nixon/Frost. It appeared to me as if there had been no research into the true personalities of the Queen or of Blair before the filming of the movie.  Neither portrayal was credible.
B0001I55SS|5.0|Those who complain about the shoddy science in The Black Hole are correct, but they miss the point. The Black Hole is from Disney Studios and it is the most beautiful science-fiction film ever made. The love and attention Disney Studios devoted to making this film stunningly gorgeous is immediately obvious to anyone who watches it and that beauty is really the point of The Black Hole. For sheer beauty, it is a Masterpiece that easily ranks among my top 10 and among the top 25 best sci-fi films of all time.<br /><br />If you must have scientific plausibility to enjoy science fiction films, forget it, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy a good story, well-acted, which is a visual masterpiece, don't miss The Black Hole. You may never again have the opportunity to see outer space and space ships so beautifully rendered.

I bought the beatss by Dre, and while I enjoyed the sound I felt like they were going to break. They did on the 2nd day again on the 2ND day.  I returned them and researched and bought the JVC xtream explosive's. I say they are a lttle less than the Dre's on sound but are far more beefy.  I hooked up the Fiio E6 to them via my Ipod Shuffle and I am blow away.  I danced in my living room for an hour straight and I am a 29 yr old man+Iraq Vet+Prison Gaurd.<br /><br />So put them in your drop buy and press proceed.

B000OYC3J8|1.0|Not since the Rolling Stones put out \\"Sucking in the 70's\\" has an album been so appropriately titled. \\"Thump\\" is a perfect description of Meg's drumming \\"style\\" (such as it is), and Jack's vocals, guitar, and songwriting are the epitome of \\"Icky\\". There's been some great rock and roll over the years made by marginally talented musicians (The Stooges, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and so many others), and there's been some great music put out by bands that were completely pretentious egomaniacs (Yes, Genesis, King Crimson), but combining pretentious egomania with marginal talent (ie: Jack White) or none at all (guess who?) just produces a blinding headache of a CD.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Just dont get what the fuss is all about.  The book is boring and predictable. The writing is bad - how many times did the author use the phrase \\"cocked his head\\".  It was a chore to get through the first book.  There are better erotic fiction books out there to enjoy.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I have it on my phone and my kindle fire I take my workouts everywhere even to work. I like the pace and the instruction.
0679409866|5.0|I was surprised by this one. Persuasion was the only work of Jane Austen's that I had not read in high school. I don't know why it took me until 32 years of age to decide to read it, but I finally did, and loved it so much! It is immediately familiar in the sense that you can sense it as a work of Austen's, but has some slight differences. Anne is less spunky & for some a less immediate heroine. There is certainly less dialogue between characters as compared to Austen's other works. I feel that these things represent maturity & sophistication in her writing that add much depth. I can now say that this is my favorite. I was instantly moved to tears at the crucial point of the story I was so touched and affected by Anne's journey of persuasion....I hope you are too.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Through out the whole book, it seemed as though Suzanne Collins was rushing to get to the end. Extremly uninteresting, boring, rushed book. I've read the first two books, and I have to say, they were amazing. But, Mockingjay was just, not like the other books, and I do not recommend to any Hunger Games fan. Read Harry Potter. You won't be disappointed.
0679405429|5.0|Love how beautifully published this edition is. It is still a favorite of mine, after all these years. I try to read it once a year or every other year, at the very least. Always find something new each time I revisit it. Thank you Jane Austen for paving the way for future female writers..........[[ASIN:B005GRF3QI Jane Austen: The Compete Works (Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Lady Susan & more!)]]
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Does a good job of protecting my Kindle, but has no provisions for storing/holding a pen. It's ability to stand alone is weak, but usable.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|Norah's voice is perfection, soothing & sensual, warm & expressive, yet restrained. I would describe this album as a very relaxing & quirky listen. A few of the songs I do not care for, but most of them I enjoy. My favorites are Turn Them and Life is Better. If you are a fan of Norah's than you will certainly like this one.
B007K3JCAE|1.0|I really like this movie. I thought it was smart, action packed and that the ending was terrific. However, I will not be purchasing this Blu-Ray due to the fact that a real digital copy will not be included. This is a movie that I would like to own, but I will not give in to Warner Bros. The worst part is that they will surely do the same thing for The Dark Knight Rises, so I will not own that movie either.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I gave it one star, but I really should not have given it any. This book is so poorly written and has it only basis is sex.  I will never buy the next 2 books.  The book does not have any plot, it is neither a love story, nor a thriller, nor a biography.  Maybe she wrote it becasue she has fantasies about the erotica in the book. I don't know, but the only reason I kept reading it was becausae i thought maybe it would get better and I would find a plot for the book. I didn't and I wasted my time. Shame on me, but I will not be buying another one.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|I am an old time Van Halen fan and have been a fan through both the Roth and Hagar eras.  I have to admit, I was skeptical, but what we have here is an incredible collection of songs.  I think of it as an apology for VH3, heh, heh.<br /><br />Really, start to finish, there's not a bad song on here.  I'm not a huge fan of Outta Space, and Roths little \\"rap\\" during \\"As Is\\" to me comes off out of place (I like everything else about the song), but other than that, outstanding effort and maybe even the bands best effort...ever.  It's that good.<br /><br />I'll skip the song by song commentary, you can get that from the collection of other reviews out here.  The music overall is way more than solid.  It's powerful and electric and recaptures that classic VH sound very well. Roth sounds good (on the CD at least) and the guys are tight and Wolfgang fills in very well for the missing Michael Anthony (backing vocals are actually very well done).<br /><br />The biggest gripe I have isn't with the CD, it's with the tour.  Out of 24 songs they perform, we only get 4 new songs???!!!  Are you kidding me?  This, to me, is exceedingly disappointing.  I mean, even on the VH3 tour they did more than that.  I do give them credit, mind you, for digging deep into thier catalogue to pull out some really obscure gems (Full Bug, Girl Gone Bad, Women in Love, ect...all AWSOME).<br /><br />However, if we are cutting out all the Hagar era stuff, you'd figure that'd leave plenty of room for new material.  You are promoting this CD correct?  This is the Different Kind or Truth tour, yes?  I mean, these are great, GREAT songs.  When I saw the setlist, I was very disappointed.  VH have always perfromed at least half of a new release, if not 80%, and now we get...4 new songs...out of 24 on the setlist?<br /><br />VH, please do us a favor and drop You Really Got Me and Pretty Woman, they've been done to death (especially YRGM) and they are not even VH originals anyway, they are covers.  Replace themwith Blood and Fire (it's a crime that song is not the closer) and something like Beats Workin' or Big River and replace Ice Cream Man with Stay Frosty (same style of song, give us the new offering).<br /><br />We've waited 28 years for new Roth and 17 years since the last Hagar VH CD (VH3 was not great), give us the new material.  Even with my suggestions, that's 7 songs out of 14 off the new CD and 7 new songs still leaves rooom for 17 \\"classics\\" on a 24 song setlist (and please, add in Me Wise Magic, it's a cryin' shame that song hasn't seen the light of day as well).<br /><br />Other than my tour/set list complaints, this is a solid outing that has rarely left my playlist and something that I workout to regularly...great, heavy, in your face, rock and roll from VH.<br /><br />12/19 - Update...disregard my previous negative comment about Outta Space...the song completely rocks!  Though my comments about the tour setlist still stand.  And they have since added Blood and Fire I believe, which is awesome.
B00449KUNA|3.0|I've been wanting this album for a very long time, so I finally just got it! I really love Peter Gabriels voice!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Ever since the series came out I've watched it every time it was on TV. I consider BoB one of the most superbly done semi-documentaries ever done. Certainly it was not a documentary, but the way it was shot and presented leaves no doubt that it was accurate. The producers paid meticulous attention to all the contributions of the remaining members of \\"Easy\\", and the result is a nearly perfect representation of WW2 through the eyes of the real players.I finally broke down and bought the DVD collection, and will enjoy watching all the added material.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is great. there are a few to many advertisements but that's what you get when you go free and it is easy to close them and play
B001C4CI8U|4.0|The first season of Fringe wasn't all together that great... I barely made it through the 2-hour pilot, but boy am I glad that I stuck it out for a little while. It takes a while for the show to get off the ground, but when it does it sure takes off running. By the end of Season 1 you'll learn to love Peter, Olivia, Walter, and Astroid errr... Astor, wait... what is her name?<br /><br />Seasons 2 & 3 are great enough to justify getting through season 1, even if you aren't sure  after the first few episodes
054537409X|5.0|The three book series and the movie are fairly similar. The characters are the same. The movie director does not take licence to rewrite the whole book with a new plot, different characters, changed scenery and altered situations.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|This sounds exactly like you would expect it to, She & Him singing Christmas songs. That being said, it is exactly perfect for what is expected and doesn't miss it's mark at all.
1469984202|5.0|This is easily the best sci-fi I have read for years.  Not the cheeriest book ever, but brilliant in every other way.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I'm not sure exactly what it was about this movie, but I was consistently laughing. Charlie Day steals the show and his sidekicks are perfect companions. All the bosses were so strangely weird and annoying that I wanted to kill them off as well. Throw in a well placed twist or two and great writing, you have yourself the best comedy out of a year of clunkers!
1600595871|4.0|I only have a few issues with this book. First, I am an architecture student looking for ideas for my portfolio, and this book, despite using all of the bookmaking terminology, is simply not geared specifically toward making professional looking books. A great portion of the book is filled with folding pamphlet type projects and other scrap book like \\"structures\\". For my use, I would rather see fewer but more detailed descriptions of ways to make a dozen or so solid professional looking books.<br /><br />Second, some of the directions are not clear. Fortunately, the few projects from the book I have chosen to do have been simple. I was able to get an idea about the details and directions which book was missing or didn't completely explain. For example I found the \\"Two-Sewn-As-One\\" instructions on page 100 to be unclear and the diagrams which went along to be of little help.<br /><br />One other small gripe- the author suggests PVA glue, also known as water based glue, for perfect binding which I doubt would hold up as well as contact adhesive cement.<br /><br />Still, the book did inspire a couple of projects which I am pleased with so I don't regret the purchase.
B003Y5H574|3.0|Honestly, this movie isn't that funny overall, but that might be because it's tuned for an older audience. Viewers the age of Steve Carell will love this movie, no doubt. But fans of Gosling might find it harder to stomach. Being that I am of the latter, I quickly got tired of the \\"Carell trying to be like Gosling\\" shtick and cared way more about Emma Stone and Gosling's relationship.<br /><br />Thankfully, the last 20-30 minutes of the film are amazing and made up for the rest of it, the scene in the backyard is so perfectly constructed.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|All the movies from the Original Cast of Star Trek.  Movies is great form, added scenes and a big suprise DVD with Whoopi Goldberg hosting William Shatner, Leonard Nemoy, Patrick Stewart and Jonathan Frakes.  All in one easy to store thin pack.
B007FRA8Z8|5.0|I've been a fan of Marina and the Diamonds for a while now, and I simply cannot get enough of this album! The wide variety of types of songs and beats keeps you captured from beginning to end! The story of Electra Heart (NOT Marina's alter-ego!!) is truly captivating, and I often find myself at the end of the album before I even know it! Glad Amazon made this album available before July because I CANNOT wait that long! Definitely recommend this album if you love her older stuff!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just finished reading book 1 \\"Hunger Games\\" and loved it.  I haven't seen the movie yet. I found myself believing that this world could exist. I really feet for and cared about the characters. I would think about them when not reading and wonder what would happen next. The book was a fast read and keep me coming back - I love that in a book.  And when I turned the last page, I said \\"Noooooo\\" because I wanted more. And since there are still 2 more books to go, I can have more.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|Most certainly worth 2$. It's fun and funny as well. I like seeing guys getting old lady hair and stuff. Keeps you very busy. Starts off easy enough and gets faster but not so much that you can't keep up and you get frustrated. Really fun game and well made!
B005LAIGNC|5.0|This movie has great characters, action, and emotion. After watching it, I literally stood up and held my hand to my heart. This is the best African American action picture and the best aerial dogfight movie. This is a very important story that everyone needs to know about. It looks and sounds spectacular on blu-ray. The extra features are superb. I just wish there were more of them. That's not because they're lacking but because I love the movie so much.
030716327X|5.0|Excellent book i recommend it to anyone with a baby. Children will respond to this book. Its fun and entertaining
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I almost stopped reading this book at 60% but I kept thinking it would get better so I finished it. I don't understand the high star rating for this book. How can you make a love story and \\"happy ending\\" out of a jealous, violent, obsessive Travis and an inexperienced 19 year old girl? It doesn't make sense. Abby moving to another state and filing for a restraining order would have made more sense.  I work with teenagers and I would never want them to think this is an ok relationship.  I know it is just a book but it is disturbing and unbelievable to assume that they are going to be \\"happy ever after\\".
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The perfect app. It does exactly what you want it to, and a few more things you didn't know you wanted, and its super easy to use and set up
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Seems like the author just sort of threw this together to wrap things up. No further character enhancements. the entire war adn attack on the capital just seemed gratuitous and completely disjointed from the action in the other books.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|well it is great but it as a lot of adds that cover the screen while ur playing ur game.plus the game is a little boring because there is only little cheap games.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is absolutely fabulous! Written from a young college grad's perspective, James makes the reader really connect to the characters. Though most people focus on the sexy details, the beautiful fairy tale-esque story of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele captivate the reader and make you wish you had a fantasy romance like the characters. This page turner certainly leave you wanting more! I'm on book two of the trilogy, I would HIGHLY recommend this to any woman!!
1401223176|5.0|I've bought this book so i can get to know the character Hush, and you know what, this is the best damn book ive ever read, i thank jeph loeb for making another great story, it involves so much with the villains in the rogues gallery and of course the newcomer hush, the artwork is amazing and throughout the story, the relationship between batman and catwoman grew a lot more, and certain twist that made the story a lot crazier, its totally worth the buy and would make a great collection on your shelf.

B005CGI4EG|5.0|Married With Children is a satirical look at everyday life in America. The show is for anybody from anywhere that has ever been married, or had dreams of success, either in their family life, or in the business world. I don't ever expect to see a funnier look at the Great American Dream.
B0083GPDBO|1.0|Sorry. Can't give any documentary style movie a good rating. I wish there was a warning on films like this. I get easily nauseated watching these types of films and did not make it through 30 minutes. My wife watched a bit longer but does not care for this style of movie, either. Her complaint is that it's hard to get \\"mentally lost\\" when watching a movie that looks like a home video. Just be warned if you are like me, and don't care for a documentary/home video style of movie.
B000002KZ6|4.0|When Talking Heads released \\"Speaking in Tongues,\\" that album followed the groove-heavy direction of its predecessors \\"Fear of Music\\" and \\"Remain in Light,\\" but took the dark, frantic music from the earlier album in a lighter, frothier direction.  Moreover, without Brian Eno's influence, the band stared drifting toward more pop-sounding songs and less intriguing subject matter.<br /><br />When I listen now to \\"Speaking in Tongues,\\" I feel that the band emphasis (or lead head Byrne anyway) also had shifted its emphasis from sound to visuals, from the music to the show, so that the visual aspect of what a performance of these songs would look like became more important than how the music sounded.<br /><br />That change in direction ultimately undermined the band, but the halo effect from the earlier two recordings was still strong enough so that \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" was a jaunty celebration, a churning, funky m&eacute;lange brimming with riffs, fills, percussion, and effects that worked well in this new context.<br /><br />\\"Stop Making Sense\\" followed, and that album was truly a soundtrack documenting the stage spectacle from the band's 1983-1984 tours. It was about the visuals, the stage show, the physical arrangement of musicians and Byrne's bit suit days. (I saw the band twice during this time, and the staging was unique and creative for its time.)<br /><br />But because of this change in emphasis, the music itself on to \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" suffers just a bit, and what were once muscular grooves and bizarre instrumental renderings were being transitioned to serve the melody and spectacle. Still, this was the last great Talking Heads' album (again, \\"Stop Making Sense\\" is a fine recording but it pales beside the video of the concert) before the band lost its direction on \\"Little Creatures\\" and \\"Naked.\\"

B006AX6ONI|5.0|Relatively quick read, I could not put it down though.  I really enjoyed all of his insights.  Well worth the value.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I feel if you already have seen the show or haven't yet and wish to, then you should pick up a copy because it'll help fill in those gaps or answer questions that the show hasn't yet. It surely helped make sense as to HOW everything played out; where as in the show they kind of went a different route that from what I've read in articles and seen on the preview for the new season, they are going back to the comic series story line.
0439023513|5.0|As the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy, Mockingjay did not dissapoint.  It was, however, full of surprises both good and bad.  I'm not going to spoil it, but a lot happens.  Just when you think everything is alright, another casostrophe occurs.  Because the novel was so fast paced I couldn't put it down, which is something I loved about it.  Collins introduces a lot of new characters, both major and minor.  Plus, the setting for this novel is entirely different; most of the events happen in District 13 or in the Capital.  I'm happy to report that the ending is happily ever after... well for the most part.  Mockingjay is action packed and keeps you guessing the whole time through.  Although, I didn't like every part (there were a lot of deaths) the overall novel was well written.  I would reccomend the series to just about anyone because it provides action, romance, and a great story line.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This is a must have for your iphone/ipad/kindle.  I use this book along with a few others on my iphone to read, reflect on and think about whenever I find myself having random few minutes of free time throughout the day (waiting for appointment, during meals, etc).  Mark Cuban gives very honest and genuine advice and tells great stories about his past and experiences that highlight those lessons.  If your a fan of Mark Cuban and real 'self-made' stories, invest the few dollars and get this book.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|this game will keep you entertained when you have some free time. I like the fact it keeps me intertained whether I'm waiting in line or at home relaxing.
0385512058|5.0|I recommend this book to any recent highschool or college graduates.  I'm a big advocate of \\"your network is worth more than your networth\\" and this book is a primer for building lifelong relationships in business and life.<br /><br />This book is not about sleezy real estate agent networking or about shotgunning your business cards with both hands at 'networking mixers or conventions'.  This book is about building and maintaining real relationships.<br /><br />Great advice and ideas to implement into your own lifestyle - like dinner parties.  If you want to throw the best dinner parties in your town, the chapter in this book is perhaps the best resource and step-by-step gameplan on doing so!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|SPOILER ALERTS!<br /><br />The other negative reviews sum up most of what is awful about this book. By the end of the first chapter, I was rolling my eyes (brilliant, successful, gorgeous, aloof, jet-setting billionaire falls instantly in love/lust with unkempt, mousy, awkward, plain, sheltered college girl... HUH?). She finds him instantly attractive (OK... and?), he stalks her, shows minor interest, suddenly throws himself on her in an elevator, she's conflicted with insecurity, he shows her his dom/sub playroom, she decides that while she's never had sex or even touched herself (cough, please) that she's suddenly ready to rip her clothes off and be pounded into submission, well, maybe not, oh yes, please, oh no, he's so weird, oh yes, please do it again...<br /><br />Add in the most hideously repititious phrases and words (I swear I counted \\"flush\\" and \\"blush\\" about ten times on one page) for a dash of additional irritation.<br /><br />There is nothing remotely attractive about Ana, aside from her appearance (which is never described in detail, while we have a description of \\"Adonis-like\\" Christian over and over.. and over). She's not funny, she's not alluring, she's not flirty, she's not mysterious. She's boring. Utterly. Which only makes Christian's instant infatuation with her all the more childishly unrealistic. At least Bella (Twilight) was smart, witty, and endearing.<br /><br />And on the \\"Twilight\\" note, while it's painfully obvious that this is practically fan fiction (and it's no secret that the author was inspired by \\"Twilight\\"), there are some scenes and phrases virtually copied from \\"Twilight\\". Compare the scenes where Christian/Edward says \\"I can't stay away from you anymore\\" to Ana/Bella, and she responds with \\"Then don't\\". The \\"rescue\\" scenes where Ana gets in trouble at the bar, and Bella gets in trouble out walking alone. Ugh. I can't go on.<br /><br />The sex scenes are laughable. The untouched virgin (naturally) combusts with multiple orgasmsat the slightest touches and kisses from this guy. He's this uber-experienced dominant, yet he falls apart into a fluffy, needy puppy (thinly disguised by his SM habits) within a few rounds of sex with her. Apparently the dozen or so women he had long-term dom/sub relationships with before hold nothing to the bland, bookish Ana. Her sheltered, conservative lifestyle flies out the window, and I'm left wondering why she bothered \\"waiting\\" until 21 to start all this, if she lets go of it all so easily? Oh wait, I know... it makes a better story... or so the author incorrectly thinks.<br /><br />I can't talk about it anymore. Even complaining about it is a waste of time. Unless it spares one poor soul from having to suffer through this experience. Then my agony may have been worthwhile! SAVE YOURSELVES.<br /><br />I'm just glad that I borrowed this book from someone, and didn't waste any money on it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this and wanted to throw it across the room. It's just ridiculous.  What sane woman wouldn't run away from this man when he first introduced these things?  The whole premise of this book is that this man gets to abuse women because he's in a powerful position.  Poorly written book supporting domestic violence.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of my favorite books. I love it.  Katniss is a great heroine. She is tough and smart and has determination in the face of impossible odds. And not only that, but she is loyal. She is truly a wonderful character. Although the plot is a bit brutal in some places, making it perhaps not the best bed time story for young kids (as a matter of fact I wouldn't suggest it for anyone under 12 yrs old), it is filled full of action and the utter desperation Katniss and Peeta face in trying to survive the Hunger Games. The story is a little like The Running Man, but with teenagers instead.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book, but I don't recommend the audio book. I bought that too and I can't stand the narrator's voice.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I am sad to say that this book was a bit of a struggle for me.  After I finished the first book, I was crazed and absolutely dying to find out what happens next.  I was a bit disappointed at the direction this book took.<br /><br />I have such a love/hate relationship going on with Anna.  Just when I think she has become so whinny I think I might actually take her over MY knee, she does something so empowering I just want to applaud her. (i.e. the confrontation with Mrs. Robinson at Christian's Birthday party)  James tried her best to give us a little bit of action in the book, but it seemed to me like she either wasn't fully committed to it or just didn't care about those parts as much as she did the sex parts.  I feel like she missed a number of opportunities to give us a little more action outside the bedroom that just fizzled out and had me wondering why she even put those parts in there in the first place.  Example: The whole Psycho Ex-Sub situation.  It was the main plot sequence to this book and when it finally got to the confrontation, it just kind of burned out.  This was also the case with the helicopter crash at the end of the book.  My first thought was `OMG he's going to have amnesia and not remember anything' and then Christian's all `Oh it's no big deal.  We crashed and then hitched a ride with a trucker.  You can all go home.'  FRUSTRATING!!!<br /><br />On the plus though.......I LOVE the ending of this book!!  When she throws that drink her Mrs. Robinson's face and then Christian's mom slaps her- WOW.  I have always wanted to do that and I really enjoyed Mrs. R being put in her place.  The only other part of this book that I really enjoyed was when it was finally over.  Don't get me wrong, I love them.  I'm happy they are working through their difficulties and I'm really excited that he finally told her why he's all `Fifty Shades of F*&^ked up'...... but Anna is just so annoying and obsessive about Christian's relationship with Mrs. Robinson that Ijust can't put up with her.<br /><br /> After I made my way through this one, I had no intention in reading the third......however the girls I work with told me that book 3 was better so I guess I'm going to power through.  I can only hope that the last book isn't as 'Vanilla' as this one was.
1250006341|5.0|This is a lovely book at an amazing price. It is a must-have for fans of Downton Abbey. This is a high-quality book filled with photos and information about the series as well as life during the early 1900s. I bought it for a gift and I would definitely recommend it as a wonderful companion to the dvds.
B007RXC3A8|4.0|Sonata Arctica will probably always hold on to their \\"power metal\\" classification, but their work has become more distinctive with each passing album and harder to lump together with more traditional power metal like Helloween or Blind Guardian. Their first albums (we'll call that era Phase I) gave metal fans a generous amount of satisfying tracks in that classic style, but hints of their future experimentation were always there. With Unia, the band made a sudden shift to their progressive era (we'll call it Phase II). Unia itself was a little rough, though not without some good stuff. The next album, The Days of Grays, was a large improvement and showed that the band's experimenting was yielding really interesting, satisfying results. At this point, you don't really know what you're going to get when you start listening to one of these albums, and there's definitely something exciting about that.<br /><br />In an album with a lot of experimenting, most of it succeeds and some of it doesn't. \\"Cinderblox\\" is a genre-busting masterpiece, combining country and metal to glorious effect. It's almost unthinkable that this could actually work but the final product speaks for itself. Who knew a banjo could synch up so well with double-bass drumming and keyboard solos? The funniest part is that aside from that banjo, this is the song on the album that comes closest to a classic Sonata track - the kind of song fans always say they miss. We're unlikely to get another \\"Wolf and Raven\\" or even another \\"Flag in the Ground,\\" those songs are already written. But if the band can still provide that same kind of thrill with an ingenious twist like this, I'll keep buying Sonata albums for decades.<br /><br />Other highlights include the goofy fun of \\"****load of Money,\\" a wacky combination of hair metal, Broadway theatricality and some of Queen's more flamboyant songs, the beautiful tearjerker \\"The Day,\\" the satisfyingly heavy \\"Somewhere Close to You\\" and \\"Wildfire,\\" parts II and III.These two tracks are complex, eight-minute prog monsters that continue the story of the unstable outcast that began in an excellent track on the Reckoning Night album. Both of these songs are such powerful storytelling that it not only invites comparison to the original \\"Wildfire\\" but also Sonata's ultimate masterpiece, \\"White Pearl, Black Oceans.\\" They blend everything that has been great about both Phase I and Phase II Sonata and I suspect the fans will love them. The story details, however, can get foggy. How exactly did we go from the angry pyromaniac of Part I to the bizarre environmental message whispered at the end of Part III?<br /><br />\\"Only the Broken Hearts (Make You Beautiful),\\" the first song, is not the most impressive opener. It starts off well enough, with a simple but memorable riff driving the intro. However, by the second verse the song has already been smothered by seemingly endless layers of harmonized vocals. \\"Don't Be Mean\\" is the kind of overwrought ballad about love gone wrong that the band can't get enough of. Musically, it's very pretty but the title and lyrics are a clear reminder that English isn't the band's first language. Hearing a grown man use the phrase \\"don't be mean to me\\" with such sincerity is a little cringe-inducing. As for the single, \\"I Have A Right,\\" it's not bad but it's as close to a straightforward pop song as the band's ever gotten. Fans of more aggressive sounding metal may be put off.<br /><br />Stones Grow Her Name is a strong album that the band can be proud of. I don't love every track, but the majority of them are great and even the lesser ones are still pleasant listens. As long as fans can accept that the straight power metal days of Sonata are long gone, this album will deliver.

B000EGDB10|3.0|Although it absolutely reeks of '90s blockbuster cliches, a confident performance from Tom Cruise and two or three truly great action sets ultimately save the first M:I from the dregs of mediocrity. The plot is a bit too twisty-turny for its own good, with perhaps ninety percent of the cast switching allegiances at least once before it's through, but that's kind of its thing and I can write off a few eccentricities in the name of identity. Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are wasted as generic lackeys, though, and the vital makeup effects aren't nearly as good as I had remembered. The magic of watching a guy rip off a faceful of fake skin is sort of lost when I can immediately identify who's wearing it as soon as they step on-screen. Though campy at times, it's still worth a watch for the perfect, trendsetting blend of action and suspense it brings to several key moments.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|I enjoyed CHRONICLE very much.  The story was very realistic when you consider that teenagers would probably do some of the pranks that were done in the movie if they suddenly had \\"super powers.\\"  It's not likely that they would use this power to fight crime like Spider- man.<br />They 3 main characters were very believeable in their roles.<br />The reason why the alien creature wasn't explained is because there's going to be a sequel!<br />This film was very well made when you consider the low budget that the film makers had to deal with.  Considering the amount of money that was made at the box office, the sequel should have even better special effects; I only hope that the story will be as interesting.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|This CD gives me hope for the future of rock music. It's incredibly thrilling to hear a band that produces such strong, fresh, and interesting melodies and vocals that are as good as anything rock has produced since the 60s. The lyrics are perfectly fine, but the melodies and song structures are so strong that they seem to call for equally strong lyrics, and so by contrast they seem a little disappointing. What really makes this CD so compelling for me is the enthusiasm and energy they project and the singing, which is startling in its soaring range. The first time I heard We Are Young, it was almost as exciting as the first time I heard the Kink's You Really Got Me in 1964 (and to be clear, the musical sophistication here is leagues beyond the Kinks). My one complaint about the CD is the production, which is heavy handed and full of the usual heavily processed computerized noises, particularly in the bass and drums. For most of the music being made these days, this kind of heavy production is necessary, because there's no real melody to speak of, and singers, when they sing at all, are extremely weak. But this music doesn't need any props or cosmetics, and the production in this case actually gets in the way of the music. Next time, they need a producer who recognizes great songwriting and singing and who understands that production is supposed to bring out and support those things. But don't let that stop you from buying this. It is the freshest, best thing I've heard in many years, and the songs are completely stuck in my head, as they will be in yours.
0061692042|5.0|Every review of Canada is going to begin the same way, with the stunning opening sentences of the novel.  \\"First I'll tell you about the robbery our parents committed.  Then about the murders, which happened later.  The robbery is the more important part, since it served to set my and my sister's lives on the courses they eventually followed.\\"<br /><br />That's a bit more sensational than the average start of a serious literary work, but it telegraphs so much of what is to come.  In fact, I'll give you a run-down of what those opening sentences illustrate:<br /><br />* This novel is told from the point of view of a first-person narrator who speaks with a simple, clear voice.<br />* Despite the author's Pulitzer Prize-winning pedigree, this is a plot-driven novel bordering on a literary thriller.<br />* This is a coming-of-age tale.<br />* This novel is being told in reflection from some point in the future.<br /><br />That's a fair amount of info to glean from three sentences!<br /><br />The novel's narrator is 15-year-old Dell Parsons, one half of a set of fraternal twins.  The other half is his sister, Berner, older by six minutes and always the more worldly of the two.  The novel opens in the summer of 1960, and the family of four (with father, Bev and mother, Neeva) is living in Great Falls, Montana.  The kids have had a fairly rootless upbringing, due to Bev's Air Force career and a lack of extended family connections.<br /><br />Dell relates the family history, beginning with his parents' courtship and ill-advised marriage.  \\"...they were no doubt simply wrong for each other and should never have married or done any of it, should've gone their separate ways after their first passionate encounter, no matter its outcome.  The longer they stayed on, and the better they knew each other, the better she at least could see their mistake, and the more misguided their lives became as time went on--like a long proof in mathematics in which the first calculation is wrong, following which all other calculations move you further away from how things were when they made sense.\\"<br /><br />It's the older Dell, nearing retirement, that can look back on his past and family history and see things so clearly.  His story is told in a combination of his older and younger voices.  Nonetheless, given the above, it's no surprise he describes his family as \\"doomed.\\"  Bev doesn't adjust well to life outside the military, and a series of poor decisions leads the family, and particularly the teens, into dire and life-altering circumstances.<br /><br />Like all novels being told in reflection, this one features quite a bit of foreshadowing--again, you can see it in those opening sentences.  This continues throughout the novel, and there's a reason that foreshadowing is one of the most commonly used literary devices.  Because it's so darn effective!  Rather than diffusing the novel's tension, it ratchets it up, and it definitely keeps readers turning pages.  It's amazing how powerful a simple \\"I never saw her again\\" or \\"given how her life turned out\\" can be, and when the foreshadowing is of a crime, even more so.<br /><br />Despite the novel's page-turning plot, characters are given equal attention.  This is obvious early on as Dell describes his father, \\"He was a non-stop talker, was open-minded for a southerner, had graceful obliging manners that should've taken him far in the Air Force, but didn't.  His quick hazel eyes would search around any room he was in, finding someone to pay attention to him--my sister and me, ordinarily.  He told corny jokes in a southern theatrical style, could do card tricks and magic tricks, could detach his thumb and replace it, make a handkerchief disappear and come back.  He could play boogie-woogie piano, and sometimes would `talk Dixie' to us and sometimes like Amos `n' Andy.  He had lost some of his hearing by flying the Mitchells, and was sensitive about it.  But he looked sharp in his `honest' GI haircut and blue captain's tunic and generally conveyed a warmth that was genuine and made my twin sister and me love him.\\"  That's only a small part of Dell's recollection of Bev.  Could I describe my own father so well?  I doubt it.  Even relatively minor characters have a feel of completeness about them, leaving me with linger questions about them long after they'd come and gone.  How much did Mildred really know about her brother's life?  Did Florence see Dell again?<br /><br />The novel's prose is not ornate, but it's beautifully crafted.  Ford expertly paints the time and places in which the novel is set.  Clearly, I could go on quoting from and discussing this novel indefinitely, but better you should make these discoveries on your own.  Near the novel's end, Dell states, \\"There's little else to say.  I have that as my satisfaction.\\"  And by the time you reach this astonishing work's end, you'll have yours as well.e captain's tunic and generally conveyed a warmth that was genuine and made my twin sister and me love him.\\"  That's only a small part of Dell's recollection of Bev.

B0030BCCB6|5.0|Every journey begins with the first step...so they say...and any journey into Fleetwood Mac's music should begin with this set. Their first 3 albums. I love playing songs from this period of the Mac's career as many people still aren't aware they got their start as a blues band. British blues at it's best. Peter Green's incredible guitar, Jeremy Spencer's spot on Elmore James covers, and a song with  Eddie Boyd  thrown in too.You get their smash \\"albatross\\",and \\"black magic woman\\", both singles in the UK. Also, the first songs featuring Danny Kirwan are here too. Now pick up \\"blues jam in chicago\\", and \\"original Fleetwood Mac\\", and you'll have the blues side of the Mac pretty much covered.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is now required for my Senior level economics course in California.  I had created a piecemeal presentation cobbling together the impetus for the current economic crisis in the United States.  This video does everything my presentation does and more.  It should be required viewing for every American.  You can't argue with the facts about who was appointed for what and who did what (especially the appointments).  A democracy must be participated in and watching this movie lights a fire in my students to seek knowledge understanding and solutions.  Kudos to the creators of this documentary.

B007H9B6KA|2.0|Well, I must start by saying I've always been a huge fan, since the debut album. That being said, when I first listened to this, I did not like it at all. After a couple of weeks, some of the songs grew on me. Now, after a couple of months, I can say that this album should not have been released just yet, It needed to be polished further. There's something intangible missing here. It has 90%, but lacks the other 10% which makes their sound really special. Imagine that you like a certain flavor of pizza, then they just remove the salt from it. That's exactly how this album feels for me, and it pains me to say that.

1587613379|1.0|I bought this book from Amazon and received it today.  I immediately cracked it open and ended up reading it cover to cover in one sitting.  I kept reading hoping I would come to the part that prompted 29 Amazon reviewers to give it 4 or 5 stars. Or the part that supported editorial reviews of \\"definitive guide\\", \\"absolute masterpiece\\", \\"a must-read\\".  That moment never happened.<br /><br />This is a simple book that has obviously helped enlighten a number of readers. If, however, you've done any reading on feminist thought, artful negotiation, fair fighting or sexuality your reading time is probably better spent on more in-depth, complex material.
0765365278|4.0|Be patient! This book starts a little slow, but it gets much better!  Definitely an exciting beginning to what promises to be an epic series.<br /><br />I say be patient because, for me at least, the book starts out a little dense.  Chapter after chapter spent describing this world.  And for me, even after all of that description, I still struggled to figure out exactly how this world works.  Not until later, when characters were more naturally interacting with the environment, did I understand the full context of this rock-based land.<br /><br />But once you get past all of that, the book really is phenomenal.  Kaladin is a complex and righteous character who has a natural instinct lead.  Sanderson makes you feel like you have really have watched this person grow from nothing to something. From slave to champion to hero and all of the rises and falls in between.  Some pieces of the cannon are pretty cheesy, but lets be honest: its fantasy, that stuff makes us feel good.<br /><br />I wasn't crazy about Shallan's story arc, which is a bummer because usually Sanderson does really well with female characters.  Her story was drawn out and a little ridiculous, but the ending provides at least some promise.<br /><br />Dalinar and his family are easy to get behind if not stubborn and boneheaded.  Im not a huge fan of the Shardplate and all that Halo 3 stuff.  Doesn't do a lot for me, but the characters themselves are very interesting.<br /><br />And while it may seem like I have a lot of complaints, the fact that I am even writing this review should tell you that I enjoyed the heck out of reading this book.  As I have for all of Sanderson's novel's, sans one or two.  I will definitely read the next book, although I hope it it significantly lighter.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|it freezes  up everything.  Keyboard.... freeze up.  Loading up....... freeze up.  Heck it completly screwed up my apps including google play store.  my tablet barely works now thanks to this lousy browser.

I had a an earlier pair of Terra Fis  which saw plenty of action Hiking, Kayaking, and during everyday casual wear, but they had a BLOW OUT and died.<br />My only issue with these is that I'd like to see them in OD, Khaki or Brown instead of black.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book. I recommended to my friends. I had considered buying it in the grocery store, but did not since I would rather get it for a better price on my Kindle. Then I saw an interview with a different author, Nicholas Sparks, who I like. He said the most recent book he read was Defending Jacob. He liked it. In my mind, I said, \\"SOLD\\"! His recommendation was enough for me. The book did not disappoint.
B007JM4CWY|2.0|I have the same problem as a few other people. Once I  closed this subpar game it wouldn't reopen. Now maybe there's an easy solution that I overlooked but after playing the game for a few minutes quite frankly I don't care. Uninstalled.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Jojo Moyes is not a favorite of mine but this book is an exception! What a lovely wholesome story and an easy read! I thoroughly enjoyed it as did the friends that I passed it onto.The hero of the story is a paraplegic cut down in the prime of life in a freak accident. The heroine is a zany misfit employed as a companion for him. Their worlds would never have crossed  previously. It is basically a story of an unusual friendship based on mutual respect and liking.The  humor is poignant and at times the emotions are raw and painful. There is no holding back the tears at the outcome but a complete sense of peace that it was the RIGHT ending. Despite that,it is NOT a chic flick type of a book as many men will identify with the hero and his thoughts and feelings and his decision on how to live out his life.<br />I didn't buy this on kindle.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could not stand this book and I really, really tried to read it.  I felt the characters had no depth.  I had no connection with them, no belief in them.<br /><br />I am an avid reader, female, age 56 years old.  I've read the classics - Romeo and Juliet, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, etc.<br /><br />This so called \\"book\\" was elementary at best.  I've read Stephenie Meyer, Nora Roberts, Jude Deveraux, Nancy Thayer, and newbies like Amanda Hocking and Kristie Cook.<br /><br />I could not tolerate than Ana was such a weakling to be \\"dominated\\" by the wealthy, 50 shades of moody Christian.  This is the typical bad, damaged \\"boy\\" being rescued by the stupid, naive, caregiver \\"girl.\\"  For all the women out there who try to rescue \\"damaged\\" bad boys, this may resonate with them, but it is insulting for any intelligent, balanced women who have a strong self-image.<br /><br />How stupid are women to fall for this crapola?<br /><br />Save your money and rebel against mediocre writing and unbelievable characters.
0345803485|5.0|I must admit I dont do this often but I had to when reading  some of these. I am a advid reader Of books and fan fiction. I have read pretty much everything the author has written on Fanfiction, she is good and I have read the story for this book on fan fiction and loved it. So I picked of the three books and read them in 2 days. People what is your problem with these books? Yeah its smutm, fantasy, and it takes the reade rto a place we all wish we could go to at some point in our fantasys this women just had the courage to put it in print. So to each his own apinion I look forward to more books from this author. To those who don't like it or didnt finsh well being a prude is not a nice way to live but to each his own.

6303471714|5.0|I have owned and used this video since it came out in '92. I own a decent fitness video library. Cindy's SHAPE YOUR BODY Workout is my absolute favorite.  I always come back to it, especially if I've taken time off and gotten out of shape a bit. This video has the fastest results for stamina building, strength building, and even cardio.  It is not a jump around twist an ankle video.  The exercises are smooth, controlled, and precise but done at a fast enough pace that you'll be sweating and loving it all the same. The exercises can be altered to your fitness level, you can certainly vamp up the intensity by adding weights, she uses 5 lbs ..I use 10 to 15lbs. Keep water close by...yep you're encouraged to drink your H2O!! Love this video, I hope that you will also, absolutely a fantastic video for all people at all stages in their fitness journey. Happy day and happy sweating!!

B004MGMJ3E|1.0|this album does not sound any different from its first chords to its last. not a single defining moment or remotely interesting diversion of tactic. Pitchfork clearly is submissive to the artist. That's too bad.

0345803493|2.0|I don't even know where to begin. These books are a stylistic nightmare, the execution is terrible and the sex scenes are boring. At first they turned me on ever so slightly, but then they got annoying and eventually they just made me angry. If you know about BDSM and have experience with it then that is not a good enough reason to read this blasted book, that's the mistake I made, I was expecting more and what I received was just not up to my standards. Now granted I realize that the author had to do most of her research on the internet to write those parts and I'm sure she didn't want to scare too many people away as I'm sure most people are not as screwed up in the head as I am. As others have mentioned the repetitiveness is just terrible. Besides the repetitiveness it seemed like the writing was awkward in another major way, she seemed to attempt to compensate for the repetitiveness, it seemed like she was trying to show that her vocabulary was not as limited as the over 300 uses of murmur in these first two books might have you believe. I'm not sure if it's because she's British or because she just consulted with a thesaurus, but some of the vocabulary is awkward and just unnecessary.<br /><br />Yet somehow I cannot stop reading these books and I do plan to read Book 3 (and skip over all the sex). This book is like a drug, you know it's absolutely horrible for you but you just don't wish to put it down. I really can't say anything good about this book except that it's addicting and I have absolutely no idea as to why!<br /><br />Christians attempts to go away from his dominant side just seem unrealistic to me, I am naturally submissive and am trying to be in a relationship with someone who is about as vanilla as they get. While Christian was straying away from his dominant side I was straying towards my submissive side, oddly enough this book did make me realize that I will never be happy in a vanilla relationship and I have resigned myself to the fact that I will eventually need to end my current attempt. So at that part I was shaking my head because, at least to me, it seems to unrealistic to suppress this need, it's not a want, it really is a need.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first began reading this book it seemed a little dull so I put it down.  I later decided I would start over and really read it.  I actually began reading some of the more (enticing chapters)  to my husband and we both started looking forward to the next chapter.  It is just plain fun and any book  that makes you laugh or puts a spark back into your marriage has to be great!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book, along with \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" and \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\"  is awesome!  The series is one of the best I have ever read.  I am an avid reader and I do not typically read this type of book.  But the way it's written draws you in.  You learn to love the characters and you really want to know what happens next.  It turns out to be a great story with a surprise ending that I never would have suspected during the first book.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who is an avid reader of all types of books.  It is extremely shocking and entertaining. And yes, there is a story!! It is NOT all about sex.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This series is so addictive...I can't put it down...the character development is amazing.  I feel like I'm part of the story when I'm reading...like I'm actually there...an awesome book
0525478817|5.0|\\"You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice.\\"<br /><br />Did you know that there are, chemically speaking, two different stages of love? The first stage, the one where you're falling and all dopey and basically unable to function because you can't think of anything but that other person is the result of a chemical cocktail of adrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin pouring through your brain. The second stage, the one where you're committed and stay together potentially for life is because of two other chemicals, vasopressin and oxytocin. These are the ones that really bond you together, but the fact is, once you're getting the vasopressin and oxytocin, you don't get so much of the adrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. And that, my friends, is probably the biggest reason that I (and quite probably you) love to read about falling in love. It gives me a bit of those chemicals (and feelings) back. That's why after reading a book I love, I often can't sleep, and I usually have a lot of energy. And I love it!<br /><br />But here's the thing. Reading can also make you feel not-so-good feelings that you don't like and want to avoid like the plague. That, my friends, is why I did not really want to read The Fault in Our Stars. I drug my feet...a lot. Even while reading. A book that could have easily been read in one sitting, I read a third of, put down for two days, then read chapter by chapter for some time, getting up and doing something else constantly to try to keep myself from getting too involved. This behavior continued for about 2/3 of the book. I knew what was coming, and I dreaded it. I kind of Monnicad this book. I didn't want to get hurt, so I pushed it away, but it hurt anyway. But it also felt pretty good, falling in love with Augustus Waters.<br /><br />This book doesn't really need another review at this point. Many/most of you have already read it, and to my knowledge, everyone's loved it, so it seems silly to go on and on, and yet I'm not sure I can resist fawning a little. So here it goes:<br /><br />I love Augustus. I love that he pushes this perfect boundary between being pushy and just plain attentive. I love that he doesn't try to kiss Hazel, or call her too much, and I love that he reads her favorite book first thing, and really thinks about it.<br /><br />I love that Hazel has a hard time standing much, and Augustus has a hard time sitting. Something about that whispers \\"star-crossed lovers\\" in your ear and breaks your heart.<br /><br />I love that Hazel and Augustus both have wonderful families. Families who care about them and support them, and even hover a little, but the kids don't resent them for it. They love them for it. There need to be more families like this in books (and maybe in real life).<br /><br />I love that this book manages to include poetry that wasn't at all cheesy, and did not once make me gag.<br /><br />I love that this book made me laugh a lot more than it made me cry. I agree with Hazel and Augustus (and with Mr. John Green), you have a choice how to tell sad stories, and the funny choice? That's the best one.<br /><br />And I like my choices.silly to go on and on, and yet I'm not sure I can resist fawning a little. So here it goes:<br /><br />I love Augustus.

0756407125|3.0|This is the second book, the second day in the story of Kvothe. The first book I thought was great, but this was 4000 ereader pages at the font size I like to ready at.<br /><br />That made the book seem to become long, and I began to wonder where it was going.<br /><br />Often the second book of a trilogy is the one that lags. Well we haven't had the third book, the resolution, yet, but this book did indeed lag. Those 4000 pages, way too any were stuck on developing, and developing, and developing our hero. Far too many were spent on long sequences to set up the one line legendary things that Rothfuss has ceded in the first work, or added here in the second.<br /><br />It is like playing one of the old RPG computer games, and there were side quests. Let's take and do everyone. It may not be important to the tale, but for the price of admission, you deserve to know about everything.<br /><br />Yes, the first book became a big seller, and so price to word performance, we do get our monies worth. I just don't know if I really see any growth in Kvothe as a person or any real progress made in the true quest he is on. Additionaly the background noise of the present day part of the story (most is told as flashback, reminiscence) is something that seems to be becoming as big as anything in Kvothes previous history.<br /><br />All should be revealed in the third book. But now, I am not sure if the series is going to warrant a reread.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|For having the conviction to both personally fund and produce this film.  Cinema is 20th century story telling to both entertain and influence.  Saw the film first during it's theatrical release and most impressed with the technical accomplishments particularly with regards to the GCI universe this motion picture takes place in.  After watching the supplements, appears to be far more than what met my eyes.<br /><br />I still have to view the actual film, but having just watched the included, made for this Blu-ray documentary:  \\"Double Victory:  The Tuskegee Airmen at War\\" the segregation of the times was brought back reflecting on how much has changed through the sacrifices, contributions, and accomplishment of the individuals portrayed in this film.  If the film's story doesn't touch you, this documentary will.<br /><br />In the immortal words of a song from the era of Doo Wop:  \\"You had to have been there.\\"  Thanks George for retelling us the story of how far we've travelled and how much farther we still need to go.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|- The game is fun but difficult to press individual squares on a small smartphone screen when the grid is large (e.g., 15 cells per row).  It should have a zoom feature: double-press to zoom in/out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book.... is a beautiful love story full of passion.... i readed all 3 books in two weeks....
B0053FANRC|4.0|this was a great addition to the series.  I'm glad i bought it. good shots of tokyo.  i had trouble trying to decide if this was number 3 or 4 tho
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A really great game considering its free. Awesome story,  progressing your town is fun, and I love the side quests.

B007L96VCY|5.0|Ram, originally released in 1971, is one of Paul's finest moments. It's raw simplicity is what makes it special.. and why so many fans cherish it to this day.  McCartney fans will already know the history of this album... Written in Scotland with his wife Linda during a rough period in Paul's life, dealing with the break-up of the Beatles and coming off a poorly recieved, although successful album (McCartney). The supposed pot-shots at his old songwriting partner, John Lennon.. etc etc.<br /><br />The history is great, but the songs are what make it for me! \\"Too Many People\\" and \\"Heart of the Country\\" are brilliant. Who can forget \\"Uncle Albert\\" (a US #1) and it's irresistible chorus? I'll never forget the first time I heard that song, didn't know what to make of it, but I loved it. \\"Eat at Home\\" will get you up and moving... same with \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\", a perfectly weird, rocking song that happens to be my favorite on the album. \\"The Back Seat of My Car\\" was a minor hit and also a very good song.<br /><br />As far as the remaster goes, the sound is a definite sonic upgrade! Much cleaner sounding.. and as the other reviewer mentioned, not a loudness war victim. Remastered with much care.<br /><br />The bonus disc is great but only has a running time of 33 minutes. You get the non-album single \\"Another Day\\" (A Top 5 Hit) and it's B-Side \\"Oh Woman Oh Why\\" - which is a great tune! Plus we get a few alternate mixes and rarities. It's a great little bonus disc but a few more songs, demos etc, wouldn't have hurt.<br /><br />The packaging is decent also. Comes in a quality digipak with an attached booklet full of photos and song lyrics. I'm a bit surprised there are no liner notes but I guess you'll have to shell out the bucks for the super deluxe version for those.<br /><br />All in all - a great album in a great, 2 CD remastered package! \\"Ram On\\" and pick it up!
B005Y1B3Q0|4.0|It was never meant to be Shakespeare. If you're a typical male you'll like it. It has expolsions and alot of testostrone. Watch with your favorite drink and plate of red meat. There are two scenes in this movie with honest to God Acting in them. Micky Rourke gives a speech that is amazing in a film like this. All in all it will never win an Oscar, But for any action rush it works just fine
0783225482|5.0|this movie is hilarius,  it was funny years ago when it was out, and just as funny now, must have for any video collection.  worth buying.
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|Das Boot is quite possibly the most realistic submarine movie ever made.  The audience is drawn in so intently that you can nearly smell the oil, gunpowder, and sweat in the crowded confines of the sub.  Perhaps the only negative aspect of this film is that you begin to root for the Germans.  In essance this film shows with great passion and precision the horrors of war on all sides. A great piece of entertainment.
0312330537|4.0|Gregory David Roberts's Shantaram is supposed to be partly autobiographical, or at least loosely based on the author's own experience. That the novel is not entirely fictive is part of its appeal, veracity making its white-knuckle-ride of a plot all the more gripping. Still, be aware that Roberts himself has stated that the characters and plot details are imaginary, if grounded in real life.<br /><br />Shantaram relates the adventures of an escaped Australian convict, named Lin, in Bombay and its underworld. (Roberts himself escaped from an Australian prison and lived in India, and belonged to a Bombay mafia for a number of years.) Lin, having arrived almost by chance, soon grows roots in the great metropolis. He learns Hindi and Marathi, moves into a slum where he works as a doctor, befriends a migrant from a remote rural area, falls in love, saves a bear from prison, rescues an American girl from a notorious madame, and moves on to become a member of the city's most prominent gang, not all in that order. At some stage he is also jailed, and he goes to fight in Afghanistan for a spell (against the Soviets, as this takes place in the 1980s). The story is well told and the style of writing both agreeable and effective. Far from being written like a thriller, indeed, Shantaram has a distinct literary turn, with interesting observations and aphorisms. Perhaps its weakness is that it can be florid, and even preachy, at times. I would describe it as a cross between Paulo Coelho and Vikram Chandra. Anyway, this is well worth reading and is unlikely to disappoint.
B0079J28NC|5.0|I found out about this re release just today. I have purchased Beatle items of every form, vinyl,8 track, digital,cassette, paper, plastic, ceramic, cloth, etc. You get the point. If it has one new Beatle thingy in it I will be happy. Would the fab four want us bickering over such trivial things like aspect ratio or other such things. Just remember how much joy we have gotten out of their music. Just leave enough for the rent,food and coffee. I still have mono capital albums and 8 track red and blue tapes. I love to share this with my grandkids. All together Now!
B0083GPDBO|5.0|This movie was unexpectedly great.  The documentary style filming worked well because it was switched up from various angles and cameras.  Essentially, it's about what happens when a kid gets bullied at school and home too much, but has a good ending.  It would be great to see a sequel.  Definitely worth a look.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|What every one is saying is true. This band is hot. My wife and I had the oportunity to see them live in Knoxville, and it was insane! The talent and energy they bring will be legendary. I just got the CD and it only took me two minutes to get it into the player. The sound quality and the packaging is great.  You owe it to your ears to buy this CD!
0345803485|5.0|At first I picked up this book because everyone was talking about it - good or bad, if it had such a reaction I thought I would be worth picking up. As soon as you get through the first few pages the character interactions become completely obvious. I was afraid that the book would simply be sex, sex and more sex. However, James soon reveals unexpected details that give the characters more depth. A romance to its core, the book still proved to keep me turning page after page, eager to find out what would happen next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it this is awesome epic awesome and so epic. I love all the games. this is so awesome
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|My daughters face just simply lit up when she saw the Coraline movie in my hands lol.... I received it exactly when they estimated the del time at checkout no sooner lol but it got here on time and in one piece ... good job i would buy again
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I don't need to rehash the plot line of the book. I too purchased because of all the stellar reviews. But this book doesn't have a special spark to it that would make it a five star book. I found the book to be boring once the trial portion began and then the ending was completely unbelievable. The writing also left me wanting to try to connect to the characters. I didn't feel any sort of attachment and I can honestly say that this book did not make me want to continue picking it up and reading. I was glad when it was over. I would either skip this one or rent from the library. It's not worth the kindle price I paid.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so cool you can play lots and lot of games and cool part is you have to work for new games I would give this game to anyone
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so much fun! keep getting caught up in all the little quests &amp; such!  and seems educational, too! thanks for the fun!
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|I play bass guitar for my church.  I needed a player where I could tune up the bass to listen to the bass lines on the songs we're playing.  The graphic EQ on this Rocket player allows me to hear the parts I need to.
0156030306|5.0|This book opened me up to many other books.<br />Several months after reading it, i still find myself recommending it to friends and family.<br />It is an interesting story, but the way it is written is genius.<br />The book starts out like it is written by a ten year old kid with phonetic spelling and grammar mistakes, but as the research goes onwards and the main characters IQ increases it takes on a whole new world of intellect.<br />I wouldnt call it 'science fiction' strictly....when i think of 'science fiction' i think of far out crazy stories with little refernce to reality...this book, flowers for algernon is very real indeed.<br />It touches on the emotions and our own feelings towards people less fortunate than us, but it also hits on the childhood we all had and the way children who are different are picked on and beaten down.<br />The book also lets your imagination run wild, thinking about the possibilities for medical research into illnesses, laboratory testing and possibilities.<br /><br />A very interesting read, i love the way you can just read a chapter/journal entry that might only be two pages long...great for the modern human who is starved of time.<br />enough said,
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I've already written a pretty extensive review about Season 1, so all that I can add is that this show (THE BEST SHOW E.V.E.R) just keeps getting better. It is my absolute favorite show of all-time. It's raw and it's real and continues to dig deeper and deeper into our emotions as human beings, leaving nothing untouched. I saw numerous 'macho guys' on Twitter admitting to being reduced to tears watching one episode in particular. THE WALKING DEAD does not hold back ANYTHING, and that's just one element that has made this show the most-watched cable television show ever.<br /><br />I can't wait for Michonne in Season 3! October can't get here fast enough.......
B002RI91IU|4.0|An unusual book, very well written.  It is a ponder upon loneliness and its effect on three men in highly unlikely situations.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|the movie was great. it all leads to the ending which im not sure what to make of it but excellent none the less.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|CrossMe is a type of Japanese logic puzzle called a nonogram.  You are shown a grid surrounded by numbers, which represent the number of consecutive squares in that particular row or column which much be filled in.  For instance, \\"5\\" would mean that you have to fill in 5 squares all next to one another, while \\"3 4\\" means there are 3 filled squares, followed by an unknown number of blank spaces, then 4 more filled squares.  Filling in all the appropriate squares will reveal a picture.<br /><br />The game can look very intimidating to the novice, but once you learn a few tricks, it becomes very simple.<br /><br />Step one:  Look for rows or columns that are completely filled in.  In a 10x10 puzzle, that would be a row with a \\"10\\".  Then look for rows that are completely blank.<br /><br />Step two:  Look for rows or columns with a number that is more than half the width of the puzzle.  For instance, in a 10x10 puzzle, a row with \\"6\\" or higher will always occupy at least a few of the squares in the middle of the row, so you can fill those in.<br /><br />Step three:  If you have any squares filled in along the edges, then you already know how many to fill in from that edge.  In a 10x10 puzzle, if a row is labeled as \\"3 4\\", and the first space in the row has already been filled, then the next two must be filled as well.<br /><br />Step four:  Fill in gaps between squares.  If a row is labeled as \\"4\\" and you have one space filled, then a blank, then another filled space, then you know the blank between the two must be filled.<br /><br />Step five:  If you tap on a square twice, it will place an \\"X\\" instead of filling the square.  Use these whenever possible.  If you've filled in all the appropriate spaces in a row, fill the blank squares with \\"X\\"s and it will be help you figure out the columns.  For instance, if a row is labeled \\"3 3\\" and you already have two sets of 3 squares filled in, then the rest of the squares in the row should be X'ed out.<br /><br />Hopefully that made sense.  Like I said before, it's a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes much easier.<br /><br />This game works perfectly on my Motorola Xoom tablet.  My only complaint is that the price, $4.95, feels a bit high.made sense.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|This keeps the grandkids busy and happy and I find myself playing it too.  It is necessary to. wcontinue to buy acorns which gets very expensive.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|I love this game but the squares are too small even for tiny fingers like mine. This makes the interface and game play very frustrating. This is on a Kindle too ... I can't imagine it on a cell phone!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody is back!  After movies like \\"Manhattan\\" \\"Radio Days\\" and<br />\\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" some of the recent movies have been somewhat less than perfect.  However, with \\"Midnight in Paris\\" he really hits the ball out of the park!<br />After seeing the movie on TV, I immediately ordered the DVD for my personal collection.  This movie is not only fun to watch, but if you pay close attention, you can learn a lot about French history and the Americans who spent a lot of time there (Artists, writers, etc.).<br />I would rate this movie as certainly Woody's best effort.  The cast is great, the story line is interesting and the camera work is exceptional.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I am not reviewing the movie content/story.  You either like Tron or you don't.  We purchased this movie in 3D to try our new 3D plasma tv and to check out the 3D glasses.  The 3D in the movie is not over the top.  To me, that makes it effective, but my husband wanted the 3D to be more dramatic.  There are a couple of scenes where the disk thrown in a battle comes right out to hit you, but most of the 3D is subtle.  I think it is well done.  My own personal taste goes toward it being a waste of money to purchase expensive 3D movies.  The good glasses are also expensive.  But, if you really enjoy 3D, you will probably like this movie in 3D--unless you need every scene to come out and hit you in the face.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|As a 24 year old single chick I fell totally in love with this book & the other 2 in the trilogy.<br /><br />I was hesitant to buy it at first because of all the bad reviews on Amazon but I'm so glad I did.  It had me laughing, crying & there were some really touching moments which I really enjoyed. It was hard to put the book down at times, I had some very sleepy days at work from being up reading through the night!  The banter between Ana & Christian (verbally & in the emails) was expertly written and very amusing. As for the other \\"stuff\\" that has made these books fly of the shelves... well who doesn't like a bit of debauchery in their books to keep things interesting! It certainly opened my eyes up to a whole new lifestyle I've never really heard of before.<br /><br />If you like a good love story with a bit of humor and a lot of smut, you should definitely  buy the book :)<br /><br />Laters, Baby ;)
1401233791|4.0|This will be very short.<br /><br />Everything you need to know about the collection is contained on the other reviews.  No much I can say about the content, except that is wonderul!<br /><br />Coolest thing to do is to really collect Knightfall in it's entirity.  Volume 1 is the perfect start.<br /><br />Why do I take 1 star off?  Because of the paper quality.<br /><br />I received my copy today, and although I was very pleased with the lenght and content, the paper left me cold.  Is the exact (or almost the same) paper quality as the old editions.<br /><br />I honestly thought that the newspaper paper wasn't used anymore.  Man!  I wanted to take two stars out because of that, but I guess the good is bigger than the not-so-good.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. I couldn't stop! the graphics are fantastic. the animals are so creative. what a fun concept! I couldn't put it down.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works great for me. Ads only pop up at the start of a new game. A little laggy at times but otherwise good!
B007L96VCY|5.0|Nicely done remaster.  It seems that the sound engineers were not about to bastardize this classic album by hitting the \\"Punch & Crunch\\" buttons to unwisely \\"modernize\\" the sound.  It's a restrained remaster, as it should be.<br /><br />RAM was always my favorite McCartney album.  The country air of Scotland did the boy good.  If you don't own RAM, then this remaster is worth buying.  You won't be disappointed.  If you can get a hold of the old vinyl version from the early 1970s in good condition, that version also still sound very, very nice.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I like this kind of puzzle on paper, but I LOVE them on a touchscreen. The interface, graphics, and music are all top notch, too. Looks like this is going to be my go-to time waster for the next few weeks!
B003L16FAE|1.0|Excellent movie - blu-ray is very poor quality.  As someone else suggested, buying the DVD and up-scaling on the player is probably about the same effect.
B007ZD17XO|1.0|hate alawar friday games, don't work and they still haven't fixed gourmania. This game loads then blank screen.Guess they care more about grabbing your money then fixing the game. I buy alot, but alawar is starting to tick me off.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Completed about 55% of the book.  Great and very interesting reading.  How can one nutty person be so brilliant!<br />Book is very well written.  Draws you in.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i used to play the old school version when I was in elementary school. I loved it then and love it now. I know some have mentioned the energy taking too long, well, true when you are a hard worker chopping trees, collecting money, farming, building but if you learn to pace yourself and do things that don't take energy spaced strategically between other activities you are less likely to run out all the time. the only thing I wish is that it didn't have to connect to Internet and update everytime you turn power on kindle. I just have to remember to turn it on and open the game before I leave wifi connection. it's  kinda a bummer if I forget to do it and don't have wifi access. also, I wish I could exchange coins for dollars but I've managed without having to buy any.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I feel like I am one of the only people who didn't like this book, but I could NOT get past how annoying Ana was!  She was just so naive, it drove me crazy.  And the book was supposed to take place in 2011, so as a college student, how did Ana not know how to use email or turn on a computer??  I couldn't stand how she talked about her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" as if they were real people, and I also couldn't stand how she said \\"jeez\\" on just about every page.  I am very curious to find out what happens to her and Christian in the second and third books, but I honestly don't know if I can bring myself to read them.
0312330529|4.0|Here is a book which can be picked up at any page and be enjoyed! I am not far into this true story, but everything I have read so far, just intrigues me, and I always enjoy being able to just sit and read it. It is a HUGE book, but would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a true story about hardship and overcoming adversity.
0345529057|4.0|There are so many storylines to this tale that would keep the most cynical of readers comfortably occupied but truly satisfied whether they care to admit it or not. Yes, there were moments where I was left silently screaming at the fate of some characters, wondering at their sudden demise, but herein lies the excitement and the build up to what I am certain will be an explosive finale.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game brings back good memories and was a good game to pass the time. But the bugs got annoying. Could not complete quests and had quests restart to the beginning if I completely closed the application. After these and other issues are resolved, I will start playing again.
B005DBFZQU|5.0|I believe András Schiff has found his niche. I am not a huge fan of Schiff's renditions of Bach, but do enjoy his Beethoven recordings. This recording however is extraordinary, and far exceeds anything I've heard from Schiff. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys solo piano.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game, so it gets 5 stars. but honestly, there's next to zero animation in this game, it shouldn't tax the system in any way so why so much stuttering and force closing? I can only guess it's poor programming. could be the device (fire) but since pretty much everything else I've played runs smooth I'm disinclined to believe that. and finally, stop begging for 5 star reviews and threatening to withhold updates. it's distinctly unsavory.ask for reviews, that's fine, but earn your 5 stars. Aside from the graphical and occasional gameplay issues this game is brilliant. 5 stars for concept.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a pretty fun app. not too hard to figure out the games although a couple games are a bit challenging.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|Very good at covering the start of the current economic status and how it has triggered the continued fall.  Easy to access through Amazon.
0385751532|5.0|The author takes a self conscious view of the Holocaust safely hiding behind the lens of a 9 year old boy, mingling historical fact with realistic fiction...and, he pulls it off.<br /><br />His writing is from the perspective of a young boy, and he accurately captures the boy's world view, in the boy's language, understanding, and in the reality that he is just slightly around the corner of an adult view; almost deliberately staying away from the harshness of the world.  I vividly recall thinking this way as a child, knowing that if a boy crosses over, he can never maintain the protection of innocence, yet cross over he must.  So it is with the character of Bruno, as the author cleverly keeps his thinking as a boy, with the adult realities just moments away.  The author is successful in showing us how boys think, while telling a harrowing story, as if from another era where story telling left much to our imagination.  He gives us both pain, and satisfaction:  the horror of what took place, the pain of what a child experienced, yet the satisfaction of having characters aware of the atrocities against the Jews.<br /><br />At the age of 9, I still held to innocent world view, though I knew it was coming to an end.  Incredibly so, the author is able to extract from memory, how it is a 9 year old could not grasp the evil of Hitler, yet know it was just around the corner.<br /><br />My 12 year old daughter read it, as it allows for dialog on what must never be forgotten, yet without the usual mind numbing numbers. It brought the horror home.<br /><br />I loved both the book and the movie.  It was a great gamble, but the author pulled it off. How could anyone not love it?
B004Q3QRWC|5.0|I did worry this might not wrap and would read more like a sequence of short stories but worry not neat parcels get tidied up in surprisingly unexpected ways.  Genius actually.  A new favourite author.
0385523394|3.0|The title and picture sucked me in. The brief description captured me further. Certainly a subject not many of us are familiar with. The writing is good and the best descriptions were of the surrounding, fellow inmates, and the \\"rules.\\" I certainly could feel the boredom, the agony of waiting, the guilt of what Piper put all of her loved ones through and she never quit telling us of that. I don't mean that I thought it distracting, but rather that she continued to own her mistake without forgetting that she herself was to blame for being there in the first place. Suspense as a story lacked, except when Nora came back into the picture and the pending trial. So really quite a bit before it ended I had lost interest in the whole thing. When it did end my cynic mind took over and wondered did she write the book to enlighten? to make money? It did make me more aware of the number of prisoners who are in jail for nonviolent crimes but then Piper felt the guilt of the junkies whom she knew would go back to using. She felt her role in their demise so then I was confused. It was more of an interesting book than one I couldn't put down. And I guess that's okay too.
B000MRK7AO|5.0|The original American theatrical trailer for Sergio Leone's classic THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Italy/Spain/W Germany-1966) has Eli Wallach as the Bad and Lee Van Cleef the Ugly, while the film reverses these. Practically all three leads are interchangeable, as Clint Eastwood's character, mysteriously nicknamed \\"Blondie,\\" is certainly a bad guy, plus after his desert ordeal, he's quite ugly (for a while).<br /><br />A bit overlong at 162 minutes, yet there would be little fat to trim here (perhaps the bridge sequence?) if cuts had to be made.<br /><br />Saw this in first run a very long time ago. With the advent of home video in the '80s I've been able to reexperience it umpteen times since. During the most recent viewing, I looked beyond familiar characters, plot and dialogue and studied other details, such as camera panning during Eli Wallach's worried search for a gravemarker while Ennio Morricone's magnificent \\"Ecstasy of Gold\\" plays, also Leone's timing of facial closeups and quick edits during the climactic three-way cemetery showdown. That all these guys are grimy, sweaty, unwashed and unshaven is certainly accurate for an age and place where fresh laundry and bathtubs could be few and far between.<br /><br />Although filmed in Spain, backgrounds suit the American West nicely. How much of the Civil War was fought in this country's more arid areas is a legitimate question.<br /><br />Morricone's main theme is heard throughout, always in variation. As a very amateur musician and singer who favors harmony, bassline structure and counterpoint to melody, an almost-syncopated downscale string countermelody in this piece, especially as Eastwood gallops off at the end, is a real attention grabber. It's an inspired bit of orchestration, at least for me.<br /><br />Few movies stand up to the scrutiny of repeated viewings as well as this one, and not many American westerns have ever been as good. Bad and/or ugly, maybe.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|This is a pretty fun, enjoyable game. I would give more stars if the numbering would work properly. I have run across more than a few puzzles where the numbers both above and left do not 'cross out' properly. somewhat frustrating to me as a new player of this type of game.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|As much as our heroine, Ana, professes to be totally blase about Christian's billions, let's be honest...if a man made $50k/year and behaved like Christian does, the world would think he's a d-bag.  Dude is rude to everyone he encounters, sulks and pouts like a baby, he's emotionally abusive, and he's incredibly insecure.  Yet, we are to believe that EVERY woman he encounters blushes and simpers and stammers and flutters her eyelashes in his presence.  I would love to sit down with E L James and ask her if she's punking us.  Is this really her vision of the ideal man?  I'm afraid I know the answer.<br /><br />A couple of the sex scenes are titillating, and they are probably the only reason to consider purchasing this book.  It's not really my sort of thing, but I suppose that's why I have a certain level of interest in reading about it.  Be forewarned, though: they get repetitive and boring VERY quickly, and I think most people will end up skimming over the sex scenes by the middle part of the book.<br /><br />On a side note, the most shocking part of this trilogy's success is that the movie rights just sold for $4 million. I will be very interested to see how these books could be turned into a successful movie franchise. I don't envy the screenwriter who, no doubt, will need to rewrite every word of awful, cringe-worthy dialogue.<br /><br />Laters, baby.

B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is a fairly visually polished implementation of nonogram puzzles on Android.  Everything looks and sounds good, and the puzzles are solid, but I feel like the input interface could use a bit more work.  After playing Picross DS, I know just how well nonograms can work with a touchscreen, and sadly this app falls short of that standard.  The whole \\"tap once to mark, tap twice to X, tap three times to clear\\" mechanic is unintuitive, and would work much better by utilizing a toggle area on one side of the screen to switch between marking modes, or by taking advantage of multitouch functionality.  Additionally, zooming in on a particular area (a necessity on phones) prevents you from seeing the hint row and column.  Picross DS addressed both of these issues admirably.<br /><br />I think that, with a little more thought put into the input process, this would easily be a 5 star title, and possibly even worth the $4.99 asking price.  But it's not quite there yet.  I'll definitely be trying out this app on my tablet though.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Great acting by everyone.  Begs the question yet again, \\"Is it nature or nuture?\\" Knew Tilda Swinton would be great but Ezra Miller (Kevin) was amazing. So worth watching more than once.
B007L96VCY|5.0|If there was any McCartney album that really deserved and needed a remaster, it was Ram. The Beatle's engineers have tuned this album up and made it sound alive. Finally, you can hear all the intricacies of McCartney's musical ideas coming to fruition here. The drums and bass sound crisper. McCartney's hit a grand slam with this reissue. It's been cleaned up and it sounds fantastic. Great job!
B0014JKJHK|5.0|I had my older crocs for 6 years but they were very worn out and i kept slipping at work. these came on time and look perfect, they even feel comfy too. the store sells them for 45$ plus tax so i think its a great deal.
0345803485|1.0|With so many people mentioning the \\"Twilight undertones\\" of this series, and the reflection of Edward and Bella in the main characters, it's amazing that no one seems to realize this book originated as just that--Twilight fanfiction. It was originally titled \\"Masters of the Universe\\" and Christian and Ana WERE Edward and Bella. The names were changed for publication, but it is what it is.<br /><br />That being said, if Twilight fanfiction is your thing, you will love this series. If not, don't bother with it.
B00169N0BK|5.0|I have been struggling for a year with mismatched screen and print color. In addition, my prints had a red tint with some papers. I used the ColorMunki to, first, calibrate my screen. This was quick and easier than any calibration tool I have used in the past. Second, I performed the printer calibration on each paper I normally use. This operation was also faster and easier than any solution I have tried in the past. The result was seemingly magic. The red tint was gone and after calibrating each paper the screen match was better than anything I have tried in the past. The process first scans one target then calculates a 2nd target based on the result of the first target scan. This 2nd scan fine tuning can also be continued to achieve even better accuracy. I have not needed to go beyond the standard 2 scans. I am extremely happy with the ColorMunki and highly recommend it to anyone needing a quick, easy and relatively inexpensive solution to monitor and printer calibration.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Well, I hope this game is great. And people who've accidently spent real life money, you can't blame team lava because you didn't know you we're spending real money. It only takes you at least 3 min. to see. Like seriously. I'm only ten yrs old. If you let your kid play games that involve spending real money, then look into it more before you let them play it. Easy things like this isn't much of a big matter. So please stop acting like it. I, being only ten yrs old, make sure I'm not spending money in games like this because one, I'm GREAT with electronics and it only takes at least a minute, so really no one but you to blame.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Great series.  This book didn't really pick up until more than halfway into it BUT, well worth the wait.  Immediately started third book in the series and currently finishing the fourth.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|This band is as tight as a band can get, and the lead singer/guitarist Brittany Howard is putting raw soul back into rock and roll. Ms. Howard sounds powerfully committed--as though she is exorcising personal demons, as though her life depended on her performance. Most rock lovers will find something to like here, still this music is more art than commerce--and all the better for it. Here's to a long life for Alabama Shakes!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Be warned - you won't be getting too much sleep yourself until you turn the last page of Before I Go to Sleep. This is a phenomenal, unique story from start to finish. It kept me reading throughout the night, through breakfast, lunch, and dinner the next day. I knew from the beginning that there was something going on that was not just the typical amnesia story. I never expected the twists in the storyline though.The main female character has amnesia and doesn't know if she can trust her husband who she wakes up seeing as a stranger every morning, so she keeps a journal to try and figure her life out. This leads her down a winding, seemingly endless path. This is the most frightening condition I can imagine. You are living, but yet not really!<br /><br />This is by far one of the best books I have read in a long time. I had my ideas and suspicions, but they never led me to the truth and the conclusion was unpredictable and the most frightening of all. I get so excited when I find a book that is so amazing and one of a kind discovery I practically stop living my life to get to the end of it! Excellent Writing; Excellent Storyline; Excellent Suspense; the endless tension is thoroughly encapsulating. Although the best but not one I could read again.

1936719118|5.0|Derek Sivers, the author of ANYTHING YOU WANT (AYW), describes his book as \\"40 Lessons For A New Kind Of Entrepreneur\\".<br /><br />In terms of credentials, he is the founder of BabyCD, a company he started from scratch and 10 years after sold for a pretty price. According to Wikipedia, \\"Derek Sivers bequeathed his company to a charitable trust for music education, and had them sell it to Disk Makers. This agreement allows him to receive the minimum allowed by law for such agreement of 5% per year of the company's sale price (annually $1,100,000 pretax, based on a sale price of $22 million as reported by Sivers until death, while upon death the remainder if any will ultimately go into the trust\\". More about Derek here:[...] and here: [...]<br /><br />Listening to the audio-audible version of AYW I did not keep count of the number of lessons. It's immaterial because AYW is also \\"10 years experience in 1 hour\\".<br /><br />My kind of book! Short `n sweet. To the point. Fluff- and b.s.-free.<br />Derek is articulate and presents fresh perspectives throughout. 5 stars.<br /><br />According to AYW, \\"Most people don't know why they're doing what they're doing. They imitate others, go with the flow, spend time and energy on the unimportant and follow paths without even caring to make their own. They spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them they should want, without realizing it won't make them happy\\".<br /><br />That leaves AYW for people who do not wish to be on their deathbed one day realizing they have squandered their one chance at life, full of regret to have pursued little distractions instead of big dreams.<br /><br />Each of Derek's lessons are worth taking. Samples:<br /><br />- Know your personal philosophy of what makes YOU happy and what is worth doing.<br />- Business is not about money. It's about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.<br />- Making a company is a great way to improve the world while improving yourself.<br/>- Never do anything just for the money. Don't pursue business only for your own gain.<br />- Success comes from consistently improving and inventing, not from consistently promoting what's not working.<br />- Your business plan is moot. You don't know what people really want until you start doing it.<br />- Starting without money is an advantage. You do not need money to start helping people. By not having any money to waste, you won't waste any.<br />- You can't please everyone. Proudly exclude people.<br />- Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.<br />- The real point of doing anything is to be happy. So do only what makes you happy.<br /><br />I trust I'm not giving away, for free, too much. Instead I hope my review may motivate you to find out more. About what Derek calls \\"the opposite of ambition\\", about making progress only with massive effort, about the value of persistence, and about what those statements mean, how to place them in context and how you're supposed to apply them to your own situation.<br /><br />I enjoyed listening to my audio-version of ANYTHING YOU WANT. AYW is fun and inspiring. It will leave its mark on me, like good books do. Let me know about your experience. Paraphrasing Derek, like you I'm just a student of books, not a guru. Any feedback I'd appreciate.
1439153663|2.0|After reading the reviews, I suggested this book for our book club.  I found it easy to read, but bland.  The characters were either good or bad; there was no grey.  The book read like a soap opera.  Marshall's abuse by his tutor, as well as Lavinia's abuse by her husband, although very plausible, felt contrived.  Lavinia's cousin's behavior made one question if she could be a lesbian.  It was as if the author was trying to deal with abuse and GLBT issues through a modern lens.  It just didn't seen to work.  Our book club was very disappointed.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Update July 20 2012<br />I got through all the puzzles and was on my last one a couple of weeks ago. I had already started wondering where I could find more when low and behold when I checked the menu lots of new puzzles had been added in the form of new levels. 47 per level. Today I saw an update and MORE puzzles were added making the $4.95 price tag even better. I am a happy camper.<br /><br />Original review<br />I love logic puzzles, tend to get addicted to them and I can see this will be no exception. This was new to me but I already know I love it. Works smoothly on Kindle Fire. I had a little trouble at first because the instructions are not very clear for a novice but I did a search on Google and found good instructions. Look at the listing that says \\"Nonogram Puzzles 209.189.56.28/Nonograms.nsf...\\" if you are having trouble.<br /><br />The music is nice but you have the option to turn it off and the zoom feature is helpful. A stylus will also help. I also like the fact that you can play in portrait or landscape mode. You will need that when you get to level 1.7<br /><br />Every once in a while Amazon comes up with a worthwhile FAOTD and this is one of them. At first glance one might think $4.95 is a bit steep, but knowing what I know now I would pay it.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Earth Wind and Fire is one of the greatest R&B groups which scored a number of great hits during mid 70s to early 80s. It has released a number of greatest hit compilations so far, but this one is most suited for ordinary music fans who have never bought any of EW&F albums.<br /><br />Earth Wind and Fire is regarded as a disco hit maker because during late 70s to early 80s the group had produced such tracks that might fit well for disco-dancing from slow ballad AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE to dance-pop BOOGIE WONDERLAND and LET'S GROOVE. But up until mid 70s they created some great spiritual songs with ethreal out-of-the-world chorus. CAN'T HIDE LOVE is one of the good examples to show their chorus style. FANTASY is by far the most successful single release in Japan. KALIMBA STORY and MIGHTY MIGHTY are the funky pop songs representing their early days' music style.<br /><br />Verdict: Well-balanced and great one-CD compilation showcasing their career.<br />Rating: 90 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Music fans who want to get a glimpse of great 70s music.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|The movie and HD signal were great, but Amazon needs to improve this service in terms of pausing or temporarily stopping the movie.  I had to exit out to the top menu every time we paused.  Viewing with the family at home, that has to be done. Other services such as Netflix or Vudu are much more user-friendly in this regard.
1401235417|4.0|Having jumped in and out of the Batman Universe over the years, I'm certainly no expert on the series. Still, it's readily apparent to anyone at least moderately familiar with the Dark Knight that Batman storytelling can be an inconsistent lot.<br /><br />Thankfully, 'The Court of Owls' is a smashing hit, a wonderful re-interpretation of the Batman legend from a completely different perspective. To both oversimplify and not ruin the plot, the storyline assumes an ancient society - The Court of Owls - is Gotham's longest running menace, specifically toward the Wayne family's attempts to historically transform the City.<br /><br />Through cleaver plot weaving, The Court of Owls pieces together Wayne's past and present, also the entire gamut of Robin's...in a wonderfully illustrated package. The writer's ability to infuse such a key alternate variable into the Batman system is no small feat.<br /><br />The Court of Owls takes a gorgeous, stylistic approach to presenting the tale, with wonderful embellishments that - through visuals - bring out animalistic tendencies of all the characters involved. Very rarely has rabid madness been so well illustrated. This presentation is paired with a very clever physical reorientation of the book at a key plot stage...one that goes a surprisingly long way in capturing the moment.<br /><br />Still, The Court of Owls runs light on dialog, with nary a quotable quote to be had throughout. The Court emerges as uninspired characters, also Batman's quest to uncover them.<br /><br />As a collective, however, this is a solid Batman tale, a harkening back to some of the darker (in a good way) Batman days, when ethos and soul were front and center. The book finishes with some nice storyboarding and full page art, nice little extras to capture the genesis of the tale.
1452101426|5.0|First of all, let me state this is a fantastic book. All aspects of the film are covered, including backgrounds, major and minor characters, structures and creatures. Development of how these were brought about is gone over in depth.<br /><br />However, those of you who preorded the book (as I did) and don't want to know the plot of the movie need to be warned that there are major spoilers included. Most of the movie is story boarded in black and white and in color, and you will pretty much know the whole film if you page through the book in detail, as I tend to do with \\"art of\\" books. Again, if this is not a problem for you, its a great book and dig in. But if you want to stay surprised as too major plot points in the movie, I'd wait until after the film before opening up.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Awesome puzzle game. If you like logic problems or sudoku, you will get hours of enjoyment, and possibly some frustration. Sometimes hard to fill in the boxes you want, but if you zoom in a bit, that solves that problem. Great on my galaxy sII
B00080DIWE|4.0|I was quite surprised when I opened the package. Inside was two complete stands and plenty of spring clips to hold just about any 1/24 and 1/25 body firmly in place while spray painting. These eliminate the need for bending coat hangers or spraying on top of spray cans. I haven't used mine yet but I will now feel confident that the body wont fall off the stand during or after painting. A great little product that perfectly filled a need.

B00001W9G0|4.0|A few surprises lay ahead of me with this film. First-while I'm no fan of Babs, one must respect her numerous talents. Her acting is outstanding in this film and her rendition of the theme song is soul piercing. One starts out finding her character much how one would expect the actress' personality to be; overbearing, self-righteous, loud and obnoxious. SPOILER ALERT: Somehow by the end, your heart breaks for her - no it is torn to shreds - and you weep aloud in sorrowful sympathy. Secondly, while I'm no romantic,  I cried for three days 'remembering' this movie. But the story is so well told, the characters so believable, the time frame so perfect, the viewer is pulled into the emotional abyss. Perhaps it's the song, perhaps it's Robert Redford's ethereal beauty, perhaps it's the victory of the homely girl winning the handsome man - only to have her hopes destroyed. Perhaps it's that the beautiful man has a horrific heart. Four stars because it hurt so bad. Well, hope this helps.

1589946634|5.0|Space Hulk: Death Angel is a challenging and entertaining game (although I have managed to win my first two playthroughs, it was by the skin of my teeth both times, which makes it even more fun.) The cards are printed on nice, heavy card stock and should last for a long time, provided you take reasonable care of them. The box is small enough that it can easily be packed into a suitcase or travel bag, which is great for me because I am on the road a lot and plan to bring this game with me quite frequently.<br /><br />If I had any complaints about the game, one would be that the rules booklet is poorly written, and first-time players can find themselves confused if they are relying strictly on the booklet. (There are multiple videos online explaining how to play, and I would actually recommend starting there.)<br /><br />Another complaint would be that the colors used in the game art are very dark; I realize that this is keeping with the gloomy theme of the game, but a colorblind person such as myself may have trouble distinguishing between the red, green, orange, and yellow colors used on various cards. Fortunately, the cards have unique symbols associated with each color so it's not too bad.<br /><br />I can't attest to the replay-ability of this game (as I've only played it twice,) but with the variation in special powers between all of the squads and the random events, I imagine each game will be different. The game is technically 1-6 players, but it's a cooperative game with no \\"secret knowledge\\" so with any more than 1 player it basically becomes multiple people collaborating on a solo game.<br /><br />I rambled a bit, but I am really enjoying this game so far and it's well worth $20 for the quality of the cards and challenging yet achievable goal.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|The movie was just what my son wanted and he was very happy with it!!! My son had no idea I was ordering it for him and he was excited when it came in the mail and he opened it.
006197806X|5.0|Hoo boy. Delirium is one of my favorite dystopians thus far. I'm fascinated with the idea of love as a disease and Lauren Oliver's exploration of the mindset that created the \\"deliria\\". Not only is the set up a great hook, but Oliver's writing is impeccable and draws you in to her story. Pandemonium is, in my opinion, at least as good if not better than Delirium. This is because we get to explore Lena's broken life. She is in mourning. Not just for Alex, but for the comfortable life and people she left behind to get to the Wilds. But Lena has to embrace the life she has been thrust into or die.<br /><br />Many people have disliked, and will dislike, the switch between \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" in Pandemonium. I found it to be a very effective and fascinating set up, though. First, we see the contrast between the lives of those in the Wilds and the citizens of New York. We also see the contrast between Lena as she was immediately after escaping into the Wilds and when she is living in New York. Lena left her home with Alex to lean upon, making the decision easier--though not easy in any way--and cushioning any kind of blow. But when she decides to help the rebellion, she doesn't have anyone to fall back on. She is making decisions free of outside influence and  with the knowledge of what the consequences could be. That made me admire her more than I did at any point in Delirium.<br /><br />Honestly, there's not much more I can say past, \\"READ IT.\\" I've read a lot of dystopians in the past could of years, and none have gripped me like these have. Nor have I read a second book in a trilogy in a long time that is the equal of its predecessor. Pandemonium is that, if Delirium's better.

I also have to say that the ending was a total surprise....'nuff said, I won't spoil it for anyone, you will just have to find out for yourself and don't spoil it by looking at the end first...that's like peaking at your Christmas gifts early...then you have nothing to look forward to on Christmas Day! :)
B00846F1YW|2.0|compared to mumbo jumbo or fire maple games.... this is annoying!  I don't like the flow and all the nonsense communicating. I deleted before I finished~ its just not high quality.
B00846WWVM|2.0|The title sums it up. I just wasn't very enthralled by it.  I could play it if I was bored with my other games. Overall the game is mediocre.
B002N7P23I|1.0|As another reviewer has mentioned, this version of the film is dubbed and NOT, as I had expected, subtitled. If you're cool with that, fine, but after watching about 5 minutes of the dubbed version I couldn't take it anymore. It just looks jarring and silly, it's much easier to take the film seriously when watching with subtitles...
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This was a slow reading book, especially comparing to book one in the series. It took me quite a while to read because it didn't have much drama that makes you keep reading late into the night.  Needless to say, I was slightly dissapointed with it.  It's also not nearly as \\"erotic\\" as most people say.  I felt like I had to read it because of the way book one ended.
B000148KK2|5.0|WOW she is great I got to see her live in Naples FL. She was on my bucket list. Now I put her back on the bucket list. I want to see her one more time.<br />Sounds GREAT  :-)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|lots of fun on the kindle fire and I totally recommend getting it. great graphics and a fun twist to a classic game
B007MDB71O|5.0|I rarely go to a theater any more, don't care for crowds etc.  Usually more enjoyable to watch on my own big screen once a movie comes out on blu-ray or dvd.  But I have always been a fan of the Princess of Mars books so I decided to see John Carter (poor choice of a name didn't help this movie)  Well to my complete delight, John Carter was an extremely enjoyable movie.  While not exactly like the books it is based on, the changes are not bad.  Actually went back to see it twice!  It is the first movie in a long time I am looking forward to adding to my collection.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|nice game, but a lot is lost when it glitches, which is too often to continue playing :( In the end I stopped because all objects were stuck in &quot;ready&quot; state so I could not continue...
1451648537|4.0|This was a great book until about 2/3 of the way through.  Then it got long and tedious.  Maybe a biography should be written a little bit after the death of the subject.  I thought the author was a little in awe of Steve Jobs and most people would be, I can understand that perspective.  But it made for a little bit of hero-worshiping in the book.  I would have enjoyed the book more if I felt the was a lot more subjectivity.  Jobs is an incredible person and a great contributor to our society.  I love all of our Apple products and we have a lot of them.  I think they are well designed.
0470474874|5.0|This book is THE book to have if you are trying to teach yourself Excel from scratch or answer a few questions you may have. The writing is easy to follow, painless, and clear. The book provides a CD of example datasets you can manipulate for practice. The CD also has a full-text version of the book on it, meaning you can practice excel without having to carry around the book, which is great for people who travel and don't want to lug the book around. Whether you are just starting with Excel or know a lot already, this book is the book to get! I wish I would have purchased it sooner!
B000TEMRIU|5.0|Classic Smashing Pumpkins album with a lot of really great songs. It's hard to find albums like this these days.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I bought this because I have two dslr's with video capabilities and I was going to be using them to teach elementary school kids how to shoot and edit video. This worked like a charm on my Nikon D5000. It screws in place in seconds and it's ready to go. It was sturdy enough that I could trust a group of middle school kids to walk around the school building without me with my D5000 mounted to this handle. I haven't tried yet, but I intend to use this handle to get some great shots of my 3 year old as well.

1451627289|5.0|When this novel premiered late last fall, many people jumped to the conclusion that Stephen King wrote an alternate history about what might have happened had JFK survived the assassination attempt in November, 1963.  This is considered a watershed event in American history, after all, and right up there with Pearl Harbor and 9-11.<br /><br />Well is it an alternate history or not?  Yes and no.<br /><br />Jake Epping, the main character, is an English teacher who reads a chilling essay from one of the school's janitors, who is taking night classes for his GED.  At the same time, he learns the reason why Al of Al's diner can sell his scrumptious burgers so cheaply.  The next thing you know, Jake ends up in September, 1958, with the opportunity to avert two grisly events and change the course of American history.  The specific mechanism to thrust Jake back in time involves Al's Diner and troubles a small minority of readers who want all the nuts and bolts spelled out.  However, it's a minor point in the grand scheme of the story.<br /><br />For the five years between September 1958 and November, 1963, Jake enjoys root beer without HFCS, restaurant dinners that cost less than 50 cents and an overall friendlier and more carefree atmosphere.  He buys a snappy red Ford convertible and manages to buy credentials that enable him to get a substitute teaching gig in Florida.  The long, drawn out, methodical plodding to stop the JFK assassination begins when Jake travels west, to Texas.  He finds a more permanent job in a small town south of Dallas, falls in love with Sadie, the pretty school librarian, and when he needs extra cash, just places a bet on a sporting event and collects.<br /><br />Remember, this is Stephen King.  Easy money and screwing around with the status quo often leads to pain and sorrow.  In 11-22-63, the past becomes a character (it does not want to be changed) in much the same way that \\"death\\" stalks the hapless teens in the \\"Final Destination\\" movies.Saying more would court spoilers, but 11-22-63 ends poignantly, and well.  It rises far above some of his recent works such as \\"Dreamcatcher\\" with its off-putting premise and \\"Cell\\" with its cast of cardboard characters.<br /><br />It may take over a week to read because of its epic length but 11-22-63 is one of last years' best books and one of the best books of Stephen King's career.  This is the story he wanted to tell when he wrote \\"The Dead Zone.\\"

B003IKMR0U|4.0|Nothing more to say, really.  I bought this after I bought the expansion.  Not really worth $20 for both, but it's a pretty fun game.  My kids like it.  The only problem is the bottom of the cardboard dice cup fell off during the first game.  I would probably buy it again, sans expansion, but I wish it were more durable.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One is a very unique, entertaining, and engaging story.  Being born in 1980 myself, I didn't get some of the references but many of them were great.  I think someone about 5-10 years older than me would absolutely adore the nostalgia.  But the story itself is great.  Highly recommend this book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|spider solitaire is a very challenging variation of the original.  I find it entertaining and often get absorbed in it for long periods of time.
1250008409|4.0|Perhaps it was my Buddhist/Taoist family background, and that this is the first meditation book that I've ever read, but the book really enlightened me.  He does tend to be wordy, so I skipped as much as I could in the front pages and started right into his conversations with the master temple monks.<br /><br />The visualization techniques were useful as meditation guides.  But where I found the most value was their incorporation into my everyday activities.  I've not yet even finished the book and I've already found that my life is significantly more peaceful than before.  Starting a new life, moving into a new home, and starting a new job was stressful for me, but learning to positively detach and evaluate everything has improved my quality of life.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|read past the first 70 pages. no matter how boring and dull you find them. i swear, it is well worth it. this series is thrilling, addictive, heartbreaking, full of colorful and intelligent characters who captivate you for days. it is haunting and gloriously good.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm a very slow reader, and became a person dislike reading. As my new goal, I tried to read the book before watching the movie. I doubted that I would finish the book. But the book is so good, which makes me want to read until the end. So for the first time I actually finish reading before watching the movie
B005ELQVGW|3.0|I have been a Bjork fan for quite some years now and must say that i have enjoyed every single one of her albums up until she released this one. I will describe it in one word: DISAPPOINTING. Why? Because this is a rehash of ideas that she developed better in her previous work. There is nothing here that you haven't heard from her before; the lyrics all reflect her love of nature and yet they sound clunky and uninspired. You have her typical ballads with plucked instruments and the more aggressive numbers with percussion. But there is no melodic hook or traditional pop structures anywhere to grab your attention and by the fourth track they all sort of muddle together. For further reference listen to Homogenic or Vespertine where the good material can be found.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I laughed a lot when I read this. I didn't have any expectations for this book to be anything other than a lot of good jokes and storytelling, and I wasn't disappointed.

0345803485|5.0|Great book. My first Mature Audiences book ever. It was really good and sexy. But, if I didn't have the other 2 books it would have left me on a cliff hanger! So get all three for sure.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this movie in the theater and now I'm lucky enough to review the Blu-Ray and that will be coming out soon. Though the movie and did not get all of the positive reviews and some other Disney movies have in the past, I was quite impressed by the movie itself and actually spurred me to start reading the original books ( which are great also ). I thought the acting was strong and the cinematography of was simply breathtaking. I have to give credit to the individuals working on the digital end of this movie as there was much that went into the making of the film ( especially in CGI). The Blu-Ray has pulled the best from the film and given even a few great extras as well. I am always a fan of the behind the scenes action that Blu-Rays tend to provide and this Blu-Ray delivered as well. The Blu-Ray provided amazing visual aspects for the viewer too. As someone with a larger screen TV, the images just exploded off the screen, and this is exactly what I am looking for in my Blu-Ray Discs! I highly encourage all to see this!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is a good book. I read the book within 2 days. Characters are good and overall easy to follow along.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|With so many superhero movies out there today, this one stood out to me, not only due to it's very different filming style (using a documentary style), but also for the solid acting, plot and overall story that was being shared. I truly enjoyed the idea of average people learning about powers, struggling with them and struggling with each other and how to control the powers themselves. I had heard good things about the movie going into it, and the things that people had told me paled in comparison to the movie itself. For me, I actually enjoyed this more than some of the large money big box superhero movies that came out last year (which is saying a lot). The only thing that may turn some people off to the movie is the fact that it is a hand held recorded movie and for some this may turn them off. Saying this though I reiterate that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and believe that you will as well!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like the game. makes me miss tapfish but still fun.  need more opportunists for acorns.  how about a new movie now and then
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Great film set in the untracked northern expanse.  A plane wreck, survivors and the long trek out.  Oh .... did I mention the wolves stalking the survivors party and picking them off one-by-one?  Great performance by Neison and the rest of the cast.  Well worth the watch.

B007MAETA8|5.0|I have every John Mayer studio release and I like them all, so when this album came out I didn't hesitate to pick this one up.  From the chords of the first song I knew that it was a goodie.  Now, I'm not enough of a John Mayer critic to say, \\"John this album isn't as rocking as others you've done or this isn't your style of music at all or why have you gone to a folk/blusey/country sound.\\"  I think everything he's done musically has been fantastic.  I appreciate this album for the quality of music it contains and if John Mayer is the one providing it, I don't object.  This style of music isn't that far out of his realm anyway.  He is a deep, very contemplative personality anyway.  This album really doesn't have a bad track on it; I like Queen of California, The Age of Worry, Shadow Days, Speak For Me, If I Ever Get Around To Living and Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey.  I'm not much of lyricist, so if there's any crazy meaning to these songs I have no idea.  This album has great harmonies, melodies and great instrumentalists, with John's handiwork right over the top.  A very simple, easy, fun listening album and that's it.

0345803485|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is about Ana who is graduating from college and ends up interviewing Christian Grey for the student newspaper. Ana clearly has extreme low self-esteem, and I would say some self-hate as well.  She immediately falls hard for Christian Grey who loves his women submissive.  Christian quickly enters a submissive and dominate relationship with Ana. This relationship is reminisce of an unhealthy, abusive relationship. I thought I would read all three books, but this is so sickening that I don't know if I can finish the series.

067960085X|5.0|I found this to be a masterpiece of economical storytelling.  It communicates to me on an emotional level.  To my way of thinking Holly is but a character in the story, while Capote is the protagonist. He is the narrator. Almost all of his fiction is autobiographical, and \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is no exception [the narrator even says his birthday is September 30 - which is Capote's birthday; and Capote is Buddy in \\"A Christmas Memory,\\" Joel in \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\" and Collin in \\"The Grass Harp\\"].  Both my heart and head responded to the way he talks of his desire to be a professional writer and the pride and sense of achievement at his having his own apartment:<br /><br />\\"I am always drawn back to places where I have lived, the houses and their neighborhoods. For instance, there is a brownstone in the East Seventies where, during the early years of the war, I had my first New York apartment. It was one room crowded with attic furniture, a sofa and fat chairs upholstered in that itchy, particular red velvet that one associates with hot days on a tram. The walls were stucco, and a color rather like tobacco-spit. Everywhere, in the bathroom too, there were prints of Roman ruins freckled brown with age. The single window looked out on a fire escape. Even so, my spirits heightened whenever I felt in my pocket the key to this apartment; with all its gloom, it still was a place of my own, the first, and my books were there, and jars of pencils to sharpen, everything I needed, so I felt, to become the writer I wanted to be.\\"<br /><br />As for Holly, she is one of the wild things she speaks of in Joe Bell's bar - just another wild wounded, creature Doc Golightly brought home:<br /><br />\\"Never love a wild thing, Mr. Bell,\\" Holly advised him. \\"That was Doc's mistake. He was always lugging home wild things. A hawk with a hurt wing. One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky.\\"<br /><br />She was pure ambition. She ran to Hollywood and allowed Mr. Berman to pay for finishing school and acting classes - they smoothed her edges and got rid of her accent and provided her with a vocabulary.<br /><br />\\"I knew damn well I would never be a movie star. It's too hard; and if you are intelligent, it's too embarrassing. My complexes aren't inferior enough: being a movie star and having a big fat ego are supposed to go hand-in-hand; actually, it's essential not to have any ego at all. I don't mean I'd mind being rich and famous. That's very much on my schedule, and someday I'll try and get around to it; but if it happens, I'd like to have my ego, tagging along. I want to still be me when I wake up one fine morning and have breakfast at Tiffany's.\\"<br /><br />She ran to NYC because knew she wasn't cut out for Hollywood or stardom, she needed more freedom. She uses her god given talents to pay for her independence.  She had an untethered heart.<br /><br />I loved the way the story unfolded, his relationship with Holly - her being a free spirit. I felt the scenes with Doc were poignant, and Holly's reactions to a death in her family is quite moving; or when she explains the 'mean reds'; and felt for her when she lost Rusty, then the Brazilian and finally the baby. This character was based on several women friends of Capote [Gloria Vanderbilt, Carol Marcus], his mother and even himself - especially the lying and self-absorption.  This was written in 1958, but it was set ten or twelve years before, when Truman was very young.  Capote being famous when he wrote this; he had been publishing for ten years - acclaimed works like \\"Other Voice, Other Rooms,\\" \\"The Grass Harp,\\" and \\"The Muses Are Heard,\\" award winning short stories, a play of \\"TheGrass Harp,\\" a musical of \\"House of Flowers\\" and the screenplay for John Huston's \\"Beat the Devil.\\" Still, it was this work that brought him into the front rank of American writers. \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" was acclaimed as a great work of art and was an instant bestseller.Grass Harp,\\" a musical of \\"House of Flowers\\" and the screenplay for John Huston's \\"Beat the Devil.\\" Still, it was this work that brought him into the front rank of American writers. \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" was acclaimed as a great work of art and was an instant bestseller.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The three volumes of the trilogy actually contain an interesting story. With decent editing, this could have been a soft-core \\"romance\\" classic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the editing (or lack thereof) reduces the series to Harlequin Romance status, and I'm at a total loss to understand how it became a cultural phenomenon. Especially since I can't imagine Hollywood every trying to make a picture from it :)<br /><br />I lost count of the number of times \\"salacious\\" was used after the first dozen. Considering all the other esoteric words that were conspicuously pulled from a thesaurus (\\"priapic\\"? Please!), I would have expected a better variety. And, believe me, \\"avuncular\\" should NEVER be used more than once in any book!<br /><br />\\"Lolita\\", this is NOT.<br /><br />That said - Ladies, read it and yearn. It should introduce a whole new audience into a cheap thrill genre which has a undeserved bad reputation.
B0065GC0BA|3.0|While I think that Jojo Moyes has tackled a serious subject in quite an accessible way, I did have major problems with the ending and the conclusions or messages that one could draw from it.  I would be very interested to know what people with disabilities think of the way the topic was treated. (Won't say more here as I don't want to give too much away to those who haven't yet read it).<br /><br />My other quibble was with the way the changes in perspectives were handled, ie, think that the author really needed to make a choice between having a single or multiple perspectives.  The bit where it jumps over to the mother's perspective seems out of sync with the rest of the book and it probably would have been better to have found another way to try and make that character more sympathetic.<br /><br />I have never read any other Jojo Moyes but I get the impression that she is usually more of a straight out \\"chick lit\\" writer.  Hats off to her for trying something different.  Judging by the other reviews, others found it a lot more palatable than I did.
B005VT42BS|5.0|This is a handy tool for checking any network. Even if you do not need all the tools, it can be handy for such things as telling if your Blue Ray player is connecting to the network, or what IP address your IP camera has. For most devices, it gives enough information to let you figure out what device it is. You can also hang custom tags on different devices. That way, you know what it is right away. On my network, it was able to get the device name for most of my devices all by itself. For those that it did not, it gave you the identification of the manufacturer of the network interface. For example, it did not get the name of my Roku box, but it was identified as a Roku device. I then named it so it was properly identified the next time.<br /><br />If you know networking, this app has a lot more uses. It turns you networked Android device into a network analyzing tool. Between this app, and the WEB browser, it makes configuring network printers and print servers a snap. You get the IP address using this app, and then connect to the WEB interface of the device. You no longer have to fire up your laptop from quick changes.
B004EPZ03O|2.0|We had just watched the original Muppet Movie for the first time since it was new in the theaters. This 2012 stumble is just plain annoying. All the fun and quirky was removed and what is left is petrified cliches tied together by rehashed songs. Most not even good for a chuckle. The only GOOD Muppet was Jack Black and he isn't even a puppet. This movie is too boring for children, too irritating for adults. Who is this for? I gave my copy away.

B003GYEGNO|5.0|I read and enjoyed this book previously in the late 80's. The passing of a further twenty-five years or so have brought it some clarity. I've got to highly recommend it, although there is one flaw that SHOULD push the rating just below 5 stars. More of that later.<br /><br />Sherman McCoy has it all. He makes a million dollars a year selling bonds for a top Wall Street firm. He lives in a 14 room, one-apartment-with-servants-wing-to-a-floor building on Park Avenue enjoying picturesque park views. His devoted wife--a little older than him and not as attractive as she once was--has carved out a career as an interior designer published in Architectural Digest, and his idealized 12 year old daughter attends the toniest private school with it's own shuttle that tools up and down Park Ave. gathering golden children in the promised land. Topping it off is his mid-20's mistress who he joins for the occasional impromptu tryst in another woman's rent-controlled apartment ($333/month)that the mistress--trophy wife of a self-made Jewish gillionaire--coopts from her for $750/month.<br /><br />Sherman's (SHUHMAN, the mistress calls him through her South Carolinian accent)fantasy life begins to come unravelled when he misses a turn off to Manhattan and ends up in the Bronx one evening after picking up his paramour at Kennedy airport. He goes from missplaced to lost and stops at an on-ramp because of an abandoned tire in his path. Two black youths appear from the side and a larger one come towards him somewhat quickly. This is the point where a spoiler opportunity presents itself to me, I'll resist the temptation, but the upthrust is that one of the youths gets struck by Sherman's car and the balance of the book is devoted to the downward spiral in Sherman's life this produces.<br /><br />The only flaw in the book occurs when detectives first visit Sherman's apartment to get a look at his car as a function of their hit-and-run investigation. The struck youth went to the hospital with a wrist injury, is treated and leaves with undiagnosed head trauma that later produces a coma (ultimately fatal). He told his mother he had been hit by a Mercedes with a license plate beginning with an R and a second number with a full ascender (my words, not his) like an \\"I\\" a \\"P\\" or an \\"F\\". After a self-appointed civil rights leader/preacher looking for a fast buck produces PR that takes talk of the accident to viral extremes, the police launch their investigation that leads them to Sherman's (and 500 other) doors to examine their cars. With so many possibilities, the police are just looking to eliminate the cars with no physical damage.<br /><br />Sherman blows the interview and arouses their suspicion. His behavior is not only ridiculous and outrageous, it's also unbelievable. Here he is, a self-styled \\"Master of the Universe\\" (as a bond salesman) and he can't act cool in a not even unexpected situation? Here, the author almost lost me. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />But he had to do this to produce the rest of the action of the book, which was well drawn and monumental. The author's gift of language, or characterization, or descriptive narrative--I could go on--are beyond comparison. This is a masterful story-teller at the peak of his powers.<br /><br />For those of you that look for \\"messages\\" in better fiction, you see how revered American institutions can be prostituted and perverted by the whims of angry crowds and determined behind-the-scenes influencers. Courts aren't supposed to function like the one in the Bronx, but, in context, it seems the most natural thing in the world.<br /><br />This is not Tom Wolfe's best book, but it's better than just about anyone elses.th a wrist injury, is treated and leaves with undiagnosed head trauma that later produces a coma (ultimately fatal).

I was very disappointed.<br /><br />But he had to do this to produce the rest of the action of the book, which was well drawn and monumental. The author's gift of language, or characterization, or descriptive narrative--I could go on--are beyond comparison. This is a masterful story-teller at the peak of his powers.<br /><br />For those of you that look for \\"messages\\" in better fiction, you see how revered American institutions can be prostituted and perverted by the whims of angry crowds and determined behind-the-scenes influencers. Courts aren't supposed to function like the one in the Bronx, but, in context, it seems the most natural thing in the world.<br /><br />This is not Tom Wolfe's best book, but it's better than just about anyone elses.
0062060554|3.0|...but it misses the exclamation mark, simply because of the pacing. The story tends to slow down in sections. Otherwise, this is a pretty good book and worth a mild recommendation.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it! its an awesome game. I'll be playing it for quite a while. it is a good time-kill. :)

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is by far, thee hardest and most interesting game ive gotten for my K-fire. So much thinking to create a pixelized image. And I got it free. If your not a puzzle person I wouldnt buy it it's really hard. And you may be dissapointed if you cant figure it out. Puzzle lover's alike have fun and good luck.
B004R1Q0XY|4.0|I was a little hesitant to try the vanilla cupcakes but they turned out AWESOME!! So light and fluffy, just how I like them. The recipe for the chocolate frosting was delicious as well. This book is good for when you have a craving or just a basic book for vegans. There are a few ingredients that the average person may not have at home, but if you are a dedicated vegan, you'll most likely always have what you need on hand. Enjoy!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|A fun little free game where you just draw and guess right? Wrong. You have to create an account through face book or email. Seriously you shouldn't have to create an account just to draw a friggin picture. I deleted this first thing.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Too much violence in these books. Would not recommend the trilogy. Only read all three because I wanted to know the ending. The first book was OK but the rest were substandard.Very over-rated.
0385333846|3.0|This book has been hanging out on the outer circles of my \\"classics to read one day\\" list and I finally decided to give it a try because it's so short. I read the first several pages in the store and found it the most interesting of the books I was considering buying. That being said I was glad it was short and I could finish it quickly. I can see the reasons why it's considered a classic, but I just didn't find it very interesting. The irony and fatalistic spirit are indeed darkly humorous. For three quarters of the book, I couldn't help but chuckle at the line \\"So it goes\\", but I did get tired of that too by the end. There were some absolutely brilliant sentences. Some of the vignettes held absolutely amazing ideas that would be fun to develop into a full novel.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|I purchased the video on Amazon via my new roku. I loved the convience of being able to make the purchase instantly from my home and to view it on the spot without having to run out to the video store. The kids loved the movie. I will definitely make another purchase and recome to friends as well.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was so into the book that I read it in 2 days. Keeps you wanting to know whats going to happen next and I couldn't put it down.  Definitely a roller coaster of emotions but so worth the ride! Completely fell in love with Travis!

B003K07DUC|4.0|The hand-held camera effects didn't bother me.  I found the movie disturbing and its ending especially provocative.  Matt Damon was terrific, as ever.  Well worth watching -- and pondering.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just happened to read reviews for this book on Amazon and decided to try it out. I'm a big sci-fi buff- both movies and books, and I'm pleasantly surprised by how interestingly this book has been written. The POVs of the key characters are very gripping and the story has brilliant fluidity. I find myself thinking about the characters even when I'm not reading it. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates a good science fiction/high tech plot. Can't wait to see where the story eventually goes!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a game for those of us who love puzzles and like to use your brain...I recommend highly..there is only one problem ... this thing is additive .. so be ready to spend multiple hours engaged in it. Great for Y's older folks who want to keep our brain functioning..lol
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Enjoyed it;  hard to put down...  Very memorable characters.  Sort of a love/hate relationship with the book because of the nature of the story itself.  Glad I read it...very unique.

B003O86FMW|5.0|beautifuly wriiten book, very orginal , with old themes and values. The series was well paced and riveting<br />Really enjoyed it !
B001USHRCK|5.0|I bought this a while back and finally had the chance to put it together. Seeing as this is soon/now(?) a discontinued set, I highly recommend acquiring it now before third-party sellers skyrocket the price.<br /><br />It is a great set. Although it is under the Castle theme which has a large focus on fighting demons or in the Kingdoms line, other factions of knights, the Medieval Market Village has a much more whimsical appeal to it. It is just a regular, everyday scene from medieval knight. Of course, the violence can be easily added as there are armed guards and even an armed female assassin/spy minifigure (which I think is pretty cool) but you can play with it as you like.<br /><br />I own three modular building sets like the Fire Brigade and the Grand Emporium. Compared with these sets, the Medieval Market Village is not too difficult of a build. Although the designs of the building are great and there are some great microbuilds like the bed and drawer set, there wasn't anything in the build that was too difficult. If you own other sets in the Kingdoms line like the Mill Village Raid or Blacksmith Attack, you may be a bit disappointed to see some repeating features. A nice feature of of the building that is similar to the Mill Village Raid is that the builds can be opened or closed and they look great either way. Also, there is good deal of detail within and on the exterior of the buildings.<br /><br />Unlike the modular sets, this set does not have numbered bags which may be a bit disconcerting considering that it is 1600+ pieces. Really, though, it wasn't too difficult even without the numbered bags. There is a method to the madness. As long as you don't take all the bags and dumped them into one giant heap, searching for pieces shouldn't be too much of a toil. I recommend dumping the bags in different piles or even into different cups or containers as the bags tend to keep like pieces together. I did suspect that I was missing a few pieces from the set and drew from my own collection to finish the set but in the end the missing pieces turned up.<br /><br />I recommend this set to adults, older children and more diligent and patient younger children as the build can take a few hours and the end product does suffer from some fragile point (the tree in particular). Overall, it's a great set and a great addition for someone who is invested in the Castle/Kingdoms line (or even the upcoming Lord of the Rings theme).rew from my own collection to finish the set but in the end the missing pieces turned up.<br /><br />I recommend this set to adults, older children and more diligent and patient younger children as the build can take a few hours and the end product does suffer from some fragile point (the tree in particular).

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is good not only fir reading the Bible, but also for studying, comparing translations, and, most importantly, developing the spiritual discipline of rescuing the Bible. It's great!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|First of all, the concept of changing the seasons during the game is genius!  It was fascinating to work thru each scene.  Not only did the look change, but you could do different things within the scene that you couldn't do before.  The graphics and colors were beautiful!  A very good game, where you have to think ahead.  It can be a challenge at times, but it is so worth it!  Fire Maple, please make more games like this one!
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|Has it really been so long since I first watched The Thing as a kid? I remember watching it on LaserDisc (wasn't all that popular in comparison to DVDs, but I still enjoyed it) as a young kid and loving it, not really get horrified, but enjoying the fright chill (and chill overall).<br />Now we have what happened before all that, starting with a Norwegian crew in the Arctic tracking the source of a signal that, given time, unleashes a chameleon-like chaos. Now's a good time to be rather paranoid.<br />I almost couldn't recognize Mary Winstead from when I saw her in Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World (the main movie I can always remember her in) since she has a much more serious role in this and is a stronger, more independent heroine (I guess that's because there's no love interest here for her) as well as a group of guys that I've never seen before, all having an interesting flavor to add to this frightful recipe. I thought the special effects in the original Thing were crazy good for its time, this time, they get a believable revamp. Nothing like completely obvious CGI, but it looks real enough (and disturbing enough) to almost get you paranoid in life (almost), facial shifts, skeletal breaks, body rearrangements, complete metamorpheses that get under your skin (and practially stay there), and a good dash of common sense to help with the paranoid tension between everyone.<br />This was definitely one very good prequel in an age of Hollywood where most prequels end up falling flat and are better to not notice at all. And then, the last test done for the last enemy was one that did end up getting me good, despite its simplicity.<br />Those, along with the visual effects of contrasting infernoes and surrounding ice (some of it in a couple characters' personalities), this will be one very good horror movie to be rememebered for a time to come.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book, in my opinion, is pure trash. How did this auther ever get published in anything but Penthouse or Hustler?! The writing is very poor, and bad language is used for shock value in lieu of anything interesting or meaningful. I do not recommend this book. We are what we put into our mind. And I, for one, do not care to litter in my own consciousness. Pure crap.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|How would you view the afterlife? Don't believe in one? Don't worry, some of the people in this movie don't either, though they have reason to wish to. Despite the wishes, they're not sure what to believe in.<br />Except for the superstitious folk who aren't warmly welcoming of outsiders. Most especially if they see the woman in black in the isolated house. The one over the bridge and throught the woo- I mean along the stretch and isolated by a marsh that can easily flood.<br />That's where a young widower must go to prove he wants his job (while trying to find out if he can communicate with his late wife), but things don't always go to plan. Take, for instance, the children. Out of all the suspicious behavior, it's the children who suffer the most (sounds Old Testament to me, whatwith how it says anything bad happens in society, no matter what, the children get it before anyone else), the easiest to influence to committ suicide. Extremely dark for a PG-13 flick, especially when some of it is implied and only one is overtly seen and is not so subtle. Why would a spirit committ children to do unspeakable tragedies upon themselves? Watch and find out, if you can handle creepy vibes, cliched jump tricks done effectively (several were predictable yet still got me), and a fervent characterization in Daniel Radcliffe's character with his interaction with everyone (especially the one villager to actually try to help him out rather than try to scare him off).<br />Though, it's not only the jumps and spirits that can cause uneasy creeps. There's also the local surroundings. And not just the paranoid stares of everyone who lays eyes on Radcliffe, there's also the structure of the mansion itself, which is downright jarring with the antiques, wallpaper, displace lighting, etc. The mansion itself is like a character that adds subtle unease and has secrets of its own.<br />And the history behind the woman in black herself? Now that... is a disgustingly disturbing story all on its own, one worth the dark and twisted story it is in.<br />Keep your friends close when watching this, and your sanity ever closer.own, one worth the dark and twisted story it is in.<br />Keep your friends close when watching this, and your sanity ever closer.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I love John Mayer's music. Period. Born and Raised, I hope will guide musicians towards the one reality..to be an enduring part of any music lover's consideration you need to make good music. Music that defines you and presents your point of view at a particular point in time. The hell with everything else. A good product endures. That's exactly what Born and Raised is all about. Terrific songwriting, gentle harmonies, a general sense of acceptance of a situation beyond one's control. Given the circumstances surrounding his health at the time of this release, this album takes on a far greater meaning (don't know if that's the intent though!).<br /><br />Standout tracks include the title track, Queen of California, Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey. No weak songs or fillers though. This is GOOD Music. Buy it, keep an open mind. Continuum, Try! and all are behind him now. This is the space he occupies at present. This man is truly versatile and with him around..music is in good hands.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|It looks great, but it really doesn't support the kindle firmly, it falls with almost any movement and hey! this is a mobile thing, you are using it in places not necessarily flat, steady surfaces; you are on the go.<br /><br />I think there's a lot of room for improvement in the design of this case. When I see I could have paid $16 (almost half) for other options, It doesn't look like a good purchase decision.<br />It is funny that other \\"reviewers\\" went out of their way to update their review several times for a what... $30 dlls purchase? yeah right.

0345803485|1.0|I am about 40% through this book and cannot go on. I am baffled why anyone likes it. It is painful to read. The erotic parts of the book are anything but because there is no story behind the characters. It is like reading a really bad porn movie without the cheesy music. I just can't understand why anyone likes it.  I wish I could rate this zero stars.

0393088774|5.0|As an economics major, I've been reading many books from both sides of the aisle on how to deal with political economies, especially during recessions. I have come across several Austrian arguments, and now I have a book from the Keynesian circle of economists. This is definitely a game changer for me, and Krugman compels the reader to look closely at his data and the data provided by international organizations such as the IMF to examine the effects of growth policies in the eurozone and in America. I was especially excited to read the sections regarding the European financial crisis because his arguments were extremely well written and convincing. The countries undergoing the most distress were those which chose to take on austerity measures (Krugman goes as far as calling them \\"savage\\").<br /><br />Good book, great read, I definitely recommend it to libertarians.

B0081JDMUW|5.0|I don't know how Joe Bonamassa manages to produce CD after CD with so much vitality while also undertaking such a long touring schedule plus a radio show. He is a rock blues artist and this CD leans towards his blues side, despite covering songs by Bill Withers & Tom Waits. I love his versions of Robert Johnson's `Stones In My Passway' and Howlin Wolf's `Who's Been Talking' which has an intro of about 30 seconds of an interview with Howlin Wolf. (and it works). However the stand out track for me is his version of the Bill Withers classic, `Lonely Town Lonely Street.' Joe Bonamassa fans will not be disappointed, and this CD is also a good introduction for those that are new to this great artist.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|Chronicle is perhaps one of the better POV films to come out in years (or at least since Cloverfield), a pleasure to sit through. Besides being an immensely entertaining film (especially the first and last thirds), Chronicle pushes the medium forward in ways that haven't been explored before. Most of this comes from the use of camera execution. Due to his powers, Andrew can levitate the camera from which we are viewing him, therefore allowing for smooth movement that covers a wider amount of space than before possible. And best of all it fits with the film's internal logic! Use of multiple camera sources (in the last third) create an ever changing and epic capture of a huge event (no spoilers) and every angle is covered.<br />Even better, the film has quality acting from all of the leads, who are always convincing in their roles. The script is tight, and the dialogue is pitch perfect, but some of the characterization is a little shallow and underdeveloped. However this does not hurt the film in any truly noticeable way, and Chronicle provides a refreshing look at superhero and POV films. 9/10 or 5/5
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Waited until this game was featured as free on my Kindle Fire, got it, and now I am hooked onto this game every time I come back from work and during my lunch break. The controls are a bit frustrating though. I spent some time adjusting. Great game, though.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I had the chance to catch LND in a local movie theater the other night as it was playing for one night only.  Being a big Phantom fan, I thought I'd give it a try.  And while this show does not hold a candle to POTO, on its own I think it holds up rather well.  It has all the hallmarks of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical - if someone were to play a random song from it, I could pretty easily guess the composer was ALW without any hints.<br /><br />The basic story line is that 10 years after POTO has ended, Phantom has moved to Coney Island (naturally) and started his own show there that features Meg Giry with Madame Giry overseeing it.  Christine and Raoul are now married with a son, Gustave, who is 10.  Raoul is a real douchebag it turns out - an alcoholic and a gambler - and apparently not very good at basic math.  The couple is broke, and the Phantom manages to lure them to Coney Island with the promise of money if Christine will perform one time.  When they find out that their benefactor is the Phantom, well you can just imagine how everyone feels. The rest of the show basically deals with Christine being torn between two lovers (again) and also facing the fact that Gustave is actually the Phantom's son.  That's right, Raoul - it only takes one night. Ten years ago. Do the math!<br /><br />I found parts of the story a bit contrived at times and there were a few points in the show where I actually had to muffle my laughter when things got a bit campy.  But on the flip side, there were some beautiful songs, especially \\"Til I Hear You Sing\\" and \\"Devil Takes the Hindmost\\" (whatever that means).  Also (and I realize this means I have way too much time on my hands), POTO took place in 1881.  LND takes place in 1907.  That's not 10 years later, but you just have to go with it.  As far as the cast, I thought they were stellar.  And I thought it was filmed beautifully.  You would have had a hard time noticing this was filmed on a theatrical stage and not a sound stage because it had such great camera angles and excellent lighting.<br /><br />So rather than overanalyze it and try to compare it to POTO, it's probably best to judge it on its own merits, and that's why I give it 4 stars.  Great cast, beautiful music, and beautifully staged and filmed.

B0083GPDBO|1.0|Personally, I'm way over the whole hand held camera movies... Sometimes it works really well, Cloverfield is a good example, even the original Blair Witch Project. Chronicle is a perfect example of when it doesn't... and that's really not even the worst part of this movie. What is truly dreadful about this video (cuz it doesn't even rate being called a film by any stretch of the imagination) is the piss poor visual effects. I'm sorry, but every single scene looks amateur and it appears the hand held camera does nothing to help it, much less cover it up.... it's one thing to shoot hand held, fine, it's played out, but I get it. What IS NOT ok, is to put out a movie with a VFX heavy story, that look like some teenager living in their parents basement did it with a cracked copy of After Effects. I go to school with guys that would be \\"mortified\\" to turn in a class project much less homework that looks this bad.... if it doesn't rate student work, it shouldn't rate your hard earned movie dollars, much less your time.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|The BK-2 is an excellent knife and my primary choice when I go out in the wilderness.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-1095 Cro-van Steel is an extremely versatile steel. It holds an edge well, sharpens easily, and is able to get extremely sharp.<br />-The grivory handle is contoured nicely with a decent palm swell that fits my hand perfectly. (I did however purchase the micarta handles for more comfort while working for a long duration.)<br />-This knife can be customized and modded fairly easily. It has several aftermarket items to customize it to your liking.<br />-The sheath has excellent retention.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The sheath. They need to make the belt loop part of the sheath out of a more durable and stiffer material, it's just thin nylon. I've also heard rumors that the sheath will dull the blade, this is not the case with my sheath. The retention may be too much; I have to use a considerable amount of force to remove the knife from the sheath. I can still do it one handed, but it takes effort.<br /><br />-This is not really a con, but because the blade is so thick, it is pretty heavy. If you own a standard 7\\" Ka-bar, this thing feels about twice as heavy to me. I like the added weight, but some may not.<br /><br />All in all, a very good knife. Worth the purchase. I stiffened the belt loop of my sheath using gorilla tape and that fixed my sheath problem.

0345803485|2.0|I was strongly encouraged to read this book by two women (both over age 40). I'm still trying to figure out why. The book is somewhat interesting at first, but once the main character becomes involved with Christian (the other main character), everything thereafter is dedicated to talking about how perfect, intelligent, well educated, anatomically perfect (and well endowed, in Christian's case), and psychologically insightful these two are. I agree with the other reviewers who mentioned the repetitious nature of the writing. There is a thing called a thesaurus. Surely there are other words to describe an erection (i.e., tumescence?).<br />My main issues are as follows. First, did anyone edit this book (aside from the author)? Because she uses the word \\"disorientated,\\" which does not exist. She also cannot spell \\"sandals\\" (sandles). Again, even the most basic spell check program would have caught these errors. Second, I take issue with the fact that although Ana keeps saying she isn't submissive, she behaves very submissively with not only Christian but most of the other characters as well. In addition, both she and Christian are completely codependent and \\"cannot live without each other,\\" have suicidal ideation at the thought of losing the other, but then talk about this as love. Gross. That is not love, it is mental illness. It's as though a couple of people in recovery relapsed and wrote a book together. And Christian is beyond a stalker. Ana seems to find his tendencies charming. As someone who has been stalked, I find this appalling. There were many times that I wanted to reach through the pages and slap her. Her pathological need to keep Christian from becoming angry with her is disturbing to say the least. Third, the whole notion of someone who orgasms continuously from just being touched, and cannot bring herself to say no to sex because her \\"body betrays her\\" - come on. Did a woman really write this? I'm not saying that women can't have orgasms during theirfirst sexual encounter, but a virgin being body slammed by a man with an enormous penis who then experiences several \\"bone crushing\\" orgasms is just a bit outside the realm of real life.
0345803485|2.0|Where do I start? I tried to like the book but it was rubbish. This author was totally trying to look cool, young and hip but her age showed through the main character ANA. Please tell me what 21 year old says \\"make love to me\\". Let me count the ways..<br /><br />REASON 1- The author is so repetitive example, my inner goddess is jumping up and down...my inner goddess wants to see the room of pain..my inner goddess is doing cartwheel. All I was freaking reading was Ana's thoughts. It was like reading a high school diary<br /><br />Reason 2- Completely unrealistic! What couple is having sex 6 times in 1 day. What are you a robot.. oh and if it couldn't get any crazier this chick is a virgin. Give me a break! Also, Christian has money to burn but we never seem him working, he just spends money and bones. We never know how he became so successful.<br /><br />Reason 3- I found this book more border line abusive, and it wasn't over the sex! Surprise They never really have any s&m type sex. Christian feels the need to tell Ana what she should eat how, what to wear, what to say etc etc. And this girl allows herself to be a door mat! Christian never seemed at any point attractive to me. He was downright creepy
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After reading the first one in paperback, I immediately downloaded the second (Fifty Shades Darker) on my Kindle. The second novel doesn't have the same \\"novelty\\" as the first. The sex scenes become repetitive and you get a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling. I did like the plotline of the ex submissive stalker but even that wasn't a satisfying conclusion. I doubt I will read the third... maybe if I'm bored this summer.

B000LXH0AE|3.0|I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell.  But in \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\", he does something I didn't think possible - he made me care about his character.  In a turn that blends comedy and drama, Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS auditor whose highly regimented life gets turned upside down when he meets Ana (the charming Maggie Gyllenhaal), a baker who is delinquent on her taxes, and starts hearing the voice of his creator, author Karen Eiffel (the perfectly neurotic Emma Thompson) in his head.  A trivial thing, setting his wristwatch, puts Harold in danger of dying, something Miss Eiffel's protagonists do with alarming regularity.  But Harold's awareness puts him on a mission to find out what's going on and more importantly how to avoid getting killed off.<br /><br />Ferrell plays Harold with great balance.  As opposed to movies like \\"Elf\\" and \\"Anchorman\\", where he seems to be nothing more than a big goofy kid, Ferrell allows a conflicted man to emerge.  He likes Ana, but refuses cookies from her because they could be considered a bribe.  He enjoys structure in life, but is taken by Ana's carefree attitude.  And though he understands why his death is eminent, he yearns to remain alive.<br /><br />Ferrell, Gylenhaal, and Thompson emerge as the real gems in this movie.  They shine.  The same cannot be said, however, for Dustin Hoffman, who basically phones in his role as literary professor Jules Hilbert, and Queen Latifah, who basically has no role at all as Penny, the assistant sent from the publishing house to make sure Eiffel turns her manuscript in on time.  As some other reviewers have also noted, it is a bit odd that both Eiffel and her creation would exist in the same universe.  It does make things a bit fast and loose.  Despite that, \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" proves that the comically-inclined Ferrell can handle a more meaty role.  It's not the Great American Movie, but it is a nice change-of-pace picture for a rainy afternoon.

1439127700|5.0|I have just finished The Presidents Club by Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffey and cannot recommend it too highly. Particularly in this day and age of widely diverse political beliefs and hateful rhetoric, this book reminds us that there is a common ground for us all. I did not find this book to be Republican or Democratic in view, but rather a colorful and insightful review of the Presidents from Truman through Obama. It emphasizes the support and advice each sitting President received from the past presidents. And how to a man, they all considered the \\"Office of President\\" to be more important then the actual office holder. Many interesting antidotes are described of actual warm and lasting friendships that developed from harsh campaign rhetoric, and conversations/meetings/diplomacy and advise that the general public never knew about. The three words the authors use to describe the Presidents Club were \\"cooperation, competition and consolation\\". As each Presidents Club member realized no one but a former President could understand the pressure and problems of that office. \\"On the one hand, the presidents have powerful motives - personal and patriotic - to help one another succeed and comfort one another when they fail\\". Harry Truman stated he would not criticize a sitting president because he believed \\"more time must pass before anyone, even an ex-president, can evaluate the performance of a man in the White House\\". Each President from Truman through Obama seems to me to be given a balanced portrait of their strengths and weaknesses but only in the greater picture of the \\"Office\\" itself. I gained a good deal of insight from this book and will treasure it in the upcoming campaign.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|After reading the reviews, I was expecting an unlikely romance between two intriguing characters from completely different worlds. Part of my assumption was correct, but Beautiful Disaster turned out to be so, SO much more than that. I love the struggles that Travis and Abby go through in their relationship, not only because of their problems with each other, but because of their own battles with themselves. Jamie McGuire really does an incredible job, and I'm surprised at what some of the negative reviewers have said about this book because it seems like they had such a superficial view on the characters.<br /><br />Aside from that, the plot is also very...interesting, lol. It really is unexpected without being too ridiculous. I've gotten so tired of being able to predict what's going to happen next in some books, so Beautiful Disaster is very refreshing. And yes, there are a few grammar mistakes here and there but do remember that Jamie McGuire self-published this book, and it is still remarkably written. Honestly it's written better than some books by well-known publishers, in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I could not give Beautiful Disaster anything less than 5 stars. Thank you Jamie McGuire for this beautiful book - I've already started reading it over again. :)
B007V2UGPE|2.0|Game is fun but takes lots of grinding to earn enough to upgrade army.  Glitch lost days work worth of upgrades several times. Uninstalled when it sent an ad notification in the middle of the night using text notification sound.
B0072M9PM8|5.0|I agree completely with C. Welch.  This is a terrific album.  I think its their best since Sonic.  Good n Evil was heavy and cool but was kinda missing that unique twist that have always made the Cult different from the other hard rock bands.  Born Into This was ehhh. Three good tracks on it.  Not gritty enough.  This record has everything you can want out of the band if you're a fan and love their classic three records.  Though this brings back some of the stylistic magic of Love, Electric and Sonic Temple, Choice of Weapon is its own original style, message and music.  Ian's voice and phrasing is so instantly original and recognizable as it's always been and Billy's no nonsense riffs are better than ever.  The capsule tracks are cool as well while not quite as edgy as \\"Choice\\" but a bit more atmospheric and spacey.  Billy's guitar work is really sweet on these tracks.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors so I like just about anything he writes, but this was a good book and I liked the storyline alot. Worth reading.
B000683VI4|2.0|My gf pretty much forced me to watch this flick with her and I resented every minute of it. If you're a guy, I would highly advise against watching this movie. Very sappy.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I didn't dislike the book but it was not one of my favorites.  I thought it was poorly written but having said that I read the whole thing simply because I wanted to find out how it ended and now I want to see how the other 2 books end. I have read much more interesting books and much better written books.  The sexual parts to the book, which is alot, do not really offend me, after awhile it is kind of tiring but I want to see how they all end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it and the games are easy and really fun. Most of them my three year old even plays.
0375842209|4.0|This is a historical fiction novel written for young adults. The author did a great job making a very original WWII plot. He made it very original by writing it from the point of view from death, and somehow making the reader feel empathetic for death, which is quite a feat. Most of the story takes place in Molching Germany during WWII. It is the story of a young girl named Liesel Meminger, who was forced to live with foster parents after her mother can no longer take care of her. In the process of moving to her new home, her younger brother passed away. She comes to Munich to live with Hans and Rosa Hubermann. She immediately becomes very close to her new papa, Hans. Hans soon teaches Liesel how to read and write, which shows Liesel her true love, books. Liesel becomes best friends with her neighbor Rudy Steiner, and they will stay close throughout the novel. Liesel will meet many hardships throughout the novel, and will learn the true power of words. I liked this meaning Zusak conveys that words hold great power. I liked how Zusak did not spare the reader. Meaning he would do whatever it took in the novel to further progress the reader's feelings towards the main characters. One thing i might have changed would be to say how Liesel's life was after the bombing, in order to show the reader how she dealt with further tragedy in her life.

031618201X|4.0|the parasol protectorate ventures to the original vampire's home in egypt this time, taking along the baby and the whole crew of characters.  it's quiet the adventure to be sure. the french woman - can't recall her name- is still very nebulous and one still doesn't really know what side she is on.  Many big changes in this novel leaving this series open to many avenues - scotland, a new hive and the baby, prudence growing up... the adventure will be rollicking a bit absurd and entertaining.

B005DGJTC6|5.0|I was dismayed to learn this wonderfully different version of the King Arthur legend was cancelled.  It was so refreshingly new and didn't overwhelm the viewer with too much blood and guts or SEX, which is most likely why it didn't make it.  Too bad,  real quality viewing opportunities are fewer and fewer and most new series only make it for one or two seasons.  My DVD library collection is filled with these short series.
0439023521|5.0|It was action packed, and kept me up all night! The character development is great, and it leads very well into the following books in the trilogy.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|this game looked ok but it took and hour and a half for it to download and the game wasn't even that good.
0439023491|4.0|Fantastic book. Was hoping for a bit more resolution at the end, then I picked up the third book and started right away, so it was no big deal.
B007SGM084|5.0|My wife wanted the book. Now, on her SECOND reading, it has added a certain 'zest' to our relationship. Highly recommend the book for improved relationships.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love detail in a book, but this book had far too many uninteresting details. I was pleased with how the trilogy ended, it just took Collins far too many pages to get there.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I was playing around with the controls and decided to click on the question mark in the top right corner next to the menu. And to my great surprise there was not only a link to the wikipedia page (which has in depth instructions for those of you complaining) but instructions on how to fill a line. You have to tap and hold the square you want to start with until a ring appears. Then you just drag until all your lines are filled! So this game is amazing and perfect!
0876391277|5.0|This book has a great deal of information about creative playing. It also has a clear sense on the concept of how to use sound effects on reed instruments, and it's explained in a very detailed, clear, fun and encouraging manner. It gives also concepts, and exercises that will help you develop your own sound through experimentation, which is ultimately what every player should look for. This book is a  great way to encourage your imagination through concise exercises, presented in a very entertaining way. I highly recommend it!
B007SPPANM|5.0|I believe I've watched this movie more than 5 times. It's one of my Favorites! The acting performance of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet was Fantastic, the love story was Mesmerizing, and the music was just the icing on the cake that blended well. The history of the Titanic and how it happened up until who survived was interesting, sad, and thought-provoking. Many moments of this movie make you laugh, or bring tears to your eyes. I consider this 'a classic' as I would 'Gone With The Wind.' The action and intense suspense had you on the edge of your seat as you watch the ship crumble to pieces with panic and tragic events of the passengers aboard. The characters were all unique in their specific roles and the emotional roller-coaster ride was one a viewer will never forget. Recommended for all those who love historic events that replay a certain mark in life, combined with action, suspense and romance. This is the type of movie I would watch again-and-again to make sure I haven't missed anything. Incredible Movie, Excellent acting and music!
0307352145|5.0|As a practitioner of the MBTI, I was a bit skeptical when reading buying this book but after reading and reflecting, I realized that I've been practicing the Free Trait Theory for the past 6 years traveling the country teaching workshops.  What I thought was extroversion simply wasn't.  The book made me think back to my teen years and on my most rewarding work experiences - they were all introverted activities.<br /><br />This book has made a profound difference in how I view myself - feel very comfortable in my own skin now!!!<br /><br />Highly recommend this book for extroverts and introverts!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Highly recommended for all science fiction lovers, who enjoy explosive action from beginning to end. If you enjoyed 'Independence Day' with introduction of aliens, battles of fire and explosions, then you'll enjoy 'Battleship' as well. Special effects are amazing with unique technology as we view earth invasion. Introduction of the U.S. military in all their fighting glory gives additional thrilling moments with unstoppable action. Very entertaining from beginning to end!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter and I both play it almost all day long. It's fun and addicting. The only problem is the level-up bar by village name is blinking with glitches now and the collection screen will do it to. But I still love the game!
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Heart and hip devouring country-garage soul with some southern Alabama blues thrown in--led<br />  by the distinctly addictive voice of Brittany Howard, who's sort of a modern day pop/rock version<br />  of Otis Redding meets Amy Winehouse/Janis Joplin.

0307730697|5.0|Fearless easily makes it into the top 10 best books that I've read.<br /><br />What makes this book so special is that it is about a very special man. Fearless is about a man who was a husband, a father, a son, and a SEAL Team SIX Operator. The book follows the life of Adam Brown from small town kid all the way to the top tier of the US Military. It takes you into the very heart of this remarkable man, revealing his strengths, and his struggles; bringing you at last to his ultimate sacrifice in the mountains of Afganistan.<br /><br />Before I can go more in depth on the story of Adam Brown, I think it's absolutely necessary to talk about the writing. Without the caliber of writing that Eric Blehm brought to this book, and the extensive research, and interviews (and who knows what else), this story could not have the impact that it does. It also speaks to the type of person Eric is, that he was able to get so many interviews with Adam's SEAL Team SIX unit, as I can't imagine those men would have trusted just anyone with Adam's story.  Eric is an author I will definitely be following.<br /><br />Back to Adam.<br /><br />I won't bother summarizing the story, as you can get that pretty well from the jacket copy, but I do want to talk about why I think this book will have such an impact on the reader.<br /><br />One of the most powerful things about Adam's story is how genuinely human he was. What I mean by that is: he was like you and I. Sometimes in these stories of people overcoming obstacles and fighting their demons, the actual person gets lost. Or, in these types of posthumous biographies, the story ends up being sanitized or aggrandized, and its integrity is lost. That's not the case with Fearless. Adam expressly requested that his whole story be told (a brave thing itself). I'm glad he did, because what emerges from the book is a portrait of a man, a man that struggled with some very dark sides of his nature, a man that never had a \\"miraculous deliverance experience\\" and never was able to get the formulaic fixes to work, yet still was able to, somehow, \\"make it\\". The powerful thing about that is, I believe, that for most of us, this is our own experience. Not everyone struggles with cocaine addiction like Adam, but we each face our own obstacles, and we all look for those \\"miraculous moments\\" which never seem to show up. Sometimes we don't think we can \\"make it\\" without them, but the truth of Adam's story is that most often, we don't understand that we have been given everything we need to \\"make it\\", and frequently, the only miracle we need is for us to get up and get to it. (I know it's not always quite as simple as that, but the essence is the same)<br /><br />The same was true for Adam. He found (and was given) what he needed, which in his case was faith, the love of a good woman, and his family--and then he got to it. Was his life perfect and rosy after that? By no means! He faced some horrific things, paid costs you and I would consider \\"way too much\\", and he still struggled with his own demons the whole time. The man was incredible though, in his tenacity and strength. He faced these things in himself and while on the battlefield, and eventually finished victorious during a mission in Afghanistan, protecting you and I.<br /><br />After finishing this book, Adam Brown is my hero. He should be yours too.<br /><br />Read the book.
B00846F1YW|4.0|fun and entertaining! easy to understand. tap and play..nice story line continuation of #1<br />Mysteryville. I would recommend. this game.
B006P0FIGU|4.0|I've been a fan of the Musketeers since I saw the 70's versions.  Disney's rendition was just bleh... The Musketeer was cool.  The 70's ones were awesome.  This one is closer to those, imho, and threatened to unseat the original as my favourite, but I don't think it can quite cut it... close, though.<br /><br />* SPOILERS BELOW *<br /><br />I really don't understand why people are complaining that it's an action flick... or super-hero-esque... that's what the Musketeers are! I personally don't care whether or not it remains \\"true\\" to the original story, whatever, exactly, that might mean.<br /><br />Though the story is a little used because of the previous movies, it feels pretty fresh. But they did actually put some effort into the characters and plot and made them different than in the older movies, but just as good.<br /><br />That they made D'Artagnan younger and gave him an age-related dynamic with the Louis was neat.  That they made him that young also fit with his cockiness much better than the older incarnations in the other movies.  Louis was hysterical, and I'm glad they made him somewhat of a twit. The dialog was witty, funny, and well written (except for one part below). The sword fighting was extremely fun to watch, which is part of why I like the originals so much.<br /><br />That said, there were a couple of things that weren't so great.  I hate that ploy where writers give the main character some witty remark early on in the movie, and have him repeat it at the end... IT'S LAME, and it was lame when it happened in this movie.  It wasn't, however, a deal killer.  Milla Jovavich was disappointing, though, and she's the reason I had to give the movie only 4 stars.  She left the role feeling pretty empty, which is sad. I haven't enjoyed a single movie of hers since  The 5th Element.  So, bad casting job for the Countess, but the rest were great.
B004LFO0ME|5.0|This album is amazing. You can't use Youtube forever to get your music fix, buy the songs and take them with you. Enough said.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Did not like the resolution. Is Jacob guilty in fact or only in his parents' eyes? Why did Dan Rifkin attack the father? Also, people are hanged not hung. Roy Scheider did not encourage his children into the water in \\"Jaws.\\" On the contrary, he discouraged his boys from entering the ocean in \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Jaws\\" the sequal. In Spielberg's \\"Jaws\\", Murray Hamilton encouraged the mayor of Amity to bring his grandchildren into the water. Little mistakes in editing make a novel less believable.<br /><br />Anyhow, who cares what I think? But an educated lawyer would not use hung for hanged. Do da do dah.

B0072M9PM8|5.0|Finally after the ho-hum pop/rock cd Born Into This, we get the triumphant return of The Cult. A cd of 14 new tracks<br />if you are a casual fan and 10 new for the die-hards since 4 were released a year or so ago in capsule format.<br />What you get with this release is a culmination of Love, Electric, Sonic Temple, Black Sheep and Beyond G&E.<br />They took everything they learned (or innovated) and then Bob Rock came in and said take all that greatness<br />and lets bring it to the present and just blow the doors off.  This cd is loud and proud.  Lean and mean.<br />And I'm loving every second of it from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />The songs have a bite which was definitely missing from BIT.  The first song is really nothing like anything<br />I have heard from The Cult before.  It's more punk sounding.  The chorus is just not their usual.  And that<br />is not a bad thing.  I like the idea of them stretching a bit more.  The second song almost sounds like the<br />opening to Nico from BGAE.  There is an opening on one track that reminds me of Dreamtime.  There are flourishes<br />of Love all over the place.  Some Electric and Sonic too.  This cd just brought all of it together.  I think<br />that is why I love it so much<br /><br />I read one review on here that said that if this had been the follow up to BGAE that the fans would not have<br />been disappointed.  I think that statement is dead on.  Though Ian has turned his back on that release I think<br />that it was a fine hard rock cd but the songwriting was missing some hooks.  Then they followed that up by<br />having Youth produce the next release was just a mistake.  But they learned from it and now we have this release<br />and I could not be happier.<br /><br />The production is tight.  The Billy's guitar sound is just amazing.  It's been brought out of the muck and he<br />sound fresh and invigorated.  Ian's howl is beautiful.  His passion comes through.  The rhythm section is the<br />best we have had.  And I have been a proponent of Matt Sorum returning.  But Tempesta put that to rest for me.<br />He and Chris Wyse have brought it.  Heavy, tight and perfect sounding.  They gelled.<br /><br />Even the packaging on this cd is awesome.  And to have Mike Dimkich (the 5th Cult Member) listed in the liners<br />was nice to see.  The guy is great for them live.  Better than Billy Morrison who was just a stellar player in<br />his own right.<br /><br />This is a near perfect cd.  10 new songs for the Die Hard Fan and 14 new songs for the new or casual listener<br />to the Cult as 4 from the 2nd disc were released as capsules a while back.  On the 4 soley produced by Chris<br />Goss you can hear the difference in sound from when Bob Rock took over.  Goss gave the songs a more industrial<br />metal sound.  Good for sure.  But Bob Rock really made it come together.  If I could change 1 thing on this<br />entire release, it would be to have 1 more heavy track and 1 less slow track.  That's it.  Otherwise, in my<br />mind the Cult is back.  And as usual they will be ignored.  And it's a shame because very few bands are able<br />to write a cd as good as this.  Not Van Halen and their rehashing their B-Side throw aways.  Not Metallica<br />and their attempt to find themselves.  Not Aerosmith and their hired gun writers and cheese fest lyrics.

Not Van Halen and their rehashing their B-Side throw aways.  Not Metallica<br />and their attempt to find themselves.  Not Aerosmith and their hired gun writers and cheese fest lyrics.
B007R6X9IK|5.0|Symbiosis is the only way to describe Dave Gahan's voice rising and falling within these beautiful arrangements. It is a magical match. Dave dug much deeper than usual on lyrics, probably motivated by the Soulsaver tracks. If you like surprises this is definately one. The quality of the songs is superb, better than anything else out there right now.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I am sorry I bought this predictable drivel. It was so boring. Not to tell you how to spend your money, but this, libraray patrons, was a snore. It did not hold my interest nor did it entertain me. Please, save your money on this series. If you saw the movie, I hoped you like that.
B00846REIS|5.0|As a 50 Shades of Grey fan I must say I have been searching for quite a while for something that would help me through my Christian Grey withdrawl!  Unfortunately I've read some really over the top disgusting tales in my pursuit. Finally I found Bared to You...This is it!!!  In fact, I found this story more believable than 50 Shades.  Wishing I didn't have to wait for the sequel though.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the story line.  In the beginning, as others have mentioned, it is similar to 50 Shades but I didn't find it as \\"dark\\" which I actually liked.<br /><br />If anyone out there can suggest similar books please...comment on my review.  Not looking for kinky crazy with an unbelievable plot...just something extremely steamy & hot that offers more than 200-300 pages.  That's what this book offers. When you search for books like this you often get books that offer 15 - 90 pages of pure smut.  This has a story that you can believe although my own life is rather boring in comparison!<br /><br />I tend to read two books at the same time.  Once I picked this one up I couldn't do my normal switch up and I ended up reading the entire thing in a day!  Worth every penny IF you like books like 50 Shades.
B004OXCL5Q|3.0|There is no doubt that this is a good film:  the acting, the plot, and the themes are strong, the sets and props are wonderful.  You can imagine you are in medieval Spain, with its jousts, wars with the Moors, and wily courtiers.  It is a good place to spark an interest in history, not because it is factual but in order to understand the truth behind the myth.  It also is a good portrait of a reluctant leader, thrust into greatness and growing into the role.  Finally, the values in it - tolerance of diversity, seeking the truth, and doing the right thing regardless of the personal price that must be paid - are laudable and worth discussing.<br /><br />However, the film lacks subtlety of character:  the heros and those redeemed do not even seem all that human, when compared to, say, the personal struggle for faith by Ben Hur.  Moreover, the dialogue is laden with platitudes - \\"honor\\", \\"God-given king\\", \\"glory\\", etc. - and is flat, denuded of the poetry of language that it is the stuff of great writing.  In short, instead of suspending my disbelief and becoming engrossed in the story, it seemed such a blatant product of \\"Hollywood\\", even though it was filmed in fascist Spain.  When the glitz and highfalutin verbiage are brushed aside, this is a standard potboiler.<br /><br />The film seeks to create a myth about the Cid, a medieval knight who shows mercy to moslem forces and gains their loyalty.  Based as it is largely on Racine's play, he kills his future father in law in a matter of honor and thereby is estranged from his fiancee until his pure heart and loyalty to what is right win her back over.  In the meantime, as an exile he engages in civil war against a sleazy king and then against invading North Africans.  As a martyr in the end, he transforms his ancient adversaries into better men and enshrines himself in legend.  This largely works, but expecting anything beyond what is basically a romantic melodrama is too big a stretch for me.  It also fills in the significant gaps in the historical record with fiction; in fact, little is known of the Cid, beyond that he was a solider of fortune who fought on both sides.<br /><br />As a bluray, the images are spectacular.  However, except for dialogue, I found the sound too loud, particularly the blaring trumpets of the lugubrious musical score.  The extras are also predominantly the publicist fluff one expects in these things, but there was an interesting documentary on the producer that is critical and honest; I learned that he was more or less a con man, unable to manage money or relationships, but capable of extraordinary networking, and indeed successful with this film, at least, which is rightly regarded as a classic epic.  It does have one laughable extra feature, a kind of lecture by John Bevere, who is a fundamentalist spewing the crudest patriotism and twisting the values of the film to his \\"vision\\"; for example, he says he bars his kids from watching most PG films (I suppose like Home Alone) because they would teach them \\"to disrespect their parents\\", but thinks El Cid is his kinda film.  After this embarrassing preaching, my son and I discussed the kind of mind that would reason like him, also instructive.<br /><br />Recommended as good fun.  Just don't expect it to be art and leave your worldly cynicism behind.ificant gaps in the historical record with fiction; in fact, little is known of the Cid, beyond that he was a solider of fortune who fought on both sides.<br /><br />As a bluray, the images are spectacular.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I was initially excited to hear that a BDSM novel had gone mainstream.  I was also initially excited to hear that a work of fanfiction had been adapted to be an original novel and sold in the mainstream market.  I thought these were exciting new developments, and could only mean good things.<br /><br />HOW WRONG I WAS.  This book is a complete disappointment.  Poorly written?  Don't make me laugh.  Poorly written would be a compliment, 50 Shades is barely readable, and what you do read infuriates you to the point of fictional-character-homocide with its lazy plot and character development (plot holes big enough to lose a bus in), overuse and misuse of words, labels, imagery, phrases and cliches, and what seems to be a case of an amateurish-at-best editing process.<br /><br />Firstly, no matter its origins, I paid for an original novel.  This means that somewhere between first draft and publishing, this novel should have been stripped of its \\"Twilight-ness\\" and reworked so that original ideas and facts filled those holes.  Unfortunately, this never happened.  Ana is so blatantly Bella, the only thing that has been changed is a name-swap.  Similarly, characters that might have been useful and relevant to the story when it was a Twilight fanfiction (eg. name-swapped-Jacob and name-swapped-Mike), are now redundant.  They often only relate to the plot in that they are clumsily used to tick the boxes of Twilight canon.  Yes, name-swapped Mike (whose parents also own the hardware store that name-swapped-Bella works in) inexplicably likes Ana/Bella, and appears in an early scene seemingly to demonstrate just this and thus show how desirable Ana/Bella is to both the reader and Grey/name-swapped-Edward (who is an incredibly busy CEO yet somehow has enough time to stalk Ana and find out where she works, then toodle down and stock up on cable ties, rope and duct tape.  Real subtle, real classy), even though Ana totally doesn't think she's pretty or worth any boy's admiration.There are many characters which serve no purpose in the story, yet the reader is subjected to paragraphs or even pages of interaction with them: I am only poorer for having had to read pointlessly about how Ana/Bella has family out of town and she calls them regularly and all her irrelevant family history about her airy-fairy mother and her non-committal father.  Plus there were whole conversations of nothing - filler just to prove (or so it seemed) that these characters existed.  WHO CARES IF THEY EXIST, I DON'T WANT YOU TO PROVE TO ME HOW TRUE TO BELLA'S FAMILY SITUATION AND CANON FAMILY MEMBERS YOU'VE STAYED. THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE STORY.<br />  Ugh.  I could go on forever about how even in the smallest details, this book is a blatant mimicry of Twilight (the busted up old car, the clumsiness, the intrusive stalkerish-ness of the male lead), and I'm surprised copyright laws hasn't started calling it a plagiarism now that E.L. James is profiting from it.<br /><br />Secondly, when I buy something that has been professionally published, and has ostensibly been through a professional editing process, I DO expect that it reads like someone's made even a half-decent whack at editing it into shape.  If I were an editor and a copy of 50 Shades as it is now was handed to me to edit for publication, my first reaction would be to send it back to the author and get them to work on it themselves for a while, because by the time a book reaches an editor it should already be pretty polished.  So I am astounded that the published copy of 50 Shades is actually so terrible and the writing and style so poor - like I said, it feels like I'm reading a first draft which needs a lot of work, and this is after its been edited and published!<br />  There were inconsistencies within characters, such as Ana showing on several occasions that she was well-acquainted with swear words, and had no problems using them, and then on the next page saying \\"oh, my!\\"  She's 21 for God's sake!  Firstly;  even if she didn't like to swear she's unlikely to use such a dated phrase, let alone make it her every-two-pages catchphrase, and secondly; who alternatively swears freely then acts all prim and proper?  No reason is forthcoming on why Ana seems to have two distinct and contradicting sides of her personality.  I understand complex characters having interwoven facets of their personality, different aspects coming to the fore depending on the context, but that is not the case with Ana, she flips back and forth without any explanation or even integration of the two sides of her.<br />On a related note: over and over again I wanted to scream or tear my hair out as Ana anthropomorphised her subconscious and something she likes to call her 'inner goddess'.  I have no idea what the point of either of these two ridiculous 'characters' was - both only really appeared when the issue of sex came up, and the subconscious always 'ran and hid' from Ana's scandalous thoughts (not sure where or how, I am convinced Ana's head is entirely devoid of a brain), whereas the 'inner goddess' was like an irritating and immature emoticon, and either strutted and puffed up her chest proudly, or jumped up and down and waved pom poms.  Jesus Christ, gag me with a spoon.  No seriously, it would be more pleasant than having to stomach any more of E.L. James's characterisation.<br />  But wait there's more - E.L James is so bad at developing rounded and realistic characters, or even two-dimensional characters, that she resorts to getting other characters to proscribe character traits.  When Ana first meets Grey for an interview for the college newspaper (In a scenario so ridiculous, artificial and clumsy that it could be the premise of a meeting in an amateur porn video - Ana's roommate is the head of the paper but is too sick to take the interview, and Grey is too busy being an incredibly important CEO of a successful company to reschedule, so Ana is clearly the only option to fill in, eventhough she doesn't even work for the paper or have any journalism experience) he describes how good he is at his job, managing his employees, his company's projects and interests, and information, and she decides that he is clearly a 'control freak'.  Um, no.  He's a CEO of a large and successful company.  He describes himself as having exacting standards both for him employees and in his own management of his employees and company, but not outside what is appropriate and REQUIRED for being a CEO.  Anyway, Ana likes the label of 'control freak' so much that it basically becomes Grey's nickname in her internal monologues from then on, which are needlessly lengthy and whiny and ill-informed.<br />  AND THE FILLER. OMFG THE FILLER. Not just sentences that were dumb and would make the story richer by being pruned, but paragraphs and pages of waffle.  Not even just waffle.  Poorly written waffle, with bad style, grammar and structure.<br /><br />Thirdly -- and I do not claim to be an expert or the one-and-only authority on the subject, and even within the BDSM community I'm sure there are a range of opinions on how realistic the BDSM relationship in 50 Shades was portrayed: I'm sure there will be many people with more authority on the subject than I who disagree with me, but I think many will agree with me -- I dislike how the BDSM relationship between Ana and Grey was portrayed.  I do not think it is accurate and I don't particularly think their relationships is a healthy one.  That is not to say that I don't think any BDSM relationships can be healthy: I believe that people can engage in both healthy BDSM love relationships and BDSM sexual relationships.  But Grey does not come off as a a truly caring and responsible master - he seems too selfish and possessive.  The BDSM community's mantra for safe practice is 'safe, sane and consensual', and I'm not sure that Ana and Grey's relationship always abides by that, particularly considering that her has no problem using illegal technology to invade her privacy and track her mobile signal before they are even involved; espouses the importance of full disclosure before getting embroiled in a sexual/romantic relationship with Ana, but leads her on and encourages her interest in him before he even tells her that he only does BDSM sex and only does contractual sexual relationships, not romantic ones; and always seems to remove Ana from familiar or neutral locations and whisk her off to his what is firmly his own territory when she is physically or emotionally vulnerable (instead of helping her get to a safe location that is 'her own' territory).<br />  I understand that romance books and erotic books don't always aim for realism (nor is it something their readers particularly seek) and are often designed to push the envelope for the sake of titillation and thrills.  However, I think when you are portraying a minority group (as the BDSM community could be argued to be), especially if you are not part of the minority group, you should be aware that minority groups are often misunderstood or discriminated against by the majority, and you have a responsibility to portray that community both accurately and sensitively.<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
0345803493|5.0|Outstanding book!! The second in the series of books from this new author!! I couldn't put the book down!! I read it in a weekend!!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|It was very good. I really enjoy watching it. It was worth the money. I would recomend this movies to a friend.
0345803485|4.0|This book will capture your attention right from the start. It is VERY graphic, but good. This is the authors first book & you can tell that with some of the words she uses. I am educated & I still had to use my imagination of the meanings of several words when I wasn't near a dictionary. The second book in this series is outstanding!! I couldn't put it down. So the writing gets better. Well worth the money to buy the series of books at one time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book(s) is intoxicating!When you get book 1,you might as well go ahead and get 2 & 3. Great read from cover to cover.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|I grew up on Van Halen, first album I bought was Van Halen, Van Halen.  Saw them in 1985 for the 1984 album, so after so many years had given up on them. Van Hagar years were OK, but were missing that swagger.  I originally hesitated on buying this album as thought they were just cashing in and did not want to be disappointed.  I have listened to this for over a month, and it really grows.  Tattoo Tattoo was great from the first listen, but the others were so so at first.  The album has really grown on me, bullet head!!!, This is the old Van Halen and it really fits for me.  If you liked the Van Hagar years, definitely not for you, but if you liked the Van Halen years, you will be pleasantly suprised.  Hope they make up for lost time, but if not, thanks for this.  Many great memories.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|One of the best free games on the app store for Kindle Fire!!  It has a zoom feature, the ability to drag and select multiple boxes!!  No problems so far on my Kindle Fire(KNOCK ON WOOD!!)so not sure why others are having problems.  1.6 I solved with no problem although others have been unable to solve it.  So Despite problems others have had I don't see any of them and I highly recommend you to download this game especially if you love puzzle games!!!  (KNOCKS ON WOOD AGAIN FOR GOOD MEASURE!!!)
B004G5ZY7E|3.0|I don't know if this book lost something in the translation, but I just couldn't get into it. I could not care about any of the characters because there was no character development and they remained strangers.  I found the story very confusing, one development piling onto another without coming to a concllusion on the first. The killer was obvious from the beginning, he was the only one who made sense. I kept putting this book down and picking it up again with no sense of anticipation. I think ,in the future, I will stick to American authors.
0345803485|5.0|I love this book, it was my first introduction to erotic novels hahaha. I found that I couldn't put it down once I started reading,completed the 1st book within 2 days. Thankfully I bought all three at the same time, for I was left wanting more and had to know what happens next.It is a bit detailed during the sex scene's but I guess thats what makes the book. I have since read all and wasn't disappointed, just left me wanting more. I have lent them out to several people and they have all raved about the books, even the more reserved of them. Really felt like I was part of the story if that makes since.

0307950689|1.0|I came to like Dan Brown after reading Angels and Demons, then on to Deception Point and Digital Fortress.  What Dan Brown does in researching all the information he lacks in filtering what is truly necessary for the reader to absorb.  In order to unlock a mystery we don't need half of what Brown throws at us.  For example he goes on and on about the meaning of word and then juxtaposes that with the symbolism of the word then mixes it with the different interpretations of the word.  At one point during my reading I felt like I was being lectured rather than entertained by the plot elements, which lets be honest were severely in short supply in this latest Langdon saga.  That's right saga, it just kept going and going.  I honestly wish Brown's computer would have crashed 3/4 of his way through this novel and just given up writing this one all together.  The last two chapters of this book where Robert and his latest *love interest* babble on seems like Brown took the last bit of his research notes and threw them into idle chit chat for our benefit. BLAH!!!<br /><br />*(that's right latest love interest, not only is there one woman dumb enough to fall for this boring guy, we can't forget that there were 2 ahead of this little starlet).  Let us not also forget that one of these damsels was the direct descendant of Jesus our lord and savior.  Just like her ancestor and his infinite forgiveness she put up with his constant yammering.  Apparently she also had a sick dog complex and felt sorry for Langdon as well.<br /><br />Moving on, Brown seems to have lost what he originally had talent wise.  This novel follows the same scripted formula.  Talky talky, run away from danger, hide, more talky talky, get caught, escape narrowly, then rinse and repeat!!  In my honest opinion I believe that Robert Langdon is becoming less Indiana Jones and more Mr. Magoo.  Time to put your type writer in the attic Mr. Brown!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got this app to keep my kids entertained and I probably use it more than them, a wide variety of games to posy.
080214473X|5.0|This book was simply outstanding!  This has to be one of the most intense military novels that I have read so far.  The author does a great job of making sure we feel the same way the actual Rangers and Delta's felt during their night spent in Mogadishu!  This heart pounding mission that these military members went through was insane.  With only 100 soldiers they took on pretty much an entire city for several hours.<br /><br />Now, normally when you read a book and then watch a movie you notice how ridiculously over the top the action sequences are compared to the novel.  This process was reversed with this adaptation.  There were scenes from the movie that were massively underplayed.  One such part in the movie, an Army Ranger and his crew are in a fire fight with some Somalis and the Ranger takes a shot to his hand blowing off his thumb.  In the movie the Ranger yells and his quickly bandaged up by his buddy.  In the novel however, the Ranger yells instantly grabs his gun with his other hand and tells his buddy, \\"He's mine!\\"  With a few shots fire and one successful hit the Somali's brain matter says goodbye to it's recent dwelling.  Fingers get blown off and duct taped back together on numerous occasions.<br /><br />So if you have an appreciation for the military and the situations they put themselves into for the sake of our freedoms to be preserved this novel will solidify those feelings.  If you possible still don't have any affection towards them, I do feel sorry that you have not come to appreciate your comfortable lifestyle within the United States.<br /><br />In reading this my huge respect for my own brothers in arms increased. This book should be a must read for all military individuals and perhaps even recommended reading for the entire school system.  It would be good knowledge for the citizens and future voteRs of the United States to understand exactly what goes on in other parts of the world to secure our safety.  By continuing to keep our enemies engaged we keep our nation safe.  It would be a scary day to wake up and realize that the enemy brought the fight to our doorstep if we decided to let terror run a muck.<br /><br />Semper Fingaged we keep our nation safe.  It would be a scary day to wake up and realize that the enemy brought the fight to our doorstep if we decided to let terror run a muck.<br /><br />Semper Fi
B0050PYNP8|3.0|What had happened was, I got spoiled by Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and director Edgar Wright's three prior screen excursions. [[ASIN:B0019MFY3Q Spaced: The Complete Series]], [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]], and [[ASIN:B004ZJZPXY Hot Fuzz [Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy]]] all featured characters who - no matter how bizarre the stuff going on around them was - were likable enough and believable enough that you got invested in them. SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ were this trio's take on, respectively, the zombie sub-genre and the cop buddy film. The TV show, SPACED, was their nerdgasmic homage to pop culture. With PAUL (but without Wright), Pegg and Frost take on the sci-fi genre and fail to soar. I'm rating PAUL a better than average 3 out of 5 stars. I liked it. I didn't love it. PAUL doesn't have the smarts of their other collaborations. Or the brilliant, irrepressible sense of humor.<br /><br />Clive Gollings (Frost) and Graeme Willy (Pegg) are two affable Brits who've crossed the waters on holiday. The film opens with their having a grand time of it at the San Diego Comic Con, after which they embark, via RV, on a leisurely road trip with pit stops to various UFO landmarks along America's heartland. Life imitates nerdy wishful thinking when, one evening, Clive and Graeme stumble onto Paul, a little green extraterrestrial what had done a bunk from a top secret government facility, wherein he had been kept prisoner for the past sixty years. And them relentless government agents are in hot pursuit. Paul doesn't want to probe anyone as much as he desperately wants off this God's little rock. Clive and Graeme become his unwilling accomplices.<br /><br />If Paul and Spielberg's E.T. had attended the same school, Paul would've been the one chillin' in the back of the class and playing the fool, while E.T. would've been seated in the front, conscientiously jotting down test notes from which Paul can later copy. Paul is the sort of \\"hip\\" alien we see more of nowadays, the alien with attitude. He wears flipflops, he smokes, he swears amiably... he is, God help us, a wisecracking slacker alien, and impeccably, digitally rendered. Today, I miss E.T. and his unassuming grace more than ever. And everytime I heard Seth Rogen's deep voice coming out of Paul's beak, I just kept getting thrown off.<br /><br />It would've been okay, though, if that had been the only bother. But it's not. I dunno. Is the secret ingredient Edgar Wright? Does he have to helm a Pegg and Frost picture in order for it to float our boat? PAUL is a surprisingly lackluster film. It's pretty concerning that the screenplay credits go to Pegg and Frost, because the quality of the writing falls several tiers below what I expect of them. Is this their stab at a mainstream audience? Or did Universal coerce them to cater their comedy to what's safe? I smiled occasionally, but laughed rarely. PAUL goes for the obvious gags. There's a particularly brutal running bit with Kristen Wiig's one-eyed, uber-religious character evolving into a rampant potty mouth. Maybe a scene or two with a naive soul letting rip with the cusswords may be funny. But the movie goes to this well time and again. I miss Kristen Wiig's deadpan sarcasm. What I don't miss is Sigourney Weaver's cameo in the third act. She isn't good here.<br /><br />The stuff that works, it's because of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and their buddy chemistry. They make the film watchable. It's a pleasure watching these two long-time pals playing off each other. You sense the high comfort level there. And the few times that the film - or Universal Studios - allows them to be themselves, the results are a riot. I enjoy the shift in dynamics. This time out, Nick Frost expands beyond the idiot sidekick role. There's even a chance that his writer character may be the smarter of the pair. For his part, Simon Pegg is so self-deprecating and down-to-earth that you can't help but like him. PAUL has its moments, except that these guys have set their standards so high that you have to call them out when they submit mediocre work. And PAUL is far from their best. I frankly can't wait for Pegg and Frost to reunite with Edgar wright for THE WORLD'S END, the third of their \\"Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy,\\" projected to be released sometime in 2014. Edgar Wright, look at you, dude, suddenly an indispensable cog. As far as PAUL, I say catch it when it's on cable. Alf has a lot to answer for.<br /><br />This DVD gives you the option to play the film's theatrical version or the unrated version.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I received this promptly on my Kindle Fire.  This last book in the Hunger Games trilogy did not disapoint.  Once again a lot of action, but balanced with character development.  A great ending with neither a lollipop ending, nor a heartbreaking end.  I will defintely read this again in the near future!

I'm not usually so enthusiastic about games, but since downloading, I find myself returning for a quick Quell visit regularly. It's challenging without becoming frustrating. I'll probably buy more when I complete the free levels.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I like the game, but the screen in a phone is too small for the larger grids. If you like Sudoku, then this game is good. But you may prefer a tablet over a phone for this.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book wasnt your typical read. Just when you think you have the story figured out, its not what it seems. I loved all the characters. Travis wasnt a perfect rich boy, but scarred and beautiful. Abby's background was so fun to learn about as you get into the book. I like she wasnt some proper girl that fell for the bad boy. America and Shep provided another fun couple to read about. All characters made the story work. I started this book in the AM and couldnt put it down. I stayed up all night until i finished it. Then i turned around and started to read it again! Great book, wish there was a part 2!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I'm so sorry to be late with this review.  I love the set and have even learned to like a few songs I wasn't familiar with.  thank you for the FAST shipping.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Sorry - there are no fights in this movie - no gun battles - no car chasings in the streets - no gang rapes - no bitches. This is a beautiful movie - a painful love story between two people. A young man and a mature woman meet coinsidently and start a secret love affair. She is charged with a crime she didn't commit from the war and ends up in jail. Does the young man wait for her on the out side??
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice game I really enjoyed playing and I would like to see more games like this. I think everyone should try this out
B00729GQ0A|2.0|Lots of people seemed to have loved this but I sure didn't.  It didn't seem original, the characters didn't feel real to me.  It was one of those books where my mind kept wandering as I was reading because I wasn't interested enough and I usually love this sort of story (love Charlaine Harris, the Twilight Series, Cassandra Clare).  There was definately some potential.  I thought the protagonist's experience of having a mentally ill, judgmental mother could have been more.  Being shunned for being Wiccan in a Christian dominated culture could have been explored more too.  And honestly, the romance bored me.  Too bad because I love to get caught up in a story.  Obviously it worked for some others though.  I ended up just wanting to get through it so that I could move onto something more engrossing.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I like games where I need to use logic skills to play,  so word and puzzles games top my list!  this game is easy in it 's simplicity but challenging to discover the only way the puzzle will work - I like that it makes a picture when you are done. I prefer this to sudoku as I do not like numbers!!  it would be good if they added a score or a timer for more challenge. I do think the price is a little too high but am thrilled that it was the faotd. I would recommend this game to someone seeking a new puzzle game.
0393064476|5.0|I bought this book on a whim.  It became one of my all-time favourites.  I have since given copies to each of my children and a number of friends.  The story it tells is one we need to hear.  Fundamentally, the book answers the most basic questions of human existence and aids immeasurably in understanding the human condition.  I moved on from there and read the poem by Lucretius that was the cause of the swerve.  To read the impact, for example, of the poem on the United States Constitution was very moving.  The only other book one needs to understand the history and vagaries of human life on this planet is Charles C. Mann's national best seller, 1491 - New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus.  When these two books are read, all we are missing is a  good text on physics, a good text on mathematics, and Darwin's Origin of  the Species.  It would not be fair to review Swerve without mentioning the writing skill of the author. It is superb.  Free distribution of Swerve to every U.S. citizen, particularly to its children, would be a major step for mankind.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Excelent SCI-FI book.  Keep me reading until the end.  The story join perfectly the post-apocalyptic future with nostalgic journey to the past.  If you grew up on 80's like me, I really recommend.
B007KDFWRG|3.0|Loved 'Revelator' and saw them live in London, but sorry guys, I don't like much of this. Same songs yes, but a lot of them wander off into twiddly-diddling and are overlong because of it. Look at one of my all-time favourites 'Midnight in Harlem', for me no comparison with a couple of tight versions and wonderful Derek solos on youtube. 'Bound for Glory', likewise, here 13 minutes of it! Sorry don't even like the material on cd 2. They're a fine band, Susan's great, but I think Derek still holds himself back to give others their space, not always for the better. Well, there was always gonna be someone who wasn't happy!
B000V5Y2E4|2.0|I did not like this episode. The elderly man draws a parallel from his stubbornness to that of resistance fighters. It is a senseless and incorrect parallel. The resistance fighters were not just fighting for mere land and housing, nor were they fighting against other Bajorans (at least for the most part.) They were fighting a ruthless and cruel oppressive enemy known as the Cardassians. That is completely different than a freedom fighter fighting to protect his family from oppression. This old man was fighting against his own people, that for the most part were regaining their freedoms and trying to improve the quality of their lives. He wasn't fighting against an oppressive enemy that would torture and kill him on a whim. He was fighting against his Bajoran brothers and sisters ... all for a piece of land. He would have his liberties and freedoms on Bajor, or another world or path of his choosing. Vulcan logic teaches that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. I understand the human equation that sometimes the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many in certain circumstances, but him protecting his little oven and cottage just to be stubborn isn't quite as justified. Lands will be repaid to him and he will still be more free than he ever was when the Cardassians were in power. I understand the point he's trying to make, but I would be willing to move to improve the quality of lives of that many of my people, and possibly even improve my own life.<br /><br />The trading done by the two youngsters is entertaining, but not enough to salvage this episode. The man in question is trying to draw a parallel between two very different and unique circumstances that are only related to a very slight degree, and he finally, after a dramatic and abrupt fanfare of destruction by Major Kira, gives up and decides to go. Did it really have to come to that? Just not a fulfilling episode for me, overall. Two stars seems a bit generous....
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Glee since it's first airing on Tv's Fox Five,I've also bought every CD issued by the group. This latest CD is up to their usually high standard but so many of the song from the 2 episodes \\"Props\\" and \\"Nationals\\" were left out.I don't undersatnd why they do this not everyone has an Mp3 player to download into.If they would pack these CD's with fan requested hits I'm sure the sales would be phenomenal.For now it just looks like corporarte greed.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|When I tried to install this app for the first time, my phone crashed and needed a reboot. Normally this would send it straight to the trash with a negative review, but I understand designing an app to run flawlessly on so many different phones and tablets can be tricky. I gave it a second shot and the install was successful.<br /><br />The game its self is pretty good. I'm new to this kind of puzzle, so I can't say how well it pulls off what it's going for, but it's fun, challenging, and rewarding when you solve enough to guess what the picture is. The tutorial was a bit vague, but I learned all I needed by hitting the help button.<br /><br />I saw complaints about the controls. Mostly due to difficulty hitting the intended squares as the grid gets larger. This isn't too huge an issue as zooming in and out is easy. You can also draw lines. I also saw complaints that the puzzles are broken. Specifically 1.6. Not so. I passed it just fine and I'm a noob.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars due to the install issue and price. Granted, I got it as FAotD, but I'd never recommend this at its current near $5 price. Drop that to about $2.50 look into some bugs, and it's a solid puzzle game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Youversion Bible. Our church uses the live events for notes, so I don't miss anything. I like the diveerse reading plans as well.<br />Highly reccomend this free app!
0345803485|1.0|This was the most ridiculous, poorly written and narrated book I have ever listened to.  It sounded like the author had a third grade education with phrases such as, \\"Oh my,\\" \\"crap,\\" \\"double crap,\\" \\"holy crap,\\" and yes, even \\"triple crap.\\"  I sat through the main character blushing and flushing and turning every color of the rainbow.  If I had to sit through one more cliched phrase, my head would have exploded.  If you want to listen to someone raising an eybrow, cocking his head, smirking, saying jeez, and the absolutely worst of all, the biting of the lip about 10 million times, then waste your money.  I actually feel embarrassed for the author and editor because it's so poorly and childishly written.  The sex seens are completely laughable and are the antithesis of erotic.  If you want to become celibate, buy this book.
B005PK1G76|5.0|We bought this for our Inglesina Swift. It fits perfectly. This is such a handy addition! We use one cup holder for our daughters sippy cup and another for our bottled water. The main pocket fits our phones and snacks for her. Also, it does not interfere with opening and closing the stroller. We love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is it. This is the best I've read for years, and the best post-apocalyptic sci-fi book I've ever read. This has kept me up for way too late all week. The tempo is just so well aligned: I didn't miss details and I never felt bored at all - always thinking \\"5 minutes more and I'll go to sleep\\", ending up reading an hour more. It is also quite fascinating the way the line between good and bad starts well defined, but then blurs. For then to smack back into a straight, hard line. It is not a bright story by any means, but there is glowing in the dark.
1439152799|5.0|This is the third novel by Kate Morton. She is a genius of intrigue usually involving 3-4 generations of the same family involved in solving a family mystery. I can not put the books down and begrudge the need to sleep. My friends are all waiting in line for me to finish. I understand her next book is due out in October.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|If your like me you love romance stories. But don't you just hate it when you spend the entire book waiting for two people to come together and when it finally happens... you've got 2 pages left. The best thing about this book is that with Abby and Travis you get the entire story. From the first look to the first kiss to the first fight and what happens after the first declaration of love. The story is very relatable and keeps up a great pace. Abby is a very strong female lead and I fell in love with her instantly. Travis is just... Delicious. From the shaved head to tatoos I was all over this character. He's very complex but the love he holds for Abby and America and Shepley becomes very clear throughout the book. This book will make you laugh, smile, gasp, and swoon. I recomend it to anyone and everyone. I've already re-read it 4 times. This is definitely on my top 10 list. Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a good book and I want to purchase the rest of the trilogy.I enjoy the convenience of ordering from Amazon.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was an interesting book in that it kept my interest from beginning to end.  The action was spectacular, The imagination of the writer gripping.  I realize it's a young adult book, but enjoyable for adults.
0307957934|3.0|I've read, and enjoyed, all of Robert Harris' books.  And I enjoyed this one as well, but it represents a distinct decline in quality.  It reads almost exactly like a Michael Crichton, an author I lost all respect for in his final 5 or 6 books.  They were formulaic, preachy-- really more polemics than novels-- \\"The Fear Index\\" reminded me of these.<br /><br />The book is tightly plotted and the exposition is crisp.  All the action takes place in one action-packed day, as a new world's reality dawns on the reader (much sooner than it dawns on the protagonist).  The opening chapters are promising, but that promise is squandered quickly and the last half of the book is surprisingly predictable.<br /><br />After loving all of Harris' output, this was a letdown.
B005KELW26|4.0|We got this folio because my daughter loves purple and it's very nice but I wish that you had the same thing with the one that swing and double layered so it can be shock observent as well.
B007SGM084|1.0|Buying this bundle costs 2 cents more than buying the three individual novels! Really?!?!? No break whatsoever!?!?! Couldn't give Kindle readers at least a 10% discount for buying the bundle?
B0074V3712|3.0|There are not many examples, that relate to homo sapiens, its mostly about insects if you are interested in them the book is great.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Travis is a guy who really didn't know how to treat a girl until Abby came along and rocked his world. I love the shock value that happens once you realize where she really comes from! They were made for each other.. even though Abby fights tooth and nail against fate.<br /><br />This book is a must read. Jamie McGuire is a wonderful writer and made the book come to life as I read.<br />This should become a movie ASAP!! I can not wait to see what she comes up with next.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had a sense of what the book was about before I started. I was amazed at how quickly I became invested in the main characters, Christian and Ana. I was cheering them on the whole way while they struggled through their issues.  Ana was the light that Christian needed to make his way out of his self imposed darkness.  As soon as I was done with one, I bought part 2 and 3.  Loved the series and have been singing their praises to everyone!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun there area lot of games to play but some of them are pretty hard its better than I expected
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. keeps the kids entertained and makes fhs time pass by faster. and yeah so get this game. it freezes sometimes but nothing big.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Fascinating to play, but it seems like it was created with tablets in mind. If you have it zoomed out far enough to see the guiding numbers, it's sometimes difficult to read the numbers, and it can be VERY difficult to get your tap to register on the correct square.
0439023513|5.0|As the third and final book within this series, I couln't stop reading it!  Just as exciting as the previous two stories.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its give me something to do when im stuck in doctors office or bored at work. It's  fun and creative.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I wouldn't call it \\"the worst pink prose\\" I've ever read, simply because I don't normally read such garbage. Otherwise this book could easily qualify. The only redeeming quality is somewhat interesting setting. But the book is impossible to read. It's offensive to my language taste. Every single cliche that you can imagine - is in there, repeated multiple times. Style is horrible, language is even worse - do yourself a favor and take a pass. Unless you're a connoisseur of pink fiction (but without any erotica) - in that case go and indulge yourself.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a far cry from the game I played as a child and it's a good update! I only wish that there were fewer things that required cash.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|This reader opened my 60mb document better then the native kindle app. It also has the ability to annotate and search. I'm a little disappointed that I can't create bookmarks from within the app although it supports bookmarks. Perhaps I'm missing something...
B005LAIGN2|1.0|i was VERY excited about this movie till i saw it. To be brief, it LOOKED good, SFX/CGI were top notch. HOWEVER, the acting was terrible, the plot was spoon fed to the viewer, they assume we are no longer capable of inferring things on our own. It was cliche and predictable, and it was technically incorrect!! in one scene (SPOILER STOP NOW!!!!) a character in a P-51 goes nose to nose with a German in an Me-262. he gets shot in the chest a few times and gets a two minute death scene. You don't GET a two minute death scene after you've taken several (let alone ONE) 20mm rounds in the chest. It was insulting. If I was the Tuskagee Airmen i'd be upset. They had a better 30 second spot in Hart's War. watch that instead.....
B003QSEKTU|2.0|I got this for my two year old because of the songs. It did exactly what I needed it to. He LOVES the singing/dancing scenes which I knew he would.<br />I wont let him watch it once he gets a bit older and begins to understand the bigger story. It is full of teens prioritizing boyfriends/girlfriends over college and ends with a strong \\"my high-school girlfriend is all that I live for\\" vibe. The songs are beyond annoying and repetitive. The choreography is interesting enough I suppose. Overall it is what you would expect from a disney channel franchise that pushed one more silly movie out to rake in some merch money.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games was a good book that got better as you got into it.  I am now looking forward to reading the second in the series.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I lov this game. there r no annoying pigs. its so fun watching the little birds fly away after u brake their cages. the only thing that bugs me is the monkeys
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my 4year old and I love this game...very addictive! ! the only thing is it wont let me visit my own friends. it keeps saying I need to update...oh well! still fun and my daughter loves ice age!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this app was the first I got on my kindle fire. awesome app. love it.  the ads are a bit annoying, though. great. please get it! my 2-year-old loves it too!!! fun fun.  :P
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Love the books, am loving the series. Some variations, but all done well, in a \\"believable\\" sequence, if such a thing can be said for a vampire show. Super fun. Hope they do a series on the Grave Sight series as well.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|Such an excellent, refreshing rock/pop/alternative sound that truly their own. Great songs. Buy without hesitation. Deluxe version offers 4 additional tracks. Worth the extra money, in my opinion. 5 STARS
0439023491|3.0|This book is not as action packed as the first. As usual, the auther tried to develope the characters/flesh them out, so to speak, and made the book a little more boring. Oh well. I expected it. Still, pretty good.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books were WONDERFUL!  There were so many twists and turns in the story. I loved it! I hope the author writes more of this series.  Please let me know if and when she does and I will gladly purchase the book(s) ASAP.
0439023513|3.0|Pretty good as a sequel. This, the third in the series, cannot compare with the first. Very seldom is a sequel as good as the original, and this is no exception. Still, it neatly raps up the future of our heroin.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|great little app I real like it and think you should get this app if you want some entertainment. plus its a free app.
B00479SVBU|1.0|I had high hopes for this with all the great reviews.  Purchased for a 16 hour trip with kids, and was very upset with the heavy static no matter what station I tried.  Sent it back.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics. It's hard to stop playing once I start. This is one of the best game apps I've played in a long time. Works great on my Kindle Fire & I've experienced no problems. This is a premium game.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I never review, but this is a great app that got some lousy reviews because people don't know how to zoom or fill in multiple boxes. To Swype through an entire row you must first long press the square. Then, anywhere you drag your finger will full other boxes like it did the first. Long press! Great app but could use a better tutorial.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you're a Firefly fan, you have to see Serenity. If you're not a Firefly fan, you have to see Serenity.<br /><br />Serenity wraps up many of the mysteries left in Firefly, specifically dealing with River. While it doesn't answer all of the questions, and certainly brings up quite a few more, Serenity is the concluding story of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew, and depicts each member's growth as an individual.<br /><br />For those who have never seen Firefly, Serenity offers an action-filled sci-fi movie with an interesting concept. It's fast tempo easily draws watchers in, and will make them instant fans.  Many of my friends saw Serenity before Firefly, and are now die-hard Firefly fans.  I personally saw the TV show first, but either way I believe Serenity is an open movie for all to enjoy.<br /><br />Serenity is one of the many great works by Joss Whedon. It was the only movie directed by Joss before he was chosen to direct the Avengers, so clearly it impressed people.  It is ranked one of the 10 best Sci-Fi films of all time by SFX.  Orson Scott Card is reported to have said that he would not make an \\"Ender's Game\\" movie unless it was as good as Serenity.  Considering that movie has yet to be made, I'm going to assume that means the bar was set a little too high.
1439153663|4.0|Great book, great historical novel. Ms. Grissom takes the subject of slavery as we think we know of it from the annals of history and flips it on its head with unexpected characters in unexpected situations. A cautionary tale of why we should always be open to discussing uncomfortable matters. Themes of family bonds and unrequited love pack a powerful punch.<br /><br />I notice most of the negative reviews of this book are because the reviewers thought the book too sad. Suck it up, people, life's not all about roses and happy princess endings. This book is thoroughly researched for its historical elements and while some view it as sad; I think its full of love and grace.<br /><br />The way the story came to the author struck me in the deepest way - I believe this tale was meant to be told.
0786956291|3.0|For those of you who know absolutely nothing about Dungeons and Dragons, this may be good for you.  This is a very simplified version of the game, meant to be easy to pick up and play right away.<br /><br />If you are looking for a more in depth, exciting game, I recommend looking elsewhere.  While slightly more difficult to do, you will have a much more fun and intense experience by purchasing a Dungeon Master's Guide and a full mission book.  This will allow more friends to play, and allow you to get more creative.  This starter kit really can only have a couple people play at one time, the mission is very short, and the characters you can make are limited.
B0083EW97W|2.0|I've got everything John has ever done (yes, even AS/IS).  I feel like I'm listing to a Jackson Browne or an Eagles disc.  Not one cranking guitar driven song John?  Really?  I've listed to it four times through and there is still not one track I'm replaying over again.  As of right now, hugely disappointing.  So far, JMT was my favorite.  This, is dead last.  Is that flutes I hear on \\"A face to call home\\"?  Flutes?  Really?  I'd rather listen to Jethro Tull.
B005LAIGF0|5.0|this movie must be seen.  it is great! watch today! i watched this on a flight recently and it breaks my heart that it didn't receive a bigger theatrical release.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I really like this app.  I can pin a note to my home screen to remind me of any errands I need to run and it stands out so I see it every time I look at my phone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was wary about this book being nothing more than erotica, but I fell in love with the storyline. I can't wait for more from this author!
B000E6EHGI|4.0|I am not a really great GD fan but the have a kind of American folk rock style music and it makes you want to get an old moonshine jug and toot along with them. I really would like to say they got this good old fashion bluegrass rock an roll started
B007KZY1YY|5.0|This book is a follow on to fifty shades of grey, it is very hard to put this book down you just want to keep reading to find out what is happening or going to happen. Very good read<br />just started the next one in the series will let you know how good it is when I've finished
B0002ADY0Q|5.0|Many bands pour the best they got to make ths first impression good. Uriah Heep did not have to do that. Often called the Beach boys of Rock because of there great vocal harmonies these guys had the special chemistry that just mixed well.Now some 40+ years later all there work stands up to all newcommers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's fun because there is more than one game to play so when you get bored of one you can just play another.
0307463745|4.0|The authors don't waste words (to me, that's a positive).  I love the direct writing style; no fluff.  Some chapters are just one page long.  Why?  They made their point, move on.<br /><br />As a business owner, I appreciated the information.  It's an informative and fun read.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|i absolutly love this book and i love the movie too .... u should totally read this book .i would probably read the books first then the movie … i love the characters tooo
1469984202|5.0|Rare is the book that completely transports the reader to a different world.  I have been a voracious reader for over 30 years and cannot name more than 20 books that take me so completely into the story, that when I put the book down, it takes me a moment to come back to my own world.<br />The characters in this book are so complete and compelling that they occupied my dreams.<br />Yes, this is science fiction, but I believe any reader who wants to travel to another time, another world, and walk among the people there, will enjoy this book.<br />I recommend this book to all people who read for the sheer joy of it.  You will not be disappointed.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is an apocalyptic story about a writer's wish to findout about the personality of the man who created the atomic bomb. His journey bringshim to San Lorenzo, a secluded Island where a religion exists that's main point is \\"finding meaning is futile\\". He meets the children of the maker of the atomic bomb, all of which possess a substance that could potentially destroy the world.<br />  This is my first time reading Kurt Vonnegut and it's an experience that I should havehad sooner. The book has a very satirical tone to it and is reminiscent to the works ofChuck Palahniuk and Christopher Moore. Vonnegut offers us a tongue in cheek view of religion, politics and the human condition in general. His style of writing is confusing at first but the reader can tell that it's intentional. There is mystery and an element of surprise. In the beginning I wondered what exactly the book was going to be about.<br />  The characters are round and well developed, all have their own unique quirks,<br />and lack predictability. Even Mona with her nonchalant personality ends up surprising you. The main character (John or \\"Jonah\\") is delightfully inconsistent when it comes to his structures of belief and always keeps the reader guessing. Newt (who is a little person and the son of Felix Hoenikker, the creator of the atomic bomb) seems irritated and resentful at first but emerges later on in the novel as a dignified man with an amiable disposition. Julian Castle (a well-to-do member of the island of San Lorenzo) provides comic relief one moment and enrages you the next.<br />  The overall feeling that I got from this book is that it is a futile business to try to understand the meaning of life, why people behave the way they do, and why \\"evil\\" in the world continues to prevail.

B007JM4CWY|4.0|I was hooked in the tutorial. sort of wonky if you bump a bunch of wrong ones. but still dig this neato app!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This a great set of books and for the ~13 cost to get all 3. I read all three in less than a week actually 1st book took me one day. Must read the book if you have seen the movie will help explain fill in the gaps.
B0015DROBO|1.0|After reading some of the reviews praising this book, I expected a clever mystery at the minimum. Instead, I found it to be a tedious read with a contrived plot and sadistic characters that seem artificially inserted. There are much better mysteries to be read.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Excellent app. I make lists of everything from groceries to \\"Tp Do\\" stuff. Ready helps with an aging memory or just a busy life. A real must have!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|this is a good calendar for my purposes.  I like that I can quickly tap on various days to see the schedule rather than using back button all the time.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|I'm not sure if this is really the pro version. This shows up add the free one in the google market. And it crashes too much.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This little app works as advertised! I love it as it is packed to the gills with great information about battery life. Excellent!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|like the concept of sudoku but to a whole new level! very interesting game as it challenges you mind! it is a chellenging game, though very rewarding and fun.
B006OB3K56|2.0|This movie the story is not organized, you don't really get any out of them, I think most audiences probably only concentrate in sex part, overall it is not a good movie.  I felt waste money to buy it.
0345803485|3.0|So I am not a reader.  I've read the Twilight series because there was so much fuss about it and of course I loved them.  Then a bunch of people are talking about this book EVERYWHERE!  Facebook, work, twitter, even SNL did a spoof so I gave it a read.  One - I have never read an erotica until this one and it kind of creeped me out!  The whole you do what I say, and I don't make love I F**K HARD?  Seriously Christian creeped me out and IDK if I was this girl I would have turned around and run out of that apt when I realized what kind of WEIRD stuff the \\"amazing\\" Christian is into.  Also this is supposed to be based off of Bella and Edward and I for one didn't get their personalities or anything close to Bella and Edwards characters from Ana and Christian.  The writing didn't really affect me, I'm 20 and don't really pay attention to that at this moment in time I got what they were doing and saying ect.

0553801473|1.0|This is the book in which George Martin betrays his readers, exploiting for profit the very fan base which helped him achieve money and fame.<br /><br />Since people are usually pretty good about discerning when they are being taken advantage of, the whole slew of caustically negative reviews surrounding this book should come as no surprise. In the immortal words of Randall Patrick McMurphy:\\"When a man's getting screwed he has a right to holler.\\"<br /><br />Hundreds of reviews point to similar truths.<br />1)A Dance With Dragons contains little to no real plot advancement. This is especially infuriating when the novel is the size of a phone-book. To write a near thousand page novel where \\"nothing much happens\\" takes a certain amount of craftsmanship, I'll grudgingly admit.<br />2)Martin's stall tactics are enabled through character assassination. Tyrion and Dany are practically unrecognizable, having seemingly lost their strength and resolve. If these characters had retained spunk and a sense of agency, Martin might have been forced to take the story a discernible direction. Hence, Martin mangled them beyond recognition.<br />3)This long, uneventful book relies on plenty of \\"world building\\" filler, in the form of tedious, mind-numbing descriptions. It also relies on maintaining the interest of the reader through plenty of lowest common denominator gutter tactics, in the form of excessive and gratuitous sex and violence.<br />4)Unlike the first 3 books of the series, Martin did not seem to enjoy writing this book. Hence, the writing is weary, uninspired, and sleep inducing. (I think he tried to make up for this by talking excessively about food, which he obviously does love. Unfortunately, this did not improve the book, it merely contributed to the bloat.)<br /><br />Oddly enough, there is a common point of view expressed by many of this book's defenders, and even by some of its detractors. This point of view is basically that \\"A Dance With Dragons may not be up to the quality of some of the other books in the series, but a bad George Martin book is still better than almost any other fantasy book out there.\\"<br /><br />I totally disagree.<br /><br />The world of Fantasy Fiction is full of wonderful authors worth reading. Whether one is talking about relatively neglected geniuses of the past like E.R. Eddison or Fritz Leiber, or obvious choices like Tolkien or LeGuin, or contemporary figures like Tim Powers or Robin Hobb, there is no dearth of first rate material.<br /><br />It is mystifying to me why many people tend to assume that George Martin is the standard bearer, the best the genre has to offer. This assumption does not bear scrutiny. Sure, I really enjoyed the first three books of this series and consider them very good, but even Martin at his best seems to suffer from a defective worldview: nihilism masquerading as realism.<br /><br />Even if one puts the first 3 books of this series high in the fantasy pantheon, there is no getting around the fact that A Dance With Dragons fails on many levels. It is much worse then the misstep that was book 4. In fact, I am hard pressed to think of a worse fantasy book. What is particularly galling and pernicious is that the mainstream media has decided to jump on the Martin bandwagon and give A Dance With Dragons laudatory reviews. (I'm sure marketing considerations has nothing to do with it...) Not only is an overrated author getting an excessive amount of attention, but newcomers to the fantasy genre may well give up on the genre entirely if they read Martin's train wreck of a series under the false assumption that this is the epitome of fantasy.<br /><br />I would like to forget about A Song of Ice and Fire entirely. Unfortunately, the HBO series and accompanying marketing blitz ensures that Mr. Martin and his series will be the topic of conversation for some time to come.<br /><br />Well, then here are my two cents: George Martin has become the contemporary Darth Vader of the Fantasy world. His influence is toxic. He is a powerful villain in the Fantasy Fiction Galaxy. He exploits his fan base, he crafts inferior works designed NOT to advance a story, he utilizes a vast marketing machine to sell a series that even in its best moments contains an ugly and erroneous world view and which in its worst moments panders to very vulgar tastes,  he insulates himself from criticism, he stigmatizes those who have criticisms, he gives fantasy fiction a bad name.<br /><br />Come to think of it, I don't think Fantasy Fiction even had a Darth Vader prior to GRRM. No other genre author I am aware of merits the negative reaction that Martin so richly deserves. Congratulations, Mr. Martin, on this singular accomplishment!tasy world. His influence is toxic.

B000VZUWZW|4.0|I had never watched the Big Bang Theory prior to seeing a recent rerun on cable tv, and I thought that it was hilarious.  So hilarious, in fact, that I downloaded the first season onto my Kindle just to see what the series was about, and ended up watching it all in one night.  (When I watched \\"The Peanut Reaction\\", I laughed so hard that I tripped while walking downstairs and practically launched myself into outer space!)<br /><br />I really liked how the group is introduced to the audience, how the characters progress and cohere, and the incredible wit displayed in the character interactions/dialogue.  I love the geek/science aspect of the show, including the social awkwardness, the comic book adoration, etc, and how bizarre these things are to Penny.<br /><br />Of course, there were a few areas that could have used improvement since it *was* the first season, but this issue is now moot; these have long since been improved.<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this series to others!
B006X415GK|5.0|this doll is great i bought it for my 6yr old daughter who has 7 other dolls like it we got it for her birthday she loved it she likes the color and the hair style and just everything about the doll it came in oringinal package and everything was there no missing peices and shipping was fast and on time i would recommend anyone to buy this product !!!!
B007O3BGZE|4.0|I was not blown away by my first few listens to this.  This is a grower and takes time to digest.  My only experience with It Bites is due to John Mitchell and his stellar guitar playing.  Well Mr. Mitchell is not the only stellar musician here, everyone shines.  This release has more of a subdued feel than the catchy pop-prog style of \\"The Tall Ships\\", and maybe that's why it took me longer to catch on.  Any band can get in a rut and repeat themselves, but those that alter their writing style and still sound good show versatility and class.<br /><br />I really like the raspy lead vocals and the layering of the backing vocals stand out on all tracks.  My current faves include the title track, and \\"The Big Machine\\" - although the chorus seems similar to \\"The Tall Ships\\".  \\"Send No Flowers\\" took me a long time to appreciate but it is tasty.  \\"Meadow and the Stream\\" may be the most progressive song on this disc, but the short lyrics of the chorus is kind of awkward.  And the ballad \\"The Last Escape\\" is awesome.  Everything about this disc shows attention to detail... the music, the production, the booklet, and the disc itself looks like a record.  Well done chaps!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy gets better and better. Christian is determined to have Ana and she is just as determined to not be controlled. Who will win? Who has the ultimate control. This book had my mind and adrenalin in over drive. I just couldn't put it down and hope to finish book three with in the next day or so. I am stunned that this author has captivated me so. MUST READ !!!! *****5 stars
0880796863|4.0|I just got my \\"Original Rider Waite Tarot\\" deck the other day and they are beautiful! I love the muted palate. The cards have an otherworldly, from another time quality to them that, for me, enriches the experience of viewing, meditating on and reading them. I grew up with these images--first exposed to a Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot deck when I was about 11 or 12 years old--so I know them well, but this deck helps me to see them in a whole new light. I have an Abano-Waite deck that I have owned for about 15 years.  The Albano Waite is very colorful, so there is quite a contrast between the two decks. I do still love my old Albano-Waite, but I think this \\"Original\\" set is far better.<br /><br />The card stock of the \\"Original\\" deck is heavy. The first thing I noticed when I took the deck out of the box was how much thicker it was that my other deck. I measured it, and the Original Rider deck is nearly a quarter inch (about 3/16\\" to be more precise) thicker than my other deck! And this was no illusion. Comparing any single card from the Albano to Original the difference in thickness (and stiffness) is quite evident. These cards feel like they will last forever.<br /><br />This deck has a lovely matte finish. It's not shiny at all. I saw some old review where the reviewer complained that the cards were glossy and plastic-coated. Maybe U.S. Games has changed this, but my deck (purchased in May of 2012 and printed in China) is not like this at all. The matte finish along with the muted colors make for a lovely presentation. I imagine the cards are coated but not in any way that detracts from their beauty and feel.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with my purchase.  If you are a fan of the Waite-Smith decks and don't have this \\"Original\\" set in your collection, then I would urge you to pick one up.<br /><br />Now, to the question of this being the \\"Original.\\" I am not an expert in the RWS decks, by any means. But one reviewer here stated that these cards are a copy of the \\"Pam C\\" printing--which is not the 1st original printing. Based on my research I believe that reviewer is correct.  A week or so after buying the \\"Original\\" RWS deck I decided to go ahead and get the [[ASIN:1572816392 Pamela Colman Smith Commemorative Set]] as well. THAT deck does appear to be reproduced from a true \\"Pam A\\" deck, to the best of my ability to tell. And if so it is more \\"original\\" than this one.<br /><br />Again, I am no expert--though I have been doing quite a bit of research on the matter--so take my words with an appropriate grain of salt. Regardless of which is more original, however, the PCS Commemorative set is superior to this deck, in my opinion, and worth the extra money if you are willing to spend it--or just buy both like I did :) .  I plan to write a review for the PCS Commemorative set after I have had a chance to spend more time with them, but in general the images are much more crisp and detailed on that deck verses this one.<br /><br />That said, these are lovely cards, and a worthy addition to any collection.  I can't give it 5 stars, not after having seen the Commemorative, but it is a good, solid 4.<br /><br />A good buy.
B0083GPDBO|2.0|I really like movies that think outside the box, D9, Hunter Prey, Equilibrium, etc. and this movie seemed to offer just that but it never really gets off the ground (pun intended) Chronicle eludes to three teenagers that mysteriously acquire super powers, well not exactly, the powers they get are kinda lame. My biggest beef with this movie is that it offers a very narrow range of characters to relate to: You have the good looking political type, the in-between jock and nice guy type and the whiner sissy baby type, it was this last type that really alienated me as a viewer. I really wanted the whiner to fly up into space where there is no air and just suffocate there so we could see what happens to the other two guys but it was not to be. Anyway it's probably worth $3.00 or $1.00 from Red box  :)
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a fun game. Its quite a huge step up from the usual board games people play. With multiple ways to win and infinite replayability, this is a good long term investment. Although games normally take over 2 hours to finish.
6301752686|5.0|I love these cartoons!  I remember them from my childhood.  My children also viewed them when they were children.  Now that I'm going to be a granny, I am so disappointed that these wonderful cartoons are not available in DVD.  As our VHS player died a long time ago, I am saving my VHS copy in hopes that someday I can once again view them.  These are classics and I wish Disney would consider redistributing them to a new generation.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|well... the controls are all jacked up and so it makes it a lil difficult to play, which is retarded but maybe... JUST MAYBE, it will surprise me and have at least a few extra cool games... idk tho!! :(
159562015X|4.0|The book is excellent in helping to determine what your strengths are as well as how to work with other people of varying strengths. I wish I had this tool years ago because it is so much more in depth than I expected.<br /><br />Make sure that if you purchase this item that the access code is included. The book is useless if you don't have the access code.
B000BYA4JM|2.0|Although I love this movie, no matter how terrible the acting and plot, the DVD was not as described. For the price, I won't complain too much, but I suggest a more accurate description on other products. I probably would not trust this sellers' idea of 'New'.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I remembered seeing this movie 20 years or so ago and wanted to buy it now for my Asian movie collection as I had enjoyed it so much then and it had made such a deep and lasting impression on me at that time. I thought many of the dream segments were so unusual, innovative and beautifully shot.  It's a very different movie as other reviewers have commented on, kind of like moveable art. I think my favorite of the dream sequences was the first one with the Fox Wedding on the rainy/sunny day called Sunshine Through The Rain. It reminded me of a Japanese Noh play except that instead of being set on a wooden, outdoor stage it was set on a path in a magnificent, old growth forest.  Everything about it was stunning and mesmerizing. My next favorite is the peach orchard/Hina dolls come to life dream simply called The Peach Orchard. Many of the dream segments seemed like they had deep psychological meaning and perhaps you have to be born in Japan to truly and fully understand the depth of some of them or the old myths and fables from which they spring. The segment called Mt Fuji in Red seemed almost prophetic on director Kurosawa's part given the terrible destruction of the 6 nuclear reactors in Fukushima in March 2011 and how many people died in the tsunami. I wondered what he would think of that segment in Dreams in light of what had happened in Japan last year since 6 was the number of reactors that blew up in this dream segment.  I don't know whether Kurosawa really dreamed these dreams the regular way or whether it was more like lucid dreaming on his part where he knew he was dreaming and could exert some control over the dreams but whichever it was the stories had such environmental and humanistic morals to be learned from each of them and the richness of each one is simply timeless. It will have you thinking about it for days after you watch it. A very beautifully filmed and inventive movie from one of Japan's greatest directors. Highly Recommended!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I found this book to be decent.  Barnes and Noble REALLY built up hype for this book, and I waited a good two months before I got it through my local library.  I'm very glad I didn't spend $12.99 on this book, but it was fine for a free book to read at the beach.<br /><br />The book drags.  Frankly, I was more interested in the courtroom drama of it than I was with the subplots--the meetings with the psychiatrist, the time at home the family spent eating dinner, and all that.  I agree with other reviewers who remarked that the main character--the father, Andy--was weak or \\"an ostrich\\" as someone specifically put it.  I certainly got the feeling that the mother/wife was carrying the burden much more deeply, and it might have been a better plot had it been told from the mother's perspective.  (Of course had that happened, this book might more closely resemble a Jodi Picoult-type book like Nineteen Minutes.)<br /><br />On that note, if you like Jodi Picoult, I think you'll like this book.  There is a twist at the end that I did not necessarily see coming.  I have to say that I was impatient with this book--because I couldn't wait for it to end so I could move on to something else.  That's not a good thing--I prefer books that make me sad to have finished them.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I had this CD prior to this purchase, but the red one got cracked and I was heartbroken, but seeing the price I got versus what I paid for that one well that was a real steal. The fact that I got the CD 1 day early from the shipping date also was a awesome plus. I am a fan of these guys and being able to reclaim a vintage CD is a real plus. I love various styles of music this just happens to b one of the ones I really like so, I hope in the future to rebuild my library bit by bit w Amazon.com. Thanks guys for the best prices and delivery. U sold this gal big time...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it! very cute game:-) passes the time in a fun way. my kids enjoy it a lot. play it.
B002A80QLI|5.0|Saw the man and his amazing band live in San Francisco.  They played all the songs of this album and then some.  This music is a throw back to the great music of the late 60's early 70's.  He has James Brown moves and a Bobby Womack voice, but looks like Little Anthony. :)  Best to see him live to truly enjoy the great gems of this collection.  I am a new fan for life.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|A fun game that can be a little difficult to control at times. the inclusion of different challenges and requirements keeps my interest.
B007SGM084|5.0|I must say that I fell in love with Mr. Grey from the beginning. I see many mixed reviews yes the writing could of b een somewhat better but everyone gets the point of the erotic tangled love story.  I enjoyed all three books and I will definitely read them again. I love to read books that affect me *wink wink*
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great fun game. lots to do. never gets boring at all ever. definitely recomend to download to everyone. do it now
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This is a great book! The next book in the series is even better.  I would highly recommend reading this one!
B0073U2FB2|5.0|Purchased this sci-fi movie as I do all sci-fis, knowing that ratings from the producer or individuals will surely vary with my own opinion, but I found this movie very good, not ridiculously shallow or childish, respectible special effects and certainly an acceptible level of acting quality.  Plus, I found that I really did like it.  New faces in movie role selection are usually a plus in these movies and I found this true here. I'm in my 60's and have been either going to theaters or buying movies since I was 9 years old, so I'd say that I think I can at least share my opinion, as humble as it is, with those that care to buy, go see, or rent this movie.  Don't think you'll be sorry.  Oh, really nice wrinkle in the change-of-scenery for this flick.... good to see that New York or LA is not getting blown to hell for a change.
0345803485|4.0|Absolutely could not put the book down! As soon as I finished reading the last page I bought the next two that follow... hoping they are as good or better!This one could have ended better... but I guess thats what the other two are for.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Everyone is hung up on hunger games it seems and rightly so. This is a powerful fiction story about the brutal journey of one sacrificing girl and the cruel world she lives in. It's a look into the future of a macabre world that could be, on some scale, our yet to be. It tells the tale of earth in the future after it is completely demolished by mankind in nuclear war and what it has evolved into. The struggle between good and evil,the very rich and dirt poor it still prevails and war is managed on a lesser scale, contrived by the powerful, to be played out by the young and poor, who are slaves to the upper government. Once a year a lottery, much like how they drew names of our young men in the Viet Nam era is staged in each district. Two names. one male and one female are drawn to induct the new young warriors into the games. The wars are staged with these young men and women who must brutalize and kill one another for their individual survival and for the good of their district while televised for all to see. There can be only one survivor...but this one young woman changes that. By doing so it changes everything  from life and death, uprisings and downfalls,friendships and love, to daily surviving and flourishing again in a world so tragically corrupt. Her struggles,indecisions, fortitude,pain, rawness and humanity are paramount to nothing else I have ever imagined a young woman to have to endure. This book captures the reader and doesn't let go until this last book as it is a trilogy...not a hard read at all, but one that is definitely gripping and \\"you  just can't put it down\\"  engrossing that lets the imagination run wild with the possiblility of \\"what if\\"?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|yeah I really like this game I think that every one should play this game cause it is addictive once you start playing then you cant put it down I mean wowwy wow wow.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I almost did not go to this movie, but am glad that I did.  Battleship starts off with a great piece of humor as the main character, Hopper, breaks into a convenient store to get a woman a chicken burrito. Fed up with his lack of direction in life, Hopper's brother forces him to join the movie. Skip a year to two later and Hopper is not a Lieutenant in the Navy and stationed on a Destroyer in Hawaii. Then the aliens come.<br /><br />Some of you might think that this is just another alien invasion movie where humans must defend themselves from annihilation. Though the plot line is similar, Battleship is still different. To me this was a story about accepting change and growing up with the alien invasion as a backdrop. Hopper is a very immature character when you meet him at first. When the aliens arrive in Hawaii and destroy most of the Naval fleet stationed there, he is suddenly left in command of a very cr*ppy situation. He has to figure out how to rally what is left of his crew to fight, discover the aliens' weak point, and destroy them before they can call for help. This horrific incident forces Hopper to grow up and learn what it is he's made of. That is something very few people ever get to learn.<br /><br />There is another character in the movie who is a Army Lieutenant that lost both of his legs while fighting overseas. When you meet him he is angry at that and feels incomplete and useless. When the aliens arrive, the man learns that even without his legs, he quite capable of putting up a fight. He hikes up to where the aliens built a communications array with two other people, to destroy it. He learns to accept the loss of his legs, but also discovers that he has more than just physical strength. He has courage and the willingness to do what needs to be done.<br /><br />Another thing I love about this movie, is that it paints the U.S. Military in a positive light. It shows men and women putting their lives on the line to defend everyone else. There is alsoa scene where Hopper and his crew join with a bunch of retired Navy soldiers, all of whom are in the 60s or older, to navigate the USS Missouri, which currently serves a museum, out into the open water. They then use the decommissioned ship to obliterate the alien warship. I thought it was a nice touch because it pays tribute all who have served in the military.<br /><br />Battleship has a lot of explosive action and won't let you down on that score. There are plenty of scenes with the main characters going toe to toe with these armored aliens. There is also a good amount of humor mixed in to break up the intense action sequences. In short, if you liked Battle L.A., you will like this movie. It is well worth seeing in theaters even with today's prices.
B004SBX112|4.0|[[ASIN:0310327903 WEIRD: Because Normal Isn't Working]]  Angry Birds Seasons is fun to play.  Beware it is addictive.  I have already worn out a stylis since purchasing the product April 20th.  Some levels are harder to accomplish however I never played video games.  For the younger people it probably want be a problem.  My seven year old grandson has given me some pointers.

B000VDUWMC|5.0|This book is a real mind opener about the forces that shaped social evolution from the stone age to present times.  At times, the text is repetitive and I truly feel a better editing job was in order, however I still gave it five stars for the content.  If you are interested in understanding the evolution of societies and the true reasons behind the social disparities throughout the world, this is the book for you.  It is, as the title claims, particularly focused on the appearance of agriculture, language, technology and animal-borne infectious diseases and how they influenced relationships between societies.  All I can say is WOW.
B007B6T3K4|4.0|So I listened to Xandria's first album and loved it. Then I grew extremely disinterested with every album after that as their sound became more and more pop and less Gothic metal. With the departure of Lisa, suddenly the band has snapped back to its roots. Pure symphonic Gothic Fantasy Metal, that's what we got. And now the album is actually one of my favorites of all time, especially with Manuela taking over a gaping void left by the departure from the metal world of Tarja. (If you don't get the reference check out some old Nightwish).<br /><br />Good stuff and so much more than I expected.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This was one of the best action series with a great story line...amazing performance with all actors!!! Lots of sex and blood.... Love stories... Really good...
0307951529|5.0|On a long flight from Singapore to New Jersey I read more than 70% of this book.  This is one packed with little nuggets [that contain huge value].  I found myself highlighting and writing notes in the margins of almost every paragraph!  After landing I was attached to the book, reading a page here and there on subways rides, in waiting rooms, etc<br />I am an avid reader drawn to business books like many of us are.  This book is by far the best business book to date in terms of practical, applicable information.  I would rank it up there with Rich Dad, Poor Dad.<br /><br />Whether you are an aspiring or established entrepreneur this book contains pertinent information [some are reminders] but still invaluable nonetheless.  Here is my advice to you, purchase this book and DO NOT lend it to anyone.  You will not get it back!<br /><br />I'd love to see more detailed interviews in the next book, but aside from that this is a solid piece of work!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really found Shades of Grey a good read because I had read so many other erotica titles that had no substance as far as a story line. I liked the back and forth suspense the characters brought to the book. You may find it lacking in brutal erotic scenes but I like the romance. A little sex can really go a long way.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|I read this book after reading the first two. I just had to know how the story would finish! But then about 1/4 of the was through, it started to become sloppy with respect to the story. It made reading it a painful chore. At the end it felt rushed. The ending was inadequate and unenjoyable. Possibly the biggest anticlimactic piece of writing when you consider the first 2 books.
B005ONTD42|2.0|My aging cats need some fun toys and as soon as I saw this on a news blog I clicked \\"buy now\\". But I LOL'd when I saw the price. Seriously. Why be so greedy?

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very intelligent game that will provide hours of relaxing fun for a person of any age. Would highly recommend purchase.
B0080CL0HM|3.0|If you've read the book you know it's pretty dastardly, that is if you can suffer through the awkward translations available.<br /><br />The initial movie seems a bit slow which affects your investment in the characters.  But somewhere in the middle it starts to take off and I felt that the actors, especially Rob Pattinson found their footing, which made the rest of the film quite interesting.  I will take exception on some of the panning and focus shots they did on the characters at times.  It reminded me of an Oscar Wilde comedy, a bit out of context for this genre of film.<br /><br />Cristina Ricci did a phenomenal job as always as did Kristen Scott Thomas.  However, I felt Uma Thurman a bit out of place.  She is by all means a talented actress but I believe miscast for this role.  It somehow threw the balance off, especially since I thought her a bit over acting in her character, and her exaggerated annunciation of French annoyed.<br /><br />Several times I thought that Rob Pattinson looked, how shall I put this......not as good looking or \\"dandy\\" as one would have expected.  But I think it is a testimony to his interpretation of the character George Duroy who, perhaps is supposed to be quite \\"bel\\" physically but in actuality is a miserable person inside.<br /><br />Epic film? No. But worth a rental.
B007JM4CWY|1.0|I have downloaded this game twice. I can play once downloaded but if I close it i can not open it again.  I just get a blank screen. I liked the game and would give at least 3 stars if it would open.

0671502484|4.0|If you are looking to get an overview of what the start and development of oil was, this the only book to put it in terms most people can understand.
B007SGM084|4.0|I am going to disagree with the other reviewers that said this trilogy was too pricey. If you can find it cheaper in paperback then buy it that way...but the kindle edition isn't really \\"way too pricey\\". Three books in one...1501 pages total, priced at $29.99. IDK...the math seems to work out to be fair and reasonable.<br />The trilogy is worth reading no matter how you want to buy it.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The Polar Express rates as one of favorite movies!  I lost the first disc I had, so was glad to replace it through amazon.com!
B005HSL626|5.0|Probably the favorite out of all the free apps we've DL'd on our Kindle Fires. The kids have not tired of playing it, and they educate me with a different \\"fruit fact\\" every day, so it's educational as well. Well worth a free download. Hours of free fun for kids.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay I did enjoy this book, more than I thought that I would. But for all the media attention this books has recieved I do not understand. Yes they have sex, yes there is some s&m, but not to the point of which I thought there would be. It more reminds me of love making in other teenage love stories. Boy likes girl, girl loves boy they have sex, and fall madly in love, I mean what the heck, why are woman swooning over this? I could understand it more if the story was more about s&m, but he was easy on her and very sweet to her. I liked it because I love those teenage love stories, but I was expecting more of an adult love story from this. I get hotter reading my harliquin reomance novles.
B005ER6STG|3.0|I watched this movie last night after hearing all the hype and reading 1 star review after 1 star review. Sure, the core message parallels that of \\"Natural Born Killers\\": Western society/culture is destroying itself via the media & mass entertainment outlets. Thing is, the shocks are pretty much the only reason to watch it because the quality of everything but the prop, make-up, & art departments suffers due to a laughable script, so-so acting, a conventional music score & sound by the sound department (a few of the \\"gross-out\\" sounds worked though), and the lighting department did a so-so job. I'm a film buff/elitist, whatever you want to call it; I notice flaws and they bug me--that's just my taste & opinion.<br /><br />I know lots of people go for these types of horror flicks that are more concerned with the shock factor than the little things that add up to a well-made film; to each her/his own. Funny thing is, after the 1st few shocks I became desensitized towards the barrage of sickness, enough so that I began to find the film funny, like a blacker-than-black black comedy. The edge of realism they tried for turned into surrealism. That surrealistic feel surrounding the gore works against what (I believe)was the film-maker's goal: to have the movie as a whole be like a slice-of-life gone terribly wrong. Instead of making me feel genuine emotion towards the characters and their situations, that surrealistic edge gave me enough SAFE distance from them that I could step back from what I was seeing and think critically. If they could have found ways to remove that safety blanket between the gore scenes, so that I was tethered to the story enough to be unable to step back for a breather, I would've been deeply repulsed for the movies full duration instead of chuckling and shaking my head.<br /><br />The film-makers were obviously attempting to create a meaningful, realistic film with an important message, but due to the over-all lack of professionalism (exceptions to all involved in the amazing work with the gore)the movie goes from being a potentially important and artistic statement to falling flat as another typical shock flick that, while upping the ante on the limitations of pervasive gore, stays grounded as just another movie in the Netflix \\"Horror\\" genre because it, surprisingly enough, didn't take technical chances in how it was made to match the chances it took with the limits of gore. The script could've been helped greatly by running it through maybe 3-4 more drafts.<br /><br />All-in-all, \\"A Serbian Film\\" should be called \\"A Serbian Movie\\" or \\"A Serbian Horror Flick\\", because, unfortunately, those involved in its creation obviously placed all of the emphasis of their talents on the shock factor of the gore alone, versus putting in the time and effort to make the other aspects of the film stand tall with the blood & guts. A tripod falls down every time if it only has one leg fully telescoped. HOWEVER--if you get past the technical misfirings (if that sort of thing even bothers you at all)you'll probably appreciate this movie for the risks the people involved took (everybody whose name is attached to this movie will find their reputations forever changed, for better or worse);or, like me, you'll end up enjoying it as something outlandishly gross to watch a few times (don't see myself watching it more than once more on my own--too many better films to digest),or a \\"shock token\\" to show friends or bring to parties to witness the certain gross-out reactions. Hey, I can admit that it's FUN at least!o all involved in the amazing work with the gore)the movie goes from being a potentially important and artistic statement to falling flat as another typical shock flick that, while upping the ante on the limitations of pervasive gore, stays grounded as just another movie in the Netflix \\"Horror\\" genre because it, surprisingly enough, didn't take technical chances in how it was made to match the chances it took with the limits of gore.

B007R3AZNK|4.0|Thanx, Joe for another fine slab of music.Althuogh,I'm partial to the live recordings(hence 4&1/2 stars)this is choice enough stuff for me.Sure beats the psuedo sludge thats clogging many of the musical arteries today.I find it interesting that Brad Whitfod had a hand in this recording.I like the fact that JB keeps a steady interplay with musicians of the previous generation as well as those of his own.I wonder what a Derek Trucks/Bonamassa collaboration would sound like? Maybe one day, but for now,\\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\"is just really fine.
B001FB563E|5.0|This is a stark movie which never lets up on the sense of lost hope. Though this is a very dark movie I had to own it. I see this as a potential reality of the Earth if the human race continues to consume and to war destroying precious ecologic systems. Our modern day truth is ignored or justified allowing the continued human plight captured by \\"The Road\\".
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app so so much because I can read the Bible on my kindle fire!if so great all my friends have this app on there kindles so they can read the Bible when ever they want where ever they want!I hope every will rate this a 5 stars and also get the app.works great
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very simple. Nice seemless interface and very secure. I noticed that you can set it to black out screen on the target computer as you use it. I thought that was a great feature. Nice work. The price is so reasonable too. I can even watch my DVR from anywhere. So commercial free HD movies and TV shows on my Kindle any place there is wifi. Thanks Splashtop!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have read and re-read this book countless times and it is still amazing. can't get enought. Plan on not being able to put it down until you have read the whole entire thing. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author!
6304432461|5.0|this is it!  this is the one...  this is where it all started!!  he just wanted to protect his wife from impending doom... and now he turned out to be one of hollywood's major action characters in the history of cinema.  long live john maclane!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The plans are wonderful. The fact that it will sync what I've read on my phone AND kindle is absolutely terrific.  Thank you!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|best game in you've ever made! It would help to have more levels though...Oh well it's still the best game I've played
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a great fun way to fill the moments that are hum-drum. definitely recommend to anyone that just wants to &quot;chill&quot;.
0439023521|5.0|A sci-fi thriller by Suzanne Collins. An immersive story of a teenager in a much bleaker future than most would expect where one glamorous city rules over 12 poverty-filled districts. The protagonist of the book, Katniss Everdeen, volunteers herself when her little sister, Primrose, is chosen to enter the \\"Hunger Games\\" where 23 other \\"tributes\\" (2 from each district) battle for survival in a huge arena. The story is about overcoming a challenge. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an action-filled thriller.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|Roses are red reviews are blue. This book was pretty good. The first chapter was the best, and the tenth was the worst.v
B007JM4CWY|1.0|I've never heard of this game before, but, since it was the freebie today, I thought I'd give it a try.  Glad I didn't pay for it.  I couldn't make any sense of the tutorial.  Can't say that this game makes me want to go out and try other developers' versions of it.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|We received this product ahead of the scheduled date!  We bought it used, but to date, I've had no problems w/used DVD's bought from Amazon.  The product case and DVD's inside and out were in excellent shape!  We've watched this series several times already and have fallen in love w/the new 5-0 characters.  This new 5-0 series does great credence to the old 5-0, but ramps up far beyond its predecessor!  We intend to buy Season 2 when it comes out as well!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I purchased this book after the movie was released & received such great reviews.  I was not disappointed at all.  It was so hard to put down once I started reading.  I would certainly recommend.  I bought the DVD after I read the book & it was awesome as well.
B003L77FYS|5.0|We received this product within the specified time, in fact earlier than specified!  The condition was excellent!  My wife and I have enjoyed all 5 DVD's. We plan on buying season 4 when it comes out.  There is no reason to be afraid of buying a used product from Amazon.
068485743X|4.0|This book has good guidance and some useful suggestions for exercises in it.  I thought the advice on adjectives and adverbs (chapter 2), sound (chapter 3), comparisons (chapter 4), and showing versus telling (chapter 11) was presented very well.<br /><br />I agree with others that many of the examples given were too exaggerated (even if they might have been actual submissions) to be of much use.  I found myself skimming or completely skipping most of the examples.<br /><br />Overall I found \\"The First Five Pages\\" to be a valuable and fairly concise read on the subject.
0345803507|5.0|I enjoyed this book just as much as the first two!!  I was expecting a little more with the ending, but it was still great!!
B0055V0GQC|4.0|I purchased this after seeing Rival Sons on tv when they played the High Voltage Festival. They have a very Zepplinesque sound to them along with solid lyrics, & a very tight sound. I am very impressed with them & as always Amazon was their to supply the Rival Sons fix I needed! I think any Classic Rock fan will appreciate Rival Sons & what they bring to the table. Just like Guns 'N' Roses brought that classic rock sound back in the late '80's after the hair metal & grunge phase, I think Rival Sons will do the same now!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was even better than the 1st!!!  As soon as I am done, I will get the third and I know I will enjoy it as well.  What a great love story!!!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was recommended by my daughter; interesting and good but I'm not compelled to stay up late to finish it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love the game.  reminds me of classic Mario but with a rainbow.  controls are easy to use and feels like a classic controller.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|God is great. this Bible app is amazing!! I would like to thank the creators of it. it truely is great!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I really enjoy this type of puzzle. Very well made and lots of puzzles at a variety of difficulty levels. Highly recommend.
