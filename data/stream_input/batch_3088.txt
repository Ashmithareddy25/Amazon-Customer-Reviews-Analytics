0553573411|5.0|It's a great book and there isn't much more to be said I highly recommend buying and reading the whole trilogy. Very great story teller. My new favorite series and author.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Too hard and confusing.  NO INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.  I loved the movie but the game sucks!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like this game a lot.it is very very  fun!  If you like these kind of games , then you have to play this one,  it is the best !!!
0374275637|4.0|Helps people understand how perceptions are created and why some are distorted.  Easy to read although slow in parts.  Useful.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Love it , love this old time music ! I would recommend this to everyone  . And will because of amazons I cloud
B003G4W49C|5.0|A book worth reading again, if only to find true bits of wisdom about human nature and good vs evil, and maybe even forgiveness.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is so good.but I'm just figuring out how to use it but so far it's good u now what I mean. But it's working out if it doesn't hey it was free
B00EB6ENXO|1.0|I bought the DVD and came with a poor excuse of a digital copy. The digital copy now-a-days does not download into your computer, but you're free to steam it. I could not use it on my mobile devices without being connected to the Internet. What a rip-off.
147676459X|5.0|The new material is great, the older stuff still wonderful/funny or insightful.  Buy one for all your friends, and several for yourself in case you lose one.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I got this book only yesterday and I could not stop reading it. It is so compelling<br />Loved it so much.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|... And couldn't put it down after that. Beautiful story with flawed characters and of course the unforgettable language of flowers.
B00BTHWFEC|3.0|I got bored with this after the fourth or fifth play. Don't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. I have Sabbath stuff going back to the first album and am a big fan. This is tedious.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Love this movie. Great action pack.<br />Watched two time. One in French the other time in English.<br />Both time truly enjoyed.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very intense movie. But fun to watch. All the actors did a great Job. It was more than what I expected.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fabulous<br />Only sometime s shuts down but works mostly so that it goes well most of the timeshare h have high
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Any story that digs so deep but stays real is worthy.  This story is worthy. And you'll never think of flowers the same. Ever.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Sarah Manning, a petty fraudster, has returned to the city she grew up in to put her life back together and reunite with her seven-year-old daughter, in the keeping of Sarah's foster mother. However, Sarah's life is thrown into turmoil when, getting off the train, she immediate comes face-to-face with a woman who is her exact double. The double immediately throws herself in front of a train. Shocked, Sarah steals her belongings and discovers she has a lot of money in savings. Sarah decides to pose her double to take that money and built a new life for her and her daughter...but when she discovers that there are yet other duplicates of her out there, things become a lot more complicated.<br /><br />There are many reasons to watch Orphan Black: its compelling science fiction plot and ramifications (handled with a light touch), the perfectly-timed story development and pacing, the interesting array of three-dimensional supporting characters, its excellent soundtrack and its refusal to conform to any kind of formula are among them. But one stands tall over all others: the absolutely astonishing central performances by Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany. Maslany plays not just the central character of Sarah, but an array of her various doubles and duplicates. In one episode she plays no less than five characters, many of them interacting with each other. The interactions themselves are convincing (with judicious use of CGI and overlaying of images, but mostly clever double work and positioning) but it's Maslany's ability to fully inhabit and develop each character as a completely separate individual that is jaw-dropping. Even when they are posing as one another, it's possible to tell which is which through subtle nuances of expression. Before the season is half over, it's easy to join in the chorus of voices expressing disapproval that Maslany was robbed of an Emmy nomination this year. The only flaw in her performance is her 'street' English accent she uses as Sarah, which is mostly acceptable but occasionally dips towards Dick van Dyke territory. But it's easy to forgive given how good she is on every other level.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a mixture of other young talent and established names. Providing experience and presence are Matt 'Max Headroom' Frewer and Maria Doyle Kennedy (probably best known internationally as Queen Catherine of Aragon on The Tudors, also known as 'the best thing in it') as the morally ambiguous Dr. Leekie and as Sarah's foster-mother Siobhan respectively. Amongst the other younger castmembers are Jordan Gavaris as Sarah's foster-brother and partner-in-crime Felix (whose English accent is better, though still a bit affected) and Michael Mando (who played the psychotic Vaas in the recent computer game Far Cry 3) as Vic, Sarah's highly unreliable ex-boyfriend who plays both an antagonistic and comic role as the series progresses. The cast is, as a whole, fairly likable and play their parts well, though the otherwise-solid Kevin Hanchard could do with bringing a bit more subtlety to his role as Detective Art Bell.<br /><br />The series has a relentless pace to it which makes a nice change from other shows that seem to delight in rationing out their secrets to the audience over many years. Instead, Orphan Black covers more ground in its first episode than most shows manage in two seasons. By the end of these opening ten episodes alliances have been forged and shattered, major characters have arrived and been killed off and the secrets behind the duplicates have been exposed, explored, developed and complicated several times over. Yet the show never feels rushed, with a good blend of drama, psychological horror and occasionally hilarious comedy (particularly driven by Sarah's 'soccer mom' double, Alison) making each episode immensely watchable and indeed re-watchable in the light of information unveiled in later episodes. The show is also sensible in dropping even major characters for several episodesin a row when they have nothing to do rather than giving them pointless filler storylines. Not only is the cast good, but their interactions are highly engaging: Felix and Alison's initially prickly relationship develops into a more amusing friendship as the season continues, whilst Sarah finds it tricky to deceive Art, a good man who may end up on the opposing side to her.<br /><br />Picking out flaws is almost impossible, and the most noticeable (such as Sarah's accent) are pretty trivial. One of the revelations in the season finale is a bit puzzling, since it is completely illegal and would never stand up in a court of law yet the characters react like it's a life-changing moment. There's also an argument that the actual cliffhanger is leaning towards the predictable cop-out side of things and, on occasion (most notably in the final two episodes, which barely pause for breath), the show's pace runs away with it a little and allows it to get away with a few minor lapses in plot logic.<br /><br />But it's hard to criticise the show too much. Orphan Black's first season (****¾) is relentlessly entertaining, supremely-acted by its star and its science fiction plot is surprisingly well-developed (the science itself is a bit simplified for casual viewers, but the social ramifications are addressed nicely). It is available now on DVD and Blu-Ray in the USA, but, somewhat perplexingly, not until August 2014 in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray).
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|Great addition to my Beyonce DVD collection! Can't wait to listen to the new single \\"God Made You Beautiful\\" and I cant wait to look at the Revel show taping! That was my first beyonce concert.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|Like paying up front to play BUT continues to freeze and  stops the game play  PLEASE fix have had this problem 3+ times
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|I must have enjoyed it. I own it and have seen it many times, especially the last third. As usual, watching it multiple times lets you catch statements that you might have missed. I wonder if there will be a sequel? Again, Amazon Prime is the way to go.[[ASIN:B00FQRFC7S To Arrive In Time (Vorian Archives)]]
B00CE6E6B2|1.0|A brand new KFHD2 and as usual a great game is not compatible. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves!!! This makes no sense. Get it together and get with the times. Either you are a developer or a dinosaur you can't be both
B003XI4LUQ|3.0|Good special effects but seemed to be lacking any great suspense. More dialog would have helped and did he just kiss Andromeda or did they get together?
B00FEJIVRQ|3.0|storyline is getting old, repedative, and too predictable.  The viewing of the movie in instand video through amazon from halfway around the world worked spectacular.
0671449028|5.0|Another cute Sandra Boynton book.  It is a little strange that the animals are all on a boat (Noah's Ark?), and that they all exercise right beofre bed (admirable), but the book is cute and my daughter likes it a lot.  My family really enjoys the drawings of all the different animals and this book is quickly becoming a favorite at bedtime.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game itself is a lot of fun! It would be nice to have more &quot;lives&quot; before they cut you off and then try to coerce you into spending real money to buy more though. I understand the marketing aspect...everyone wants to make a buck. It just seems a little manipulative to me.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|The Croods was so hard to describe but exceptionally funny.  I didn't know what to expect but I am glad I watched it. A wonderful family film about the caveman.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It was clever and kept my attention. I liked the layers of mystery. The End was a surprise.  A definite watch.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Great family movie!  Kids from 4 to 13 loved it!  Can't find that in a movie very often.  Nice message also.
006202406X|4.0|I loved Divergent. Insurgent was fine. And I'm really happy with Allegiant and with the way it ended!<br /><br />I love it, when a book doesn't have a happy ending just for the sake of a happy ending. Furthermore... there are different kinds of happy endings and it doesn't always have to be connected to love. There are more things in life than that.<br /><br />I only give 4 stars, because the end seemed rushed to me. I liked the idea, I liked what happened, but it kind of happened too fast, like time was running out. If the book was about 100 pages longer, I would have enjoyed it even more. But I stilled enjoyed it a lot!<br /><br />Thanks, Veronica Roth, for being brave and letting it end this way! This way much more believable and meaningful than what some fangirls are wishing for ;)
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|I have been a Jon Schmidt fan for a good ten (or more) years. I have all of his CD's (can I recommend Winter Serenade?). I loved him when he started bringing &#34;this cellist&#34; out with him for a few songs here and there. Then they started doing shows together. What?!? They are awesome!! So I, too, fell in love with Piano Guys. I have both of their CD's, which my kids, so I was excited for this one. November 1, I popped it in the player!<br /><br />They definitely did not disappoint. All are beautiful and slightly-to-quite unique. I love &#34;O Come, O Come, Emmanuel&#34; and of course &#34;Carol of the Bells/God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.&#34; Surprisingly, &#34;Where Are You Christmas&#34; is one of my favorites and it has me wishing I knew the words so I could sing along. &#34;Still, Still, Still&#34; and &#34;Silent Night&#34; are simply beautiful songs.<br /><br />This CD will fit any mood are you in. Definitely a great buy!!
B006B7LQ90|5.0|Amazing read.  Talks about the most fluid field ever - technology - after 20 years it is all completely relevant!
B004DSX5B6|5.0|Just very good tool in outdoor world which I think much better than the other Brand's products! Heavy weight and goodlooking!
B00DU74U74|2.0|I read this book and let me say I could NOT put it down. I then watched the movie. Ugh. What a let down. Normally movies are typically not as good as their books but this was even worse than normal. Not so fantastic acting and adopted and cut short story line left a lot still desired out if this movie. If you enjoyed the book please just skip the movie. I did however discover that I like this author and that twilight was not just a fluke.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Good well plotted stories and strong acting make me a fan of this show.  The things that makes me stop at 4 stars is the conventional TV land unrealism of the world represented in this show.  Despite all their attempts a relevance it really doesn't seem at all real.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Absolutely loved it. I think he did a great job following along the original line although differences or maturity in his writing style king is still the best
B002JWD6AS|3.0|LOVE Maggie Stiefvater, but this series not my favorite--too much repetitive story line within the book. I felt like I was reading the same scenes over and over. Much prefer Scorpio Races and Raven Boys!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great little hunting game.  Love the different locals and prey.  I have it on both my phone and my kindle fire.  Even got the kids playing.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I was really hoping Dawson and Amanda would end up together...  Tucker's story about him and Claire was heart warming
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play but not a fan of having to wait to unlock levels,etc. very addicting and a blast. I enjoy seeing where my friends are.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This converter works, as advertised, for my 2012 Macbook Pro and was much cheaper than buying a whole new set of chargers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Very addictive. My kids and I play all the time. I just wish my daughter could get it on her Nook for free.
B009NPLIFE|4.0|As entertaining as expected. A nice, quick way to close off most of the loose-ends of the series and allow the average Gossip Girl fan some sense of closure.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|I liked that Amazon was offering the HD version for $0.99 but it most certainly was not HD. As my title reads, it was literally worse than bootleg quality. Whenever the excitement was happening, it turned VERY blocky and I was unable to see most of the best parts of the movie. I am unsatisfied.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I used a piece of Scotch tape to join the adapter to an older MagSafe plug, and it's working perfectly.  Been using it for a couple of months now with no issues whatsoever.  Would buy again.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I saw all the one star reviews before I read this book and honesty, I think that this book deserves 2.5 stars. Most of the one star reviews said that Veronica Roth disappointed them because of something bad that happens in the end. I won't spoil it but I think that even though I expected it, it was a little sad and at the same time made the book better. This book was a Big let down. The whole thing was about genetics and it just kept drawing on about the same things. I didn't like the concept of Chicago being an experiment. It took away form the sense of adventure and made the difference between tow and three stars.<br />  In the first and last ten chapters, the book was written like the Veronica Roth we knew and loved was paying attention to writing it like how her fans would have wanted her to be writing it the whole time. Lots of people will tell you not to waste your tome reading this book, but I think it was with my time to finish the series. Even though this was not her best work, it was still with while to read. So don't listen to the people who tell you it isn't a good book, you should read this!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Poor viewing experience because the player was terribly slow. I rented the movie, couldn't watch it and there was no way to return it.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I love bluegrass and i love Alan.  he always does a great job,  and I have all of his music
B003008RWA|5.0|Sicko (2007) is a frightening look at the U.S. health care system. Here, Michael Moore exposes the realities that permeate a seriously flawed and corrupt system: record profits for insurers and drug companies, as well as bonuses for those who deny treatments, a lot of which would be life-saving. In only a way that Michael Moore can deliver, the viewer is taken on a roller coaster of emotion, from hilariously funny depictions of how things are done with our current system, to very upsetting testimonials from those whose lives have been negatively changed forever. Moore also explores other nation's health care systems, and much to his surprise, he learns how other nations look out for the well-being of their citizens. A lot of nations put people before profits, and in many cases, citizens pay nothing for their health care. Finally, Moore brings attention to the fact that federal prisoners in Guatanamo Bay, Cuba are given full health care, and thus are treated better than U.S. citizens.  Sicko isn't for the faint of heart (no pun intended). This film is a fascinating yet tragic look at the reality of the U.S. health care system; it's capitalism at its worst, but worthwhile viewing.
B00G9U7NEQ|3.0|Its funny enough and family appropriate. But it certainly lacks the punch of the first movie. It mostly hangs on the first movies coat tails. However, its a must rent. I just wouldn't pay $20 to buy it. Kids liked it, but they also watch the Redbox knock offs and love those too, so take it with a grain of salt.
B00FJTYDKK|1.0|we will probably go to VUDU,because,your service,WAS NOT STREAMING, IN 3D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We wanted to use our NEW 3D-TV capabilities,and you failed.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was hard to believe that all of this book began with a six year old boy and climaxes with him at only the age of eleven. I know I never even dreamed of doing what he did at that age. Loved it. A great lesson comes from it.
1250037751|4.0|The novel takes place in San Francisco, where Clay Jannon, out of work web designer, accepts a job working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore.  It’s not your ordinary bookstore.  There are a few shelves of the type of books you’d expect to find, but the majority of the store consist of very unique volumes, written in code, which are strictly for members.<br /><br />This was a very fun read.  The Clay and his friends, a bunch of computer nerds, seek to solve the mystery of this strange club, and as a reader, I greatly enjoyed the characters and the twists and turns that go along with this journey.  My only disappointment was the ending.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Very relaxing puzzle game with different types of images. difficulty ranges from super easy to very hard. I totally get lost in the puzzles.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best series on TV! Great story lines, costumes, and setting. Excellent cast. Hurry and get Season 3 in. I can't wait for Season 4!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love the suspense and tension between all the characters.  I don't want to see them fall apart but I know it's going to happen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Loving' this game! Now I understand what all the rave is about! Well gotta go, my full lives are back up.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Great for Bible research or plain Bible Reading!  (If only I can make it appear in my Kindle Device Apps!!!)
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This movie upholds the original premise of shaking up assumptions.  Sully and Mike meet at the University and we get to watch their friendship evolve.  Great graphics, fun adventures, good G rated fun.  I recommend it highly.
1608871827|5.0|I really love this book man! If you're a fan of the movie, you'll want to get this book too.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|hate it.<br />It doesn't work. I can't find the ap on my kindle tablet. I wish I never purchased this item.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Very happy with this album.  I was really worried that Pearl Jam would be able to keep up with the great releases from Soundgarden in late 2012 and Queens of the Stone Age this past summer.<br /><br />This album delivers.  Pearl Jam is a diverse band.  Don't expect to love every song.<br /><br />My favorites are Getaway, My Fathers Son, Infallible, Pendulum, Swallowed Whole, Yellow Moon.<br /><br />There are some real standouts here that I think will be defining Pearl Jam songs when we look back at their catalog of music in 10 years or so.  Infallible/Swallowed Whole/Yellow Moon will be remembered as defining songs in my opinion.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I was skeptical but this book does &#34;prove&#34; that life is how we perceive it to be.<br />I had success with a few of the 'experiments' and have begun implementing a few of the principles in my life.<br /><br />If you are the sort of person who believes in prayer or have a feeling that you can control your own destiny, you will love this book! I personally, don't believe in prayer, I don't think we control every thing that happens to us. And I still liked this book - it doesn't hurt to send out positive and grateful vibes. Life is how you see it.<br /><br />Warning: this book has the potential to be dangerous for for those who might take it all a bit too seriously (trust humans to think we can control the universe!) So make sure you temper this with some rational thought. This author is nutty and thinks that you could win lotto, cure your cancer or make the postie bring you a &#34;gift from god&#34; - if you were just &#34;focussed enough&#34;. She claims that the reason we don't achieve these amazing things is because we are all scatter brained mortals, letting our negativity get in the way of 'the force'. However, I think we don't all win the lotto because it is ...luck ;) Read it and have some fun, but don't blame yourself if your E square is more - E.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Remarkable book! Frankl's experience in the concentration camp ans subsequent, insight into human nature is truly inspiring! The book outlines his idea of &#34;logotherapy&#34; and man's need for purpose and meaning. Very easy to read and enjoyable, I think for anyone. Psychology buffs will find a lot of &#34;aha&#34; moments.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I just started playing candy. Crush after seeing friends not being able to put it down.  I just want to play it when I have time and want to relax this is so fun ......

B0058N2SRC|1.0|I was so excited to get the whole series of Gilmore Girls.  Last night I put in a disc and it said it was unable to be played in my region.  I tried multiple discs from multiple seasons in the series and they all said the same thing.  Can't be played in my region?  Oregon?  USA?  I have a standard DVD/Blue Ray player and I've never seen anything like that message.  So sad :(
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|I like this game alot it is very challenging. I do very well playing in the hard levels.I recommend purchasing this game. Its alot of fun.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not nearly as flexible as the Apple TV or the Roku. Look into those options depending on your needs. You can screen cast from a computer to an Apple TV, which buys you a lot more options...Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, and just screencasting DVD's, etc.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great characters, great action with many surprises thrown in.can't wait to read book three !! Then to watch it on tv
B008JFUR10|5.0|So, the plot is horrible, and Jax can't act his way into a shampoo commercial...BUT IT IS GIANT ROBOTS FIGHTING GIANT MONSTERS!

B003VANOFY|5.0|Best headset I have found. I bought a cheaper logitech for work, but it wouldn't work with Linux. (Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit). So on a friend's recommendation I bought this. I was able to get this working with no issues with Mumble...the sound quality was so good that I ended up using this to listen to music as well, and then used this for a game of LoL under OS X and Windows 7.
B005544TRQ|5.0|very nice series.it is very nicely done and written. it is has laughter, drama and a little suspense. must watch
B0035LMTZA|5.0|Great action movie. Will be a movie night choice for many weekends. The whole family can watch and enjoy.  Humor and action.
B000XVK30S|5.0|The Addams Family is a remake/movie of a series that ran in the seventies. The delight and humor of this movie is particularly humorous to those of us who saw the old series and reruns as children. The cast pulled off the remake with astonishing likenesses to the old characters instead of trying to reinvent them, but with a modern twist. The Addams' are a comedic gothic bunch who do things they're own way in spite of the world about them; while the children play with electric chairs and gallows,  Morticia (played perfectly by Angelica Huston) feeds her carnivorous plant \\"Cleopatra\\" whom has a penchant for any guests straying in the house, as \\"Grand MA ma\\" cooks up supper for the family while tentacles wave in the pot. Gomez (Paul Rulia) flips about the house practicing his swordwork and Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd)  lights a light bulb with his mouth! And the seven foot butler \\"Lurch\\" will kindly take your hat for you, just hope he leaves your head on your shoulders! And don't forget \\"Thing\\" the disembodied hand that scampers about the house like a pet- a pet that answers the phone and will kindly act as a golf tee...It's all just another day in The Adams Family household.<br />  In this remake, Fester has been missing for twenty years much to the grief of younger brother Gomez. A Lady Loan Shark and her bruiser of a son, along with the Adams' crooked accountant, try to shave the thugs head and try to pass him off as the long lost Fester, all in hopes of finding and stealing the Adams' famous fortune of gold and treasure. But the Addams household turns out to be a hard nut to crack!
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|One of the best shows out there!  It always keeps you on your toes, and the complex story line is insane!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is very addicting. I heard other people tell me how much fun it was, and I had to try it for myself. This is a warning you can play for hours and not want to stop. On the down side it only lets you try so many times and then you have to wait for twenty minutes or more. The game stops you for that amount of time..
B00G24KKAS|3.0|It's sad to say that season 4 is a bit disappointing for me.<br />But it already started in the last episodes of season 3. I guess it's because Glen Mazzara left TWD.<br />There is no tension anymore. New Characters die to early so you don't really care. e.g. The first episode of the new season would have been at least 2 or 3 episodes on the old seasons. The pace is too high. There is one event after the other. So there is no time used anymore for character development.<br />I hope they reduce the pace again, because the series is still very well done.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It's just about the stupidest game on the face of the planet. It just wants you to buy all these &#34;special tools&#34; that have crazy prices to make the game easier than it already is. I would give it zero stars if that were an option. The first level is super easy. You would think that it would get harder right?! It doesn't really get harder. There's just more obstacles in the way. It's a waste of your time to even download it to see if you like it. The Facebook version is way better.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Mild Spoiler Alert--<br />The characters and story line is enticing and keeps the reader mesmerized! Clary and Jace have this connection and you cant help want  more and more. Clary's powers are so fascinating and thrilling! I enjoy her overpowering will to help those she loves. My favorite scene in the book js when she uses this ordinary rune &#34;open&#34; and with her abilities she amplifies the power and it busts the ship apart! I can picture the scene as if it were a movie, she grabs the seal and starts frantically drawing this rune on the wall of the ship. You can see the wood where she drew starting to melt and burn away because of the power shes putting behind it! She's doing this to save Jace, the boy she loves but shouldn't. When shes finished her &#34;father&#34; Valentine says something and she looks up and says &#34;it means 'open'&#34; and you hear the ship literally straining to break apart. Then it does just that, the ship busts open like an internal explosion! So intense and the writing is incredible! This series is a must read!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have been waiting for this game to finally come on the kindle an  I'm so happy it's finally here. It's an awesome game .

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Extremely frustrating and challenging but I love it.  I just got it very recently on my Kindle and am on level 37.  I had to wait 24 hours after (I think level 35) each time I unlocked a challenge (3 of them).  That was a little extreme but I guess that makes you want to get back to the game after not being able to play for a day!!!  I watched other people play and couldn't imagine what the &#34;deal&#34; was - now I know.  It's addictive.  I am not on Facebook so can't get any help.  I refuse to BUY lives or objects to help win a level so I play<br />over and over and sometimes that gets boring.  I don't plan on joining Facebook so when I finally get to a level I can't win, I will start<br />over if I want to continue.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great for people that like strategy games.I love it.great for all ages.if you love games get this one.you'll love it
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I bought this to read on my own mini break with hubby hoping for a guilty pleasure read and it did not disappoint.  I laughed so hard I looked like a lunatic.  Thoroughly recommend to all Bridget fans.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game &amp; the challenge of finding the most valuable combos while still looking ahead to what each drop will bring into play. I don't<br /> like being limited by running out of lives and am not interested in asking my Facebook friends to send me &quot;lives&quot;. Still, a fun game for any age.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I know they have made a movie on this book, but there is no way they can catch the flavor and the depth of the book.  A true masterpiece of story telling.<br />I know now I have to read more of Mr. Card's work, but this book will be hard to beat.

B00AA0U046|4.0|I am not an extremely informed Hendrix fan and this is the first album of his I've ever purchased.  I saw it at Fry's at a price much better than here. For a double record 200 gram vinyl set I figured I had little to lose.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is due to the fact that even though there are two records, there is only 35 minutes of music total which I thought was a little lame.<br /><br />My record playback system is top-notch.  I have hundreds of albums and never gave up on vinyl even when it was hard to find records.  I'm glad for the comeback.  With that background I can say the recording is very good.  It is a masterful remix and seems like it could have been recorded today.  The pressing is very good and the thick 200 gram records are excellent.  The insert with extra `12\\"x12\\" photographs is a nice bonus.  I love the photo of the two stodgy military guys in front of dozens of young kids in suits watching Jimi.<br /><br />Is it repeated work from other albums?  I don't know and I don't care.  It is quality music presented in a quality package from one of the greatest rock legends of all times.  I enjoyed every minute listening to People, Hell & Angels.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Writing that reads like butter. Complex, fascinating, sweeping in a good way. Completely different from her previous work. Manifests her wide range. Characters you care about. Nothing predictable.
0992251656|5.0|I need to say at the outset that I am pretty neutral on the subject of Joss Whedon: I never got into Buffy or Angel or Dollhouse, I have not seen Firefly the TV show although I saw the movie and it was fun. I really liked Cabin in the Woods and Avengers but I am not really paying attention to Agents of SHIELD.<br /><br />So with all that said, I really dug the hell out of this game and can't wait to play again.<br /><br />The premise is straightforward: you're all (up to four players) captains of your own Firefly-type ships. There are several captains to choose from and I gather that they're all characters from the show and are differentiated by their skills and by small extra bonuses to certain kinds of activities (as Burgess, I got a free extra piece of cargo every time I completed a legitimate shipping job).<br /><br />There's a big, multi-stage mission - a heist or something similar, in our case it was to steal the English crown jewels - drawn randomly at the beginning of the game. First to complete the mission wins. But it's big and dangerous and often requires different items from the four corners of the map to complete, so to get the skilled crewmen and gear and ship upgrades that you'll need, you need to take on smaller jobs to earn money and rep.<br /><br />In other words, it's Privateer or Freelancer: the board game. Like, straight up. You get jobs (go to a place and do a thing, or pick up cargo at point 1 and take it to point 2) and they pay money roughly corresponding to the danger level and distance involved, and you use that money to buy better stuff so you can take bigger jobs so you can buy better etc etc.<br /><br />Jobs can be legal (deliver the mail) or illegal (deliver contraband) and moral (steal from the evil government) or immoral (steal vaccines from a hospital). Different contacts tend to offer different kinds of jobs, and the mechanics encourage you to find a type that suits you and stick with it, because completing a contact's jobs successfully raises your reputation with them, unlocking the ability to get better deals or do stuff like fence contraband through them. Legal jobs tend to pay less but, as they take place in Alliance space at the center of the board, are fast and safe to complete. A lot of them can be done in one turn. Illegal jobs tend to span larger distances and put you in the position of either making the fast crossing of the central systems (and risk being caught by the authorities) or creeping around the lawless border systems at the edge of the board, where you risk dangerous random encounters, including with the incredibly bad-news Reaver ship. Moral jobs are just regular work, but immoral jobs cause your crewmembers with the Moral keyword to become Disgruntled, which can erode their effectiveness and make them able to be hired away out from under you by other captains.<br /><br />(Another way to Disgruntle your crew, moral or not, is to not pay them their cut of a completed job. This is a thing you can actually do!)<br /><br />At spaceports you can buy ship upgrades, gear, fuel, and parts, or hire crew members. Crew come in varying levels of effectiveness and have different job types - mechanics help keep your ship running, pilots help you escape pursuers, mercs help you fight, medics heal wounded crew, etc. There are named characters from the show as well as cheaper generic &#34;henchman #2&#34; options. Ship upgrades are exactly what you expect: they let you go faster, hold more cargo or fuel, spoof distress signals to lure the authorities away from you, etc. Gear is equipped by crewmembers to increase their too, is more or less what you'd expect - guns, medi-kits, hacking tools, and so froth, along with comedy options like a fancy bolo tie or a ridiculous hat.<br /><br />Traveling through space or doing missions on the ground yields random encounters drawn from card decks; these take the form of skill checks. There are three stats in the game - fighting, mechanics, and negotiation - and every crewman or piece of gear adds to one or more of these. You roll a d6, add your score for that skill, and see what that result yields you. There are usually varying grades of success, like - &#34;1-3, A warrant is put out for your arrest, 4-6, attempt botched, 7+, success.&#34; You usually get a choice of a couple different approaches (talk or right, for instance, or ditch a piece of cargo to skip a difficult fight). Most encounters also have an Ace in the Hole: a way to instantly pass them and skip the roll if you have the right piece of equipment or the right crewmember (space hooker distracts the customs inspector, fancy suit gets you past the bouncer etc).<br /><br />So those are the nuts and bolts. How does it play? Well, like I said, I loved it; I know everyone won't, however. It's fundamentally a race, pitting your head for space-business against your friends' but with only a limited suite of ways to help or hinder them. Player interaction consists of a) when you're in the same space as another player's ship you can wheel and deal to your heart's content, buying and trading crew or cargo or whatever, b) stealing away each other's Disgruntled crew members, or c) siccing the Reaver ship and Alliance patrol cruiser on each other (like, if I draw a card that moves the Reaver ship a square, the guy to my right gets to decide where it goes). The game ends when someone completes the big heist, but there is no timing mechanism beyond that so the length of the game is pretty much entirely up to the lead player. If everyone's ruthlessly efficient, it will be short; if they're not, or if there are a lot of random setbacks (such as the Reavers massacring your entire crew) it will be long.<br /><br />Those are the downsides. The upside is that it's a gloriously Ameritrashy game, absolutely chock full of really great thematics (again, even to someone with no Firefly experience) and bursting at the seams with chips and cards and models and counters - but it's also simple as hell. Everyone had the mechanics pretty much down by the second turn. And the theme and mechanics dovetail in such a way that everything more or less explains itself; you don't need to think in abstract game terms to understand that buying guns makes you better at fighting or that going through government space with a hold full of fugitives and contraband might get you stopped and searched. It all just makes sense.tion - and every crewman or piece of gear adds to one or more of these. You roll a d6, add your score for that skill, and see what that result yields you.

B007EECSFA|2.0|The writing style is choppy and hard to follow. I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends or family due to this!
B0032KLAKE|5.0|It was an amazing movie all throughout! Ed Norton and Richard Gere were simply amazing. Awesome twists throughout the entire film.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Let me begin by saying that in spite of the things I didn't like about &#34;Allegiant&#34; I enjoyed reading the book.  Just like the previous two, it is hard to put down.  And even though I may not agree with the direction that Roth took it and with all of the plot points, I can understand and appreciate why she chose to take it in that direction.  It is a fitting ending for what she began in &#34;Divergent&#34; even if all readers are not thrilled about it.  It is very hard to talk about &#34;Allegiant&#34; without giving anything away as SO many other reviewers have done (even though this isn't the forum for that), but I will try not to.<br /><br />The story picks up right where &#34;Insurgent&#34; left off, with the dystopian future version of Chicago in chaos because of the video that Tris made sure was shown.  In that video the residents learned that there are people outside of the fence who have placed them in that city for their own protection but that it is time to let out their divergent population.  Yet Evelyn and her factionless army do not want this to happen.  Now that they have overthrown the faction system, they want to install their own system - talk about going from bad to worse.  Yet Tris and a small band of her friends (Christina, Uriah, Cara, and Tobias, among others) sneak outside of the city to discover what is out there for themselves.  What they find is nothing like what they imagined, and it threatens to tear them apart as they try to reconcile new truths with old truths and struggle to determine if these truths are real or just more fiction.<br /><br />Roth made the decision to tell the story through the viewpoints of both Tris and Tobias, alternating between them.  This isn't necessarily a bad idea in theory, and for those who purchased the collection of stories from Tobias's point of view, they had some familiarity with his perspective.  The problem comes in the fact that their identities when they are telling the story are not different enough.  There were times when I had to turn back to the beginning of the chapter to remind myself who was narrating at that point.  Perhaps this is what Roth wanted, or perhaps these characters are so similar, but there needed to be more differentiation between their voices.  Another issue is that there are so many new characters thrown at the reader but hardly any of them are developed enough, especially those who are meant to be the villains in this piece.  Perhaps if Roth had made this a longer book, or split it into four books, these characters could have been given their due.  Which brings me to my last issue with the novel.  There are so many climaxes among the various plots that the ending just feels way too rushed, especially considering the impressive beginning this series had.  It's been over a week since I finished and I think I am still in shock with the direction that Roth took this in.  If she feels that she has been true to her characters, then I can't fault her for that, even if I don't agree.enough.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun, the only game I play on a regular basis? I play almost everyday and I live the fact it is a game suitable for everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It can only be used with Youtube and Neflix. Not very useful. Of course it does not cost that much either

B004SH40BQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS BLUETOOTH TRANSMITTER, IT WORKS AWESOM ON MY IPOD NANO 6GEN. I bought a LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset, but becasue of the IPOD not having Bluetooth capabilities, I knew I needed to get a bluetooth transmitter, so I found this one... I read the reviews of this one and a few others, this one kicked butt in appraisal. So, I bought it! It was easy to link with my headset, and works great. Thank you for a quick delivery and a good product.

B0036S4B6M|3.0|There was a lot of hype around this book, and I think my expectations were really high. It started off really well, and I got caught up in the wonderful story. The momentum did not continue throughout the entire book, though. I was a little disappointed at the feeling at the end - not necessarily the actual ending. (sorry, don't want any spoilers).<br />It was very different from what I was expecting. If you are interested in the book, it's still entertaining. I just wouldn't be waiting for her next book.

Both are wonderful, I think that I love &#34;Coming from Reality&#34; a little more than &#34;Cold Fact&#34;,  but both are great.  Everyone in my family now loves Rodriguez,  and<br />my friends as well listen all the time.  How I wish he did more, ...how I wish that the 30+ additional songs he wrote would be recorded.  I would snap them up in a minute.  This is a remarkable story, about a genius.  Would give anything to see him.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love it, can't wait for #2! It is a little violent, and not quite the same as the book, but the entertainment value is great.
B00ELOOYZI|2.0|I love this app. It's challenging and fun but the rocket design aspect is riddled with problems. I hope the developers would fix the attachment points of the rocket components. Each piece only allows for one attachment point. This makes for a flimsy, wobbling rocket that doesn't fly. Also after spending 30 mins carefully building a rocket I might accidentally bump one of the already placed pieces. Well this is android so it rand it and places it somewhere else and there is no undo or back function in the game. Therefore I have to start all over because the delicate order you place the pieces in determines their attachment order. This makes the rocket building frustrating and no longer fun. A simple developer fix would make this game 5 stars! It has so much potential!
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Effectively &#34;I Am Legend&#34; rehashed, and diluted out. Poor plot especially around finding the cure, good visualizations. Zombie makeup and acting is almost comical. Unusual to see Bradd Pitt in this sort of centrally hollow movies.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Spoiler alert.  Don't kill the heroine.  Ruined the whole series for me.  Usually if I really like something I will read it again and again--not this one ever again.

006202406X|2.0|To start with, let it be known that I am a HUGE fan of the first two books in this series and I was REALLY looking forward to this release.  They were spirited and fun and it made for a very engaging story.  The third book, Allegiant?  Not so much.  I won't even get into the whole who lived and who died as much as some on here.  I will just say that it was really kind of a cop-out ending for a character that was set up to be such a survivor. It was disappointing and will not go down as one of the saddest deaths in young adult literature, I'm afraid. Now, onto the rest of the review...<br /><br />The story line was tired & old, frankly.  It lacked the spirit and imagination of the first two books. You can only read so many government conspiracy stories before you just don't want to read them any more, especially when this book doesn't really get into the details of why the behavior is occurring, other than they have \\"defective genes\\".  Basically, don't write a story about government playing with genetics when you know little about genetics.<br /><br />The format of the story left something to be desired.  The chapters ping pong back and forth from Tris and Tobias' point of view.  The other two books were from Tris' viewpoint, and that made the story work.  It was about the journey of one girl.  Now one chapter is from Tris' POV and then the next two will be from Tobias... and then back to Tris.... Tobias... etc.<br /><br />I would say that you should read this book if you NEED a conclusion to the story.  If you don't, you may want to pass on it.
B00DMEQP2S|5.0|Don't we get tired of the mainstream crowd going on and on about how the new stuf doesn't sound like the old stuff? I went and picked this one up on vinyl, the 30 dollar sticker price was a bit high, but I found it at a discount here on Amazon, and it still came with the MP3 download and the visual optimizer (If I ever have a nasty cold and need to take some Robo-DM I will be sure to load that baby into my computer...)<br /><br />Peeps gotta get with it. Oracular was a fluke in 2007 with the mainstream success. I actually discovered these cats through some huge boobed chick via her My Space profile way back when that I was stalking. Never got with the chick even after multiple requests to go out for milkshakes...but the MGMT has stuck with me ever since.  Too bad even the college radio stations seem to be ignoring it these days, its killer modern psyche rock! Albums worth!<br /><br />The crowd that digs psychedelic should be up all over this album, personally I dig it more than the other psychedelic out now, which tends to lean more on fuzzy, acid metal, modern black sabbath slag. MGMT have taken their style much further into something out of the San Fran Nuggets box... touches of bubblegum and electronica. Side one is poppier and side two gets a bit murky, but that is what psychedelic is all about. This is great stuff and is at the top of its game, doing even the likes of the psychedeligrampas like Syd Barret and Arthur Brown justice. That chick with the boobs has been out of college for a few years now...(I tried messaging her on My Space yesterday, the boobs still look delicious)  but the true fans of wild tripped out psyche music know that MGMT still got the stuff. One of the best albums of 2013 in my opinion.

B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app, and seems to be more accurate than some of the others.  The only thing I don't like about pulling it up is that the advertisements at the bottom block the view making you have to scroll up to see the information for the week.
B00FHAM3Q2|3.0|I like only half of the songs. I am not a big fan of her mixed genre. Wrecking ball and her other songs about &#34;losing love&#34; are great musically and lyrically. Love, money, party sounds like something Rebecca Black wrote. It is really terrible. And MY interpretation of CLEAN is obviously different than others. To me, I should be able to listen to it in the car with my kids if it is &#34;clean&#34;. That means NO CUSSING. I am 39 so I get that I am not her target audience but wrecking ball is such an amazing song I had hope for the whole album.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The movie is great. I was a little disappointed that it did not have the paper sleeve or jacket over the case, as shown in the picture.
0062107313|3.0|*** Warning, there are some spoilers***<br />It is a testament to Tan's writing that I finished this book. I do not like spending so much time with characters I do not like or respect. Violet Minturn, the daughter of a famed American courtesan mistress in Shanghi, is someone I didn't enjoy. A spoiled brat would be a good description. Violet is half American, half Chinese, a fact that she doesn't discover until she's 8 or 9. She creeps around the house spying on all the courtesans at work. Nothing her mother does is good enough and Violet never feels loved.<br /><br />  Violet's mother decides to return to San Francisco and is tricked into leaving Violet behind. Word is sent to her that Violet has died. Violet is sold into another courtsesan house as a virgin and is trained to take up the profession. Even though she knows her mother was tricked in leaving her behind and that her mother believes her dead, she is outraged her mother doesn't come back for her. Her unhappiness colors every thing.<br /><br />  She gets involved in a relationship with an American and participates in a counterfeit identification that leads to horrendous results. I can not fathom why she does so and it is never explained. She is outraged, once again, that her duplicity is discovered. This character never seems to mature or make adult, well thought decisions. It is like she quit growing at 14.<br /><br />  The book is overly long. There's so much discussion of furnishings and clothes that I tended to nod off. I think it could have been edited by at least 100 pages and been a better story. I can see why it took her 8 years to write it as it is so detailed. I find that as an author gets more famous that there is less editing leading to really uneven stories.<br /><br />  Still I read it. Amy Tan is a fine author and I doubt I would have finished it for any other author. I like to enjoy and appreciate the characters. I like to see characters grow and mature. I don't need to be impressed by details about things that really don't matter to the story. I really can't recommend this book. At it's length, it's a big investment of time for very little return.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|Very simply, as a fan or the Arthurian myths, this is a breath of fresh air, an an inovative take on the tales.
B00DY76Z32|5.0|Great movie. Some subpar acting but an original story that seems to pull it off. Jeff bridges and Ryan Reynolds are both comical in this movie. Kids seems to love it and want to contiuosly watch it!

B005LAIIGC|4.0|Bought this for the kids. They seem to really like the how the characters are &#34;warriors&#34; in this movie than just plain &#34;good and fuzzy&#34; holiday masquerades. Different approach to normal holiday characters.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My only complaint are about Gru coins. They are difficult to get and very easy to spend. Not sure why that is but it sucks. It should be easier to earn Gru coins. The other issue I have is that sometimes the game stutters/stalls for like a second and that is often how I die. Not sure if that is an issue with the game or my kindle.<br />Overall the game is very fun and addictive. I also like being able to see where my Facebook friends are in terms of high scores. Competitive.

B009ZQC7MY|2.0|HD was spotty, so I switched to standard halfway through the episode. Love Downton but the HD isn't working for me.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great Movie! Did not waste time getting started. The movie moves along at a good pace and keeps you entertained. It did however, seem to have parts that were not in the book. A must see if you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings series.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It goes over learning spanish in lots of different ways, so it sticks with me much better. I like to hear the words as well as have to type them in. Also having a picture to go with the word really is nice.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|A friend recommended this movie. Both my husband and I enjoyed it very much. Nice story and great acting. Highly recommend thus one.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Loved the whole concept of this story.  So many hidden backstories.  Rachel Joyce is a great storyteller and kept me turning the pages.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Streaming works great, If I can see it on my computer I can see it in Chromemast all day long.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fantastic, can hold you too long, not to mention the missions with periods of 24 hours.<br />I thank and congratulate Amazon for the strategy of making the game free
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I downloaded this app on my kindle fire, and it has never worked correctly. I don't have a laptop right now, so I'm stuck using the mobile version of FB on both my phone and kindle, and I was hoping this app would make it possible to finally be able to use the full version of FB. This app does not load correctly and is constantly crashing. Don't waste your time.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|It kept my attention.  Also I like this concept of heaven. Many of my friends read this book several years ago, but I am recommending it to those who have not read it yet. I gave it 5 stars because of how much I enjoyed reading it.
B000002UZ4|5.0|Love it!!! Has all the classic songs I loved so well! Remember listening to Small town boy and crying. Because I was a nt. Flight Attendant in the early 80's and would listen to horror stories of boys trying to go home to be accepted  because they were gay and dying of aids and were shunned by their families. Was very sad I listened to them and cried with them!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Why did i have too read it so fast? This book was amazing!!!i recomend this book to every one who can handle heartbreak.
B0000073YB|4.0|I originally I had the version of tainted love that was mixed with where did our love go. Was a little disappointed it wasn't like that but the cd does bring back a lot of good memories of good times
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A great read...  I really enjoy the storey line with a couple of great twists to keep you hooked until the end.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|An epic ending to an amazing series. This was truly a masterpiece of literature. I'd like to thank Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for over a decade of entertainment.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow! Amazing plot...very very interesting first book! ;) this Man is what every woman dreams of, but wouldn't expect certain things!
1416972242|4.0|City of Ashes is the second book about Clary that not long ago found out that she is a Shadowhunter. Shadowhunters are supposed to fight demons and make sure that downworlders don't hurt normal people that has no clue about the dangerous world that is just out of there range.<br />She also found out that Valentine the man who wants to destroy the Clave is her father and that makes Jace the young Shodowhunter she was falling for her brother.<br />To make things even more complicated for her Clary hears that there is someone or something killing downworlder's children and draining them of there blood and when Valentine steals The Sole sword, one of the mortal instruments there is no doubt that something big and bad is about to happen. And once again Clary and her friends get tangled in<br />it all.<br />The book was really good and entertaining and the plot just keeps thickening. I still would like Clary to stop being so helpless and always having to be saved by others... why can't she get someone to teach her how to fight. Simon can also be pretty stupid and do reckless things that have consequenses. But in the end it was a nice read.
B005V5WBFG|3.0|I downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire for good security. At first the app was very confusing, after you made the account, and went in. I went to settings to see all the things on that app. I saw that you had to pay and this was only a trial. After that I deleted the app because I wanted something not to expensive, this was pretty expensive so I had to delete it, but before I deleted there was no glitches or anything, but if you're someone who is willing to pay a lot for good security then download this app.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I enjoyed reading  about Gandhi many years ago.  I enjoyed looking at his story on the screen.  It depicted what he really went through in life.  Getting married at thirteen had to be difficult, when he was still in puberty.  Being discriminated when you have achieved so much was unacceptable to Gandhi and he fought for his rights as well as others.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially our youth today.  It could help with the bullying and give an alternative to violence.  Gandhi embraced non-violence and demonstrated strength and power.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting and a wonderful game to play. I would recommend this for everyone to get and to play. So glad it came to Kindle
B00F91SCXC|3.0|not as good as expected, same old zombie thing but with faster moving zombies.  Still a good movie just not great.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I would recommend this game if you liked flow. It is a really fun game where you connect dots and fill the box
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderful read, great characters. The characters were intense and had  a lot of depth.  I would definately recommend the books to someone else,
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's one of the best games for people of all ages some r hard bust most r pretty easy<br />And when u get stuck it friends can send u extra life's and also extra moves
B004GJDQT8|5.0|The best app ever. I order from this app more than from the computer. I love that I can order from anywhere.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|I can understand that Diana might like to do something a bit different to the standards but there are still several thousand that I would prefer to hear her sing than this CD....it just does not do it for me....the 2 stars are for the cover.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This was a gift for my cousin who began watching this series on reruns and fell in love with it.
B00G0KY1UO|1.0|On my Kindle Fire H DX this game kept flipping upside down from whichever way I was holding it, making it impossible to play. This is however the first action game I have tried to install.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I love Drew Barrymore and I always enjoy this movie each time I watch it. I'm glad to finally have it on DVD.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|A well written, resourced and sobering presentation regarding the impact of technology on our perceptions, productivity, economy and workforce.  Generating insight from the most recent economic and job data the issues we face are greater than the common perception and are likely to get worse before our culture adapts to the challenge.<br /><br />However, the future is not bleak, and with every challenge there are opportunities to elevate the human race to the next level of capability, to embrace our creativity and to create a future of unending possibilities.  We need to make smart choices now...
B0041KBWM0|5.0|An excellent adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, this will satisfy your thirst to see the novel onscreen better than previous productions of the same. With four episodes, it actually takes the time to set the scene, develop characters, and get the real flavor of the book, as well as follow it more closely. The style of dress, the muted make-up, and the demeanor of characters is much more period-fitting than other renditions.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I like thrillers and non conventional stories... but then we thought it was too complicated for no reason. Still a good choice.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|very awesome name.I first got it on my Pc so I figard it would bee cool.also needs more maps and characters that don't look the same
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Hosseini is an outstanding writer, and I was completely captivated by Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Unfortunately, unlike his other books, And The Mountains Echoed was rather disjointed. It was almost like a collection of short stories, strung together by some common but not always readily apparent threads.  I found it difficult to keep track of the characters.  I know this is a particular writing technique, but for me it made it harder to get absorbed in the story.
B00GFJ0NGQ|4.0|After watching the complete season 3 & 4 back to back with no commericals, I have another view of the show. Actually liked them watching this way on Amazon Instant video and Netflix. Watching them on AMC with commericals and having to wait a week to see next show or months till the season started back up made me review the show as the following: Boring. To predictable. Soap opera with walkers. Think George A. Romero said the same thing. Season 1 was excellent, Season 2 was Okay, Season 3 sucked, and Season 4 really stinking it up. Not sure what the people that are rating this show so high are seeing. Maybe my expectations are to high.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Fascinating detailed story of one woman's life who followed her heart and mind which was an uncoventional path for a woman in her time.  Excellent.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Gotta love NCIS.... now, I own all ten of the completed seasons, and plan on reviewing them again this winter.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I could not even get it to download.I wound notget it at all.it is no good.I bet it would not work with you either.
B00ANKV5VK|4.0|Still they look very good and feel nice, but as I walk they tend a bit to get off my foot. I wish I could use an adjustable strip. Lenght is ok, width is also ok (according to the shape and size), but strip tends to loose.
B00F880BWG|3.0|Roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Season One--Wow!<br /><br />Season Two--Mostly yawns, too much &#34;soap opera&#34; at the farm.<br /><br />Season Three--Better, not up to season one, but better than season two.<br /><br />Season Four--so far YAWN, back to the &#34;soap opera&#34; format.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have had this game for a long time, and trust me, it's worth the seven dollars. Here are some tips if you are new to this game and are getting it :<br /><br />1. Build a house ( or hide under ground ) before it's dark. That's when monsters come out.<br />2.  You know where it says SEED? Here are some seeds: neon, jpgamer ( or jpgaming try both I'm not sure which one ).
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This universal plug works well with my Samsung phone.  So I order extra for my phone, kindle to have in the car, office and at home....
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|I truly enjoy Photo Shop pro by Adobe&reg;. Yes, it cost ten dollars and yes it does require brains! I admit, I am one of those artistic types, but I also like things to be quick.<br /><br />I don't recommend this app at all. That's right you heard me... I don't recommend it. That is if your the type of person who is content with slapping a couple stickers on and maybe adding a quick caption.<br /><br />If you are like me, and are a pro, or at least a semi pro, I do recommend this application as a on the go, or even as a simpler alternative at home or work, and don't feel it necessary to use the desktop/laptop version.<br /><br />I am a twenty-something entraupenuer, who has been sketching since literally four years old, involved in photography since sixth grade and chose not to attend the Art Institute.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed this book and found the premise quite interesting. Don't know if there is a sequel but I would buy it to see what happens to these kids.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Totally useless if you have a Xbox 360. it does the same thing much slower than the Xbox with less features.
B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|Thank God that Donna isn't alive to hear the monstrosity done to her most cherished songs.  No respect for the original composers and arrangers in a crazy frenzy of unappropriated chords and electronic instruments without a musical goal but to make something beautiful into a Frankenstein rhythm.  I supposed the producers were looking for new audience for Donna's music and achieved a common electronica compilation. I hope that I could give this record ZERO stars but you can't...
034580404X|5.0|This story is beautifully written. Kept me entertained and captivated. I would recommend to anyone!!! This story is about so much more than sex.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Helen Mirren is amazing - what a great peek &#34;behind the scenes&#34; in a time that we remember very well. The movie was well-done and the news footage interwoven spot-on.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is great. Every episode adds more and more depth. The characters are awesome. I rarely watch shows for more than a season but this one keeps me coming back for more.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I think this is the book that I have enjoyed the most in a long time. Is there a sequel? I loved Cather and hates Wren for much of the story, but lost sight of their connection. And I want to read her fanfiction even if I do not reas slash :-)
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|Fun, simple little game.<br />Levels get progressively more complex and harder, but they never take more than a couple minutes to get through (other than dying and retrying.)
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Three years after Arcade Fire released The Suburbs, they are back with another epic (double) album.  If you're looking for The Suburbs Part 2, then you won't like this.  If you're like me, and enjoy hearing the band evolve their sound, then you will enjoy this album!<br /><br />  My advice is to not judge this by the samples alone or on just one listen. Give it time, even if you liked it on first listen, like I did.<br /><br />I have listened to Reflektor four times now, and here's what I think about the album:<br /><br />-The new co-producer, James Murphy (of LCD Soundsystem), adds new electronic/dance elements to the band's sound.<br /><br />-The album is two discs; disc one has an upbeat feel, while disc two has a moodier and slightly somber tone.<br /><br />-Reflektor is sequenced well and mostly flows well, with two exceptions. First, track three on the first disc, \\"Flashbulb Eyes\\" is too short and doesn't fit with the rest of the album.  Second, the hidden track of ambient noise is unnecessary.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|Good for a few hours of play if you're moderately interested in physics based games.  Good for days of frustration if you're a perfectionist.<br />Polish of the game is good as well.  I didn't encounter any bugs or strange behavior.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was well written.  It kept me trying to put the puzzle together just like Laurel.  The twist at the end was unexpected and caused me to think back to see what I had missed. I love this story and the crafting of it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|the story was well written and the characters well developed. the ending was a little abrupt but it was a very good read.
B00FPH6M82|1.0|Slow story line. Really only 2 characters. Characters not very interesting. Same old story line. Quest very typical and boring.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|Crystal clear cans!
B0083Z614S|5.0|47 years ago my grandfather gave me this book.  My pre-teen mind asked what an old man could know of reading material for young girls.  I put it aside and never read it. Out of long- enduring guilt, I finally picked it up.  How I wish I could tell my Granddad what a wonderful time I had reading it.  I believe in the Magic, and I think he probably knows.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It's quickly become my most favorite weather app<br />Very easy to use with all the info I need on one screen.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|it worked just like it said it should, and it's also a pretty good replica of the screwdriver from the show.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|A great game for the adults! I totally love this game and can't put it down! Nice graphics and great reactions from the humans in the game.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Got this as faotd ... it is really fun<br /><br />The levels are not overly long so good to play as a small diversion. Give it a try.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|Excellent mic... can't beat it for the price.  I compared this A/B to my old Sure Beta 58 mic and there might be some subtle difference, but it is minor.  I've played quite a few gigs this summer with the XM8500 (after the Beta 58 died on me after 20+ years of gigging with it), and it has worked well.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It sucks because i used to love this app and chat with my friends and family everyday but it logged me off and every time i try to sign it says its taking too long try to sign in later:( i really ljked this app can you guys please fix kik!
0765367351|5.0|I love all things bioshock and this helped me in more ways than one.  I learned more about the bioehock world and it fascinated me and helped fuel my enthusiasm for the series
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I gave it a 5 cos the good works that has come out of it alone deserves it. God bless you Dr. Chapman. I hope to invest this knowledge in my life and introduce the truth of the hard work that marriage requires. People need to know that if they can spare dedication towards wealth creation, then there should be a concise effort towards the sustaining and improvement of marriage.
B0011Z8SPW|5.0|Just an absolute classic album of them.  Although it was purchased by me to complete my collection of their discography, it is worth it in every dollar spent
B00F6JMG0M|3.0|Satyricon is a band with a great sound, and when they create a great song-it’s awesome!  However, because their musicianship isn’t stellar, there is normally a lag between great songs per album.  I have followed them faithfully since Rebel Extravaganza; but haven’t been WOWed since then.  The crossover stuff has add some depth to their sound, but the lag is still there.<br />Enter: Satyricon 2013!  This album seems to take the best elements from all of their past albums in order to create a super album.<br />It starts off with a pleasant intro, before kicking off with Tro Og Kraft.  This is a song with a great Danzig-like groove playing over a double-bass thud!  It doesn’t disappoint. The next song follows with another great evil riff.  Nocturnal Flare is similar to what they’ve been doing with their last couple of releases-a rock back beat providing the base for a monotone riff.  This time around, they incorporate more melody and composition about halfway through to create a dazzling, hypnotic effect.  Phoenix is a great stand-out track that has Satyr singing hauntingly clean vocals over double-bass riffage.  The song itself has a dark, vintage feel to it that really works with his voice. Walker Upon the Wind is a thrashy throwback to their older style.  It works well as a filler track, but there’s nothing stellar there.  Nekrohaven, Ageless Northern Spirit, and The Infinity of Time and Space follow the same style as the first few songs on here.  It didn’t sound fresh, but still worthwhile to listen to before the epic finale, Natt!  Natt is a slow, haunting instrumental with classical undertones.  It’s just as good as any other great song on here.  All and all, good job, guys!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|One of the greatest and most soulfully performed albums ever, and it was amazing at how quiet they kept its release
B003G4W49C|5.0|A great read I'm looking forward to seeing the movie. Anyone who is looking for an awesome story full of adventure you can stop searching because you found it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It is nice to view Spock and Kirk becoming friends much earlier in this alternate timeline.I like the Kahn twist and the end left it wide open for further episodes.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Candy Crush Game<br /><br />I don't like the time constraints on the game. You play a few games and then have to wait 20+min. for the next one to start.tt
B00CE004XM|3.0|I am a huge Bonamassa fan, and loved the first cd he did with Beth Hart, Don't explain. It had a very bluesy feel to it. This cd however has more of a big band feel. And I felt Beth was trying to hard. She didn't sound like she really fit the music like on the last cd. Its ok, but I wouldn't recommend it as something that is a good representation of either artist.
0060191325|5.0|secrets exposed for how men and women really think and respond and what they need in a relationship.  very practical
B0091W0JPE|5.0|Loved that it is one of the few old classics available on Amazon Prime.  I was looking at Maltese Falcon and original Robin Hood and that was not the case.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is really great and I use it all the time. 2 downsides: it does lag a bit sometimes (audio does not exactly sync w. video) when playing video from my local desktop via a Google Chrome tab (I realize this feature is in beta right now), and for some reason I can only cast mp4s from my local desktop to Chromecast, it does not work with avi files which instead just start to re-download to my computer. Actually, this may be a Chrome issue and not a Chromecast issue, but it's still annoying to have to hook up my HDMI cable again.<br /><br />Chromecast works really, really well for casting anything from Nexflix or Youtube. I think it's definitely worth the money.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|A classic PBS/BBC joint venture. The original Masterpiece Theatre in all of it's glory. It has stood the test of time and is as entertaining today as it was over 40 years ago. Jean Marsh and the ensemble cast are magnificent!!!
B00G32TD98|5.0|This is how ghost stories used to, and should be made.  Classic, scary, and not overdone and without gob of BS special effects.
B005LAII1C|4.0|i thought it might be stupid, (and the fenway scene was) but it was quite funny.<br />i like mark wahlberg, mila kunis, and seth macfarlane, so it already had that going for it.<br />this is by no means at all, for kids, as there is lots of pot smoking and blue collar language (swearing).<br />it's rude and crude and silly, in a good way.
B00G32OER4|5.0|One of the scariest movies this year! Great visuals, haunting musical score, lots of &#34;jumpy&#34; scary scenes! Highly recommend for horror fans! If you liked Insidious, you will love this!
B0030GJ50C|3.0|Went back to which this movie to bring us up to an corrent movie now playing. Very different shi-fhi, we decided it was not a date movie.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It's Okay.<br /> I had a lot of fun, but then you realize that you can't go in the anether in creative mode and you have to go in survival in order to get other blocks.  In addition, if you go too far, they don't let you go more.  And there are some mobs that is not in pe-spawners.  Honestly I don't think this is worse $7.00.  I really liked this version but I was also really disappointed.  I recommend getting or get the PC, Playstation, or Xbox edition.
B00BGI08GG|4.0|After the success of Smallville, live action incarnations of comic book stories have gotten a major boost for the television medium.  Probably the most popular spinoff is the series Arrow, which tells the life of the Green Arrow, Oliver Queen.  The show is now it is second season at the time of this review's writing.  The first season was a hit, with lots of action, suspense, drama, and several intertwined romances going on.  The cast, like that of Smallville, is filled predominantly of little known actors and actresses, all of whom are good-looking.  Many of the heroes and heroines featured in Smallville are also present in this show, though played by different people of course.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the story of the Green Arrow, this show presents it very similar to that of Batman; playboy son who undergoes life-changing trauma that makes him a better man, who then dons an alternate personality as a night-time vigilante who fights crime.  In this case, it is predominantly white-collar crime, whereas Batman fought blue-collar crime and organized crime.  Also, there are much fewer gadgets here than in Batman, and no fancy vehicles.  Instead we get more dialogue and complicated relationships, making this the soap opera of comic book shows.  Overall, a good show.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|Still entertain even though 1 and 2 were much better.  It was worth a rental.  Chow is hilarious,  querky fun!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is a great book that really captivates you to keep on reading. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.
B000NTHT6G|5.0|Great romance. Different role for Will Ferrell. Well acted and a good plotline. Dustin Hoffman does a great job also.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I read this book in two days, started reading and I just couldn't stop. There wasn't a character I disliked whether good or evil or somewhere in between. The humor throughout the novel got me every time. I really enjoyed the dynamics of this book as well and the closure of every character made the perfect ending. All in all a great book!
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Fantastic book. I made sure to read this before watching the movie. Once I picked it up, it was one of those books that you can't put down.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Great alarm clock! I don't like my alarm clock sitting by my bed, this is fantastic! I use it for weekend appointments as well.
0817439390|5.0|Bryan is an incredible teacher. I teach a course called &#34;Taking Your Digital Photography to the Next Level&#34; and highly recommend this book to the students. I loaned the book out and never got it back so I ordered another copy. Bryan's explanations are clear and very understandable. This is a must read for anyone who wants to improve their photography. And his workshops are terrific. I knew a lot about exposure before reading this book but I knew a whole lot more after reading it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So much fun, can't stop playing until I run out of lives! I am only on level 23 and have gotten three stars on all. Yippee
B0035HKWM6|2.0|Predictable humor. Not very interesting in terms of characters. It was good when it came out, but it's just not funny anymore.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|Good price, they seem to work perfectly.  I use them to open the remote app on my SGS IV near my bed, turn on certain music for my shower.  Switch sound profiles at work, etc.
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|Sting goes to Broadway.  His operetta, that has some good songs, and tells a story.  Well worth a listen. Good
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|It's cute.  Nothing too difficult with the puzzles, the answers become self-evident after a few tries.  You get more points for using less water, which adds a new layer of challenge for those perfectionists out there.  If somethin proves too diffictlu,it gives you the chance to skip.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|Interesting to hear new versions of Peter Gabriel songs, played with orchestra only, no drum kits, etc.  You get to hear both with and without vocals.
B00A6SZRJ0|4.0|Me and my boyfriend have a love of music like this, so I bought this cd as a gift for my beloved.<br />He really enjoys listening to it, and so do I!<br />If you have a love for epic trailer music then I definitely recommend this for you
B000005YZM|5.0|It is interesting to hear this classic album, which came out as the group was breaking up. It has the hit &#34;She's Not There&#34;, but the whole album is good, and really doesn't sound that dated to 1968.
B008JFUORW|4.0|This movie got some very bad reviews as being dark....Myself.  I can say yes it wasn't as constantly funny as the other two.  But if you look at the movie in its own rite and merritt.  I really enjoyed the film.  I thought it did wrap up the series quite nicely and enjoyed seeing all of the guys one last time on film together.
140006922X|4.0|This book is most interesting and easy to understand. Our group is finding it very good and well worth the read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Bombs get old. Would like to see more change-ups in the levels. So far all I have seen is jelly and the same fruit.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun and I love to play it on the weekends for the fun of it I live it
006202406X|1.0|Wow.. SPOILER ALERT, but didn't the publisher, editor or ANYONE tell the author she destroyed this series by the way she ended the book. It would be like killing off Katniss, or Bella, or Sookie, or Scarlet...you simply should never kill off the reason people fell in love with the book in the first place. Divergent was one of my all time favorite books that I could pick up and re-read time and time again....after how she ended this series, I will not be picking it up any more. How sad.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I loved it . However I cannot find it on my kindle.  How do I retrieve it? I lost it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun way to pass the time. The graphics are great and the sound effects are awesome<br />. I would recommend it to all my friends
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I bought this for my wife as a 39th anniversary gift because she loved the show when it was on. There had been a re-run of some of the episodes on television and she was more fascinated with it the second time around, than the first. She was disappointed when the reruns ended. It enables her to revisit the experience at her leisure and the price for a slightly used version versus a new version, made it hard to pass up. The box it comes with keeps it organized and protected. It arrived ahead of the projected delivery date and our anniversary and I looked like a hero for ordering it.
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|Acting was average at best. The 2 main actors (Charlie Hunnam and the Japanese actress) had no chemistry. The 2 doctors or scientists in this movie were extremely annoying and I had a hard time watching them. The plot was ridiculous.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is a normal modern woman doing a job that everyone else thinks is glamorous and easy.  Any working mom can relate to her angst and neurosis - heartwarming and hilarious.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Great plot, actors were excellent! It was funny, had action, some romance, and a great ending, what more can you want? I highly recommend.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The conclusion to this series was so hard for me to swallow, but if I'm honest, I've only chosen 4 stars because I so badly wanted Tris and Tobias to be together. I was in total denial for several pages, hoping her death was a mistake, but when I realized it wasn't, the tears started flowing! But Veronica did the hard thing. We all know Tris could never let her brother die in her place, and in the reality of her situation, her sacrifice was the only option. As much as I hated it, I knew it was true to her character, and the moments and events leading up to it were laid out so well. Will carry story with me for days, which for me is a sign of a job well done.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing candy crush while waiting for Dr. Apt.this game is a great mind game for little kids when learningto count and colors
1476747016|5.0|1) The illustrations are adorable!<br />2) The quality of the book is great. Perfect for a gift!<br />3) The size is perfect<br />4) The price is perfect<br />5) Pusheen is so cute!<br /><br />Recommended!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game and easy to get money. Great graphics with lots of guns guns and guns. The prices for things are reasonable.
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|I am 53 years old and just loved this book. It is very well written. It kept me engaged the whole time.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun. I think there should be another way to unlock more of the levels besides Facebook friends or paying. Other  than that I enjoyed the game.
B007MC0IAG|5.0|Really enjoyable natural science trip with a purpose: discuss those interesting and delicate questions which are hard to handle in discussions with people.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie..havent been able to find it through my cable carrier. .was super excited to see it on prime. .thanks
B002KJX4IE|5.0|I always liked Beetlejuice. I never saw it in HD before, you see a lot more of details and colors are much better. Thank you
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Seeing how Ive played multiple versions of the Slender Man games for PC, iPhone, and whatnot I thought it would be good to get it for my Kindle... Worth...every...penny... I got up to 7 pages (out of 8) and was trapped in the house on Highway. Slender Man WILL pop out of nowhere in order to get you. I will give one con to this game however, Slender Man... When I saw him once or twice, his legs were like a Sandpiper bird's, they were buggy and moving very fast. An attempt to fix it would be appreciated. Othetwise an absolute wonderful game to own...that is if you're not afraid of the dark. *evil laughter*
B00DYFCYSO|4.0|The first couple of songs including &#34;Love in the Future&#34; did not grab me. However, I loved just about all of the rest of the CD cuts including &#34;All of Me&#34;, which I play constantly. I love John Legend's stuff. It's off the beaten path.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|So i can keep it simple, i love this movie, visually it is awesome! didn't mind the creativity as far as new music, just so much of Jay-Z (i will admit i am not a huge fan of), but honestly it wasnt too much of a distraction NOT to enjoy the movie!
B00AEBB89W|5.0|A movie full of emotions and that makes you think a lot, maxime that is real life. That's why they buy it. I'm using Google Translator.
0765350386|5.0|I picked up this book unaware of what I was getting myself into. Brandon Sanderson amazed me with is well thought out plot. In this book, magic can only be passed down by the bloodline and can only be used by &#34;burning&#34; different metals. the differences of who can and cant use magic and those that can only burn a one or all metals creates a elaborate political and social system that helps the story along.<br /><br />This story puts you on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen next. Problems arising creating unexpected twists keeps you wondering how it would all turn out in the end.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how Sanderson made the characters seem more real as the book goes on creating their own personalities. The more he makes his characters interact the less they seem like fictional characters on paper.<br /><br />Strengths<br />-Good Character building<br />-Always moving plot line which was easy to follow.<br />-Invites a new way of thinking making the impossible possible.<br /><br />Weaknesses<br />-There could have been a little more description on the larger battle scenes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a interesting fantasy and a adventure story. It is not a basic fantasy book where there is one hero who saves the world but it is the combined force of a group of people. This book kept me wanting to read more and not wanting to put it down.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This has been a series that I liked all of the mythological combination with fantasy, great scenery, great actors and great plot, I am very pleased you have bought. I'm using Google Translator.
031623480X|2.0|This book should have been called \\"For Those with Grain Sensitivity\\" or \\"Just Beyond Celiac Disease.\\" This would have been a good read.  However, Dr. Perlmutter overreaches on this book.  If he stuck to the issues with just sensitivity to gluten he would have made a reasonable contribution.  However, he extends his reach to talking about carbohydrates without elaborating on the three different forms of carbohydrates:  sugar, starch and fiber.  He does not distinguish between these, nor does he acknowledge their relative importance to optimal health.<br /><br />By entering your diet into the CRONOMETER.com online you will see the holes in your diet.  If Dr. Perlmutter ever performed such a nutritional analysis of his proposed diet, he would quickly see fallacy in his arguments.<br /><br />His proposed diet plan is woefully deficient in several areas.  Here are a few examples:<br /><br />1. It is very low in potassium and high in sodium.  With an incorrect balance (2:1 potassium to sodium) you encourage serious problems with the electrical workings of your heart--a pacemaker might be in your future.  In addition low potassium, causes muscles to ache with strenuous exercise.  To remedy this eat more starches such as potatoes.<br /><br />2. It appears his fiber recommendation does not seem to be in line with a 40 grams per day minimum recommendation.<br /><br />3. It appears to be low in Vitamin E.<br /><br />Using his diet your risk of kidney failure increases due to the high levels of amino acids and fatty acids.  Your bones tend to be scavenged for calcium to neutralize these organic acids. Thus leading to increased risk of osteoporosis and kidney stones. Starches reduce this risk factor.<br /><br />His rich high-fat diet increases the risk of gout, gall stones and even cancer.<br /><br />Being a Scientist myself, I was surprised by his apparent lack of understanding of big numbers when he explains: \\"mitochondrion produces...free radicals...Multiply that by ten million billion mitochondria...to get 10 followed by eighteen zeros...can you imagine how much vitamin C...it takes to neutralize...the free radicals...on a daily basis?\\" By applying simple principles of chemistry using Avogadro's Number 6.02 x 10^23 and the molecular weight of Vitamin C(=176),  you only need about 300 milligrams per day.  This is a very small pill or more simply just some pieces of fruit.  So the answer is: not much Dr. Perlmutter.<br /><br />It appears his fundamental analysis ability is poor and biases his research to promote weak arguments (testimonials vs more robust science based research) to sell a book that people want to hear they can eat all the meat (fat and protein) they want.<br /><br />Strengths: knowledge and experience with people that suffer from gluten sensitivity.<br /><br />Weaknesses: Analysis, provides a biased research findings to promote cause<br /><br />So how could someone with Dr. Perlmutter's credentials be so far off the mark?  One of his credentials indicate he is a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition.  Initially this sounded pretty good.  Researching this I found this organization is merely a non-profit organization that calls itself a \\"College\\" and that the criteria for becoming a \\"Fellow\\" is a rather simple checklist.  Therefore it appears to be a non-profit organization set up to mislead people into thinking it is something that is not. But merely an organization used for self-promotion of its members for marketing purposes--in this case books.<br /><br />Two far better books with better unbiased scientific references are:  \\"[[ASIN:1623360277 The Starch Solution: Eat the Foods You Love, Regain Your Health, and Lose the Weight for Good!]]\\" by Dr. John McDougall and the uncontested best book for optimal nutrition called \\"[[ASIN:1568581572 Beyond the 120 Year Diet: How to Double Your Vital Years]]\\" by Dr. Roy Walford.<br /><br />Note to Dr. Perlmutter: you might want to take Dr. McDougall's continuing education program for health professionals on nutrition.<br /><br />Since most research and literature is pointing to a starch based diets as being the most consistently healthy, maybe this book should have been called \\"Against the Grain\\"...pun intended.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This series is excellent, comply with the recommendation offered and very successful, congratulations.  A series for families to enjoy. I'm using Google Translator.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Robert Downey jr. is the best part of this movie, the rest is very so so.  The idea behind the movie is pretty good but the movie lacks that real wow factor and the evil characters are a little bit too silly.  Overall a good rental glad I didn't drop cash to see it in the theaters.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a Christian, I am intrigued by the books I read about the Afterlife.  This book, written by a medical doctor about his very own experience, was an exciting adventure in reading.  I highly recommend it to others who are interested in this subject.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King at his best. I wondered how a sequel would hold up, but Dan Torrance shines through as a grownup. The book was riveting, could not put it down.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|Fascinating original that the Kevin Spacey series is based upon.  However, with a the tilt being British politics.  I've been binging on the entire series.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I enjoy the upgrades. and the ability to go from season to season. Music is great for a game too.
B00ERIUO02|2.0|I consider myself to be a Katy Perry fan. Katy's [[ASIN:B003L77TZI Teenage Dream]] was one of the greatest CDs ever. Songs like \\"Firework\\" and \\"The One That Got Away\\" are classic. This CD is not nearly as good as Teenage Dream. The quality of this CD's songs is simply not as high as the songs on Teenage Dream. Even the song \\"Roar\\" is not Katy's best work. The rest of the songs on the CD are unmemorable and overproduced (perhaps to make up for the fact they are unmemorable). I suppose that it would have been impossible to equal the success of Teenage Dream with its five number one songs. Still, this CD is a disappointment.
B004MYF4SS|2.0|There wasn't quite enough depth in the characters. The story goes along at a quick pace and so you don't get bored, but when I put it down I felt a little bit cheated, especially by the ending. Probably make a good 2 hours on TV.
1439153663|1.0|If I had read the author's notes before purchasing the book I would have passed on this book.  She repeatedly says that the characters wrote the book and if she tried to deviate from their plan they wouldn't speak to her.  This channelling of spirits apparently substituted for creative writing and good storytelling.<br /><br />The subjects, both black and white, suffered horribly from every conceivable type of abuse yet none of them seemed to grow as characters.  The story was driven by secrets that were held for no apparent reason.  Misdirection and misunderstandings abounded and the entire book had a plastic feel as if the author had splashed some horrible circumstances on all the players which never penetrated to their souls and changed the way they acted.  I'm afraid the ghosts lead the author astray and were still hesitant to reveal their secrets.
B000P0J024|5.0|The Wilburys were a group that was together for too short a time.  They put out two CDs which are in this collection.  There is also a DVD of some of their performances in this collection.  It is wonderful to hear the voices of George Harrison, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, and Roy Orbison blend.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Thor is an action packed movie that I can watch over and over again. The movie has awesome special effects and a great storyline.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|Andrea Bocelli is our favorite opera singer.  His voice is so full of expression and warmth.  This is his latest collection and you get both a CD and DVD, which is wonderful.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I can't wait to read the full novel. This is a smash-bang opening. The Pendergast books are great fun. Release this now!
B00AB65SP0|3.0|As previous seasons of Modern Family were by & large brilliant, we anticipated that Season Four would continue the stellar run. And while it does have its moments of pure brilliance, these are fewer and further between. As the characters have been fully fleshed out by the wonderful cast, the problem lies quite obviously in the scripting and plotlines. Here's hoping ModFam gets its comedic mojo back in the new season...
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|love all of grishams work read everything he writes am in the process of reading this have a hard time putting it down just like all of his others
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I just love completely enjoy this series. This show is totally epic. I really enjoy watching it and have watched all seasons. i finished season 6 within a few days of getting it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Sooooooo excited this is finally available on my kindle! My husband, on the other hand, not such a happy camper ;)
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Fun show.  I enjoyed the fast paced action and the combination of characters.  This show is great for an evening's entertainment
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|Grease if one of my all time favorite movies, the actors, the music, the corny plot....I grew up with these kids....could have been my high school except for John Travolta (laughing).  Great movie!
031623480X|5.0|I have always been convinced that what we eat is what we are and research has confirmed our diet is more of a risk factor for disease than smoking!  As a Doctor of Audiology who has owned a private practice for 32 years, I have seen up close and personal how my patients age over time.  Those who have diabetes, cardiac disease, high blood pressure, and/or kidney disease not only lose their hearing but also often develop dementia.  They either have a shorter life expectancy or the quality of their life is poor as they struggle with the serious ramifications of unhealthy eating on their health (strokes, frequent hospitalizations, problems with cognition, vision loss) and this book clarifies that we can proactively take control of our food selections and prevent such ramifications.  Everyone should read it and everyone should embrace Dr. Perlmutter's guidelines.  The information he shares about cholesterol management being off-mark is worth the price of the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game every ones playing it .lots of levels, and it gets harder the higher levels I would recommend it to everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works with limited apps. It would be nice if the device worked for more apps. Also I have noticed lag in video output
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This does not work with certain versions of Apple's Airport Extreme as well as other routers (See [...] for a list of known router issues).  It is apparently a known issue and is supposedly resolved by rolling firmware on the Airport back to a prior version.  I was unable to get this product to work even after rolling back my firmware. 1/5 stars until I can get it to work.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|I didnt like it. You cant turn the sceen and there is not much room to view email. I prefer the regular email page
B00B19H2KU|5.0|Knowing that this movie was a true story was what caught my interest. Now having seen it I'm terrified that it could happen. The added bonus was the little girls acting was highly expressive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game to play! It gets addictive at times but it is worth it...especially once you have cleared the level you've been stuck on for weeks. Lol....
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Special effects are good; worth the 3.99 rental.  Its nice to see a few new faces on the big screen.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Although this is a brilliantly scripted, acted and staged retelling of the life of Henry VIII which I would have given five stars, I chose four stars because the sexual content is so graphic.  I would have liked to show my tween daughter the series.  She will have to wait a couple more years.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|I thought this was an excellent movie with great acting and a good plot. I gave it four stars because the dialogue is a little stilted but maybe that's because of the southern setting.
B005PK56TA|5.0|The first few were so scary I couldn't watch it at night!  Loved it! Watched it in a weekend marathon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My four year old son loves this game and I have fun playing it with him. I highly recommend it. Have fun
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Some interesting points but no no.visible solutions yet, maybe more later on - how do we apply this in life?
B004AKCME8|5.0|Working with several species of owls, I can tell you that their personalities are represented very well.  The snake added a bit of irony.
B0076D21O2|5.0|It was a great movie, enjoyed watching it and would recommend it. Enjoyed Jamie Campbell Bower in the small(should have bend bigger) role that he had.  He was excellant as the younger verson of The Earl of Oxford.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Great songs by a great band.  Four of the songs received radio air play, but the other songs on the album are just as good.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I really liked this story.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the whole series really.  I'm probably not in the book's target audience age-wise but find the books to be compelling.  The whole package is there, romance, adventure, mystery, just enough angst to keep you going and a plot that moves quickly along.  Cassandra develops her characters through twists and turns, making you wonder what will happen next with each.  I find myself reading much longer and later than I intend when I start.  Bravo!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Awesome movie. Doesn't disappoint. Something I know i'll watch over and over again for years to come. Trekkies have to have this.
B00364K6YW|4.0|As an avid fan of this version of handsome Pride and Prejudice, I was highly looking forward to seeing this restoration. I love English subtitles and sometimes you miss the smaller, poignant dialogue on the screen. The subtitles add to my viewing pleasure.<br />I especially enjoyed the bonus interviews with the cast members ten years later! Thank you for releasing this version!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I use Twitter for my website and company and it's one of my most popular, if not THE most popular, social network that I use.
1476727651|5.0|it was great to watch dan torrance evolve. stephen king layered this character perfectly.of course, now i have to reread the shining.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game. Not too easy but not overly hard so far. Hope I don't get obcessed with it. Looking forward playing often.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It does get u thinking and longing for more.  U want closer relationship with God. It leaves u pondering many things.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's so addictive. Easier to play on kindle fire app. Thanks for making it available. It is a very enjoyable way to play.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I use this program seldom, but it doesn't what it needs to. Have not had any issues with crashes or anything with my Samsung Galaxy S3.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Good storyline, fun puzzles, works well on the Kindle. If you enjoy these types of games you won't be disappointed.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a very addictive game which I've come to love playing with my family. We all try to see who can come up with the solution first!
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Great movie.  Fun to try and keep up with which time the movie is in at any given point. Sandra is great
B009C7JS14|5.0|I like this app it comes in handy when needed. I have never had any problem with this app so I subjest u download it here.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omgthis game got me up all night playing when I come home from work its all I do I'm truely addicted lol never been so interested in a game before.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was not at all happy with the book I just finished. Yes there were some good parts but I was mostly disappointed with the overall story line. I was going for much more.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|love it me pursonaly I think all games would be like this if they made the robots just a little bit better like when you upgrade it it actually upgrades like it put the parts in like a car so you can tell its there
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|This app is the best app for Broadway musicals.  I love all the categories and the many different sub genres within are tremendous.  I thought Pandora was good but this is absolutely awesome.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Distasteful and stupid.  This was not even funny.  Shame on those actors for participating in such a poor quality movie.
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|Loved this book.  Some of the material borrowed from her blog, but some new stuff also.  She totally gets both my dog and me.  One of my favorite authors.  Thank you for not being afraid to say aloud what the rest of us are thinking.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm clock app is the bomb .com but I wish that instead of using my 500 coins on stupid games that don't even work good I could have got the upgraded version of this app
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Awesome show,  great story line and great mesh of characters.  I just wish they would have followed and pulled stories and situations from the graphic novel more.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|On the shelf next to \\"The Diary\\". One of the finest, most well written, enthralling works of literature I have ever read. Truly beautiful!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Absolutely love this thing so much I got a 2nd later. Worth the buy and hopefully Google pushes more apps soon!
B000I9X67M|5.0|I love this movie!  I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and can  watch it either on my Kindle or with my Roku player on the TV.
B007WPM4P0|3.0|IT was good enough to finish, but so depressing. There were also a lot of awkward stares and the main character was ALWAYS crying. I was shocked by the sex scene since it was on PG. Glad I wasn't watching it with one of my children.
8866135909|5.0|I've been ordering this planner for years. As a cronic list-maker and note-taker it feels as if this planner was made for me. I can keep my appointments on one side and take quick notes during meetings on the other.<br /><br />I've tried SO MANY planners (digital and physical) in my lifetime and this is hands-down the most durable, professional and practical.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|This was my husband's pick, but I ended up really enjoying it. Give it a shot if you like knowing about rock's roots.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pretty cool to use when friends are over or when watching a series online. It does not work with any movie sites that use microsoft  silverlight.<br /><br />I love being able to stream music and video from the phone but i mainly use it for the browser support. Cheapest wireless receiver possible.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Easy Setup<br />Beautiful picture<br />Simple to use<br /><br />Cons:<br />I was under the impression it was powered through tv silly me. It needs power connection that connects to it while plugged into hdmi. Nothing to bad I just had to make room on power strip.<br /><br />There is a little light on the back of it that glows. At night i notice it with the tv in my bedroom. I covered it with a small piece of black tape.
B006G2NVCA|4.0|if you like the quieter instrumental NIN tunes, you will likely enjoy this collage of sounds with complex rhythems.  Being a die-hard TOOL fan, I think NIN The Fragile is Reznor's best.  I found many similarities to the parts of The Fragile...the parts without the anger.  This set of albums is for the most part, quiet, and is best heard in a full range system.  My first few listens were with a pair of muffs on a long flight to China and back.  Good music to shut your eyes too and just listen.  The other night I cranked it up at home while working on a project and I heard a whole new album.
B00EJOCAYW|1.0|MICRO legos.  Awesome Idea, just much much much much smaller than what I thought when match with the price.  I did not know that legos even had a micro product,  my fault for not reading the reviews. :(  Legos are awesome, only give a one star to notify people of the difference.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game for the whole family.  Can't stop playing it but dislike the fact you have limited lives and need to wait to get mord
B007PVHMCG|1.0|MICRO legos.  Awesome Idea, just much much much much smaller than what I thought when match with the price.  I did not know that legos even had a micro product my fault for not reading the reviews. :(
B00992CF6W|5.0|It needs more in the updates<br />Alot of people want dogs redstone emralds and villagers<br />Horses next update should a least have breeding
B003O86FMW|5.0|If the second movie is anywhere as good as the first movie and if it stays as close to the book - the movie ought to be absolutely brilliant.  Once I read the first book, I really had to read the second one.  I had to find out what happens next.<br /><br />This book is darker, scarier and more intense than the first and Katniss more conflicted and the plots a bit thicker than the first book.  Suzanne Collins has a knack for keeping the intensity burning.  This is a book virtually impossible to put down.  I enjoyed every word.  It was a rich, powerful, and exciting read.  If you liked the first...you will LOVE this second one.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|This free version goes a little farther than previous iterations. Better characters too. There is even a coming soon expansion section that we can't wait for...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|By the time I read this third one, I must admit, I was emotionally worn out.  But I had to read the final book of the series, I had to see what happens.  On some level, it was great to see how it all ends, getting there felt exhausting, though.  It was as though I went on my favorite roller coaster ride one too many times.  It was still good, but not as good as the first few rides.  The ending surprised me in some ways and in other ways, it seems so inevitable.  Ms. Collins did a great job, again, of drawing out the intrigue.<br /><br />I found the most interesting character in the book to be &#34;The President&#34;.  What a presentation of creepy, weird, and utterly psychopathic.  Hannibal Lechter had nothing on the President in this book.  If you loved the first two...you just have to finish the series.  The whole series is eminently re-readable.
B003LSTK8G|3.0|This was a well written book offering the chronology of the economic collapse in 2007-2009.  My only issue with the book is that Lewis illustrates very well how culpable the financial companies were, but does not illustrate the huge roll the government played in initiating and continuing the policies that put all of this into play with the liar loans, etc.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie a few weeks back.  I had to read the book to see if the movie stayed true or if there was a lot of license taken in the production.  Happily, the movie essentially stayed right to the book.  To my mind, if the book is good, it is a crime for the movie not to stay with it.  That being said...the book explains more of  who Katniss is and how she &#34;becomes&#34; who she is and the kind of things she survived that made her strong.  One of the finer things in this book is the inner dialogues she has with herself as she meets each challenge. The book explains more of the political landscape than the movie does which I found astounding and mesmerizing. It fills in so many gaps left by the movie maker.  I recommend this book for any teen and young adult.  In a world where moral flexibility is acceptable, it is powerful to see an individual struggle to do the right things and what the consequences of those actions are or can be.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you enjoyed The Shining, you will love this great Stephen King yarn ! Did you ever wonder what happened to little Danny Torrance and his Mother after the Overlook burned to the ground? This is a great spooky tale you won't be able to put down this Holiday Season! We'll done Stephen!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I'm not kidding. I fly in real places and take down enemies and become exactly like iron man! I can own stark industries and build suits from the film just like Tony stark.! Plus the graphics make it so realistic. The suits have have the designs from the film. The suits also have different strengths. You can free roam and follow the storyline at the same time. Become iron man in this epic adventure!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Greatest thing to ever come to my TV. Google needs to open this up to more countries. I've at LEAST doubled my Google Play Movies library ever since I bought it. Win/win situation no?

B002RI99IM|4.0|A beautifully written book which make a difficult concept almost understandable. I recommend reading it fast the first time to get an over-all feel for the concept of the highly improbable, and a second time (where I am at the moment) more thoroughly, not moving on until you understand. For someone who left high school mathematics behind many years ago the first reading proved more enjoyable than the second.

0756404746|5.0|The Name of the Wind is not a perfect book by any means, it will appeal to some readers whereas for others it will not. The book possesses a great amount of detail and has a slow pace of movement through events. In some instances there is a great deal of &#34;nothing of interest&#34; being said and some points that are clearly defined are reiterated dozens of times.<br /><br />All that being said, this book and its sequel &#34;The Wise Man's Fear&#34; are the best two books I have read in my life. The level of detail that is included, while at times being a hindrance in story progression, often creates a more clear and compelling picture while retaining a form of simplicity, not in description but in readability. The flow of the book while at times can be abrupt or very slow moving creates a more identifiable progression, and while at times Rothfuss may spend a few more pages than necessary in a particular portion of Kvothe's life those pages are often spent helping reinforce existing and develop new attachments to the hero. The book contains elements of the world as we know it and does an amazing job at making the qualities of its world (such as magic) feasible to a reader's mind while still possessing the alluring (pardon me for lack of a better word) magical qualities that draw readers to such concepts. Above all else, the way that Kvothe is presented drew me to becoming immediately attached to him. There is much spoken in regards to Kvothe's good qualities or gifts, but even more so on his bad qualities and vices. It was because that Kvothe's &#34;negative&#34; qualities were allowed to breathe into his personality and affect his decisions throughout the story that made me feel emotionally attached with him as he grew through the two books, and more than anything else helped me grow to love The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear.

B005LY4B0A|4.0|I wish I had played these in order.  However, I ended up with the 2nd one first, and loved it so much that I turned to this one to ease my withdrawal. It is not as good. It's still a good puzzle game... just not nearly as good as the 2nd one!
B00FQ272ZI|4.0|Despite the lack of special effects, computer animation and 3-D (not to mention dialog), All is Lost keeps your attention and your interest. It even holds off on the mood music until the second half. Until then, about the only sounds are the  lapping waves against the boat, right beside you in surround sound.<br /><br />Unlike, say Harry Potter or James Bond films, there is real mortal risk for our (unnamed) hero. The outcome is far from guaranteed.<br /><br />Robert Redford is battered by one lousy turn of luck after another, but he just keeps going. It just keeps getting worse and worse. There is only one alternative, and it is always there for him. So to that extent the film is exciting and suspenseful. But there are no guns, no villains and no betrayals, unless you believe God himself is behind this torture.<br /><br />It shows once again that a good story trumps all, a lesson I wish Hollywood would buy into, instead of comic book heroes who we all know must triumph. Great stories have been sorely lacking for a good 25 years. This is a great story.<br /><br />These single focus oeuvres, like biographies, always let if not make the lead shine. And Robert Redford, at 77, is not just an athlete, he's a fine, unstereotyped actor. Very believable. Another reason All is Lost should be on the must-see list.<br /><br />David Wineberg

B00F91SCXC|1.0|poorly written; poorly directed; poorly acted. boring with a poor ending as you never find out how the people became vampires and it never explains (but hinted at) how the people ceased to be vampires.  yep, another stinker movie with brad pitt.

B00F30S0Y0|2.0|I could not wait for the release of Reflektor because of how excellent Arcade Fire's previous albums all are. The Suburbs is a top ten all time album. Reflektor is disappointing. It lacks the vigorous spirit of their previous work. It is way too mellow and synthetic. Arcade Fire fans should still buy it. If they play live anywhere near me I'll be there. I hope the next album has the aggressive edge I prefer.

B0091REZMW|3.0|The finding of items is entertaining but the amount of energy required to do so only allows for three or four puzzles two or three times a day making the game much less than exciting (unless you use real life cash to pay for more energy and, to me, the amount of cash needed to buy energy is way too much compared to the amount of play time you get). The pictures are pleasant and the placement of hidden items are clever and not illogical to the point of being irritating.

B0086DB566|5.0|Of course you have to know your kids -- this isn't Caillou, but personally I am glad this is one of my daughter's preferred movies. Snow White and the Wicked Witch are both clever, interesting and strong female characters, something you don't see a lot of in film. Yes, they are beautiful, but Snow White doesn't really seem to care much about that while Julia Roberts as her evil stepmother goes to extremes that point out the literal pain she endures to maintain her looks.

B004UID2LC|3.0|Nice App SOMETIMES.<br />DOWNLOAD OPTION:  Sometimes i can select the download video option, and at other times, there isn't even a option to select download, only to view.  I don't understand why this happens,and if someone knows, Please tell me.<br />TIME RUNS OUT:  On many of the videos that I download, when I go back to replay them, they won't play to the end.

B003EYVXUU|2.0|*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />Before you read this review,I have included a few items about the plot of the film.<br /><br />Put simply, \\"Let Me In\\" is a nearly shot-for-shot remake of \\"Let the Right One In\\", but it lacks much of what made the original work so well. Even on its own, \\"Let Me In\\" suffers from lack of character focus, story construction and has too many contradictions to successfully suspend disbelief. While I understand that some consider it as good, if not better than the original, I have my reasons for not sharing that opinion.<br /><br />Let me say first what I found enjoyable about \\"Let Me In\\". I thought that the pacing was quite good, perhaps even better than the original in terms of moving along the action. And, the \\"car rollover\\" scene is also one of the best, most memorable effects I have seen in quite a while. It would be interesting to see a video of how they staged and executed that particular shot which was all from inside the vehicle.<br /><br />And that's about all I enjoyed in \\"Let Me In\\".<br /><br />On the negative side, while \\"Let the Right One In\\" is about two characters in search of meaning for their lives, \\"Let Me In\\" is about a rather inept vampire seeking a replacement for her older, clumsy caretaker so she won't have to do the dirty work of killing the victims herself. It's a far less interesting premise that was boxed into virtually the same story format as the original. It was almost as if director Matt Reeves had built his storyboards around each scene in \\"Let the Right One In\\" and wrote a different story in its place. The result is a film that merely hints at the power of the original novel and first film while falling into many of the old, tired cliches that could have been easily avoided.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" is not well photographed and uses dark, dingy tones that obscures much of the action of the night scenes. The climactic scene at the pool (an absolute classic in the original) is so dark and confusingly shot that its difficult to discern what is really happening. If you do a shot-for-shot comparison to the original film, in many scenes the actors are positioned or \\"blocked\\" on the opposite side in \\"Let Me In\\" which I found somewhat humorous actually. I guess this is not a criticism, but more of an observation about how much seems copied from the first film in terms of how the actors are positioned.<br /><br />Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen) and Chloe Grace Moretz (Abby) may be fine actors in their own right, but I saw absolutely no chemistry between them at all. Furthermore, Chloe's speech pattern of soft, unemotional whispers dilutes her character to the point of being rather uninteresting. She conveys none of the wisdom or even world wariness of being a centuries-old vampire.<br /><br />Perhaps my issues with \\"Let Me In\\" could be summed up by the \\"Cop\\" character played by Elias Koteas. Apparently, and this is not made very clear, Elias is on the trail of what he thinks is a \\"Satanic cult\\" which I assume are Abby and her Caretaker (Richard Jenkins) going from town to town killing people. When Elias knocks on the door to Abby's apartment for the second time in the film, he suspects that whoever is inside MIGHT (operative word: MIGHT) know something about the killings. He hears the floorboard gently squeak from inside the apartment, so he draws his gun and KICKS in the door, breaking and entering for NO reason at all. Why would he do such a thing instead of calling for backup and keeping the apartment under surveillance until getting a warrant? Well, because the script told him to enter and *SPOILER ALERT* get killed, that's why. It makes no sense, but there it is.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" just doesn't work and pales considerably when compared to the original. But even if I hadn't seen the original first, it would have been pretty difficult for me to find much to like about this movie. A shame really since another interpretation of the original novel would have made \\"Let Me In\\" a worthwhileeffort. But instead, it is but a pale, albeit dark and dingy shadow of the original film with nothing new to add.effort.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a fun game but I don't like the fact that they make some levels so difficult to win without a booster.  It feels like they are pushing really hard to get your money. I'm to a point in the game I don't think I will be able to pass a level so I will most likely un install the game.

B00F91SCXC|4.0|My teens liked this movie but said there is no way the main character could do all he did and not be killed over and over again.  My response was, &#34;It's a zombie movie and you were expecting reality?&#34; They liked it, but I did not watch it myself.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|A really entertaining read.  I have never worked in a kitchen, but this was a great inside view of how it works.  I have friends in the restaurant industry and they tell me this book isn't too far off.  A good read!
B002H5JHUA|4.0|This movie is a bit cheesy, but enjoyable.  It covers Frankenstein, the wolf-man, Dracula, Igor and other villains.  Not perfect, but great for Halloween entertainment.  I like the nods it gave to the older movies of our time.  It keeps you on your seat and has original thoughts and ideas about these mythical creatures.  Would recommend for anyone 13 and up. Parents might watch it before allowing their kids to see it, but mine enjoyed it.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I expected it to be a little more oriented with the workplace and the day to day business stuff.  Instead it dragged on a bit and covered the same handful of topics multiple times.  It was an okay read, but not very gripping.

B00BAXFECK|4.0|Whoa. This was a big book in every sense of the word--big in size (nearly 800 pages), big in adventure and characterization, and big in ideas--about life, love, art, and destiny. While it times it moved a bit slower than I would have liked, it felt smaller (in a good way) and much more accessible than many novels of this size do.<br /><br />Thirteen-year-old Theo Decker had his life change instantly when he survived an accident that killed his mother. With his father's whereabouts unknown and no other family to be found, Theo moves into the palatial Park Avenue apartment home of a distant friend. As he navigates the interesting dynamics of this family, and tries to deal with his overwhelming grief, the one thing he has that makes him continue to feel connected to his mother is her favorite painting, a small, affecting painting by a lesser-known Dutch master.<br /><br />\\"But sometimes, unexpectedly, grief pounded over me in waves that left me gasping; and when the waves washed back, I found myself looking out over a brackish wreck so illumined in a light so lucid, so heartsick and empty, that I could hardly remember that the world had ever been anything but dead.\\"<br /><br />In addition to his friend, Andy, Theo's closest companions during his time in New York are antiques expert James \\"Hobie\\" Hobart, who takes him under his wing and teaches Theo everything he knows about furniture restoration and the appreciation of antiques, and Pippa, a young girl with whom Theo has a powerful and tragic connection. And when Theo's father shows up in New York and moves him to Las Vegas to live with him and his cocktail waitress girlfriend, Xandra, Theo's life changes again.<br /><br />While in Las Vegas, Theo befriends Boris, a troubled underachiever with a passion for money and drugs. Their friendship is intense, and Boris' influence changes Theo in many ways. Both see the other as a refuge from the chaos of their own lives, and as Theo realizes that his father's life isn't as perfect as he's made it seem, Boris helps him cope--mostly with the help of illegal substances.<br /><br />The Goldfinch follows Theo's life into adulthood, with his return to New York, and finding himself constantly facing challenges. He is never truly far away from his grief over his mother's death, or his obsession with the painting, which leads him into the art underworld.<br /><br />\\"Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only--if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things--beautiful things--that they connect you to some larger beauty?\\"<br /><br />Even though his character was tremendously flawed, I loved Theo and was completely immersed in his story. I also found Hobie and Pippa's characters tremendously fascinating, and developed a warmth for the Barbour family as well. Sadly, I wasn't as enamored with Boris' character--I felt that every time he spoke in the book, he spoke for far too long, and Donna Tartt's portrayal of his accent made much of what he said a little hard to follow. I found myself imagining what it might be like to get to know Hobie and Pippa, that's how fascinating I found them.<br /><br />This book tackles some important questions about art and beauty, loss and living up to one's destiny. But beyond that it is about how powerful an anchor grief and guilt can be, and how dramatically the two can change the outcome of one's life. Donna Tartt--author of one of my most favorite books, The Secret History--is a wonderfully enigmatic and captivating storyteller, but I felt as if she crammed a little too much into this book. I honestly could have done without the whole art underworld thread of the plot, and I don't believe it would have affected the book.<br /><br />You may think to yourself, almost 800 pages? Is it worth it? Will I be able to get into the story? I'd say unequivocally, yes, to both of those questions. While not a perfect book, The Goldfinch is one that will leave you thinking long after you've finished it.
0316204366|5.0|The book is fascinating and some interesting ideas are presented that are helpful.  Gladwell is a master story-teller and he brought to life several historical snapshots that were too quickly forgotten to a culture that values the &#34;now&#34; moment above the thought provoking past.
B00ALGW286|5.0|From the moment Moscow Dreams opens, the life of a teenager in Moscow in the early 1990s reveals a life different from any I ever imagined about growing up in the Soviet Union in the Twentieth Century. Ms. Gousseva takes the life of Marina, in her last two years of high school, and turns it into more than just a coming of age book. The novel begins in 1991 as Boris Yeltsin makes his bid for power against the first elected Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev.<br /><br />No one is more confused than Marina about the changes that occur in the next four months as the communist leader Gorbachev is routed out of his role by Yeltsin. Soon communism and party affiliations are banned and the young people in Ms. Gousseva's novel must suddenly switch alliances to make good for their college applications. The state-owned sources of food disappear and suddenly the customs, tastes, and habits of the western world appear on the streets of Moscow. Capitalism has come to this country, and while the choices are exhilarating at first, soon the people realize their wages do not rise with the increase in food costs.<br /><br />Through it all, the life of Marina and her family and friends endure the changes and still manage to find hope. It's through Marina's parents and her babushka that the reader learns of why change is feared and why the government is seldom to be trusted.<br /><br />Through the personal stories, I learned about the very personal nature of the different faces of the Soviet Union and Russia. While in the United States, our political leaders may change every four years, we've never known what it was like to suddenly wake up one morning only to be told everything we ever believed and known, never really existed in the first place. Unlike books such as Orwell's 1984 where a cold impersonal view of Communism is impressed upon the reader and where the characters never seemed quite real to me, Dreams of Moscow, presents very real teenagers who are different in what they want from life, but similar in their tastes for love and excitement.<br /><br />I'm very happy I found this author and her work. I found myself transported to Moscow, the Black Sea, and Leningrad through Ms. Gousseva's vivid descriptions. It's a view of Russia I enjoyed. And that is perhaps the greatest thing about this novel. The gray view I've held of Russia all my life thanks to the Cold War of my youth, disappeared into bright and clear views of another place with people not so much different from me as I'd once been taught.t from life, but similar in their tastes for love and excitement.<br /><br />I'm very happy I found this author and her work.

B00B2DSK06|5.0|Very Cute Movie.  It is entertaining to both kids and adults.  Has a bit of a twist ending, so it's not totally predictable.
145210655X|3.0|I enjoyed Brown's latest book &#34;Jedi Academy&#34; so much I wanted to check out these other two books I had heard so much about.  This was not what I had expected and I only thought it was OK.  A small book filled with one page comic strips featuring what it would have been like for Vader to be a father to Luke when he was a little boy.  An extensive knowledge of Star Wars is needed to get these jokes, especially the original trilogy, with some familiarity of the characters in the new movies also.  I didn't really find any of the comics hilarious, some were cute, some I didn't get and others I just didn't think were funny.  The art on the other hand is very cute and funny.  Vader looks so awkward in his role as &#34;Dad&#34;.  I don't see this as being a book for kids.  To me it seems more aimed at adults, parent specific humour, and because of the father theme would make a good Father's Day present for the Star Wars fan dad.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Great movie!! The fact that it's based on a true story and being a paranormal freak, I actually know about Ed and Lorraine Warner so that made it seem more real and therefore more terrifying.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books and would have given them both 5 stars.  This last one left me torn.  The first half of the book is a chore to get through.  The author has a clear direction she wants to go but it feels like it was not edited enough and drags out far too long.  This is exasperated by the decision to split chapters evenly between two characters.  It makes what would have already been a slow part of the story feel twice as long.  A lot of the early plot points also feel forced to provide some action during this portion.  One character in particular makes a lot of choices that don't feel right to me (for their characters personality) but I will not elaborate so as not to spoil anything.<br /><br />The second half of the book (actually closer to the last third) starts to speed up and feel like the prior two books. I still overall am not as happy with it compared to the first two books... But it did get there in the end.  I have heard a lot of comments on the ending but will just say it fits.  Don't read too much into any comments from others and just experience the ending to this trilogy for yourself.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I thought this movie's special effects were over-the-top while being realistic. After Earth highlights the bond between father and son during their struggle for survival from predators after the crash that left them stuck on Earth.
B00471Z3CI|3.0|Not as scary as I remembered it being.  Watched this as a kid and was terrified.  Now not so much
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have never played such an interesting and positive thinking game in my life.You have to find hidden objects to get things to open in order to advance to the next level. This game is very interesting to me.I think you will like it a lot.
1611761565|5.0|thank you it was what I wanted. nothing special but does the job that I need it to do. enough words.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's books are very compelling.  There is probably a desire by a lot of men to be like Mitch Rapp. That character allows me to express how I would like to be. Mitch is straight forward and there is no nonsense.  He is committed to our country and he stays focused. I like that in myself and therefore in Flynn's character, Rapp.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game a lot!!!  You will get stuck but you will eventually get the level clear.  The only down side is that you may end up hating chocolate!!
1579128149|5.0|I'm a chemist and this is a great way for people to get a better understanding of chemistry.  Too many people act silly and say chemistry is a hard subject. Chemistry is part of our everyday lives and this book helps bring into focus how that is by giving a visual of the various elements in our everyday lives.  I have a copy of the book and gave a copy to my niece who is a college chemistry major and pursuing a career in neurosurgery.  I also gave her a copy of the song that came with the book i originally bought from Barnes and Nob le but did not come with the book that I purchased with Amazon.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|I bought that for my girlfriend. She love it very much. And thank you for this product , because I gave her a third surprise.
B00DI75SWM|1.0|Good idea, but needs work. The app isn't working for me, won't let me set as wallpaper. Says PRO Generator has stopped.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Great movie. Love the whole series and sad that this is the last one! Definately would watch this one again
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I am now a fan of Drew. I don't like men like him but after reading this book I changed my mind only for Drew. Thanks Emma Chase, you've done well. I have recommended this book to my friends.
B000BNI99K|5.0|The (4CD/DVD) Great American Songbook Collection is one of my favorites. I love the way Rod Stewart can fit his style to any song even to those of the 40's, 50's and 60's. These songs were some of my favorite dance songs when I was a teenager and so they make me feel as if I were dancing again. To put it simply I love Rod Stewart.
B00B19H2KU|4.0|wasn't uber scary but messed me up enough that i am all done with frequencing yard/garage or anytype of\\"sale\\" of such kind!!! If a film can keep' bargain-\\" omg it is so cute it has to come home with me now. i won't leave you!\\" Sonya (which is i ofcourse) away from shopping its a damn creepy film, the actors where spot on. One good thing the \\"box\\" did was get that Mr Rogers' wanna be away from the family. The family is too cool for \\"something\\" like him...... And i wasnt even sorry for what was happening to him while it was playing out, But just as the most scariest box had to go so did dude. I am a horror film geek since i saw the original Halloween then all of the other classics Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St.  The movies have changed like saw which is amazingly addictive for the true horror geek. But this film went back old school, tugged at our hearts because a family was being destroyed without any hope. The audience doesnt completely know what is going to happen. We have an idea but nothing concrete like alot of films today. Then they use everyday things throughout the film to remind us this truly could be Us!!! Like the cell phone flash light. Maybe high tech for old school but we dont need matches anymore if our phones are charged. Same scary alone can see only inches infront of your face as a match. The phone cant give us a one up on the supernatural hence very very creepy and eye squinting time. The ending was a terrific idea. wont get into it for those who havent seen this gem. Really good. It was a nice ride and nod to \\"realism\\" and let our minds mess us up(such as my fear of antiquiesque shopping)rather than being hand held placed where they want us and listen to thier explicit instructions on how to watch and understand for optimum viewing. You fellow horror \\"geeks\\" know asap as to which films i am speaking of ;) sit back and enjoy thats all they ask for in this film. I am sure just like my parents were petrefied of showers after Psycho but now take them a million times some days. I too may be able to stop at a yard sale. Ya know as i was writing that last line,I was shaking my head \\"hell no\\". We need to shower. I dont need to welcome something like that into my home. New or I will have it replicated. We shall see.........take them a million times some days. I too may be able to stop at a yard sale. Ya know as i was writing that last line,I was shaking my head \\"hell no\\". We need to shower. I dont need to welcome something like that into my home. New or I will have it replicated. We shall see.........
B004DF3S7A|5.0|I just love Rod Stewart singing anything. The best of Great American Song book I love the way he fits is alluring style to the oldies of the 40', 50's and 60's. He has his way around a song and this can't be denied. He somehow puts his own unique stamp on each and every song he sings.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I absolutely love historical thrllers, especially involving counterespionage and high grade action. This had it all. Reminiscent of 'Own Goal' by J.G. Rickards this really was James Bond meets Rambo, but with sex appeal and intelligence. What more could a girl want?
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Since I already reviewed the 4 CD release of TGAS I can just repeat here that I love the way he wraps his style around songs of any era. In these songs of the 40's, 50's and 60's his voice molds itself very well to the style of these eras. I was a teenager in the 50's and many of the songs were ones I danced to in the great Ballroom's of that time. I love Rod Stewart.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Another great movie from Pixar. Enjoyed watching every minute of it. My son enjoyed watching Sully and Mike become friends.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|It's definitely the best card game on Android, I enjoy playing it very much , it's fun and interesting. I recommend this game who loves fantasy and card games
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love how this version of Coin Dozer has additional prizes. It gives you more surprises to look forward to.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The only thing that would make this game better would be if you could play against friends. But even on your own it's an incredible game!
B001AUKUS6|5.0|Great cd with lay it down being my fav Ratt song. Had this on cassette and this makes my 2nd copy on cd thanks to the ex keeping the first one.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|Very interesting on many levels, and a page turner for sure, but, not very convincing when it comes to supporting a Christian perspective.<br />I did not do the nine experiments. I wanted to finish the whole  book first. When Pam Grout talked about listening to the \\"still small voice\\" I was<br />thinking she was making reference to Psalms 46:10 where we, as believers in the Biblical God, are admonished to \\"Be still and know that<br />I am God.\\" But later she clarifies what she means, and says she is not saying that we are hearing the voice of Jesus...mostly it is an impersonal force<br />that is speaking to us.<br /><br /> Miss Grout is claiming to show us ways to manipulate this \\"force\\" get what we want and to be happy people...once we learn that \\"our thoughts\\" create our \\"reality\\", we can basically carve out any life we want regardless of God's will. The author says nothing about the Christian \\"new birth\\" or Christ dying for our sins so we can at last have power over our sins and start growing in Christ. Sorry to say but it is more of a \\"name-it and claim-it\\" approach to the spiritual realm; than the Biblical standard that relates to the human's need to \\"turn from our wicked ways\\" and embrace God's forgiveness through Christ's atoning death. I understand that God works in mysterious ways, but question whether these nine experiments, are some of them.
006202406X|1.0|2000th review!<br />This book sucked. Terribly sucked. End of thought.<br />I will erase it from my mind best I can.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A panaramic epic on the plight of the Afghani people.  While very powerful as historical fiction, on an interpersonal level, this book really excels.  It tells the story of a family/a people torn apart by war and poverty, but also connected in a way that is unbreakable - across time and geography.
B00E6F155E|4.0|The video quality is amazing, and it is great that they have produced such an amazing quality document from an amazing tour after 20 years. However, the audio is so treated and rerecorded in the studio that it taints an otherwise amazing experience. How is Peter Gabriel so vain in this area that he continues to rerecord live concerts in the studio, as in his Play's Live CD and Genesis Boxed Sets? If people wanted a studio recording, they would not be buying the live recording. We want to hear the energy and flaws, just as we have seen in the actual concert. What we have here sounds excellent (quality) yet stale (content).<br /><br />The other problem in this set is the Play DVD (note: not blu-ray) which is great to have, but uses often inferior quality sources and a poorly designed menu. Every time you play a track, it goes back to the menu again, so very confusing to play all tracks.<br /><br />So, this is an awesome concert and amazing performance, and quite a good price for what you get...but could have been so much better if not for some silly things.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted to this game!  Just the right amount of brain stimulating challenge mixed with silly childish fun, and so many levels to last a long time!
1451666179|5.0|Funny, poignant, and true (even if it's lies). The author clearly knows what depression feels like and it's a good lesson for anyone. Also, she is very, very funny telling about her childhood and life. It's a nifty mix.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|works great, as advertised. integrates seamlessly with MacAir, no problems so far. needed accessory if you need to present on projectors or TV's.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Entertaining movie, better than expected. Woody did a better than normal job with his character in this movie. The story kept me guessing, always surprised what happened next. Enjoyed watching this with my parents.
B00FEJT38M|5.0|works super for me. can't wait for more and more updates. remember root your phone and get this. It does what it says it does
B000W9399S|5.0|Funny, subversive, witty genius.  Pratchett is the best of our modern sci-fi, humor, and fantasy novelists.  No one else is Pratchett.
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|Unlike many sports movies, \\"Moneyball\\" focuses on a general manager and his assistant, rather than on the players on the field. This unique angle gives the film the freedom to tell a more complex story. And, despite its cynical-sounding name, \\"Moneyball\\" truly explores baseball as a labor of love. Billy Beane may have helped bring hard, cold statistics and mathematical formulas to the world of sports, but we can see that he does it out of a genuine passion and reverence for the game. As someone who is generally uninterested in the history of baseball, I found that the film does an excellent job of bringing Billy Beane's story to life in a gripping and satisfying way. I would not have watched this movie on my own, but having seen it, I would love to watch it again.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|As historical fiction this is an intriguing bit of story telling.  The protagonist seems to fit the period, as I understand it, and is not diluted by modern ideals.  A bit of barbarian himself, an unabashed adulterer, ready to pass judgement and kill when he thinks it best serves his sense of justice, self-serving, and deceitful - a true lord of the manor and I really liked him.  How the author was able to glean such a full fleshed, believable story from such bits of historical information as were used and stay true to what is known - really well done.  Very readable and entertaining for anyone who is interested in the period of English history or just wants a good story told well.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|It may not have been loved by the world over, but it does not deserve \\"hate\\" or \\"loathing\\". No, best save those emotions for those films (and adaptations) that are truly deserving. R.I.P.D. was entertaining; a bit like \\"Dead Like Me\\" meets \\"Men in Black\\". Although I do admit that the film left me more satisfied with its end than did \\"Dead Like Me\\". I like to compare films to chemistry, so when I say it was a good chemical mixture, I don't mean that it was a great mixture. (If anything it possibly made something of the \\"Purest Green\\" as Sir Percy from \\"Blackadder\\" had done.)  What it lacked in ingredients it made up for with chemistry between the actors. Budding \\"bromance\\"? hardly. Still, it was a great adventure and one that I would gladly laugh, cry and kiss my money goodbye (again) for.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I loved the first two books. This one had so many characters I couldn't keep track of who was who. But, still worth reading.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I didn't think I would like this game but after a few minutes I loved it. The game is different and very enjoyable to play. I really love this game. The story line is great and is easy to follow.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as Hunger Games.  Not nearly the page-turner I was  hoping for.  Probably will not read Mockingjay.  Story rather predictable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad it's on kindle. Been waiting for it for a long time.no I don't have to get my computer out or my phone
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|HAIM is THE band to watch for the rest of the year and in 2014. Go get 'em, sisters, you are well on your way.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read the entire book on a cloudy raining Sunday, while drinking cocoa; such a beautiful heart wrenching novel! I laughed hard, and cried like a baby! Looking forward to my next Jojo Moyes read!
0385537131|5.0|I just received this book in the mail.  I have read about 10 pages and am hooked already.  It is kind of a sequel to A Time To Kill--you should probably read it first.  I am a real John Grisham fan!  I have read everything he ever published...  I wait for the new one to come out with anticipation each year!  So far, this book is as interesting as all the others!  Without giving anything away, I can tell you it is a real page turner!  Will Not Disappoint!
B00300EI3W|5.0|very enlightening- loved the movie!<br />Showed it to three of my nursing classes- very thought provoking! Should be required for people to watch going into Healthcare!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is good .....but really??...come back and play in 20 to 30 minutes??!  Or worse.... come back and play tomorrow......<br />Great if you want to play for about 5 minutes.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|The Mission<br />This is an amazing, heart wrenching, impactful story. There is beautiful cinematography throughout.  I would suggest this movie to anyone looking for a movie beyond ordinary.  I cannot stop thinking about this movie.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I enjoyed the book because it told the story of a man who had it all. He made Apple the great company that it is, but he made it a great company because of his SIMPLICITY ideas, his means of getting great things done the right way, the only way. He had a life that was not an easy life, it was so hard to be such an individual who had so much to offer the world, but also a man with so many absurdities to live with.<br /><br />He could not have been easy to live with. He was loved by many, hated by a few. But he was a man that had a story to tell. And he did it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I only have about 50 pages left; I'm going to hate for this to end!<br />Worth it!  Worth it! Worth it!  Great for a fall weekend in front of<br />the fireplace but keeps the lights on!
B0061S073A|5.0|this app is excellent especially if you have younger children. you can set the app up so that they cant get on the internet to buy things and they have to have a password to get out of this app you can choose which games you want them to play you can control the volume so they cant have it really loud. I would definitely tell others to get it and I have this app is perfect
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun to play. Make sure you have some free time to play, this game is sure to use the time up.
0316228532|1.0|This was a monumental disappointment.  My initial eagerness to read the author's first 'adult' book was soon squelched by the random, unnecessary, and frequent insertion of sex in one form or another.  I also was turned off by the foul language.  I gave up in disgust - never finished it. Sorry I wasted the money.
B00FX8F6VM|5.0|I love this song! I put it on repeat and cannot stop listening to it! It is amazing! :) !
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie is full of wonderful information no one talks about. Food, Inc. really makes you think about where your food comes from.
1401242855|4.0|Mask could have been a bit thicker with plastic. Nice over all and it's basically a soft tpb of the first Batman tpb in the NEW 52 with a Court of Owls Mask.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush, its fun to play with my family and friends we just sit there saying we need lives lol
1594744769|5.0|I loved this book.  It's a strange, yet charming, peek inside a world of forgotten children.  The story, in combination with the photographs, was hauntingly fascinating.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great family movie.. good for kids.. enough humor that goes over the kids heads to be funny and entertaining for adults.
B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|It was OK. I watched this with a group and we were hoping for something much darker than this. We expected a much darker suspenseful film, but the only thing dark about this movie was the aspect of Hell. It is not a bad movie by itself, it is well made, but overall it just seems to disappoint and confuse..
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Elton John at his best. I loved Elton's music since Your Song in 1969. His re-working of Candle in the wind still remains in my head. although it is not on this album, one feels the spirit of that level of ability within this album.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Not really impressed with this movie. It wasn't scary and the acting was sub par. I only watched it because my girlfriend picked and believe me, you can skip this one.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Great Game, cool graphics, you even get kind of mad at the characters talking crap and you loosing races. You will get hook and race all the time.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I do really enjoy this product and I wish I could give it 5 stars because it is well built and it feels like it can take serious abuse. I am not giving it 5 stars because I am using it in my car and it does not seem to charge my girlfriends iPhone when I am charging my Galaxy S III. Could be user error but I can not see what I am doing wrong. Otherwise and excellent product and I will definitely use more Anker products.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I would like the game more, if you would give more help, so I could solve sooner, sometimes I just want to quit playing!!
B00ERIUO1G|5.0|if like a lot of powerful vocals and powerful music this is the band you need to hear live in concert
B00FWLTPU8|4.0|Very well made monster movie. If you are looking for Shakespeare, this is not your movie.<br />If however you are looking for massive robots fighting huge monsters, you should like this.
B00CHVJODE|2.0|I'm actually surprised that this movie has such great reviews.  My husband and I tried to watch this with our three year old daughter (who will watch most anything) - and we all thought it was terrible.  My daughter actually asked if we could turn it off.  I lost interest very early on, but my husband gave it a shot and made it about 45 minutes in.  My daughter never took interest, and she's actually very good at watching movies for her age.  Finally, we all agreed that it was terrible and shut it off.  Maybe it gets better later on?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun and addictive could not stop playing,hate waiting for more lives wish that if you had to wait maybe not such a long wait
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|This is probably get but I had a hard time getting it to work for me. Not a new person friendly. Or maybe it is just me?
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The game doesn't give you enough time to learn before shutting you down. Frustrating!<br />There should be a learning phase!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is good, I just don't have enough time to spend playing for very long.  Maybe one of these days......
B002LII6KA|4.0|I bought this collection looking for an experience beyond the films, something I felt I didn't truly get from the first releases of each individual movie on DVD.<br /><br />Maybe I misread the review that prompted me to buy this collection, but a 10 disc collection, boasting 4 discs featuring the Movie trilogy with the inclusion of the Animatrix cartoon movie and 6 discs with extras.<br /><br />Although I am played out on the movies having moved on to the comics by the Wachowski's and Cloud Atlas is a great movie, I wanted to check out the extras. When this collection arrived I found out the the \\"extras\\" are nothing more than the ones you get when you purchase the Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions special editions and the Matrix Revisited documentary.<br /><br />If you are a totally Matrix Completist buy this, otherwise, stick to the copies of the trilogy and Animatrix you do have and skip this one, because there truly is no \\"Extra\\".
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I am brand new to the literary world of Ian Fleming, and after reading Damian Stevenson's wonderfully thrilling 'Operation Parsifal', it is a world I am looking forward to revisiting. I was hooked by the intriguing and very unusual premise of British agents setting up a search and rescue operation for, of all people, Hitler!! Fortunately the novel did not disappoint. The research and setting details felt spot-on. The dialogue popped (as you've come to expect from Fleming/Bond stories), and the action sequences are plentiful and enthralling. As for the Bond super-villans we're all accustomed to, Wolfgang Krupp is as good (and surprisingly three-dimensional) as they come! I discovered after I downloaded this book that it is actually a sequel, which means I need to pick up Opertaion Armada ASAP!<br /><br />I can now say with all certainly that I am a HUGE Fleming fan!<br /><br />Great read!
006202406X|5.0|I found the Divergent  series quite by accident. Having grown up in my youth on classic Sci-fi writers like Philip K. Dick, Frank Herbert, and Isaac Asimov, I wanted to branch out and read some new contemporary writers. I also had a strong interest in reading more dystopia fiction and a few google searches later I stumbled upon Divergent.<br /><br />Divergent was a solid novel and while it was a gripping dystopian styled political commentary on  class division and the social injustice racial profiling I can't say I was all that gripped with the budding romance of Trish and Four/Tobias, perhaps it was because I was not a teenage girl (I did not know that was the target group). Yet since I am a sucker for a good coming of age story I did in the end get sucked in. Insurrection I found to have a lot \\"filler\\" in it but was a needed story to bring Trish well up to and past Tobias in maturity, skill, and leadership. It also helped fill in all the questions about the fractions that Divergent left out.<br /><br />However, it is was really Allegiant that to me was the shining gem of them all. I know from reading other's reviews that most fans panned this novel and and enraged there is no happy ending and feel cheated. Putting aside the love story for a minute I have to say the writing of this installment was far beyond anything Veronica Roth did in the other two books. The central plot idea that the whole Fraction society is really a government experiment to produce divergents who are really genetically pure people needed for rebuilding society on the \\"outside\\" was a brilliant hidden plot that I never saw coming. Even more brilliant was showing that the \\"outside\\" was mimicking the Fractions without even knowing it!<br /><br />Much criticism has circled around the dueling first person accounts of Trish and Tobias. Many said they found it confusing and that Trish and Tobias sounded to much a like (which i did not notice). However, I'd point out that it was a literary necessitybecause of the death of Trish. If she remained the narrator it would have ended the book right away. Secondly, I'd add Veronica Roth is a young writer (literally in age and experience) and I felt it was the right thing for her too do as a writer least she hinder her writing style growth.<br /><br />Perhaps the death of Trish is the most hotly controversial event that has thousands of teenage girls up in arms. I'd just hope that they don't forget that this trilogy is was about perceived power being found in politics and warfare vs sacrificial love. Trish was had a heritage of sacrificial love in her parents. She had been sickly suicidal in the whole second novel and willing to give her life away to ride her guilt. By contrast in Allegiant her sacrifice is finally for the right reason and it not only forever heals Caleb but it gives liberty to thousands. She showed by her actions love is greater then war. My only grip is that I wish Tobias would have went on to explore and liberate more cities in Tirsh's honor rather then return to his.<br /><br />I will be looking for my work from Veronica Roth because I feel her work it maturing and the best is yet to come. Hopefully, her next work is a whole new story (which will help her grow as a writer).
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|This book is not literature.  The writing style is &#34;jokey&#34; and the ethical dilemma is presented as if being angry with your spouse is an appropriate and sufficient response to discovering he committed murder.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|not a brain buster but very entertaining.  great for times you need to.keep yourself occupied but you can still leave it and come back without losing your place..
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a lot of work but I have a horse finally. I wish I was able to pick the horse but fun and entertaining.
B008I6QPVG|5.0|It is a worth while investment if you are a huge fan of both the Terminator franchise and of the Laserdisc format. Spot on!
B00026WU64|5.0|Perhaps the best record Dylan ever created and one of the most influential records ever. I know some songs were cut from this record just before it was released. I hope an expanded version with those songs is produced in the near future.
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|Hathaway is good as always but the plot is so  predictable and boring it does not move. Nice music though.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Fascinating easy read on the intricacies associated with the history, development and frightening power of nuclear weapons. One of those very hard to put down books. Should be mandatory reading for all. Easy to follow narrative of the science, political and dangers of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems.
1849491062|5.0|First off, if possible I'd have given this a 4 1/2-star rating because the recipes are given in metrics.  However, this isn't a major issue because liquid measuring cups come marked with both US and metric units and the recipes contain standard spoon measures (i.e., 2 tsp, 1 tbsp).  Food scales, used for dry ingredients, also show both forms.  Packaging for chocolate and other additions show both.  Therefore, if you don't have one, buy a food scale and you'll no longer need to feel intimidated by a list of metric ingredients.  As for oven temperature, you can find a great conversion chart at: [...]<br />Now on to the best parts.  The photography is outstanding!  Each elegant recipe comes with a beautiful illustration of the finished creation and, often, detailed shots of the work-in-progress.  A look at a photo starts one reaching for ingredients.  If you're already a baker, you likely have most of them at hand.  Access to others is not difficult, and decorating cones, tips, molds, etc., are easily located at cake decorating and general cookware suppliers.<br />Included in the book are recipes for \\"sweet treats\\" (pastel meringue kisses, tarts, macarons, etc.), cookies, cupcakes, layer and classic cakes, and beverage accompaniments.<br />The author truly has a flair for artistic detail and she has provided a wonderful section that shows necessary supplies/equipment and clear how-tos for making flowers, for frosting & assembling your delicious creations, how to make piping bags, and even piping techniques.<br />Buy the book!  It's coffee table-worthy.  In the meantime, I'm off to the kitchen to make a batch of those beautiful pastel Mini Cinnamon Doughnuts.
B005JE7XW0|4.0|This was a great surprise. The acting is iffy with the main cast being fine, but the backup pretty lousy, but it makes it that much more fun.  The creativity of the writing exploiting prejudice against hillbillies is just great!
B003Y2BMVC|4.0|It's a fun movie, the kids like it ok, and it deals with fantasy, as well as getting them somewhat interested in spacial bodies. After showing this, I got to talk to my students about Super-novas, and they were really interested!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love this app and so does my 4 and 2 year olds. Would have given it 5 stars if it didn't charge for make puzzles out of your own pics.
B00G9U7NEQ|1.0|Incredibly boring and predictable...even to a 6 year old.  You're better off just watching the original. No originality in this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This digital version of the Bible is wonderful.  With the daily Bible verse and all of the translation options, it is great for anyone.  I also love it for my Bible study because of its convenience.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game would be outstanding but not all of us are facebookers. It would be much better if there were special features you could earn use of, not just unlock . I know this is a social media game but I'm not a social media girl. maybe adding special items for always use after a certain level of achievement.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Even though some levels are way hard this is a great little game and a fun way to kill time
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great shooter game and you don't really have to spend too much money at all. It's really fun to play
B00DHRLK84|4.0|Excellent movie with great action scenes especially when viewed in 3D format. With the popularity of recent zombie themed movies and TV shows, this movie is a stand-out.

B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Good movie with great plot twists.  The character development is a little bit weak, but overall the movie kept my attention.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was a real let down for the series. I have been waiting for this book for such a long time and at times I couldn't believe what I was reading. All through the book I kept thinking it would get better but it only got worse.  When reading a story that has a lot of brutality and sadness to it you look forward to a time when things get better for the main characters. It never happens. I want a &#34;do over&#34; Veronica!  You owe us that:(
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Great movie. I won't go too lengthy in reviewing it, because so many other people have. My advice is to watch the trailer and if it looks interesting to you, watch it and judge for yourself. Personally, I think this was a unique sci-fi movie that added new elements to the genre, forming its' own creation. The combination of actual father and son actors made the bond the characters had feel that much more real. I'm glad I took the time to watch &#34;After Earth.&#34;
B00BEIYGQG|5.0|If you love movies such as: (500) Days of Summer & Love Actually, you will adore this movie! It's witty, charming, funny, and heat-breaking all at the same time. The cast is incredible and kudos to the director, Richard Curtis, for capturing the story in such a beautiful way. Love all the shots of London and Cornwall.
B005K17RU0|5.0|My husband and I love this app.  We live in a valley in upper NH and the local news channels are never very accurate.  Not to blame anyone, when you don't like the weather in the north country all you have to is wait a few minutes or drive in any direction for a half hour and the weather is the opposite of what it was.  There is usually a line across the road where the sun is shining and on the other side of the line there's a 20 degree drop in the temp and it's snowing.  Your app gives us our ticket to go and find a slice of sunshine, north country winters are long and hard for us mountaineers and we lack that good vitamin d from lack of sunshine,  so thank<br /> you for making it easier to find out the weather every hour of every day.  Sincerely,  two very satisfied app. users.  Vcolebrook@aol.com

B00BMKH5NW|2.0|I may be mentioning some things that could vaguely be spoilerish, so just a warning...<br /><br />I didn't really like or dislike this one.  I'm just kind of meh about it.  I think mostly, the book just seemed to meander a bit.  I ended up skimming because I was getting bored.  The ending just sort of petered out.  Nothing with Cath's mother was resolved - what was the point of her being in the story?  Nothing with Cath's \\"crazy\\" was resolved.  She kept talking all through the book about her being crazy like her father, but then suddenly she decided to go for it with Levi and the crazy was gone.  What was the point of Nick?<br /><br />I loved Levi, but I couldn't wrap my head around what he looked like.  I don't mind real-looking characters, but between his \\"wide, lined forehead,\\" his receding hairline, wispy blond hair, big eyes and long face I just kept picturing a homely 40-year-old.  I couldn't even try to picture my own version of him, because his appearance was always being mentioned - his hairline and forehead especially.<br /><br />I do think the author has a lot of talent.  There was a lot of humor in the book.  I enjoyed the writing - Cath's way of thinking was interesting.  I could actually relate to her a lot with her anxiety about the lunchroom and unfamiliar places.  I really liked that Cath and Levi fell in love by getting to know each other - it was very natural.  I loved that she was close with her father and looked out for him.<br /><br />The thing I really hated about this book was the profanity.  I don't use it, I don't like to hear it, and I especially don't like to read it...but I can tolerate it if there's a purpose for it.  If someone uses the F-word, it better be because the character is angry or upset - that word can really pack a punch.  This book had none of that - just characters using it simply to swear, and sometimes in the most random ways.  It was almost like the author just threw the F-word into the middle of sentences just to use it.  I did a search, and it's used 45 times in one form or another.  That's about 44 times too many for me.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2.5 stars, because I enjoyed it enough to finish it, but not enough to recommend it to anyone.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Having agreat time playing and I am so impressed with the creativity and challange. Highly recommend for adults and kids!
B00E5INZ82|2.0|Graphics  get D<br />Gameplay gets a D<br />Car Selection get a D<br /><br />A low budget D rated version of drag racing. Nothing like Asphalt 8. If you want a hi powered car racing app with hi powered graphics and gamplay get Asphalt 8. This is more for 10 or 12 year olds and younger. Someone who's never driven before.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Absolutely loved this book......loved &#34; The Shining&#34; and finding out what happened to Danny Torrance was wonderful. Stephen King is a master storyteller so there were so many elements to this book that I would highly recommend it
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I can't believe I never reviewed this book!!!! This is the book I reread when I can't find a new book to read.  That is how fantastic this book is!  All her other books pale in comparison.  I had low expectations for anyone who was not in Dark River, Snow Dancer, or Judd (who is so good he has his own category). I thought you needed to be changeling( or Judd) to be a hero! Nalini Singh is a genius and where Kaleb does not have an animal counterpart, he has his unlimited abilities. His abilities are somewhat similar to having a predatory animal counterpart. He leashes his abilities like the changelings leash their beasts. Nalini Singh is such a genius that it is the wrestling with emotions and with powerful psychic abilities that fill in any gap that a is left from the hero not being a changeling. I thought Judd was a fluke that could not be repeated!  I am happy to tell you that I was completely wrong. I can think of no author that can make a person who by all definitions would be a sociopath into a sympathetic hero. He has no empathy for anyone except Sahara. He is by his own admission a monster.  Sahara redeems him and this is what the book is about. Sahara is the perfect balance to Kaleb and she is not overshadowed by him as she could have been. She knows that she is in a battle for his soul.  What is better is that she has the power to destroy him, not just emotionally, but she does have a talent that could kill him physically.  Sahara is the only one that can in the Psy world.  So her inner battle is very relevant and important to her character as well as the story.  Sahara is very compassionate but not blind to the situation.  The nuances make compelling, flawless, and such emotional reading.  It fits together like a magnificent puzzle which defies the reader to find fault with it.  I found none.  Whereas I love Judd's quirky, dry humor, I respect Kaleb's love, devotion and fidelity to Sahara.  I challenge Nalini Singh to top this book.  She is such a genius that I know she will!!!!

B005LAII12|1.0|This had to be the worst movie either one of us has ever seen! I had a lot of anticipation of seeing a really funny movie, but it was anything but that. Seems to me that they relied on total vulgarity for a laugh, which we found totally UNFUNNY. The concept of an obnoxious talking bear IS funny, but not this one. It was hard to watch the entire movie, to be honest. Pass this dog up.

B00ER23V1W|5.0|I am a big fan of movie soundtracks, in particular the movie scores. Just recently I saw &#34;Gravity&#34; in the theatre, and it is not an understatement when I say that I was blown away by my movie experience, and that the movie score played an integral part in that movie experience.<br /><br />&#34;Gravity: Original Picture Soundtrack&#34; (16 tracks; 72 min.) brings the movie score composed by Steven Price, an up-and-coming composer who earlier this year also did the score for &#34;The World's End&#34;. The soundtrack brings a great mix of orchestral score with ambient, if not electronic, sounds. As a result we get a fantastic &#34;space&#34; soundtrack for this space drama. My favorite tracks on here include abstract-sounding pieces like &#34;The Void&#34; and &#34;Atlantis&#34;, the latter of which immediately reminded me of several albums from a band called Spacecraft, which created serious buzz in the ambient field with albums like tis self-titled debut album, &#34;Hummel&#34; and &#34;Cybersphere&#34; in the late 90s/early 00s (all available here on Amazon). Other notable tracks for me include &#34;In the Blind&#34;, and towards the very end of the album, &#34;Tiangong&#34;. The only track that in my book does not really mesh well with the rest of the album is the next-to-last one &#34;Shenzou&#34;, which sounds too &#34;poppy&#34;. But it's a minor quibble in the end.<br /><br />I was quite surprised when it turns out that this soundtrack runs 72 min., given that the movie ran only 90 min. Was there really an almost non-top movie-score? I'll have to pay attention to that when I see the movie again (which I plan to do in the weeks to come). Even if it turns out that this soundtrack in fact contains more music than was used in the movie, it's irrelevant. Bottom line: &#34;Gravity&#34; is nothing short of an epic and top-notch soundtrack. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B00G4Q3KOC|4.0|\\"12 Years A Slave\\" (2013 release; 134 min.) brings to the big screen the book written by Solomon Northup in 1853, to tell the world of his ordeal as a slave in the deep South after having been abducted. As the movie opens, we go back-and-forth between scene of Northup with his family in Saratoga, New York and Northup on a plantation camp. We are not even 15 min. into the movie when Northup, having been deceived by a couple of artists into coming to Washington DC with them, is abducted and eventually sold into slavery. Another slave gives him a piece of advice on how to survive (:keep your head low\\"), to which Northup responds \\"I don't want to survive, I want to LIVE!\\". To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Couple of comments: first, this movie is directed by Steve McQueen, who previously brought us the equally excellent \\"Hunger\\" (from 2008) and \\"Shame\\" (from 2011). The latter was the at times shocking sex-addiction drama starring Michael Fassbender, and Fassbender is of course also one of the main actors in \\"12 Years\\" (more on that later). Second, this movie will likely shock you, as it certainly did me. There are many unsettling scenes, with extensive violence including multiple beatings, hangings, and whip-lashings. If it is done to make the movie as authentic as possible, then there is no argument against including these scenes. But it also makes clear that this movie is rated R for a reason. (I would not recommend that anyone younger than 14 or 15 watch this movie.) Third, the acting performances are stellar throughout the movie, none more so than Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup. Surely he will get a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this masterful performance. There are tons of other choice roles, including the already mention Fassbender as the cruel plantation owner, but also Adepero Oduye as fellow slave Eliza. At one point Eliza gets separated from her 2 children and just falls apart, to which the plantation wife responds \\"your children will soon be forgotten\\" (there was a huge groan from the theatre audience then) Keep your eyes open for a cameo from Brad Pitt (less than 5 min. of screen time), Pitt's production company Plan B played a significant role in bringing this movie to the big screen. At the very end of the movie, we are informed what became of Northup after the publication of the 1853 book, as well as what became of his abductors.<br /><br />This movie has been playing in a few select cities the last 2-3 weeks and finally was rolled out to more cities this week. It opened in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was very well attended, which is great news as this movie deserves to be seen both for its historical context as well as for the top quality movie that it is. If it wasn't clear by now, and assuming you can deal with the multiple violent scenes, \\"12 Years A Slave\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!en and just falls apart, to which the plantation wife responds \\"your children will soon be forgotten\\" (there was a huge groan from the theatre audience then) Keep your eyes open for a cameo from Brad Pitt (less than 5 min. of screen time), Pitt's production company Plan B played a significant role in bringing this movie to the big screen.

B00B0A5XQU|4.0|I'm new to Debbie Macomber - wish I'd have found her sooner.  This is the first book of hers I've read and I intend to read this entire series.<br /><br />I don't usually read cozies because many seem poorly thought out, written by people with little or no writing skills, or have uninteresting characters.  None of these apply to Ms. Macomber.  She develops her characters very quickly yet they have depth and I'm interested in them and want to know what has happened and will happen to them.<br /><br />This Blossom Street series revolves around a woman, Lydia, who has beat cancer twice and decided to open a knitting shop in Seattle.  Though the author must explain the cancer and its impact on Lydia's life, dreams, fears, and family strain it isn't overly sappy.  Ms. Macomber does not fall back on the cancer to further the storyline.  I can see why she is such a well liked best selling author.  Once I finish this series I look forward to her other novels.

B00459EZLW|5.0|Tragic that the bean counters killed this show. It was deeply developing and ready for 5 more seasons. The cliffhanger final episode is heartbreaking. The HD version is thrilling. SG-U is a show made for HD. Of course it just makes the who cancellation of this brilliant and edgy-moody series more heartbreaking over all.

Walter Salles directs the Dark Water remake for American audiences which features a great cast. While neither version of Dark Water is precisely a horror film (they are really dark, dramatic thrillers) the film is still worth watching.<br /><br />Although there was a PG-13 and unrated version of this film we get the 105-minute theatrical cut in this release. The picture and audio quality are above average. We get some extras (Analyzing 'Dark Water's Sequences and two deleted scenes) but three featurettes from the DVD release are absent.

B008NMT684|4.0|My 3.5 yo son really enjoys this app. He is a huge fan of anything with wheels so he goes back to this game time after time. I like how there are a variety of skill levels built into the one app. He's definitely beyond the initial one-piece puzzle, but still enjoys them. He doesn't have any problems with the hardest level ones either, so I am inclined to rate this more appropriate for a 2 or early 3 year old, but my son did ask to unlock the rest of them (even bringing me his piggy bank of coins to do so!) so I guess even almost-4 year olds can still enjoy it :) Great colors with easy to drag puzzle pieces. Works great on my Kindle Fire.

B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|I love remix albums. They only add to the originals as far as I'm concerned. I miss Donna so much, I'm grateful for a chance to hear her in new ways. Here's what I think so far:<br /><br />LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY -- Giorgio worked on this one, and he's no slouch with new or old synths. Never have her moans of joy been more needed.<br /><br />DIM ALL THE LIGHTS -- Worst track here. Hardly any of the original, mindless repitition of snippets, and certainly none of the intimate warmth the song meant to achieve. Were they that afraid of \\"turn my brown body white?\\" Worthy of learning how to program your cd player to skip it.<br /><br />HOT STUFF -- Is this a giddy, glamorous house anthem? Sure, okay, it's kinda like if RuPaul finally became Donna IRL at last!<br /><br />I FEEL LOVE -- HIGH NRG; it sounds pretty cluttered to me (the original is so sleek and focused, what else can you do but dress it up?), but it'd be fun in the club.<br /><br />LOVE IS IN CONTROL -- The missing hit you never knew by Whitney Houston. The 80s sounds are over-the-top, but lovable, and a great, sparkly frame for the song.<br /><br />SUNSET PEOPLE -- Hot Chip add the spooky moodiness of some of Moroder's movie scores to Donna's pristine vocal track. A mash-up that works surprisingly well, and still haunts those electric neon LA highways.<br /><br />WORKING THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT -- Someone else is doing the vocals (Tiffany Roth), while retaining Summer's vocals only for the bridge (mixed way back and high). It's not really a remix; more like a cover song. Well, it's never been covered that I know of, so I can live with it I guess, but the original is much more robotic (in a good way)and ethereal. This is almost bluesy. What was wrong with Donna's vocal? The poor hired singer should get the credit, she tries her best, but call it what it is.<br /><br />BAD GIRLS -- This has that Daft Punk gloss of what the cool kids thought the 1970s sounded like last summer; it's all right, but a very different energy than the rock vibe of the original.<br /><br />MACARTHUR PARK -- Let's face it, there's no way to make this song any crazier. But I guess you can make it faster. Imagine if Blondie had done this for Eat to the Beat, that's kinda where it's at (Atomic!). Cover me with kisses, baby, cover me with love. What I wouldn't give for a Debbie/Donna duet!<br /><br />I FEEL LOVE -- House is not the first place I would go with this track. So that makes this sort of surprising. It's like Miss Grace Jones offering you a dub version. Weird, not terrible, but very indirect.<br /><br />ON THE RADIO -- Chill, downbeat take on a shiny pop anthem. It's become moody trip hop/trance. Well, it was a pretty sad song, even back in the day. This is like staying up at night searching for channels on an old radio. Welcome to the Dreamworld.<br /><br />LAST DANCE -- The vocal on this is so stellar you'd have to be a real idiot to mess it up. Thankfully, the Masters at Work live up to their nomenclature, just pretting a fresh polish on percolating perfection.<br /><br />So only one real loser, and one guest artist, but overall I'm happy with my purchase!gy than the rock vibe of the original.<br /><br />MACARTHUR PARK -- Let's face it, there's no way to make this song any crazier. But I guess you can make it faster. Imagine if Blondie had done this for Eat to the Beat, that's kinda where it's at (Atomic!). Cover me with kisses, baby, cover me with love. What I wouldn't give for a Debbie/Donna duet!<br /><br />I FEEL LOVE -- House is not the first place I would go with this track. So that makes this sort of surprising. It's like Miss Grace Jones offering you a dub version. Weird, not terrible, but very indirect.<br /><br />ON THE RADIO -- Chill, downbeat take on a shiny pop anthem. It's become moody trip hop/trance. Well, it was a pretty sad song, even back in the day. This is like staying up at night searching for channels on an old radio.

Thankfully, the Masters at Work live up to their nomenclature, just pretting a fresh polish on percolating perfection.<br /><br />So only one real loser, and one guest artist, but overall I'm happy with my purchase!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I always find Tarantino movies fun, but if violence bothers you you should avoid this film. It's very well-done and well-acted, but it is extremely violent. All of the actors give amazing performances, and there are some fun cameos.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|A predictable and an easy read. This book is for anyone in a book club or anyone that just wants a quick, mindless book to read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been waiting to play on kindle for some time, now am able to!Really know this game, everyone at work is playing
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Amazing love story about finding someone worth unpacking your inner baggage for - and helping them unpack theirs.  Great read
B000VE439Y|5.0|The funniest film ever made is Monty Python's Holy Grail. Their other film, this one, is a close second. It takes a dig not so much at religion but the time of Christ that is portrayed by most movie makers as an oh so serious time in history. Maybe it was, but gee it's okay to laugh about it too and the Monty Python crew give us plenty to laugh about in this movie. The People's Front of Judea? Or is it the Popular Front? Splitters. See it to believe it. Recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the best games that I've ever played. This is much better than temple run in my opinion
B000031EGV|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a kid - I probably watched it a few time a month. It could be a little bit scary for younger kids, but I was never troubled by it and I watched it when I was fairly young. It's an exciting movie, and it could appeal to both boys and girls.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My great grandson loves it..I tried to get hold of Amazon but cant seem to do it...om my kindle it said the game was 2.99 and when I downloaded it the price was 6.99...
B003G4W49C|5.0|The story of Ender Wiggin is gripping from start to end. Well written and well paced. The book is much better than the movie.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|a  little unrealistic(too naive/sheltered young girl falls for disabled boy), but I enjoyed the British aspect, and also facing the quadriplegic problem/euthanasia issue. (a subject I hadn't read). most of my friends LOVED it...I like heavier literature with lots of twists. this one was pretty straight forward, with some family secrets thrown in
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The book was one of the best I've read in a while. However, when I was reading it, I kept thinking that teenagers don't speak like the way they do in this story.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I was not very disappointed in this season at all.  Now waiting for next season to see what surprises are in store for me!
B000BB1MI2|1.0|This version is so much creepier than the original. If I were a kid I think it would frighten me - I would definitely recommend the original over the Burton version.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|This a good feel good movie . The music is great. I like how they started before the accident. I still like the first footloose. This movie is a little more updated.
B00GFJ0NGQ|1.0|Absolutly the worst thing I bought, spent 2 dollars on 1 episode and every time I try and watch it , it plays for 20 seconds then quits, never buying another thing off amazon.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book. The story was compelling, and I wanted to hug Victoria several times-- of course, she wouldn't have allowed it!
0316055433|5.0|The Goldfinch is a long, incredibly involving read, telling us the story of Theo Decker, whose life takes twists and turns reminiscent of a Charles Dickens novel.  Along the way, the author exposes the reader to meditations on art, beauty, history, life and loss, in a way that seeps into your consciousness in a masterful way.  It took ten years for Donna Tartt to write this, and the time was well spent. She has aimed high by writing such a book, and she has triumphed.  It's such a huge task to tell someone how great this is; you just have to read it for yourself. I don't think a better novel has been publshed this year, and I hope The Goldfinch gets the recognition it deserves.  Truly a superb, sublime read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As advertised, this little baby made my not-so-smart TV in to a smart one!  I can now watch my Netflix!
B00867GJYK|5.0|This is my favorite Pixar film, and I hate fish so that says a lot. The beginning could be upsetting for kids because of what happens to Nemo's mother, so if your child is sensitive I might skip over that part.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|A murder drama brought to the level of real, raw human emotion; pain so searing it can be felt, human frailty of jumping to conclusions, palpable need for revenge and the mysterious way in which we truly cannot know a person, even the one closest to us.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Well produced movie, and a faithful adaptation of the excellent source book, which I love. Can't wait for the sequel.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am on my second time around with this series! I love the details and story! I get lost in the whole package!
0767919408|5.0|Who has not read something by Bill Bryson and been charmed. He is in part a national treasure despite now living in England. His IN A SUNBURN COUNTRY is still one of the best travel books ever. Bryson is known for his humor and turn of phrase and unique perspective. His latest however is a straight narrative non-fiction history book and although it clearly is well written and offers up some unique and brilliant writing it is a serious book.<br />  Bryson has taken Americana and our desire for the simpler times of yesterday and shows us that 1927 was like all transformational times in American history a clash of culture, new technology and a search for hero worship (in all the wrong place?). We get introduced into the history of aviation via Lindbergh's flight (and those others that tried and failed). We meet Ruth Snyder and her lover and her murdered husband in the most famous murder trial of the day (seems we have more than one a year now). Politics via that awful President Calvin Coolidge and his long vacation to the Black Hills and Herbert Hoover who no one who ever knew him or met him can remember him ever smiling. It's the culture of prohibition and Al Capone who was only on top a few months and the culture of the movies with the advent of talking pictures. Babe Ruth hits 60 home runs; Henry Ford's business begins to go downhill among other topics covered.<br />  Bryson mixes all this up in a narrative that is fun, informative, and easy and pleasant reading. It gives you much information for the next \\"did you know\\" conversation with friends. For example did you know that Lindbergh besides having his son kidnaped and killed and his self-destructing with his love of all things racist between 1957 and his death had an affair with a German woman who gave him two sons and a daughter?  Plus he also had a simultaneous affair with that same woman's sister who bore him two more children AND he had yet two more children with a German secretary. For those counting on yourfingers this is....yes a total of 7 illegitimate German children. Lindbergh was able to keep all this secret from his American family to the extent that even A. Scott Berg his biographer was unaware (It came out in 2003 some 30 years after Lindbergh's death). Now how Lindbergh did all this might be a subject for a book someday.<br />  The book expands beyond covering just the history of the summer of 1927. Bryson goes back and forth in time with just enough added substance to make his summer a unique look with a unique perspective on our shared yesterday. It is pure Americana....and I just loved the book.
0399159347|5.0|Fantastic book to read with a book club!  I couldn't put it down so I read it in 24 hours.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|A fun film for kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the goofiness, and adults will get all of the jokes and understand all of the cameos. One of the better Muppet movies for sure.
0345803507|5.0|I can't remember the last time I read 3 books so fast. ;)  Sure, they are a bit far fetched but it's that wishful fantasy so many of us have had at one time or another. Especially when we were much younger and didn't know about the &#34;real world&#34;. Enjoy.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|Frida is a wonderful movie.  The story is great and the art work in the film is great.  It was my introduction to the artist and Ms. Hayek's performance is brilliant and Oscar worthy.  For the art lover and or the romantic this is a must see film.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I've read most of Neil Gaiman's books and was enthralled with this one as well. The magical realism and point of view was fantastic. It was a short read but just right.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|It was a little confusing to read at first coming from a little boys perspective.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Great book!!!
0062068423|2.0|Too many characters in a too long book that moves back and forth in time. There was no emotional attachment to anyone including Harry Hole, the central figure. The plot was contrived and self indulgent
B003UYV08E|5.0|Definitely not as good as the first film in the series. I also think the 3rd film is better than this one. But RDJ makes Tony Stark fun, and the movie is entertaining, if a bit of a let down.
B00FG5E03W|5.0|I have waited so many years to see this film. It was worth all those years. A beautiful film from start to finish, Mr. Nobody shows us how choices, many even mundane, affect our future. Jared Leto's performance is outstanding.
B0042U8T9S|5.0|This is a classic album to me. It was John's lost weekend and I think this was one of his better albums. I love all the songs on it because they are so representative of John Lennon.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book due to all the hype over the actors to play in the upcoming movie.  This book was one of the worst pieces of trash I have ever seen.  There are no redeeming qualities about it.  It isn't even decent pornography, as a friend had described it.  This book should be purchased only by women with NO experience or with NO imagination as that is about the only reader who will find anything of interest.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money.  It is not worth it.  I have no idea why this received so much praise.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I really like this app.  I just got it yesterday because my kindle was sluggish a lot.  I use another app to clean out the cache.  And this one shows me which apps I do not need and I can uninstall them when I want to.  Thanks so much.  This is great.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I read all the books and have followed the seres the entire time! I love the plots and the twists!
B00GBQI0M2|5.0|This is freshly written with unexpected twists, and not so generic storylines, you are left wanting more.  I will most positively be looking for more from Scarlette D'Noire!
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|I'm normally not into any form of romance-fiction but this one thinks so far outside the box in a refreshing way that I would highly recamend it to both romance-novel fans and sci-fi fans
B000SXMNI6|5.0|This is the pinnacle of Jethro Tull's music. I highly recommend. Although Ian Anderson swears this is not a concept album, it sure comes across as one! This is great music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a real fun game,  enjoy playing it. Not hard to play. Good to past time. Love how colorful it is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love! Keeps kids entertained for awhile a great game for me to play as well :) .Very nice game Candy Crush Saga!
1401227821|5.0|I looove Adam Hughes' work, and this is a great book to showcase it. Very nice in hardcover, fairly large with great color reproductions.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Awesome game.  Ive played it under 3 different names- still cant get much better than the time before it! Fast paced.
1594202273|5.0|Just finished reading this engrossing book.  Having lived through that period, I had absolutely no idea that warheads were so fragile nor that the political situation rested on that fragility.  How many times did we avert a nuclear disaster, let alone a nuclear war, but through sheer luck and circumstance.  Yes, we can look back and say \\"well, see, nothing happened,\\" but the human interaction and development of such technology continues to be problematic today, where there is such an interconnectedness, as pointed out in the book, that any little fault can create an unstoppable chain of events.  But we humans stay the course, refusing to recognize the cliff edge that we continually stand on and only the slightest gust of wind might push us off that edge to our fate.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|Love that this hits it on the head.<br />I encourage you to take the test. It is a real eye opener.
B00008G8LG|5.0|I have loved this movie since it came in theatres years ago. It may be factually inaccurate in several areas, but I don't care about that in regards to this movie. The love story is terrific, and Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster are divine in their respective roles. Their last scene together always makes me cry.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series demonstrates vividly the truth in that statement. Each morning you wake up with a set of problems and more added as the day progresses. All anyone can do is solve that problem which is before you and move to the nest one. Katness did just that never knowing until the last moment what her solution was going to be.
1446303314|5.0|I love the character and the pictures in the book are fabulous.  I haven't had time to make up any of the patterns as of today.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun. My 11 year old has fun on this. Makes you think about how to get out.  I just wish there were more levels.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Very few women would like this movie. Drugs, gangs, violence, killing, etc. No emotion in the entire movie. Guys would love it. Sorry ladies.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|At first it was a fun game. Now it is just aggravating...cant win enough credits to continue playing. Either have to buy them or wait till next day. They don't give u shadow cards very often and the treasure chests r even getting fewer. As for power ups,  I have 400+,but can only use the chests once per game and those r the ones u get most. Have had problems with purchasing credits, but customer service always takes care of that. Just annoying having to wait 2 days.  The game ends before u can daub your last number. Should at least give more credits the farther along u get in the game to keep it exciting. Some of the collection items cannot b gifted. I don't know if they have it rigged for u not to have numbers called on ur cards, but it sure seems that way. They should give u a shadow card everytime u purchase 4 cards. I think the owners of Buffalo Studios have gotten too greedy. If they don't fix it they will loose a lot of business. Also has a few issues with the kindle fire hd.
B005J4TLO8|5.0|Pretty good movie. I like all the actors in it and it has a decent plot. I would definitely watch it again.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read the first two books twice and was anticipating the release like many others. I was left heartbroken and angry at how the characters were killed without reason. I tried to explain to someone else the gravity of the plot. I said imagine the movie Castaway with Tom Hanks. He suffers during his time on the island and has almost completely lost all hope when he is given a spark and makes it off the island. He then again almost dies to finally be discovered by a passing ship. Well imagine this same movie with him so close to salvation to be discovered dead. No hope, no redemption, just dead!<br />I wish Veronica Roth could go back in time and do a rewrite.  Maybe get past the feeling of a first draft.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent drama gritty characters interesting and great story lines looking forward to next series and seeing how stories develop !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like it very much. I do not like that you can only play for  five or six lives and than you have to wait until the next day to play again. I am not that good at the game but like it very much.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|made me almost cry when... no but really it was a good movie we enjoyed it. Would watch it again
1616550414|5.0|So you like Zelda? I like Zelda. Buy this book! You will not have one regret from this purchase. It just screams of awesome. This book is bound wonderfully. You can't get this cheaper else where.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|fun and addictive, if your into the mass slaughter of animals sort of thing. peta staff might not find it as amusing as I did.
0385737955|2.0|I read this book because it was listed among books to read if you liked the Hunger Games series (which I loved).  The Maze Runner is definitely NOT as good as the Hunger Games.  The characters are so ill-defined that it was hard for me to distinguish between the main character and the rest of the boys.  The characters have absolutely no individuality or personality traits that make them endearing or despicable or anything.  The author did nothing to make me care about the main character or his so-called love interest.<br /><br />The plot also seemed disjointed.  It moved in such a linear fashion that it seemed as though the author was making it up as he went along.  It wasn't thought provoking.  To this day, I don't even know what is the theme of the book (if there is one).  To me, it is a poor attempt to try and capture some of the success of the YA dystopian novels that are out right now.<br /><br />I will say this book may be better as a movie.  It read very much like a screenplay and less of a book where the characters thoughts are almost more important than their actions.  I will not be reading book two, but if made into a movie I would probably put it in my Netflix queue.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Never a dull moment Bongo Blitz is hours or fun and entertainment. I like that you can play even if you don't spend real cash. The free daily tournaments are amazing
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I'm giving one star because it's required in order to write a review.  I downloaded this app to my Kindle HD thinking how great it was going to be and looking forward to using it.  I was disappointed.  Long story short...just filling the word requirement...this app fails all the time, it just closes and is basically useless to me.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Thrilling writing and superb acting by Claire Danes and the entire cast. Seems ripped from today's headlines.<br /> Everything appears authentic.
B0091THDOM|3.0|This is a decent phone case but with one issue. Where the magnetic pull tab rests over time it starts to tear the leather off. I do not expect it to last for more than 6 months without looking bad. I<br />I would also worry about it pressing on your volume buttons over time and damaging them.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|Fun, like &#34;Men In Black&#34; series. Don't over think it and you'll be fine. Good action, and a few laughs thrown in.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|This Movie could have been a block buster if it had been done right, my biggest problem with the movie was in one scene Jaden Smith's character has his Fathers special cutlass on his back and then in the very next scene he does not! At first I thought I just missed something but when I went back and watched it again sure enough it just disappears with no reason as to why. It is hard to believe that a professional movie has such a Hugh editing mistake in it.<br />Overall it is a OK movie that could have been done a whole lot better in post production. I am being very generous when I give it 3 of of 5 stars.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|Timeless classic, with beautiful people, clever dialogue, and superb acting by old-time actors.  It didn't require any potty-humor to make this story fun.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala describes her belief for the real meaning of Islam and tells her story of the customs of family and neighbors and politicians in her part of the world. She is molded by principals shared by both her mom and dad and depicts people for who they truly are and the motivation for what they do. An inside look at the Taliban and their fanatical beliefs and regard for women.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addicting game...everyone in our family is playing it now. I'm playing it on two devices at the moment. : )
0547391005|5.0|There will be many a bedtime story to be had with this book. It has all the Curious George stories I remember as a child. Good buy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to install  and works perfectly. A definite step towards helping unplug from cable. Looking forward to more available apps.
B00FEN000S|5.0|I fail to understand why this movie has not received a better response from the public? It is a clever mix of Godzilla type Monsters with Gundum style robots defending the population from an alien attack. The action sequence's are great without the overwhelming look of C.G.I.<br />I have to give this movie 5 of 5 stars.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|The move was good, but the end was a bit of a let down. There could have been a lot more depth.
1885167776|5.0|I have so loved the wisdom and simplicity in this book.  It gives us a starting point for all of our decision by asking &#34;THE QUESTION&#34;.  I now preface every thing I am ready to commit to with &#34;THE QUESTION&#34;, and then I know if I am using my valuable time well.  This has made an impact on my life, and I am sure it will impact yours as well.<br /><br />ps<br />&#34;THE QUESTION&#34; is...What's the ONE THING I can do such that by doing it everything will be easier or unnecessary?
B0011EU0NG|5.0|One of my favorites from when I was a kid.  I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a family friendly movie :)
1419705644|5.0|This is like the Holy Bible of Adventure Time. So much nostalgia and awesomeness its not even funny. Buy this book!
B004SUDQE0|3.0|If you are looking for a film the whole family can enjoy this one  not really family fare. While the theme is about community pulling together, the characters are involved in marital infidelity, drunkenness, and vandalism.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|I have all the other seasons and am watching season 9 as it airs.  It really enjoy watching this series.  It adds a different type of humor to crime dramas.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I wasn't sure that I would enjoy the &#34;Walking Dead&#34; but once I began watching and continued viewing all the way through season 2, I had to continue! I was hooked! Season 3 was awesome!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good Book, Lone Surviour is more fast paced read.  Well, written for people that do not like to read a lot
0316228583|4.0|Very well written.  I've read all the Potter books and enjoyed this one too.  Her characters were very real and quite interesting.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Not at all like the book but it was still enjoyable. Anything with Brad Pitt in it is pretty good these days. The digital copy activated flawlessly on iTunes.
B00G32OER4|5.0|i really love this movie!! my friends and I had a scary time watching it..lol but is pretty cool ..
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|Just as I expected.  I enjoyed watching the original version as much as the newer version.  It was very nostalgic..
B00FEN000S|2.0|Great special effects, but the plot must have been written by a 10-year old.  The movie also had the typical Hollywood cliches all the way down to a dog who made repeat appearances at just the right time.  Kids might like it, but this is not a movie for grown adults.
1451629192|5.0|This is one of the most touching stories/book that I have ever read.  I can't imagine what this women has to endure for 18 years and being taken at only 11 years old.  Jacyee is one of the bravest most beautiful women in the world to me.  Once I started this book I could not put it down until I was finished and still think about her from time to time.  Being a mother of two girls myself I cannot begin to grasp what this family went through.  Jacyee is always in my heart.  This is a must read book!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Very entertaining and ridiculous. If you want to be entertained and not looking for something serious - this is the movie for you.
B007SSDS24|4.0|with hot russian chicks in it<br />personally, it doesn't get much better than that<br />pretty cut and dry plot, mysterious aliens show up intent on raping our planet for resources, average joes, and jane's must survive, and figure out a way to beat them. kinda like independence day in a way, but from the street level. the devil is in the details on this one though. although a couple of the characters are tired old stereotypes (aka crazy russian scientist) most of the characters are surprisingly well developed. it's not winnin any oscars anytime soon, but once again, if you've read any of my reviews before,  excellent way to kill a couple hours with your girlfriend when she's buggin you to spend some time with her and watch a movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series... I just couldn't put the book down and could go to sleep thinking about what will be happening next....
006202406X|2.0|I LOVED Divergent and enjoyed reading Insurgent right after, back to back. I read them just prior to Allegiant being released, so I didn't have much time to get high expectations/worked up.<br /><br />SPOILERS ahead....<br />I thought the plot twist of GPs/GDs was a bit out of nowhere (especially since the excitement and two books worth of escalating mystery behind being Divergent/simulation resistant ended up not being so special or interesting with this explanation), but I ran with it and did enjoy where Roth went with the plot shift in this book. I even appreciated the way Tris died, sad as it was (and even though it was a bit rushed, that's life, death can come at any moment!), for a real purpose this time, and the world became a bit better of a place because of her sacrifice.<br /><br />What I did not enjoy was the lack of character development (not nearly as much in this book, it was more written \\"this happened, then this happened, this person died, this person is in a coma now, etc), and I felt like when emotional portions came (Uriah, Tris, Tobias for Tris) I was feeling sad because I remembered how the characters were in the first book mainly, not because of anything great they had said or done in this book that was worth being sad over.<br /><br />I also agree with many reviewers that the 2 different voices this book is written in (Tris' and Tobias') are so similar that sometimes I had to double back to remember who was supposed to be narrating. Tobias sounded nothing like he did in the first book, just a male Tris really. I did like the switch at the end and enjoyed hearing the last bit of the tale told from his perspective and playing on our emotions by going back to special highlights from Divergent (the train, the Hancock building jump, even Tobias cutting his hair to bookmark how Tris had her hair cut when we first open Divergent).<br /><br />The one thing that gets me about this book is that it is written for teens or \\"young adults\\" (I am 27, married, with one child) by a Christian and has a very intimately descriptive sex scene. The actual act isn't described vividly but the touching, stripping, etc is all very blatant (I kind of saw it coming with the very descriptive make-out scenes in the first two books, but was hoping I'd be wrong). I don't think it's morally wrong to write about sex as a Christian (read Song of Solomon- a married couple being descriptive about their physical relationship), so don't hear me wrong, and it's not even whether the author condones extra-marital relations (though I hope not) by simply willing a character to do the deed that disappoints me (i.e. it's not like Roth ever claims these two have a saving faith in God, so that's not the issue)--- it is that it seemed to be done tastelessly (by being so descriptive, not just factual) and unnecessarily, like it was put in just to make you all the more sorry that Tris died in the end; that her and Tobias became the closest and most intimate they could possibly be and then she was ripped away from him- poor Tobias. Tris and Tobias are role models for teens who read this series, teens are impressionable, and this scene basically told teens when you love someone it's good to do this when you're ready because you never know what may happen. Though Roth isn't writing with a Christian message/point of view in this series, you can't divide yourself into compartments, and it still stands that this portrayal of sex was not God-honouring- basically soft-core teen porn: disappointing.<br /><br />A decent read, but to me it paled in comparison to Divergent (and Insurgent).<br />~Alicia~
B005OCFHHK|4.0|The Blu-rays that were included in this collection have a variety of appearances: some color, some black and white.  I point that out to suggest that these were not printed specifically for being a set.  It's as if they took extras from other printings and assembled them into this set.  The extras are also the extras that came with each movie, I don't believe there's anything additional.  So yes, this is a collection of the movies, but don't expect to be blown away by the presentation of them.<br /><br />That being said, the movies themselves are of course great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Oh my goodness!  I could not believe what everyone was talking about this game until I started to play.  I found myself setting a timer for when I could play again!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Pacific Rim is the multi-cultural culmination of Japan and Hollywood, coming together to create a film jam-packed with a story that wastes no time to make its points. Few blockbusters manage to inject each gigantic action sequence with emotional weight the way Pacific Rim does. There's a give and take with the film that makes for an incredibly satisfying summer movie experience, where you walk away from the film feeling energized. The special effects are also gorgeously detailed, with every Kaiju and Jaegar having a distinctive look (unlike the Transformers films).<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen a little more gender diversity amongst the cast, but I thought the character of Mako was handled fairly well. Where she could have just become some kind of love interest like many women put in these kind of character roles in Hollywood blockbusters often fall into, Mako is instead depicted as someone with her own motivations, strengths, and weaknesses. She isn't there to be a sex object for the male lead to win, but an important part to the story's overall narrative.<br /><br />Pacific Rim seems like director/writer Guillero del Toro and writer Travis Beach lovingly crafted every second of the film. It is a love-letter to anime like Evangelion and films like Godzilla. While the movie is derivative of these under-utilized properties, it is one of the few original films of this scope you'll see coming out of the theaters anytime soon.<br /><br />Wildly original, gorgeous, and full of epic action, Pacific Rim is an essential watch for anyone that enjoys big blockbusters.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|definitely one to watch with the kids, my daughter loves it, and it's got enough coded adult humor, and jokes that will amuse kids of any age, to keep everyone laughing. there's a reason there were so many &#34;minion&#34; costumes this Halloween.
B00846REIS|5.0|once I read the first book I had to get the second one right away and read it so fast that I just couldn't stop.  I wanted to know what was going to happen next right away.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive.  I have it on my phone and on my kindle.  I play it until I don't have any lives. My sister got me on this.  It is a lot fun.
B00EVW013E|5.0|Great movie. Lots of action and adventure. Wasn't slow paced at all one of the best action movies I've seen
0425252868|5.0|Probably the best WWll book I have ever read. That seems enough for WWll buffs, especially pilots or air crew.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Loved it, very addicting, my granddaughter even likes to play with me.<br />I'm spending too much time playing it.<br /><br />Thank you
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Fairly mindless entertainment.  Good &#34;eye candy&#34; and true to it's predecessor.  Not a &#34;stand alone&#34; movie if you are not familiar with the character.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|My God this series is one of the best ones I have read.... I could not get enough of it.
B000022TSY|3.0|Good quality movie. Everything worked great and had good picture and sound it just was not my favorite movie.<br />Thanks
B00BD99JMW|5.0|A very compelling story. The plot grabs your attention immediately and keeps you hooked from beginning to end. I am excited to read more of Veronica Roth's work as she gains more experience and sophistication in her writing.
B000S1L7IU|5.0|I wanted to see the end of the book immediately, yet I did not want to pass over any part.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I am sure it is me.  I am electronically challenged. I bought this for my kindle fire hd. But I am having a hard time writing and saving documents.  And when I do write one I don't know how to make a folder.  I will study the instructions more when I have the time.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very cute and relaxing way to play a game type amp from a movie I loved to watch with great grand child
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Awful movie...silly, goofy trash. I'm surprised anyone would agree to act in this stupid thing. I'd rather do a commercial for Depends.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|i love the movie.  I thought I would be able to load the digital copy on my phone, but have learned I cannot do this on an android phone.  I have a really nice Samsung Galaxy phone and I do not understand why this offer is only for iPhones.  Seems ridiculous and I did not know this before I purchased the set.  I would only have bought the single DVD if I had know.  I think this issue should be more prominent on the ad for the purchase.
B00FGM0JTY|4.0|Great look inside the music studio that produced the great soul sound for Aretha Franklin, the Staple Singers and even the Allman Brothers and Rolling Stones. Rick Hall said he wanted to be somebody and he gave the world a lot of great music to remember him by...
B00AAQVSDW|3.0|Pretty good cd. I like a few of their songs, but some of the others are a little too borderline pop for me. Prefer artists like Blackberry Smoke and Turnpike Troubadours.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|I love both actor's in this movie. The story line was good and was actually surprised at the ending. I hope they make R.I.P.D. 2. I would recommend it ok for teen's. It does have some swearing in it but not as bad as I have seen in other movies. I will watch it again and will buy it.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I never review books, but seeing all the negativity being said about the ending of this one made me feel the need to, mostly for those people who are being influenced NOT to read it because of one scene.<br /><br />If you are a Veronica Roth fan, read it, please. I cried, I pouted, and then I thought on it. I even pulled out all of my old papers from my college fiction classes where we touched on killing off characters (and yes, I had a lot of lessons on that one). And then I gave the book to a 16 year old friend and said \\"Read it and let's talk about it.\\"<br /><br />Hope. That seems to be a big trigger with a lot of the reviewers. \\"You have to give them hope.\\" Hope isn't always given by the protagonists having their happy ending. That is just one way to bring hope. They survived the battle, they can have their happily ever after. Allegiant is touching on something that most YA novels aren't, how to have hope when the world really feels hopeless. Tobias lost Tris and now he has to pull together and hold on. The world didn't stop. The revolution they started together didn't end with her. And with each little triumph, his world rights a little more. Shauna walks, his mother smiles, and his working towards a world that will unite without the threat of another war to wipe out those who are different.<br /><br />Is it what we hoped? Probably not. Is it what we are used to from YA dystopian fiction? No. But the hope is in the days that follow. In taking those risks that he normally wouldn't because of a little voice in his head saying that he can. It will always hurt - death of a loved one is supposed to hurt - but in that hurt he is finding himself and his strength.<br /><br />So if you read Allegiant once and then couldn't go any farther, read it again. Think about what is going to follow. There is hope, just not the kind we are used to as YA readers.
1476727651|5.0|He's done it again! Awesome book.. I read it cover to cover without putting it down! The story of the young boy in The Shining always felt incomplete to me, and now it is continued to a very satisfactory conclusion. Not to be missed by Stephen King lovers.
B005IEGUDY|4.0|I've often stood in old cities and wondered about all the lives lived amongst the cobbled streets for so many centuries.  This book does just that.  The plots may not be that exciting or revealing, but then I love old movies too so I allowed the author to take me through the thousands of years with innate detail and knowledge of how things worked, scientific innovations and how the big stones at Stone Henge were lifted.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This was a gift and she absolutely loves it! She never really mentioned the extended footage so guess it could noy be that obvious.
B0049J3RBC|5.0|I love this movie-my husband and I just watched it last night haha! Cute plot, fun characters. Definitely worth watching.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Great fun film for the entire family!  We enjoyed every moment of this film!  A treat for the eyes! Wonderful!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game and interesting challenges. Fun and exciting thought provoking and makes you use your head unlike most games today.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book. Informative and educational. I'm always amazed to read the negative reviews of a book and try to figure out what those people are looking for in a book. I was at 83% before I realized with disappointment that the story would soon be over. People.....read this book---you wont be sorry! I found myself telling my grandchildren about it so they would know how things were in the past. With todays interest in everything electronic that's offered to children; I'm concerned that books like this could be overlooked. READ IT
B00AUA67GQ|1.0|Not worth the space it takes on your Kindle.  Instructions are impossible.  Even with a good stylus, difficult to read notes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Thid is a fun and challenging game for kids and parents. I have and would recommend it to family and friends.
B009CGCQPU|5.0|I am a lifelong fan of Pride & Prejudice and I REALLY liked this movie. I feel like the characters were spot on, and I loved the heat and passion between Elizabeth and Darcy. It's definitely worth watching!
1476727651|5.0|Steve King is at his all time best with this novel!  He only gets better and better as a story teller!  Love that guy!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Great game very fun and interesting puzzles. Challenging for your imagination and gets your thoughts going. Try for a hard game time.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|got this for my son for Christmas, i am sure he will love it since he loves monsters inc. i will update more once he gets it to watch
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Brilliant cast and great director. A definite must see for those who appreciate good horror, I wish the American version took better ques from the original.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|These dance movies are great. Story lines are simple, using music and dance for expression and culture. Have to love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Was so glad to see Amazon finally got Candy Crush for the Kindle Fire!!!  Yes I am addicted to this game and now I can play on my Kindle :)  yeah
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The series is well acted and left us in tears. It is so real and yet depicts a world we can hardly imagine existed. It stays true to history yet makes us feel emotions that are relevant to today! Superior work!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am the constant reader Mr. King talks about. I don't love all of his books, but he is by far my favorite author. Dr. Sleep is a welcome resolution to The Shining. I always wondered what happened to Dan and now I know.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|such and cute and funny movie....took the kids to see it in theaters and they wanted more  so christmas gift it is
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|I can't say anything better than what's already been said about this.  If you are a fan of music, a lover of music even, and you love the unpredictability of where an artist can go, there isn't much better than this out there now.  This has to be the most eclectic and enjoyable box set I've ever had the pleasure of purchasing.  Buy it and regret nothing!
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|I just cannot tell you how much I love this book.  This series has me sitting up late at night because I just cannot seem to get enough.<br />I am so madly in love with Jace, I want more of him !<br />Cassandra Claire has woven magic with this series........ I don't want it to end :)
B0026PA05M|3.0|I like Halestorm but their albums really only have a few standout tracks that are worth listening to and most of those songs you can hear on the radio or look up the videos on youtube. I got this digital album when it was featured at a reduced price from amazon music. I doubt I would spend the money it if was not on sale.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Like the game but there are never enough lives to keep playing.  The game seems to be designed so you have to spend money in order to . advance
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Great album. My favorite album of 2013 and in my top 20 of all-time. Have to put in more words to meet quota.
B00474IVGA|4.0|good cd i love soundtracks to movies and this one had all the great songs from the movie. i listen to it all the time
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Great album, was disappointed in the paper/cardboard case that it came in, these tend to easily rip.  Overall great purchase and great price!
B004U8VWIM|4.0|Psychologically thrilling. Natalie Portman is a fantastic actor and was great in this role. I was hooked from the beginning.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Baz Luhrmann's usual formula: an overdose of visual effects and exaggerated acting. It's a quite tiresome movie, since everybody is on amphetamines. Even Gatsby's Duesenberg is overdone, seems like a big Chinese toy made of yellow bright plastic. Elizabeth Debicki is a pleasant surprise, while Isla Fisher is irritating as usual.
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|I don't really hear any difference, so that makes me wonder.  I like the concept, I'm just not sure whether it really delivers.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|We 'll written story, fun to read. Some humor along with the mystery, really enjoyed reading the book. Look forward to her next adventure
B005P5TQPU|5.0|i love this show  i cant get enough.  i watch it like clock work and i even love watching the re-runs
B00FQU8XTE|5.0|I absolutely love the Piano guys! It is my background music, a variety of all their work. It is also what my 1 year old goes to sleep to.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was mailed out quickly and works like the best charger I have ever had.  Amazon customer service was the best.  I recommend this USB Cable.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The Game is really fun and great when it works,  The App will occasionally stop working and it will not go again until You delete it from  Your Kindle and re install it again, then it works good for a few weeks.  Not really sure why, I think it has something to do with the Mobilityware web site?<br /><br />Jerry
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|It is a great checkers game, but it sadly made realize I am a really bad checkers player!  In spite of that, I enjoy playing.
B00132S74A|4.0|Very good but dated story.  Alot of details on how rockets work and what can easily go wrong.  The ending was a little to obvious/unlikely
0062225790|3.0|I believe I have read everything book written by Dawkins and like Dawkins very much. This, however I could have lived with out. I found it to be quite boring. By midway I was so tired of childish English Private School songs and nicknames that I couldn't wait to get to the interesting stuff...which never arrived. I was most interested in confirming his accounts of life in Kenya and childhood friends that went on to illustrious careers themselves, relationships that were previously mentioned by Dawkins as having taken place at the base on Ngong Hills. But scant little was mentioned there.<br />His early career was discussed and relationships developed at Oxford and some accounts of the origins of The Selfish Gene and then I fell asleep.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|Fun movie good for kids and families great for siblings and older brothers and sisters ball three movies are good
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|For being free, it's cool. I'd rather pay for Bejeweled. This game is fun though and I've been playing a lot lately.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game lives up to its reputation.  Fun, challenging, addictive.  I go nuts when I run out of &#34;lives&#34;!  Good for all ages.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Although it is a simple concept because of the quests it can be challenging. I enjoy playing the game immensely.
B002MFULQO|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  The argument on the conspiricy theories will continue until the end of time but this is a very excellent interpretation of Jim Garrison's investigation and the trial of Clay Shaw.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started playing the game, could be my new go to game when I have free time. Will see after a day of playing
B0067RQYNW|4.0|My rating is based on limited knowledge of how to use the program efficiently.  It is just better than the other word processors that I have downloaded to my tablet.  I like the scrolling work bar across the top and the ability to email documents from my tablet to my desktop where I can print or save docs.  I have not figured out how to get a list view of my docs instead of a scrolling set of full page pictures of my docs.  Used primarily for note taking and summarizing points of interest in lecture meetings and  planning meetings.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most addictive game I have ever played. It is very challenging but fun at the same time. Even my 7 yr old daughter loves to play it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|'The Good Wife' features sympathetic characters, interesting stories, and a compelling long-term plot.  It is also the most enjoyable courtroom drama I have seen since 'The Practice.'
0761119752|5.0|When I read this book to little kids and read with lots of enthusiasm, they always like it.  I gave it to some young children and read it once to them.  Their mother said that they wanted it read to them every night for at least a week afterward.  I read it to my grandson several nights ago, and he said &#34;read it again, Grandma&#34;.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|A great movie and a great watch.  Tom Hanks does an amazing job portraying a mentally challenged man with a lifetime of events that he has faced.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great series, one of the best sherlock versions ever, very smartly written.<br />Definitely looking forward to season 3, Big cliffhanger!
B00G32TD98|4.0|This was a good movie, based on a true story.  For scary movies, this one had a story that a lot of them don't have;  I liked the end where it showed pictures of the people the film is based on.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As with all of Grisham's novels, they are all well developed and keep your attention until the end.  The Racketeer is no exception.
B00CU0UE0E|3.0|A decent album if you don't listen to a billion albums already. It has an 80s pop synth sound to it. This band kind of fits into the pop rock sound in the last few years, bands like Modest Mouse, MGMT, The Killers, Fun, Keane, France Ferdinand and more. There's really nothing too extremely new or innovative about this album. Just fun mediocre pop rock. If you listen to other rock scenes like classic rock, 80s rock, hard rock, grunge, metal,or experimental art rock you might not find anything new or interesting about this album. All the new indie sounding stuff is just soooo worn out and tired. But if you're a teenager who's never really been exposed to hundreds of albums you may love this cd!
B00EKHE1JA|4.0|In my opinion the design of the model is more fragile than \\"Gipsy Danger\\" figure. Like the GP, the hands of \\"Striker Eureka\\" aren't open as displayed on the sale pictures. If you thought the fingers had their own joints as I did you're wrong. They're actually molded as closed fists. I think that should be provided a photo of the original model so that the buyer get a better idea of what actually is. It is certainly an excellent artistic approach to Pacific Rim \\"Striker Eureka\\".
0307387178|4.0|Short book, interesting story, well written but with some tangential rambling. Worth reading. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys nonfiction.
B00A2IUHM6|2.0|I like Seth McFarland and Mark Wahlberg, but this was a hackneyed concept even for the &#34;Family Guy&#34; creator. Definitely not worth ten bucks!
006117758X|5.0|Not all will like this book. Not many will understand it or the man who wrote it. Others will be repulsed by it and still others will wonder why it was even published.<br /><br />But all who read it will read it quickly, for it is that kind of a novel--compelling, like a magnet drawing you in, you lose a sense of time as you devour the words, coming out the end wondering where you are and where the time has gone.<br />And--all who read it will never forget, for it is that kind of a novel too--the words hammer their message into the surface of your brain like metal stamps, embossing a permanent melancholy sentiment of lonlinees, hopelessness and despair one can never shake.<br /><br />Bukowski, like us all, was a product of his upbringing, his environment, the historical times and his physical and mental makeup--circumstances that trap us all in their web and dictate how we will feel and what becomes of us.<br />Bukowskis' unfortunate and tangled web turned him into a recluse--afraid and ashamed to emerge from his room as a child and even more so as an adult where he lived vociferously consuming cigarettes, alcohol and occasional human beings who tried to reach out to him for one reason or another. He lived in rat holes with pealing paint, dangling light bulbs, an old typewriter and little else--because thats how he felt most comfortable--and it helped to reenforce, to accentuate, the envionment and mood needed to write his dark stories.<br /><br />Bukowski didn't give a damn about anyone or anything---non-discriminatory, he hated everything equally.<br />He published his first story from a dark, dank basement room in 1944, the year I was born. Thirty years later, I'd grown up, attained a mind and a conscience and was involved in the anti-war movement in Los Angeles. Bukowski was still working out of a dark, dank basement--churning out a weekly column for the LA Free Press called \\"Notes of a Dirty Old Man\\". I didn't understand him then--dismissing him as just another profane and empty sensationalist.<br /><br />Twenty years on I was in the midst of a career--now working for the military-industrial complex--working for everything I despised on one hand while roiling against it on the other. Bukowski was still in that dark, dank basement hammering out his rants like a madman--and now I understood him! It took me nearly fifty years--but now I finally understood him--and now I was almost like him.<br /><br />Read \\"Ham and Rye\\" --understand how Bukowski got to where he was and why he stayed there--until the end--in 1994 --at the age of 74. That he he made it that long--suffered that long, before giving in-- was testament to<br />his degree of inner-rage, his defiance and resistance to all he despised.<br />Perhaps, if you live long enough you will one day get there too--to where he was--his entire life.<br /><br />DH Koester--\\"And There I Was\\"profane and empty sensationalist.<br /><br />Twenty years on I was in the midst of a career--now working for the military-industrial complex--working for everything I despised on one hand while roiling against it on the other.

B004GYY714|5.0|Not bad of a selection. I would think that each person should try one one before playind or using. The price and shippinf cost were ok and the product could not be found off line.
0307730700|5.0|When I started reading the book Fearless by Eric Blehm, I really thought I knew what kind of a book it would be. I'm married to a Captain in the US Army (retired) after all, so I would have to be deaf to have not heard the tale of Navy SEAL Team Six and the mission in Afghanistan that went so terribly wrong. But I wasn't at all prepared for how hard it was to read this book. Not just hard to read near the end, when Adam Brown faces the enemy and gives his life. It was hard to read about Adam's childhood, his rough and tumble teenage years, his addictions. And it was hard to see how much his wife loved him, supported him, stood by him, helped him \\"grow up\\" in his walk with the Lord...all the while knowing what the later chapter of Fearless would bring.<br /><br />Fearless is a great book to read if you don't have much of an idea of who soldiers often are at their core, where they came from, why the military is such a good fit for many men...and it also provides insight into the life of the military family. It is raw and honest and painful...and true. True does not mean sugar-coated. Don't think this is a book you can read and not be moved. It is a book you read because you know you need to be moved.<br /><br />On my \\"Page Turner Scale\\" of 1 to 5, I gave this book a 4. Not because it isn't worth a 5 (I've given it a 5-star rating in my review @ amazon) but because it should come with some caution to those who don't take seriously the sacrifices our military have made and continue to make. Don't read it just to say you've read it. Read it because you care.
0385333846|1.0|We did not get what is shown in the picture. The older edition which is probably boxed for many days (smell) was shipped to us.  Definitely not happy with what I got. I will be very careful in buying used books in future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a lot of fun and very habit forming.  You just want to keep going.  I don't like waiting for more lives though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Nothing to add to the other reviews except to say yes...love it. Works great on my 2nd gen kindle fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What can I say? If you've already read the first one then you have to read the second, no buts about it! Absolutely love the series! Though by halfway through the book I can pick up on the author's writing style, I still wanted more. She has a predictable way of throwing sudden surprises at you at the end of each chapter, but that only made finishing each chapter more satisfying and harder to put down.
B0072NWJRK|2.0|I was hoping to read a historical novel -- this read more like a compilation of new articles.  Very dry and not colorful at all.
B009HEMTXG|5.0|Sweet, light-hearted, altogether charming.  I have watched it many times, and my kids (4 and 7) liked it, too.  James McAvoy is scruffy, intense and grand as always.  Christina Ricci is a great Penelope, and the two are surrounded by an exceptional cast of comedic actors.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's great I love waking up to it every morning it's just great love it so much. I am so happy I decided to buy it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|easy to use and works very very well.  It is a nice way to bring my Netflix to my tv without having to purchase a new dvd player, xbox etc.  Many friends have seen this at my house and have purchased it.  Has allowed me to get rid of cable and not miss it.
B005ES1232|4.0|If you like crocks and know what they are you will love this one.  Comfy fit with good long lasting quality.  4 stsars only because i find crocks in general a bit pricy.  I wear it form the beach to the boat on the bike and out to dinner lol  love it..
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|Honestly, this isn't the typical genre that I would read, but I stepped outside of the box and took a chance and have no regrets! From the very beginning of the Luna Series, Okill yanks you into the story and immediately grabs your attention with vivid details. Okill's words paints a clear visual that almost puts you inside the book in 3-D. His writing style is poetic and at times reads like a prose. The level of intensity that Okill creates is what makes it a page-turner. I was terrified, but the suspense and curiosity kept me going. Warning to PG readers- this is a violent horror story with somewhat of a romantic overtone. I gave it five stars because Okill wrote this story so well that it didn't deserve anything less. For fans of horror, vampires, and monstrous evil villans that captures the innocent as its prey, you will love this book. Thanks Simon for scary the heck out of me and actually making me enjoy it!
B00FEJHPRI|5.0|Excellent storytelling, graphics, adventure, and animation! The story line is much more intense than Iron Man 2. Great movie all the way around and clean for the entire family.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Quite why the BBC decided to bury this brilliantly, innovative piece of Canadian drama, on the infantile network that was BBC3, and failed to promote it at all, in any way, shape or form, whilst simultaneously broadasting it only in Standard Definition (rather than in High Definition), I will never fathom or forgive them for. (HD will come to BBC3 sometime early in 2014, where I hope this show will be repeated in proper HD, where I'm certain it will look even better stil.)<br /><br />But for those of us who discovered it in time for Episode 1, were met with the best piece of TV I've seen in the entireity of this year! (And that includes shows like THE NEWSROOM, GAME OF THRONES, and HOMELAND!)<br /><br />The show follows a young woman, who arrives in Canada, only to witness the apparent suicide of a woman, who closely resembles herself. With no one around, the young woman steals her purse and handbag, and proceeds to start a new life, under the guise of the dead woman's name. What she isn't aware of, is just how wrong this decision will be, and how much of a problem this one decision will now affect her.<br /><br />I can't say much more than this, as I don't want to spoil it for others. I only need to say that once you hear what the major plot-twist reveal is, at the very end of Episode 2, you will firmly be on the edge of your seat, as it's truly one of the biggest and most shocking reveals I've ever witnessed on TV. Ever! (So please do not go reading other reviews for this excellent show, as once you know the twist, it really will ruin part of the greatness of this show!)<br /><br />Simply put, Tatiana Maslany is jaw-dropping in her role. Again, I can't say more, because the spoiler is of such a big manitude, that to say more robs you of the major point for watching this show. The fact that this is a Canadian drama, financed by BBC America, with a set of British, American and Canadian cast members is a testamount to how multi-faceted the show is. Yes, the cast's accents are ropey at times, but if you can forgive this one single issue, you will be rewarded with probably the finest TV show of the year, and certainly one of the best shows ever.<br /><br />This is science-fiction, but it's not spaceships and aliens. The emphasis here, is most definitely on the \\"science\\" part, and with a couple of memorable guest actors appearing in the final half of the Season - again, no spoilers here, as they're worth the wait of their respective shock appearances, this show is truly worthy of your time.<br /><br />Not since Season 1 of HOMELAND or Season 1 of THE NEWSROOM have I seen a show, so completely compelling, well-written, and incredibly shocking, as I have with ORPHAN BLACK. This has consistantly been a really high-concept, riveting piece of TV, that more than deserves to become bigger than the niche, cult show it currently is!<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to access this show NOW! What you will end-up with is 10 truly amazing episodes of TV, and I for one, cannot wait until Season 2 gets broadcast next year - hopefully in HD and on BBC2, where it truly deserves to be shown.<br /><br />P.S. Why the Beeb is making UK fans wait almost 8 months for this show to arrive onto DVD and Blu-Ray, is another embarrassingly stupid decision. If you can, import the US release, which is already available now, and see what you've been missing!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Starts off right where season one ended.  A great spin on an old classic, and they did a great job bringing Sherlock Holmes into the 21st century.
B00CPLGGXM|4.0|This is AMD's best A10 chip and it was a reasonable price.  I really wanted to go with an AM3+ chip (quad, six, or eight core) but there weren't any micro ATX boards for it, so I went with the FM2 board and this chip.  It runs very cool and seems to be a solid performer for what I do (Star Craft II and some photo editing).  I used a separate video card, an XFX AMD Radeon HD 7750 1GB GDDR5 DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort PCI-Express so I could insure better video.  I'm happy with my choice and the $200 for the chip and motherboard.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|The Pacific Rim was like watching the Transformers, Godzilla, and the Three Stooges in one movie except the original once we're much better. I gave Pacific Rim three stars because for the neat machines and it is kind of fun to watch.
1616550414|5.0|A solid well made book with everything you ever wanted about Link, Zelda and Hyrule.  Recommended for fans.  Made a fantastic gift for the husband.
B000NMY7CM|4.0|I watched this movie for a school assignment. It was good and held my attention. Sandra Bullock portrayed a substance abuser very well in this movie.
0385743564|5.0|This book was awesome. It kept you constantly wanting to read more. I never wanted to put the book down, which is pretty rare for me. It was fun trying to figure out what Steelheart's weakness was throughout the book as Sanderson revealed more and more clues. I actually figured it out. My wife got it wrong though, so he didn't make it obvious. The only thing I didn't like is that it reminded me too much of Superman in any of DC's universes where he is a villain. But regardless, it's an awesome book and definitely worth your time to read. One of Sanderson's best in my opinion.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|A nice addition to the Alien world and a look at the corporation before it got alien tech crazy.  I'll admit I wasn't too sure of this one at first, but it is a good addition to my shelf and I'm glad I got it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I really loved this book! Being a lover of the bachelor and hunger games, could there even be a better book for me? I highly recommend this no matter what your interests, I couldn't stop reading this series and finished the first 2 books in 3 days! The only bad thing I have to say is I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE LAST BOOK TO COME OUT, 7 months is too long!
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|The plot was stupid and the dialog worse than stupid. Agents running around in Russia freeing dissidents and in the middle of the mission daddy shows up. Then daddy screws the mission and puts team lives at stake but nobody bothers to shoot McClain:).
B003B02PFO|5.0|Very funny!  This is one you can't put down!  I would recommend it to anyone looking to get in the Christmas spirit!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I'm a big fan of the blog and have really enjoyed the book. I laughed out loud repeatedly and once so hard I cried.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Best action movie at the time of release. Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors. Be sure to get Taken 2 as well.
B004132I20|5.0|What a start!  Wasn't too sure but took a gamble and fell in love with this one.  Great choices for the cast and the writing and acting are excellent.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|Couldn't bare it. Had to stop before irretrievably losing any more IQ points. Unbelievably idiotic writing. I want my 6 minutes back.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Love this music, it's fun and easy to dance to plus it's great music for listening and lightening up the mood! It is also a little different sounding, I love his accent when he explains why he wrote these songs.
B003VANOFY|5.0|We got these headsets for taking online classes. They sound great and are comfortable to wear for a nine hour a day class. Love them.
B001O7JHJ8|4.0|A good collection of Erasure's work and reasonable good remaster.  While I may be more familiar with their older work, the newer continues to be unmistakably Erasure, which I think is a very good thing.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app is pretty good. Few things I would like to say: I don't like the ads. Nor the sometimes slow loading and I have to remove this from device multiple times. Other than that good app.
B003U4UOP4|4.0|i'm not crazy about the new characters introduced (the scientists) and the time allotted to Desmond, or the time-shifting, but I still love the Oceanic 6!
020530902X|5.0|This book is a must have for any new author.  The biggest problem most of us face when we put our manuscript together is SPAG (spelling,punctuation and grammar)  This book makes easy examples and will improve any new authors writing. I would highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|soooo much fun to play, I'm always suggesting it to people to play! easy, and fun for all ages to play

B003VS0CWO|5.0|You're one of three types of persons:  (1) never seen Rocky Horror, (2) love Rocky Horror, or (3) hate/don't &#34;get&#34; Rocky Horror.<br /><br />Clearly this 35th anniversary Blu-ray disc is for you Type 2 folks.  Type 1 folks should consider it over the less-expensive DVD version.  Type 3 folks should just buzz off and stop bothering the rest of us.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version cannot fix all the technical limitations from the original film, but at least now you CAN see all those limitations in high definition!  Yes, it's more expensive than the DVD, but in this day of HD televisions you may as well get on board and see this movie the way it should be seen.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a great book! I love this series I can't get enough of this book. I will for sure be reading every book until this series ends
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Fun for all ages. Love the new challenges that come with every new level. Get further by connecting to Facebook and playing with friends
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is Candy Crush Sage.  Enough said!  I could plan this game for hours each day.  Good thing they only give you 5 lives at a time.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Because I have an ipod,  a Kindle, ipad & my Galaxy and you have to start over on every device like you don't put in enough time getting to where your at. Not fair. Love the game hate starting over and over. Fix it.
0316322407|5.0|This book is very inspirational and educational. I had to keep reminding myself that the author is only 16. Malala is wise beyond her years and a truly wonderful writer. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a great way to end the series. Nothing like I suspected at all. Full of surprises and suspense. Well worth the wait for this amazing finale in the divergent series.
0385351399|5.0|Well written, engaging, a very relevant today's world of social media.  I am sure this will be a movie soon,
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Cast, attention to detail, story line, ability of each actor completely immerses you in the family and their employees. This is a very well written/adapted, exceptionally produced show.  Can't wait for season 4.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Wasn't that intuitive for me. Is taking me a while to figure out what I am doing wrong.  Not sure if I will keep it.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Totally enthralled with this TV series on a very real life style. Only people who have walked in their shoes would know real vs fiction with in each episode. The dynamics of this show are exciting, emotional & captivatingly suspensful leaving you anxiously waiting for more!
B0000TAZYW|5.0|If you are in mood for love and need the expressions of an artist of exquisite taste then purchase<br />this disk. The overall feeling is one of low lights, a bit of wine, scents of musk and living one<br />moment at a time with the one you adore. Yes, all this before you had children.<br /><br />This album was my introduction to Diana Krall. I was overwhelmed by her melodic phrasing on the<br />piano and her vocals. She successfully seduced me as she sang her way through my heart by way<br />of these classic songs. She used a trio and a quartet plus some strings, on a few, to help coax<br />those wary feelings from my heart. Wow.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see her just after this release, playing with her trio, in a relatively small<br />venue. Terrific show and with the same tasteful presentation. She preformed the most of this album<br />as well as others. I was so sorry to have missed her opening for Tony Bennett months later. Ah<br />regrets.<br /><br />One can pick just about any song and write a tribute to her presentation; her musical finesse. Well,<br />except \\"Popsicle Toes\\". Never liked that song and unfortunately Ms. Krall did her best and I find it<br />the weakest cut on a highly consistent  and delightful album.<br /><br />The DVD-A disc is allegedly playable on most DVD players. The Sound Options: Advanced Resolution<br />Surround Sound (96hkz/24bit), Stereo(96khz/24 bit), or Dolby Digital Surround Sound; all depending<br />upon the type of DVD player you own.<br /><br />The DVD-A version includes a \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance\\" Music Video. This song is one of the<br />most atmospheric and intimate pieces of music I have chanced upon in a long, long  time. Nuance and<br />understatement make this piece stand out and  make you fall in love with love again. Delightful and<br />soft as it wafts to your ears, around your brain and into your heart. She whispers oh-so-sweet<br />nothings and you feel the warmth of her breath and you shake to your toes.<br /><br />Whether you buy the standard release, or the DVD-A, you will love these songs and fall in love again.<br />The production and mastering of the original stereo CD is superb, but listening to the DVD-A disk is<br />like letting Ms. Krall perform in your living room. And I would not even ask for an autograph.toes.<br /><br />Whether you buy the standard release, or the DVD-A, you will love these songs and fall in love again.<br />The production and mastering of the original stereo CD is superb, but listening to the DVD-A disk is<br />like letting Ms. Krall perform in your living room.

B007ZGBZHE|4.0|If you buy into the long standing story line of Pendergast and his cohorts, this series is a good diversion that is eccentric and sometimes surprisingly good.  Preston and Child write best when they write together, as in this series.  However, if you aren't game for deliberately stilted language from the main characters or flights into the supernatural, this might not be the series for you.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This is truly an exquisite album.  Her beautiful voice is clear, sometimes soft, sometimes powerful, and the orchestrational arrangements, like adding bagpipes to Little Drummer Boy, transform even the Christmas Classics into something special.  Some of the arrangements have a very nostalgic quality to them, reminiscent of the 40's.  The duet with Johnny Mathis is wonderful and it's a song that's not on every other Christmas CD, plus there's also several songs that are new to me and I loved them instantly.  You can't go wrong with this album, it's a cozy, comforting CD that conveys the true spirit of Christmas and I think it'll be one of my favorites for years to come.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|I ordered this app. It was a waste of money and I promptly deleted it. It slowed gmail loading beyond an acceptable level. In addition it was usable only in a horizontal format.
B00E6F154A|5.0|What can I say as a 30 year long fan? Bryan is mixed front and center in the 5.1 mix. He may be older and the voice doesn't have the range from years ago, but it's his character that continues to please. Some singers don't age so well. He is working it quite well with his vocal range. Compared to the Roxy Music Apollo concert from 2002 it is a bit more subdued affair but great for evening / wintertime viewing in my opinion. It's nice to see a lot of his more recent work here too. At this point why release a greatest hits video again.  It's much more interesting to include music that shows \\"where he's at\\" at the time of the concert, rather than rehashing everything older. I can safely say if you are a fan, you will enjoy this.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|After watching Game of Thrones on H B O, it was delicious to immerse in the richness of the book, using the visual from the series. Addictive a n d amazing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I have no words to describe how amazing this book was. It really built up my emotions. Changed my life. I am speechless.
B009HNDSL4|5.0|The writing is amazing.  I literally cried from laughter during the final minutes of &#34;Fulgencio&#34;.  AWESOME satire of the Godfather.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This game I have played before, but not like this I love this kindle fire awesome sound and awesome sound
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Resistance - I've certainly experienced it, but didn't quite understand what it was. Now, when &#34;Resistance&#34; shows itself I immediately recognize it.
0385537131|5.0|It's perhaps unfortunate for John Grisham that a sizable number of his fans consider his debut novel, A Time to Kill, to be his best.  For his ego it might mean that people think that he hasn't gotten better.  For me, and I vacillate on whether ATTK is his best or not (it alternates with Runaway Jury and The Last Juror), the characters of Clanton are what do it for me.  I love it when he returns to that locale (hence my affection for Last Juror), and I was delighted to see Jake Brigance come back.<br /><br />The Grisham plan right now is very well known.  The underdog lawyer taking on the case for the poor person (sometimes black, sometimes white), against the large firm.  All the odds are against him, but he somehow pulls through with either a win, or a draw that shouldn't have been even that much.<br /><br />That's not the case here, not really.  Jake is tasked with executing the last will of a rich businessman from Ford County that hates his family, and wants his millions given mostly to his black housekeeper, Lettie Lang.  Needless to say, the family is not pleased with this, as it shuts them out, so they sue.  Jake's task is to defend the will, not the beneficiary, though he ultimately has to wind up doing both.  Lettie Lang is the usual sainted black person that exists in Grisham lore, shades of Miss Callie from last Juror, but she's sympathetic without being too unreal a person.<br /><br />Sycamore Row (a title that is explained in the story), takes place just a few years after the events of ATTK, and many, though not all, of the familiar characters are back.  Harry Rex Vonner is the prime supporting player that returns, as he continues his role as Grisham's most re-used character, and every time I read him (I love Harry Rex), I wonder what Joel Schumacher was thinking when he cast Oliver Platt.  He and Lucien Wilbanks are the \\"wise\\" heads that advise Jake, and it's interesting to see how he responds to them, it's not the same dynamic as the first time.<br /><br />It's hard to talk about the negative characters, most of whom you really can't call villains per se, without giving away more of the plot.  All I'll say is that their motives are justified for the most part, and while you don't really feel for the disinherited family members......you do see where they're coming from.<br /><br />This is, for all intents and purposes, John's first direct sequel, and I'm wondering now why he waited so long.  The novel moves really well, never gets bogged down in too much unnecessary detail, and has Clanton, Mississippi and its setting and people.  I loved it.<br /><br />Five stars.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Another awesome release from the Priest!! All JP video releases are very good, with the exception of the 1986 Turbo tour.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book. Hard to put down. Would recommend to all my friends. Can't wait to read more by this author.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|This thing came from China and took so long I forgot I ordered it (middle of September - end of October.) Was fiddling with it to get the hang of using it and - IT BROKE. And it does not fit my iPhone 4 with it's cover. Oh well. live and learn.
B002ISID10|5.0|I've always loved this album but I really wanted a legit hard copy of it just to have for my collection
B002RVZV9U|4.0|I watched this documentary at a friend's hose, and found it to be quite intriguing; furthermore, the technical proficiency of these three artists is outstanding. i have a meager theater setup at my home, so I bought this as a gift for someone with a more professional setting. They informed me recently that they blew a speaker whilst rocking out as loud as possible to this awesome production.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of game. It works very well for me.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a fabulous film. Hayao Miyazaki is a wonderful film maker who makes empowering films for everyone. This is the most violent of his films, but it is still a fabulous film.
1451666179|5.0|This book is really really funny.  I was impressed with the amount of additional (hilarious) content.  If you think about it, Allie Brosh has probably generated the most numerous and enduring memes on the internet;  ALL THE THINGS, pain scale, Alot, spagetta nahdle!  I buy a book once every ten years, and I can say without a doubt, that I'm glad this was my choice for 2010-2020.  If you think you know funny, you are so wrong it makes philosophers weep, you don't know funny until you've read this book!
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is a great one it has action, adventure, and romance this series is awesome and this book is definitely the best one yet!!!!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|It was a perfect ending to such a thrilling ride.  I wish their story would continue...read the whole series!!!  It's so entertaining!
B00607EWYC|2.0|This book was WAY too descriptive. Every move this person made was described in details that didn't matter and it went on and on and on. A majority of the book described how to fix clocks. I mean entire chapters were devoted to how to fix clocks. I did a lot of skimming so needless to say I finished it quickly.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I love this cd, I heard one of the slower songs on Letterman, bought it the next day. I was hoping for more slower songs but there's more club type songs. They have grown on me though because of Cher's voice, which has only gotten better with time. &#34;Do you believe in love&#34; will always be her best club burner but this cd has some good solid bangers. If you like Cher buy it, if not buy Miley's &#34;Bangerz&#34; Deluxe Edition, it's hot.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Entertaining and heart warming.  Has a great story line and funny.  Had a green message about saving the whales.  I enjoyed watching the movie.
0783230079|5.0|One of my favorites movies. You cant go wrong! Shipped on time and the quality of the movie was good...for the 90s of course.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game. I love it more and more every time I play it. I play this more than I play anything. I got my mom,brother,and nephew playing this game. It gets addictive, I really believe that. So I hope this shows how much I love this game!!!!!!!!!!
B009LDD22U|5.0|Probably one of the funniest shows around.  I've picked up the discs for every season because it's a show I can watch over and over again.
B000VKJ6VS|2.0|This cd is better than the newest one but still only half as good as the worst &#34;Slipknot&#34;, &#34;High On Fire&#34; or even &#34;Halestorm&#34;. Save your money, listen to  and buy the singles you like instead.
B00AYB16EO|3.0|The photography and sound were well done but it was a little stupid.  This is how the movie was supposed to be done but I couldn't finish watching the movie.
B0091TGWYE|3.0|Snugg sent me this case for review, and I really wanted to use it, because it's beautiful, with gorgeous suede leather and fine stitching, and because it has a slot to carry a driver's license and maybe a credit card, so that I can leave my wallet at home. And because I really like to carry my phone in a pouch case - they're smaller and they offer good protection all around. But....<br /><br />The problem with this Snugg case is that it's just too snugg. I had to push hard to get my iPhone 5s into the case, and getting it out was nearly impossible. I worked with it for an hour or so, hoping that the leather would stretch so as to make the case usable, but it never happened. Other reviewers have said that their cases fit perfectly, so I may just have gotten a bad sample, but as it is, I can't recommend it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app. I can download my youtube videos and then watch them whenever I want to. Even if I don't have wifi I can still watch myvideos !
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This product was promptly delivered, nicely packaged and the setup was a whiz. The provision of a power cord to power the adapter is a good idea as many older HDTVs lack a USB port. But this product falls way short of my expectations. For instance this does not allow one to chrome cast any content on your laptop or iphone/ipad, but only those apps that are supported by chromecast or Chrome browser.  For instance I cannot just play any video or image or music file and expect to have the same broadcast to my big screen TV. In short this is not an application that would let you broadcast any local file from your sources (ipad/iphone/desktop/laptop) unless you figure out a way to have the same opened within Google Chrome(need to download Google cast extension) or is one of the 6-8 supported and/or Google-owned apps like YouTube etc.<br /><br />Bottomline: This is a waste of money as I can pretty much access all of the current supported content using either Roku box, or Wii or PS3 consoles or my TV net options(why pay another $35 to get something that only does what you already have...?)<br />Did not do my research enough and made an impulsive buy as the cost is pretty low, but very disappointed with this joke. I was expecting to see an APP that would let me broadcast any file (live or stored from my source systems to the big screen, but we are not there yet..)  Still toying with the idea of going through the hassle of returning the same or writing off this $35 to Google Inc
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I am a star trex fan.  I loved this movie especially in 3D. It's also great I n 2D an blue ray.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Not a bad movie worth a watch but nothing special. Not something I would really care to watch multiple times.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Nothing special about this movie's take on zombies.  Newark scenes were way to dark and jarring to give you any visual idea of what was going on.  The scenes in Israel were better, especially the zombie ant hill to breach the wall, but all that was already given away in the trailer.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|good game fun and addicting. few things I would change but over all its a fun game to kill time
B00BGI086Q|5.0|&#34;Arrow&#34; is a Nolan-esque retelling of the Green Arrow storyline from DC Comics. Like Batman, the Green Arrow begins as a billionaire who is trained to be a master in numerous archaic combat styles. In this retelling, playboy billionaire heir Oliver Queen is shipwrecked on the Island of Lian Yu, where China sends its political prisoners (primarily their own people). Oliver meets Yao Fei, his first mentor, who gives him the tools of basic survival before they are forced to part ways and Oliver finds a new pair of mentors in ruthless Australian Strategic INformation Service agent Slade Wilson and Yao Fei's daughter, Shado. Forced to become more than what he was, Oliver works with Slade and Shado to thwart the efforts of a mysterious entity.<br /><br />In present day Starling City (based on DC COmics' Star City), Oliver Queen returns home after five years on the Island, changed from the playboy he was. To his friends and family, he appears to be as shallow and callous as he always was. But to the city's white collar criminals, and later its more vicious felons, he is the one-man show in justice. Acting as Judge, Jury, and Sentencer (as he doesn't 'always' kill his targets), Oliver is quickly given a handful of nicknames, including the most common one of &#34;The Hood&#34; due to his penchant for going after 'millionaire bottom-feeders', as quoted from Detective Quentin Lance, an adversarial for Oliver in both his public face and in his work as the Hood.<br /><br />Oliver soon learns that the List he works from is not the work of his father, Robert, as he had thought for five long years but the work of a mysterious, menacing figure who sends the deadly Dark Archer to draw him out. Oliver is soundly beaten, and his confidence shattered, but he vows to bring down the other archer and whoever he works for.<br /><br />In his time as the Starling City vigilante, Oliver gains allies in the form of his bodyguard, John Diggle, and Queen Consolidated IT prodigy Felicity Smoak. Diggle and Oliver have a solid bromance going, with Diggle arguing with himself, and with Oliver, on the merits of vigilantism over leaving the apprehension and prosecution of criminals to the police.<br /><br />Oliver's relationships as just Oliver Queen suffer, as his sister Thea feels she is closer to him when he was dead than she is now that he has returned. His ex-girlfriend Laurel drifts between hating him and fighting her feelings of still loving him. Oliver's worst relationship change comes when his best friend, Tommy Merlyn, learns the truth about Oliver and comes to the decision that his best friend never returned and considers Oliver to be a serial killer.<br /><br />Oliver Queen's greatest trial comes as he learns that the menacing Dark Archer who soundly beat him is his best friend's father (played superbly by John Barrowman of Whovian fame). Working closely with his allies, Oliver attempts to stop the devastating plan of the Dark Archer. Ultimately, he fails due to the diabolical planning of his nemesis, whose poignant words precede the devastation: &#34;If I've learned anything as a successful businessman, its.... redundancy.&#34;<br /><br />The realism of this series, that sometimes the villains do win, and that that is what pushes the hero to greater heights, is what gives this series a five star rating from me. The writers of this series NEVER do what you, the viewer, would expect. The acting is well-done for the most part, with a few minor exceptions which you will discover on your own. Stephen Amell, who heads the cast as Oliver Queen/The Hood portrays a character of great depth as time goes on, and when viewing earlier episodes you find yourself realizing that he was doing a fantastic job of portraying someone who is uncertain how to act in a civilized society after five years of a hellish existence.
B0013UIUBC|3.0|A lightweight romantic comedy.  From a feminist perspective, a little disturbing that this woman had to be so socially dysfunctional in order to be a successful chef.  Especially since her slow return to a more human state caused her to risk losing her professional status.  Far too often the storyline of such a film -- especially when in steps the white knight in a chef's apron to further awaken her and &#34;rescue&#34; this poor lost little lady.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's observations and social epiphanies are thought-provoking and applicable.  His style of writing is exciting, and the fluidity makes all of books and articles such fast reads!  I have been a fan of Gladwell since I read Blink in high school, and he hasn't lost his charisma with this one.  Reading Outliers is inspirational for those who questioned success and ever doubted their &#34;luck&#34; in finding success.  Otherwise, the book puts so many events and facts into new perspectives.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent show.  It is addictive from the very beginning.  Always full of drama, and the actors are excellent.  Without giving anything away, season 3 leaves me waiting in high anticipation for Season 4, which isn't even out in the US yet.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I purchased this mouse after my old one started leaking battery acid, and so far so good. Out of the box it feels a bit light, which is easily fixed with the included weights. The mouse has a nice ergonomic feel and responsive buttons and feels sturdy. I love the braided cord, it feels durable without being too stiff. Delivery was very quick and the software is practically idiot-proof. Like most gaming mice, the Anker is large but it is not bulky; movement and tracking are smooth and the on-the-fly DPI switch is an excellent feature. This mouse fits my hand like a glove, but my girlfriend mentioned that it was rather large for her hands. I should probably note that she is used to using a minuscule portable lap-top mouse, and after I turned the DPI down she loved it. If you are looking for a wired gaming mouse with great performance, that wont leave you broke, then this is the mouse for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|graphics are adorable, and the challenges are often hard, but not too frustrating. As you proceed through the game, you actually feel as if you are learning a new skill. It's also charming to have the game tell you that you are wonderful!

B00197POXG|4.0|I love the set but the quality was not what I expected for something so expensive! Half the disks were glued in their sleeves and I wound up having to pick glue off the edges before I could play the disk. A couple of the disks were scratched as well and some had a film on them that needed cleaned off before they would play.

B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. Some fun little twists and turns (which open a few little plot holes here and there but no more than in any other sci-fi flick in my opinion).<br /><br />I though Cruise did a fine job and the CGI and cinematography were top-notch.<br /><br />Overall, a good rental for an in-home movie night.
1476729085|4.0|... Uptight guy meets unconventional gal ... Take the journey to explore individuals complexities'/incompatibilities, the impact on a relationship when pushed out of their comfort zone. The incompatibilities, managing them and the possibilities is the stuff many a romantic comedy engenders. For me, this is no superficial romp as his \\"issues\\" are similar to those that permeate my family tree. It gives me hope that my sons will find their matches.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was the awesomest book ever (even though awesomest isn't a word) ,I love it everyone else out there should love it too. It's a really great book I love Diary of  a wimpy kid books I  think Jeff Kinney (or whatever his last name is) should make some more because who doesn't love Diary of a wimpy kid I mean if you don't I totally understand but  Jeff Kinney should make more and more books and I will read the other books such as , \\"The ugly truth \\" ,Hard luck,cabin fever,dog days the last straw, and Rodrick rules.

0205313426|5.0|I admired &#34;The Elements of Style&#34; as a fresh, freshman in my first college English course.  My incredibly perceptive professor chose well for us in that advanced class.  The book again served me through my many marginal notes and markings in each addition.  The &#34;pronouncements&#34; regarding writing are as valuable now as they were in the first edition.  For anyone who has doubts about basic writing elements, this is an old, but faithful standard.

B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.<br /><br />It is unlikely anyone who goes to see this film won't have some idea about what it's about.  There have been many fine films about slavery.  And while 2012's &#34;Django Unchained&#34; certainly has violent elements associated with American slavery, that film and others often remind you that it's only a movie.  This movie will draw you in and does so with the unique history of Solomon Northup, an actual freeman who lived a good life in Saratoga, New York.  In 1841, he had a beautiful wife and 2 children (one played by Oscar nominee Quvenshane Wallis).  He was a classical violinist and highly respected in the community.<br /><br />Approached by a pair of &#34;gentlemen&#34; (including a couldn't-believe-my-eyes Taran Killam from &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34;) Solomon (an amazing Chiwetel Ejiofor) is enticed by a financial offer to play a gig in Washington, D. C.  Once there, he is kidnapped, shackled and sent by steamer to New Orleans.  Upon his arrival he is sold as an escaped slave.  During this first act, Solomon must quickly learn how to behave, how to act.  Just to stay alive.  Even talking is frowned upon, so Ejiofor must speak to the audience with his eyes and his expressions to project the torment he is experiencing.  Director Steve McQueen often focuses the camera on faces to bring out the pain of the oppressed as well as the viciousness of the oppressors.  McQueen doesn't shy away from anything so be prepared.<br /><br />Slaves, both men and women, are herded together like cattle.  They are stripped, hosed down and sold naked.  It is hard to watch.  Even harder, mothers and children are separated.  This is gut-wrenching story telling.  Solomon, now called Platt, must hold it together, keeping his wits so that he can eventually reunite with his family.  Solomon is first sold to Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), a man of some benevolence as slave owners go.  He gives Solomon a violin.  He is relatively kind.  He is portrayed as a man who is uncomfortable with his position but must accept his role as master.  When Ford's cotton crop is infested with disease, he must transfer ownership of some of his slaves and does so to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender in another great performance).<br /><br />Epps is a polar opposite to the meek-mannered Ford.  He is vicious and violently sadistic.  As noted above, McQueen and his photographer bring out the evil in Fassbender's performance.  Epps is not only focused on teaching Solomon a lesson, he always has eyes for a slave known as Patsey (newcomer Lupita Nyong'o).  She is but a wisp of a woman but always picks more cotton than any of the men.  She is regularly raped by Epps, to the point he doesn't even hide it from his wife (Sarah Paulson).  This means that Patsey not only receives harsh treatment from Edwin but from his wife in equal measure.  Solomon does his best to comfort Patsey, but has his own agenda.<br /><br />In one sequence Solomon trusts a white slave (who knew?), under Edwin's control to work off a debt, with the promise to mail a letter back to his family.  The man is paid what few coins Solomon had and upon his release promises to mail the yet to be written letter.  Instead, he rats out Solomon to Epps.  When confronted, a tired Solomon must quickly formulate a lie.  Looking Epps directly in the eye, Solomon without a quiver, delivers a believable story without hesitation.  Remarkable stuff.<br /><br />Remember what I said about &#34;it's only a movie?&#34;  There is one shattering scene where Solomon is forced by Epps to whip the stripped Patsey as punishment for her wandering off to a nearby plantation.  And for a while, as uncomfortable as it is to watch, we only see the pain in Solomon's face as he lashes Patsey.  OK, enough already right?  Instead, McQueen swivels his camera around the tree to see the peeled and scarred back of the woman as the whip tears off her skin.  This is tear-inducing filmmaking on many levels, but this scene induced many gasps from the audience and a couple walk-outs.<br /><br />But McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley want audiences to see the evil and feel the pain in the film.  And boy do they succeed.  I would be remiss if I didn't talk about some of the technical elements of the film.  During some of the difficult scenes rather than averting my eyes, I was able to focus briefly on some of the great photography in the film.  As unusual and contradictory as it may seem, &#34;12 Years&#34; is technically masterful.  The soft glow of the cotton fields, the hazy setting of the sun, the insect spreading its wings, somehow add a respite of civility to this great film of a disgraceful American past.  Look for Oscar nomination for actors Ejiofor, Fassbender and Nyong'o, director McQueen and more.ls, but this scene induced many gasps from the audience and a couple walk-outs.<br /><br />But McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley want audiences to see the evil and feel the pain in the film.

B0051CSIME|5.0|love it i dont know what to really say other than it is a great movie and the whole family likes it.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Terrible movie. The concept was interesting for about a minute. This movie completely lacked a good storyline and the character development...? Just save your money and time. Use your 2 hours and $3.99 to buy a paperback book.... This movie was absolutely aweful.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|True story of a teenage girl who stood up to the Taliban to defend her right to go to school, was shot in the head, and survived to become the activist she is today. Incredible, heart-wrenching account in her own words. This should be required reading in schools everywhere.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train: A Novel tells  the story of two women  -  one at the dawn of adulthood, the other at the end of her life's journey. An unfortunate set of circumstances brings these two characters together, and they learn that their life stories - though set 80+ years apart - are quite similar. Much of the book focuses on Vivian, a nonagenarian who was an &#34;Orphan Train&#34; rider.  We learn of her tragic past and see how she has not only survived it - but, in many ways, thrived.  We also learn about the Orphan Train movement which transported foundling children from the crowded cities of the east to new homes in the midwest.  There is much sadness in the life stories of Vivian and Molly, the teenager, but the book ends on an incredible note of hope and joy as the union of these two women enriches their lives beyond measure.  I find that I particularly enjoy novels which encompass two different eras, as this one does.  The main characters are women I would have loved to have known and I very much enjoyed the hours I spent in their company.

B001NLL8LA|5.0|Absolutely loved it. I have not read a bad Reacher book yet and I am on my 14th one now. Lee Child has written a series that keeps your interest and desire to continue reading until completed. I have yet to read one that is the same as a previous one. The character is the same but the stories are all different and you do not have to read them in any kind of order. I would highly recommend this series if your interest is in this type of subject. Alot of action and a very interesting character.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|holy cow , this movie had a great plot . characters were believable and really cool. the special effects were sick . the body count was a little high . but it was a great movie . i'll probably buy it .this thing was non stop from start to finish , i'm tellin you it had it all, crazy robots, fighting, exotic locations, hot girl, hot guy, cool dog, and the monsters made godzilla look like an octawussy . every summer we get a great movie but it will be hard to top this it was redonkuluss . oh and charlie is the man ,wait till dennis and dee hear bout this....
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Pretty good closed society story with characters I cared about. Some of the technology is implausible. I almost stopped reading when he describes hand held radio signal propagating through water and also through solid rock. But I gave him a pass so I could find out how Juliette got herself out of a pickle.

B0084B5TK8|4.0|Imagine that you are an English solicitor who is traveling to an unknown land in order to facilitate the purchase of land in England. Imagine that you are very naïve and have no idea what you are getting yourself into. That is what happens to Jonathan Harker when he travels to Transylvania to meet with Count Dracula.<br /><br />On the way he is nearly scared senseless by a pack of wolves who terrify the horses to such a degree that they need special attention in order to even reach the crumbling castle in Transylvania where Dracula lives. Jonathan Harker then becomes the prisoner of Dracula and has to remain with him for an entire month. During this time he sees things that really scare him but also make him very curious. As he seeks to uncover various mysteries and tries to escape you feel his desperate longing to be free. Do you feel terror seeping into your soul? I did.<br /><br />Fortunately for Jonathan there are warm fireplaces and a library of books to keep him busy. However one night he falls asleep in a different room of the castle and is nearly killed by three female vampires. The story can at times be sensual but more often than not it is disturbing and horrifying. This is especially true when the wolves attack a woman who has lost her child due to Dracula stealing it. You get the feeling that this is the story of the most evil vampire you've ever read about. Dracula is not a sparkly vampire with good intentions he is evil to the core.<br /><br />Most of the first part of the book is highly suspenseful and intriguing to read. Then the format changes and the story is told in letters, diary entries and newspaper clippings. This makes the book a little more difficult to read and I will admit that I sped through this portion of the book to get to the ending.<br /><br />This book is truly a grim adventure and a very richly told story. You need patience to read this book as it is very, very long. It will take you days to read it. Apparently it took Bram Stoker seven years to research stories of vampires before he wrote this book. So that may explain why this book is so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewseven years to research stories of vampires before he wrote this book.

B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|It was just ok and I did not read all the way through.  Did check the ending and spot read about 3 pages.  Surprising ending, but (for me) not worth reading all the way through.  Sorry.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I agree that the characters seemed to change in this book. I would have preferred stronger, distinct voices for Tris and Tobias. Tris became arrogant and whiny. Four became insecure and wishy washy. They didn't act like themselves. I didn't care about the new characters introduced and I was upset when several characters died. I did not think what was outside the fence lived up to the hype in the other books. Veronica Roth has talent because I really care about the characters from the first two books. My children were asking me why I was crying for about an hour while I read the end of the book. The end was disturbing and sad.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|The film showed originality and innovation. I thought it was well acted.<br />The locations chosen for the filming made it interesting.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The demons from the old Overlook Hotel are child’s play compared to the ones coming in Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />The characters shine in this novel. Danny Torrance has grown up, but his troubled past shoves him toward rock bottom. Whether it is luck, coincidence, or a higher power, he makes his way north and toward his salvation in the form of a little girl name Abra Stone. Abra is an intelligent, hard-headed, and loveable girl. I loved how we watched her grow into her shining abilities. Dan’s friends Billy and Doctor John give him the support he needs to do what he needs to do.<br /><br />Although I typically like to keep the monsters of horror novels more in the dark until it’s time to shine the light on them, King wrote the villains perfectly. The True Knot has their areas of gray. They live. They love. They torture. They murder. They are the villains we know well without really knowing them at all.<br /><br />Some of the beginning seemed a bit slow and unrelated to the ongoing plot, but like a turn of a wheel, the novel had a delightful circularity to it and by a third into the book, I found there was no turning back. King creates an amazingly complex plot to go along with the complex characters. And there are revelations that made me gasp and produced goose bumps along my arms. The ending brought tears to my eyes and was just perfect.<br /><br />Whether you’ve read The Shining or not, I highly recommend Doctor Sleep by Stephen King.

B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Last Update :8/15/14- the wait is over on a sandbox or wave type mode, now with the update there's a area on the map that is wave after wave of different types of enemies, a leader board , I played it once before posting this and u can choose difficulty and I got to wave 32 without ushering any gem stuff yet. U get a lot of coins now on this if u push the next wave before it's due, up in the hundreds. Ill say am so glad this is on here now the map is one of the largest with 3 ports on both sites wit a lot of spots to put different towers, the replay value went up more now! I will say am disappointed that the 500 gems to coins are 800 gems now,,,, it should be lower now since there's this on it, also I think the devs witch are great put the hero's price down too .99 now and fans will get more, I did get the bone Dragon and he's great hero plus can fly over anything. Well read my first review if u need more info about this app, enjoy!!<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />It's out on Amazon finally we all been waiting for kingdon rush frontiers, Like I said on the first one it's a great TD game but what makes this stand out from all others is the personality wit every character you experience. U start your story at the Hammerhold fort that u see on the first games map below the Cinders of Rift area,U chose your hero from the start that over time u can train them up on powers there's 13 hero's so far u can get some which u can buy that are powerful like dragon's all with there own special abilities. Let me just put it this way to sum it all up if u loved the first u will love frontiers even better everything is amp up more point blank. Best TD game I ever played I need say no more GET IT !<br /><br />Edit review: gotten through later levels that's even more great and well thought out,these levels get hard even on casual mode you need to experiment wit different towers in different places to fig out what works best. The tower upgrades are all different from the first one these are so great wit personality like ones that are just like from assassin creed watch is great,I love the last artillery upgrade u get and the magic one allso where u can have a reaper horseman that makes you soldiers walking dead when they die. I won't give to much surprises on everything like the great easter eggs in the game u see and may find that gives u a achievement, I'll give one that was cool that's star wars oriented I won't say anymore to spoil it for anyone. Best TD game ever and on a app in general it's top up there. I still have lots to do on this game and more surprises to come. I seen pics of part 3 all ready let's hope that android and Amazon won't make us wait too long for that. Hope I helped out anyone who read my review,there's lots I don't want to spoil on anyone that haven't played the game yet.<br /><br />Update: the heroes are on cheaper sale price for a certain time now, I got the guy danta that is fast long and short range attack, use silver bullet gun,has holy abilities that take away enemies magic ability plus boost soilders heath around him. Good hero on protected enemies and strong ones cause of his silver bullets are deadly.sonality like ones that are just like from assassin creed watch is great,I love the last artillery upgrade u get and the magic one allso where u can have a reaper horseman that makes you soldiers walking dead when they die.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The saga continues to enamour me with its reflecton on the history and nuances of a time forgotten by many. The fathers and founders of our country faced so many challenges that the glue holding them together had to be strong. Dependance on family and friends was critical to survival and that tie is beautifully woven into a story that charms the reader and causes the examination of current societal conditions.

030726999X|5.0|It's unfortunate that Stieg Larsson didn't get to see all these in print.  Whoever did the translation was an artist as well.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Worst book I've read in a long time.  This could have been an amazing book but I couldn't even get through the whole thing it was do bad!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Had a hard time connecting... still can't figure out what it good for..<br />Where's the &#34;low down&#34; on what thei thing is supposed to be valuable for ?
B000RHLY8I|5.0|Top 5 movies ever! If you like perseverance and determination then you have to watch this movie! He makes his mind up and goes for it all.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King keeps his readers involved in his characters. Always thrilling and suspense filled.<br />Never dull, never boring, and leaves you wanting more,
1781162646|5.0|As an avid Kindle user, it was kind of weird to be flipping actual pages.  That being said, I loved this book.  It was a super quick read, really kept my attention.  S.K.'s skill of character development is definitely present here.  I also really liked the use of present day and flashbacks to tell the story.<br /><br />Stephen King fans will obviously enjoy this book, I also wouldn't hesitate to strongly recommend it to non King fans.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|The stories speak to my core, as a woman, as a human Becoming.  The plots seem simple but the stories are filled with meaning.
0670024813|4.0|This was a pretty ok read.  It was not entirely what i expected but there was still some very interesting content.
B001BANK32|4.0|Excellent. Typical Stephen King. Reread due to the new book Doctor Sleep that came out which was also awesome.  Highly recommended
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It is very well done and very realistic.  Spent one whole weekend watching Season 1!!  I would recommend it highly.
1476747016|5.0|despite being a Kindle-lover... there is something about solid, colored, glossy paper for something like Pusheen.  I have loved the little bouncy animated gif site for some time and was wondering whether a non-moving images book would prove to be as charming.<br /><br />As charming, just different.  It's really an adorable book and an instant mood-lifter.  I totally recommend this as a holiday gift for the kitty-lover in your life!
B00B52F278|4.0|The ending was very good in keeping with the story line. All time favorite Starz programming.  I have the complete DVD set.  Rome was at one time a military power house but extended itself to much.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|If the Part 1 was Great, Part 2 is even better. Has great story telling and it does a great job in capturing The graphic novel into live action again. Highly recommend this to any comic book or action fan! It's better than the Nolan's versions in my opinion. Nolan is steel good.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Saved my butt many times, will triumph over Captain Morgan! Now if you meet a chick. your on your own! Ajax cant help that!
B001NHN7TU|5.0|Can't go wrong with this. Entertaining on a few different levels... it's probably been 25 years or more since you've seen this.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Quickly grows into a game the will challenge your problem solving skills...and besides that...it is just fun! The first few levels teach you the basics...but then there comes a time when you think this can never work...but be persistent, it can!
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie in IMAX, of course I had to order this collectors edition, to bad it does not come with the 3D disc, I will be purchasing the 3D version separately
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Compelling story involving three women who's lives intertwine. Author does a good job of putting you in the place of each of these women.
1885167776|5.0|Precise and to the point! A must read for anyone who has numerous information coming at them all at once! Easy to read, clear to understand and able to execute. Wish I had it when I entered the working world, but..... better late than never! Worth the investment...(in yourself)!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really do love this game!! just wish there were more room on the board.<br />..but love it! Enjoy playing!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It has progressed a little slowly. The character of Christian is a mystery to solve...fun light reading. Cant wait for second book.
1603429999|5.0|I received this book and it is just what this beginning/intermediate knitter needs to answer many quesitons. I don't know how many of the projects I will work on in the future, but they all look like fun!
1451627289|5.0|wonderful return of the stephen king we all know and love.  very interesting concept and strong detail. kept me interested throughout.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy Crush is a great addicting game but I find it so annoying to have to wait 30 minutes for additional lives or pay to buy more lives and not wait. We already pay repeatedly to unlock new levels so why charge for extra lives or make us wait so long tor more lives. As great as the game is,  I feel ripped off every time I pay an additional fee to unlock more levels.  I would rather see one price up front so I know what I'm getting into. Other than the cost, the game is fantastic!
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|I love  love  love  this recording! I think it's one of his best yet!  Great artist selection!  Must have if you love real music...
B004JMY312|5.0|Fun movie great for the little ones not so scary for the four over crowd.  Wonderful rainy halloween afternoon viewing.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Once you say that you want to ask friends on fb for lives you can't change that option.  Should be able to continue game without that.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|Excellent method of mixing personal stories with communication techniques.  Author did not bog the reader down with neuroscience terminology but rather gave clear examples using his experiences to explain why these methods work.  I found the book both entertaining and informative and a must read for improving how to communicate with others around you.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This little figure is pretty amazing and a lot of fun for a longtime fan. It arrived quickly and in good condition. I love the little details and the interchangeable parts!<br /><br />It CAN be a little stiff to change her hands and her paint isn't completely flawless, but these are minor details.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My new samsung S4 did not work completely. I thought of returning it, but my son said he will try to see if he could make it work the way it said. But....oh well...glad the price is not sky high. I actually tried to call Google, but got a recording. Thought they had a good customer service center, but guess not huh.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use my calculator for quick calculation of basic math problems on my Kindle fire. This calculator is easy to read and use and the price is right. I highly recommend this app.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Worthless.  All my TV's can already get YouTube and I don't watch Netflix.  Until they make this &#34;play anything from the web&#34; as advertised it sits in a box.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Is where these books have carried me. High on the wings of imagination and loved every moment. I can't wait to fly again!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Excellent book. Very exciting and educational.  Kept you interested from beginning to end.  Inspirational for anyone that has suffered true loss.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun and very self competitive game. I would definitely recommend this to my friends. It is an enjoining game.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This was a great book and the build up was great.  Characters were portrayed in a real  mind image.  They could. Exist.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Fantastic blu ray collection.  These are films to watch again and again.  VERY well done and entertaining.  Everything about them is first rate from the content to the packaging design.  One of my MUST-HAVEs.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Hooked on the series and love it! My DVD's are awesome!  Very fun and suspenseful series made for TV.  Started watching Summer of 2012 then the Hurricane on eastern coast, early 2013 damaged their set in the Hamptons so they went on sabbatical until July of 2013.  This set is going to catch me up, for the most part then I'll need to do something to catch up from July 26, 2013
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love it! Mandy Patinkin is awesome as are Danes and Lewis. Interesting plot twists and character development. So glad I took everyones advice and started from the beginning.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|It is Orwell's 1984 for our times, not a sci-fi techy tour de force but a look at the psychological implications coming our way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love having on Kindle. Waited for long time to get this. Wish some of the levels were not so hard.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|more than meets the eye - great study of personalities and communications, not to mention emotions and loss. Characters painted in depth.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|This worked exactly as expected. Paired with my old Bose dock that I havent used since I got an iPhone 5S, bluetooth paired quickly and easily. Would buy again.
B008LXZFH6|4.0|Good for some silly comedy and laughs - classic Will Ferrell.  The &#34;Afternoon Delight&#34; song is one of my favorites!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I enjoyed this series because it kept me interested and I found myself always watching one more episode. It also helps that the script is witty.
0307743721|5.0|It is perhaps superflous to write about a writer so many people have so much to say about. This book too perhaps Alice Munro's last with its final four autobiographical stories has already been much written about. If the reader is a Munro fan it is of course a must.<br />So I think any evaluation I might make of the stories is irrelevant.<br />What I will try to do instead here is understand myself some of the special qualities of Alice Munro's writing and why it is  so appealing to so many.<br />One quality is clearly the storytelling, and suspense. I notice that when I read her stories I become intensely curious about what will happen next.<br />Secondly, there is a kind of simple matter- of- fact description of  peoples' lives and situation. There is a modesty and simplicity in the language that also greatly appeals.<br />A third element is here dealing with 'ordinary people' and people who somehow are ignored in much story- telling. I think she shares something here with Raymond Carver as so many of their characters are people at a loss, whose lives are disordered.<br />A fourth element is the stories are filled with Surprise, sudden unanticipated changes in the story. It is hard to know where they are going and the sudden turns waken the reader.<br />A fifth element is a kind of harsh realism, a bleakness and desolation. This connects too with something I do not particularly like to read about, the violence and cruelty which so frequently appear in what characters do to one another.<br />She comes from cold country and there is a lot of emotional coldness in her stories. There is too a kind of desolation in abandonment in many situations.<br />There is a harsh sense of honestry and truthtelling in the work, and with the modesty it is very appealing.<br />I agree with the general consensus that she is a master and certainly deserving of her Nobel Prize.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow... this book had me balling my eyes out. I fell in love! I never wanted it to end. John green is amazing!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I had been waiting forever for this game to be available on my Kindle forever. I was so excited to finally download it but there are a few issues. Like none of my gifted life's and tickets that I have on my FB show up on here. So I'm out of lives I have to wait 15 min for one life. And I can't claim my tickets to advance to the next level.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the game.u should get it and I like the way the world is in the game.thanks for reading and enjoy your new game.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|It did not make my Kindle Fire wake up.  I have not called about it but I have had it plugged into an electrical outlet ever since I received it and my Kindle Fire is still as dead as ever.  However, it did fit into the Kindle where the original one did not fit properly.  However, I still have not gotten any positive results.  I have been out of town due to my mother's passing about ten days ago and have not had an opportunity to call about it.  I think the problem is with the Kindle Fire, not the cable.  Hopefully, I will make contact with you this week.  Nancy H Hall
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Can't get out of level 21...stuck for months... not buying additional crushers.  Addicting and could be fun if I could move on.
B00EVW013E|1.0|Lots of special effects but very little rational within some areas of the story. Lacked depth and seemed very predictable.
B0000252YK|3.0|I only liked one song on the entire disc. Which was Shot In The Dark, the rest was ok. I wasn't that impressed with it overall.
0399226907|5.0|I give this book as a baby shower gift so very often. Every kid needs a good book, and board books are great for babies. This one has great, engaging illustrations, teaches numbers, fruits, days of the week and has the &#34;surprise&#34; butterfly ending. My 10-month-old loves sticking her finger in the holes.
B001PSGF3C|5.0|In addition to a superb cast, very atmospheric sets and cinematography, this is just your basic TERRIFIC thriller.  It's got a supernatural element but it's not too scary, and there's lots of twists and turns to keep the plot interesting.  What's not to like with Robert Downey, Jr., and Halle Berry?  Well worth the rental fee and I'll most likely buy this next time.  Recommended!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I read all 3 books in less than a week..Amazing story and I can't wait for the next one.It will make you want more.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|THE intendedonly for thesame plan foryour can beable from I can be able and the same as a bit.  X. READ this message and.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|For a debut title, Ernest Cline put together a coherent narrative here in this book. I initially became aware of &#34;Ready Player One&#34; by reading a book club list at The Verge.<br /><br />I'll admit, the first pages were not all that inspiring. I was thinking &#34;are we seriously reading a book about a MMORPG?&#34;, but then I thought about what a great cultural impact modern computer games have had on society, so I continued.<br /><br />Then, something magic happened, a story developed. I was drawn in. The geek-culture references started being icing on the cake, and less of the main point. Overall I was very pleased with how the book developed and ended. I'd highly recommend to anyone.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|The movie had my attention right off the bat but then dragged out a little and it became kinda boring. It wasn't the worst movie I ever saw but just ok. YMMV
B0010VD7EO|3.0|I liked the song &#34;Time To Pretend&#34; and thought the rest of the album would be the same.  Sadly, it drags and it just seems like they got lucky with one song.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I would really like to give this a thousand stars!  A beautiful well written book.  I never wanted it to end
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|GREAT CD, A MUST BUY, IF YOU LIKED THE LAST CD THIS ONE IS JUST AS GOOD !!! GREAT BAND, AGAIN GREAT CD.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|This film is a mash-up of Men in Black with Dead Like Me and a dash of Ghost. If you liked those films then you will like this one. The story could be tighter and more interesting. It's predictable. Some interesting moments. Action sequences are well done and visuals are nice. Good movie to rent before you buy. For me it was a one-time watch film, not a film I will watch again.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I have not read the book, but I really enjoyed this movie. It's fast-paced and easy to watch. I wouldn't buy it or watch it over and over, but I thought it was quite watchable. David Morse was in it all of about 2 minutes. I can imagine the book really gets into everything more and would be worth checking out...
B00EAH3EQG|5.0|This is how I like my pop music. Not too fluffy, has some depth but still fun... Natalia is so sassy, honest and fun. This is for the girl who is rebellious, slightly boy crazy, emotional and passionate.<br /><br />My personal favorites are<br />Controversy -  listen closely because there is an important message in it<br />Trouble and Problem - She knows what kind of person she is and is unapologetic about it<br />Rabbit Hole-  Just a fun listen<br />Watching You - For that guy you just can't let go of
B00G32OER4|3.0|Not my favorite movie. Very creepy and strange even though based on a true story, but it just didn't hold my interest.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This was a truly fascinating read and I found it most interesting and entertaining.  The combination of interesting AND entertaining is not always easily accomplished but Bill Bryson achieved that.  Kudos!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Don't let the length of the book scare you away.  I went right into this book after the first book in the trilogy and can't wait for book three!  Ken Follett keeps you page turning!
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|Great looking and great feeling case. Very stylish and a great change from my previous case. Good all around protection without significantly increasing the size of the phone. Just wish it was a little more snug
B00FPH6M82|3.0|Great preteen movie.  My 7 year old had a challenge following the story line since it bounces back and forth, but with a little explaining here and there he really liked the movie.  Not really an adult movie though, however perfect for family movie night.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I am a florist, so I could easily relate to the subject. I have a friend that kept encouraging me to read this book. I was so drawn to the main character that at times I just wanted to reach through my Kindle and shake her. I loved the flower meaning dictionary that was included which I plan to use to guide my customers in the flower shop I work at.
0767919408|4.0|I have read just about everything Bryson has written,having found him back in the 1990s with \\"neither here nor there\\" and moved through his many books on wide range of topics- language, travel, history, etc. I have enjoyed most and have only rarely being disappointed... I have really enjoyed this newest book, although can not give it full marks as I found some minor but signficant errors in the facts I know, and it causes me to wonder if there are other errors in other areas. I must note his references to Alcock and Brown's trans-Atlantic crossing in 1919 did not originate in the \\"Canadian province of Newfoundland\\", but in the independent Dominion of Newfoundland. Newfoundland only became part of Canada in 1949, after an economic and political collapse in the 1930s where they ceded control back to Britain. The second issue may not be an error of fact as much as syntax, but Bryson mentioned the \\"motor\\" of Alcock and Brown's plane. Alcock and Brown flew a Vickers Vimy, which was a twin engined aircraft; therefore it had \\"motors\\". Given the detail Bryson adds about the aircraft of other competitors to Lindbergh in 1927, I was surprised at the small but notable errors in that historical background to first transatlantic flight.<br />Still, highly recommended, a super read.
B00EQF0JJC|3.0|One of the few films I paid for and didn't watch all the way through.  It was just too much work for me to translate Elizabethan English dialogue.  Fine cast, good acting, nice film work, and Shakespeare quality.  I just didn't feel up to it.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Beautifully done classic with message relevant to current events. Great movie for today's generation. Showed it to my middle school students to discuss arming school resource officers.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|Christmas gift.  I will not know until that time if he will like it or not.  We do like the show.
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|Really fun movie, but did have some parts that were a tad too scary for my 4-year old. MY only real complaint is not about the movie itself, but the lack of audio on the special movie features.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Bought this game 5 years ago.  Still the number one choice to pull out on a game night.  Buy the seafarers expansion.  It is worth it for sure.
B0064MGU98|4.0|The pilot caught my attention, and the more I watch it, the more the characters are growing on me. The writing is good.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After I read the first book I thought this looked to be a promissing series. Boy was I wrong the first two books were okay but by the time I got to the third one I was disappointed to say the least. To go through the first two books hanging on every single word and to get to the third book and have reading it be like pulling teeth, lets just say it wasn't worth what I paid for it. Plus the ending was just the author taking the easy way out. Of all the great ways that bookncould have ended and she choose to do that. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED AND VERY VERY ANGRY AT THE AUTHOR.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This fictional novel features a fictional character writing fanfictions about fictional fictional characters. That's fic-ception for you.<br /><br />Haha sorry, I needed to get that out of my system. Okay moving on, so, you guys! This book. Ohmygush! There are no words that can describe my happiness for finding this book. Think of baby panda bears, fluffy clouds and rainbow-puking ponies. I. Love. This. Book. To. Bits. And. Pieces.<br /><br />I have never read a book by Rowell before and I only discovered this book a week after its release but the first time I read the synopsis, I fell in love with it right away. Then there came the stunning reviews and just seeing it on other blogs made me hurt physically. I just wanted this book so very badly and then now, oh *faints (slightly)* I might just go Anne Shirley on you and speak nonstop about how this is like what I imagined it to be and more but I'm afraid I'd take things too far and make an accidental fanfiction of that which you probably don't want to read anyway.<br /><br />Fangirl follows the story of the socially awkward Cather who's a hardcore fan of Simon Snow - which sounds suspiciously like Harry Potter, by the way. She and her twin, Wren, have always been together and both have been huge fans since they were a lot younger but as they entered college, Wren has grown up from her obsession of Simon Snow which left Cath in the fandom as well as college life alone.<br /><br />Cath is such a relatable character. I connected to her in more ways than one. Actually, I think every fangirl out there will relate to her even if they're not into fanfictions. I've never written a fanfiction myself but I read them - oh, how I love fanfictions! They are my go-to whenever a book has left me giddy for more. I read Bloodlines and Lunar Chronicles and so many anime fanfictions and everytime, I'm grateful for all the Cathers out there who make every hungry fangirl's fantasies come true. Cath is also a loving sister and a very caring daughter to her father. I enjoyed her and her dad's phone conversations. There's an underlying melancholy in almost all their phone conversations but how it always ends up is just hilarious.<br /><br />The only thing that made Cath's life more exciting than mine is that she has this all-too likable guy for a boyfriend. Believe me when I tell you that he'll make you S-W-O-O-N. He's not as hot as your Will Herondale or Adrian Ivashkov but nonetheless, he'll fill your stomach with butterflies and will make your heart pound everytime he flashes you with his thousand megawatt smile. He's also very patient, caring and so very understanding too. I loved that their romance stemmed from friendship and that it wasn't any sort of insta-love. Even though they essentially have no similarities, they understand each other and they make one hell of a make-out session!<br /><br />Although I'm not a fan of slash fics, I admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the excerpts of Magicath's fanfictions and to be honest, I started rooting for Simon and Baz toward the middle of the book. I even liked it more than the actual excerpts of the Simon Snow series.<br /><br />Apart from the fanfictions though, Fangirl also tackles some other elements like plagiarism and alcoholism but with an emphasis on family and though I appreciate this addition, it's also my least favorite part of the book. The conflict with Cath's mother which is supposed to be a major part of the book was a loose end that was left hanging. The ending of the book also left an impression of suddenness which confused me for a moment as I read this in ebook format and didn't realize that I have reached the final page.<br /><br />But as I'm in for the happiness in this book, I'm willing to forgive Rowell for those shortcomings because happy and giddy is exactly what she delivered. Fangirl is an amazing read. It's superb and it's unputdownable. This maybe my first book by Rowell but it's not definitely going to be the last. I mean, have you heard what people are saying about Eleanor & Park? I am so excite!<br /><br />- See more at: [...]

B00ELOOYZI|4.0|Its a neat app.  The physics content is a bit more involved than I would have imagined.  It's really quite a learning tool about basic rocket and space science.
